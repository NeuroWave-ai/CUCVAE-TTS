EBOOK THE FORTUNES OF GLENCORE Produced by David Widger THE FORTUNES OF GLENCORE By Charles James Lever With Illustrations By E J Wheeler and W Cubitt Cooke Boston Little Brown And Company nineteen oh two PREFACE I am unwilling to suffer this tale to leave my hands without a word of explanation to my reader If I have never disguised from myself the grounds of any humble success I have attained to as a writer of fiction if I have always had before me the fact that to movement and action the stir of incident and a certain light heartedness and gayety of temperament more easy to impart to others than to repress in one s self I have owed much if not all of whatever popularity I have enjoyed I have yet felt or fancied that I felt that it would be in the delineation of very different scenes and the portraiture of very different emotions that I should reap what I would reckon as a real success This conviction or impression if you will has become stronger with years and with the knowledge of life years have imparted and time has but confirmed me in the notion that any skill I possess lies in the detection of character and the unravelment of that tangled skein which makes up human motives I am well aware that no error is more common than to mistake one s own powers nor does anything more contribute to this error than a sense of self depreciation for what the world has been pleased to deem successful in us To test my conviction or to abandon it as a delusion forever I have written the present story of Glencore I make but little pretension to the claim of interesting as little do I aspire to the higher credit of instructing All I have attempted all I have striven to accomplish is the faithful portraiture of character the close analysis of motives and correct observation as to some of the manners and modes of thought which mark the age we live in Opportunities of society as well as natural inclination have alike disposed me to such studies I have stood over the game of life very patiently for many a year and though I may have grieved over the narrow fortune which has prevented me from cutting in I have consoled myself by the thought of all the anxieties defeat might have cost me all the chagrin I had suffered were I to have risen a loser Besides this I have learned to know and estimate what are the qualities which win success in life and what the gifts by which men dominate above their fellows If in the world of well bred life the incidents and events be fewer because the friction is less than in the classes where vicissitudes of fortune are more frequent the play of passion the moods of temper and the changeful varieties of nature are often very strongly developed shadowed and screened though they be by the polished conventionalities of society To trace and mark these has long constituted one of the pleasures of my life if I have been able to impart even a portion of that gratification to my reader I will not deem the effort in vain nor the Fortunes of Glencore a failure Let me add that although certain traits of character in some of the individuals of my story may seem to indicate sketches of real personages there is but one character in the whole book drawn entirely from life This is Billy Traynor Not only have I had a sitter for this picture but he is alive and hearty at the hour I am writing For the others they are purely entirely fictitious Certain details certain characteristics I have of course borrowed as he who would mould a human face must needs have copied an eye a nose or a chin from some existent model but beyond this I have not gone nor indeed have I found in all my experience of life that fiction ever suggests what has not been implanted unconsciously by memory originality in the delineation of character being little beyond a new combination of old materials derived from that source I wish I could as easily apologize for the faults and blemishes of my story as I can detect and deplore them but like the failings in one s nature they are very often difficult to correct even when acknowledged I have therefore but to throw myself once more upon the indulgence which old offender that I am has never forsaken me and subscribe myself Your devoted friend and servant C L THE FORTUNES OF GLENCORE CHAPTER I A LONELY LANDSCAPE Where that singularly beautiful inlet of the sea known in the west of Ireland as the Killeries after narrowing to a mere strait expands into a bay stands the ruin of the ancient Castle of Glencore With the bold steep sides of Ben Creggan behind and the broad blue Atlantic in front the proud keep would seem to have occupied a spot that might have bid defiance to the boldest assailant The estuary itself here seems entirely landlocked and resembles in the wild fantastic outline of the mountains around a Norwegian fiord rather than a scene in our own tamer landscape The small village of Leenane which stands on the Galway shore opposite to Glencore presents the only trace of habitation in this wild and desolate district for the country around is poor and its soil offers little to repay the task of the husbandman Fishing is then the chief if not the sole resource of those who pass their lives in this solitary region and thus in every little creek or inlet of the shore may be seen the stout craft of some hardy venturer and nets and tackle and such like gear lie drying on every rocky eminence We have said that Glencore was a ruin but still its vast proportions yet traceable in massive fragments of masonry displayed specimens of various eras of architecture from the rudest tower of the twelfth century to the more ornate style of a later period while artificial embankments and sloped sides of grass showed the remains of what once had been terrace and parterre the successors it might be presumed of fosse and parapet Many a tale of cruelty and oppression many a story of suffering and sorrow clung to those old walls for they had formed the home of a haughty and a cruel race the last descendant of which died at the close of the past century The Castle of Glencore with the title had now descended to a distant relation of the house who had repaired and so far restored the old residence as to make it habitable that is to say four bleak and lofty chambers were rudely furnished and about as many smaller ones fitted for servant accommodation but no effort at embellishment not even the commonest attempt at neatness was bestowed on the grounds or the garden and in this state it remained for some five and twenty or thirty years when the tidings reached the little village of Leenane that his lordship was about to return to Glencore and fix his residence there Such an event was of no small moment in such a locality and many were the speculations as to what might be the consequence of his coming Little or indeed nothing was known of Lord Glencore his only visit to the neighborhood had occurred many years before and lasted but for a day He had arrived suddenly and taking a boat at the ferry as it was called crossed over to the Castle whence he returned at nightfall to depart as hurriedly as he came Of those who had seen him in this brief visit the accounts were vague and most contradictory Some called him handsome and well built others said he was a dark looking downcast man with a sickly and forbidding aspect None however could record one single word he had spoken nor could even gossips pretend to say that he gave utterance to any opinion about the place or the people The mode in which the estate was managed gave as little insight into the character of the proprietor If no severity was displayed to the few tenants on the property there was no encouragement given to their efforts at improvement a kind of cold neglect was the only feature discernible and many went so far as to say that if any cared to forget the payment of his rent the chances were it might never be demanded of him the great security against such a venture however lay in the fact that the land was held at a mere nominal rental and few would have risked his tenure by such an experiment It was little to be wondered at that Lord Glencore was not better known in that secluded spot since even in England his name was scarcely heard of His fortune was very limited and he had no political influence whatever not possessing a seat in the Upper House so that as he spent his life abroad he was almost totally forgotten in his own country All that Debrett could tell of him was comprised in a few lines recording simply that he was sixth Viscount Glencore and Loughdooner born in the month of February one hundred eighty and married in August eighteen to Clarissa Isabella second daughter of Sir Guy Clifford of Wytchley Baronet by whom he had issue Charles Conyngham Massey born sixth June eighteen There closed the notice Strange and quaint things are these short biographies with little beyond the barren fact that he had lived and he had died and yet with all the changes of this work a day world with its din and turmoil and gold seeking and progress men cannot divest themselves of reverence for birth and blood and the veneration for high descent remains an instinct of humanity Sneer as men will at heaven born legislators laugh as you may at the tenth transmitter of a foolish face there is something eminently impressive in the fact of a position acquired by deeds that date back to centuries and preserved inviolate to the successor of him who fought at Agincourt or at Cressy If ever this religion shall be impaired the fault be with those who have derogated from their great prerogative and forgotten to make illustrious by example what they have inherited illustrious by descent When the news first reached the neighborhood that a lord was about to take up his residence in the Castle the most extravagant expectations were conceived of the benefits to arise from such a source The very humblest already speculated on the advantages his wealth was to diffuse and the thousand little channels into which his affluence would be directed The ancient traditions of the place spoke of a time of boundless profusion when troops of mounted followers used to accompany the old barons and when the lough itself used to be covered with boats with the armorial bearings of Glencore floating proudly from their mastheads There were old men then living who remembered as many as two hundred laborers being daily employed on the grounds and gardens of the Castle and the most fabulous stories were told of fortunes accumulated by those who were lucky enough to have saved the rich earnings of that golden period Colored as such speculations were with all the imaginative warmth of the west it was a terrible shock to such sanguine fancies when they beheld a middle aged sad looking man arrive in a simple postchaise accompanied by his son a child of six or seven years of age and a single servant a grim looking old dragoon corporal who neither invited intimacy nor rewarded it It was not indeed for a long time that they could believe that this was my lord and that this solitary attendant was the whole of that great retinue they had so long been expecting nor indeed could any evidence less strong than missus Mulcahy s of the Post office completely satisfy them on the subject The address of certain letters and newspapers to the Lord Viscount Glencore was however a testimony beyond dispute so that nothing remained but to revenge themselves on the unconscious author of their self deception for the disappointment he gave them This it is true required some ingenuity for they scarcely ever saw him nor could they ascertain a single fact of his habits or mode of life He never crossed the Lough as the inlet of the sea about three miles in width was called He as rigidly excluded the peasantry from the grounds of the Castle and save an old fisherman who carried his letter bag to and fro and a few laborers in the spring and autumn none ever invaded the forbidden precincts Of course such privacy paid its accustomed penalty and many an explanation of a kind little flattering was circulated to account for so ungenial an existence Some alleged that he had committed some heavy crime against the State and was permitted to pass his life there on the condition of perpetual imprisonment others that his wife had deserted him and that in his forlorn condition he had sought out a spot to live and die in unnoticed and unknown a few ascribed his solitude to debt while others were divided in opinion between charges of misanthropy and avarice to either of which accusations his lonely and simple life fully exposed him In time however people grew tired of repeating stories to which no new evidence added any features of interest They lost the zest for a scandal which ceased to astonish and my lord was as much forgotten and his existence as unspoken of as though the old towers had once again become the home of the owl and the jackdaw It was now about eight years since the lord had taken up his abode at the Castle when one evening a raw and gusty night of December the little skiff of the fisherman was seen standing in for shore a sight somewhat uncommon since she always crossed the Lough in time for the morning s mail There s another man aboard too said a bystander from the little group that watched the boat as she neared the harbor I think it s mister Craggs You re right enough Sam it s the Corporal I know his cap and the short tail of hair he wears under it What can bring him at this time of night He s going to bespeak a quarter of Tim Healey s beef maybe said one with a grin of malicious drollery Mayhap it s askin us all to spend the Christmas he d be said another Whisht or he ll hear you muttered a third and at the same instant the sail came clattering down and the boat glided swiftly past and entered a little natural creek close beneath where they stood Who has got a horse and a jaunting car cried the Corporal as he jumped on shore I want one for Clifden directly It s fifteen miles devil a less cried one Fifteen no but eighteen Kiely s bridge is brack down and you ll have to go by Gortnamuck Well and if he has can t he take the cut He can t Why not Did n t I go that way last week Well and if you did did n t you lame your baste T was n t the cut did it It was sure I know better Billy Moore tould me Billy s a liar Such and such like comments and contradictions were very rapidly exchanged and already the debate was waxing warm when mister Craggs s authoritative voice interposed with Billy Moore be blowed I want to know if I can have a car and horse To be sure why not who says you can t chimed in a chorus If you go to Clifden under five hours my name isn t Terry Lynch said an old man in rabbitskin breeches I ll engage if Barny will give me the blind mare to drive him there under four Bother said the Rabbitskin in a tone of contempt But where s the horse cried the Corporal Ay that s it said another where s the horse Is there none to be found in the village asked Craggs eagerly Divil a horse barrin an ass Barny s mare has the staggers the last fortnight and missus Kyle s pony broke his two knees on Tuesday carrying sea weed up the rocks But I must go to Clifden I must be there to night said Craggs It s on foot then you ll have to do it said the Rabbitskin Lord Glencore s dangerously ill and needs a doctor said the Corporal bursting out with a piece of most uncommon communicativeness Is there none of you will give his horse for such an errand Arrah musha it s a pity and such like expressions of compassionate import were muttered on all sides but no more active movement seemed to flow from the condolence while in a lower tone were added such expressions as Sorra mend him if he wasn t a naygar wouldn t he have a horse of his own It s a droll lord he is to be begging the loan of a baste Something like a malediction arose to the Corporal s lips but restraining it and with a voice thick from passion he said I m ready to pay you to pay you ten times over the worth of your You need n t curse the horse anyhow interposed Rabbitskin while with a significant glance at his friends around him he slyly intimated that it would be as well to adjourn the debate a motion as quickly obeyed as it was mooted for in less than five minutes Craggs was standing beside the quay with no other companion than a blind beggar woman who perfectly regardless of his distress continued energetically to draw attention to her own A little fivepenny bit my lord the last trifle your honor s glory has in the corner of your pocket that you ll never miss and that ll sweeten ould Molly s tay to night There acushla have pity on the dark and that you may see glory But Craggs did not wait for the remainder but deep in his own thoughts sauntered down towards the village Already had the others retreated within their homes and now all was dark and cheerless along the little straggling street And this is a Christian country this a land that people tell you abounds in kindness and good nature said he in an accent of sarcastic bitterness And who ll say the reverse answered a voice from behind and turning he beheld the little hunchbacked fellow who carried the mail on foot from Oughterard a distance of sixteen miles over a mountain and who was popularly known as Billy the Bag from the little leather sack which seemed to form part of his attire Who ll stand up and tell me it s not a fine country in every sense for natural beauties for antiquities for elegant men and lovely females for quarries of marble and mines of gould Craggs looked contemptuously at the figure who thus declaimed of Ireland s wealth and grandeur and in a sneering tone said And with such riches on every side why do you go barefoot why are you in rags my old fellow Is n t there poor everywhere If the world was all gould and silver what would be the precious metals tell me that Is it because there s a little cripple like myself here that them mountains yonder is n t of copper and iron and cobalt Come over with me after I lave the bags at the office and I ll show you bits of every one I speak of I d rather you d show me a doctor my worthy fellow said Craggs sighing I m the nearest thing to that same going replied Billy I can breathe a vein against any man in the barony I can t say that for any articular congestion of the aortic valves or for a sero pulmonic diathesis d ye mind that there isn t as good as me but for the ould school of physic the humoral diagnostic touch who can beat me Will you come with me across the lough and see my lord then said Craggs who was glad even of such aid in his emergency And why not when I lave the bags said Billy touching the leather sack as he spoke If the Corporal was not without his misgivings as to the skill and competence of his companion there was something in the fluent volubility of the little fellow that overawed and impressed him while his words were uttered in a rich mellow voice that gave them a sort of solemn persuasiveness Were you always on the road asked the Corporal curious to learn some particulars of his history No sir I was twenty things before I took to the bags I was a poor scholar for four years I kept school in Erris I was on the ferry in Dublin with my fiddle for eighteen months and I was a bear in Liverpool for part of a winter A bear exclaimed Craggs Yes sir It was an Italian one Pipo Chiassi by name that lost his beast at Manchester and persuaded me as I was about the same stature to don the sable and perform in his place After that I took to writin for the papers The Skibbereen Celt and supported myself very well till it broke But here we are at the office so I ll step in and get my fiddle too if you ve no objection The Corporal s meditations scarcely were of a kind to reassure him as he thought over the versatile character of his new friend but the case offered no alternative it was Billy or nothing since to reach Clifden on foot would be the labor of many hours and in the interval his master should be left utterly alone While he was thus musing Billy reappeared with a violin under one arm and a much worn quarto under the other This said he touching the volume is the Whole Art and Mystery of Physic by one Fabricius of Aquapendente and if we don t find a cure for the case down here take my word for it it s among the morba ignota as Paracelsus says Well come along said Craggs impatiently and set off at a speed that notwithstanding Billy s habits of foot travel kept him at a sharp trot A few minutes more saw them with canvas spread skimming across the lough towards Glencore Glencore Glencore muttered Billy once or twice to himself as the swift boat bounded through the hissing surf Did you ever hear Lady Lucy s Lament And he struck a few chords with his fingers as he sang I care not for your trellised vine I love the dark woods on the shore Nor all the towers along the Rhine Are dear to me as old Glencore The ragged cliff Ben Creggan high Re echoing the Atlantic roar Are mingling with the seagull s cry My welcome back to old Glencore And then there s a chorus That s a signal to us to make haste said the Corporal pointing to a bright flame which suddenly shot up on the shore of the lough Put out an oar to leeward there and keep her up to the wind And Billy perceiving his minstrelsy unattended to consoled himself by humming over for his own amusement the remainder of his ballad The wind freshened as the night grew darker and heavy seas repeatedly broke on the bow and swept over the boat in sprayey showers It s that confounded song of yours has got the wind up said Craggs angrily stand by the sheet and stop your croning That s an error vulgaris attributing to music marine disasters said Billy calmly it arose out of a mistake about one Orpheus Slack off there cried Craggs as a squall struck the boat and laid her almost over Billy however had obeyed the mandate promptly and she soon righted and held on her course I wish they d show the light again on shore muttered the Corporal the night is black as pitch Keep the top of the mountain a little to windward and you re all right said Billy I know the lough well I used to come here all hours day and night once spearing salmon And smuggling too added Craggs Yes sir brandy and tay and pigtail for Mister Sheares in Oughterard What became of him asked Craggs He made a fortune and died and his son married a lady Here comes another throw her head up in the wind cried Craggs This time the order came too late for the squall struck her with the suddenness of a shot and she canted over till her keel lay out of water and when she righted it was with the white surf boiling over her She s a good boat then to stand that said Billy as he struck a light for his pipe with all the coolness of one perfectly at his ease and Craggs from that very moment conceived a favorable opinion of the little hunchback Now we re in the smooth water Corporal cried Billy let her go a little free And obedient to the advice he ran the boat swiftly along till she entered a small creek so sheltered by the highlands that the water within was still as a mountain tarn You never made the passage on a worse night I ll be bound said Craggs as he sprang on shore Indeed and I did then replied Billy I remember it was two days before Christmas we were blown out to say in a small boat not more than the half of this and we only made the west side of Arran Island after thirty six hours beating and tacking I wrote an account of it for the Tyrawly Regenerator commencing with The elemential conflict that with tremendious violence raged ravaged and ruined the adamantine foundations of our western coast on Tuesday the twenty third of December Come along come along said Craggs we ve something else to think of And with this admonition very curtly bestowed he stepped out briskly on the path towards Glencore CHAPTER II GLENCORE CASTLE 
6848_252322_000003_000000	train-clean-100	When the Corporal followed by Billy entered the gloomy hall of the Castle they found two or three country people conversing in a low but eager voice together who speedily turned towards them to learn if the doctor had come 
none	none	Here s all I could get in the way of a doctor said Craggs pushing Billy towards them as he spoke Faix and ye might have got worse muttered a very old man Billy Traynor has the lucky hand How is my lord now Nelly asked the Corporal of a woman who with bare feet and dressed in the humblest fashion of the peasantry appeared
6848_252322_000007_000000	train-clean-100	 He s getting weaker and weaker sir I believe he s sinking 
none	none	I m glad it s Billy is come I d rather see him than all the doctors in the country Follow me said Craggs giving a signal to step lightly and he led the way up a narrow stone stair with a wall on either hand Traversing a long low corridor they reached a door at which having waited for a second or two to listen Craggs turned the handle and entered The room was very large and lofty and seen in the dim light of a small lamp upon the hearthstone seemed even more spacious than it was The oaken floor was uncarpeted and a very few articles of furniture occupied the walls In one corner stood a large bed the heavy curtains of which had been gathered up on the roof the better to admit air to the sick man As Billy drew nigh with cautious steps he perceived that although worn and wasted by long illness the patient was a man still in the very prime of life His dark hair and beard which he wore long were untinged with gray and his forehead showed no touch of age His dark eyes were wide open and his lips slightly parted his whole features exhibiting an expression of energetic action even to wildness Still he was sleeping and as Craggs whispered he seldom slept otherwise even when in health With all the quietness of a trained practitioner Billy took down the watch that was pinned to the curtain and proceeded to count the pulse A hundred and thirty eight muttered he as he finished and then gently displacing the bedclothes laid his hand upon the heart With a long drawn sigh like that of utter weariness the sick man moved his head round and fixed his eyes upon him The doctor said he in a deep toned but feeble voice
6848_252322_000012_000001	train-clean-100	 Leave me Craggs leave me alone with him 
none	none	And the Corporal slowly retired turning as he went to look back towards the bed and evidently going with reluctance
6848_252322_000014_000000	train-clean-100	 Is it fever asked the sick man in a faint but unfaltering accent 
none	none	It s a kind of cerebral congestion a matter of them membranes that s over the brain with of course febrilis generalis The accentuation of these words marked as it was by the strongest provincialism of the peasant attracted the sick man s attention and he bent upon him a look at once searching and severe What are you who are you cried he angrily What I am is n t so aisy to say but who I am is clean beyond me Are you a doctor asked the sick man fiercely I m afear d I m not in the sense of a gradum Universitatis a diplomia but sure maybe Paracelsus himself just took to it like me having a vocation as one might say Ring that bell said the other peremptorily And Billy obeyed without speaking
6848_252322_000023_000000	train-clean-100	 What do you mean by this Craggs said the Viscount trembling with passion 
none	none	Who have you brought me What beggar have you picked off the highway Or is he the travelling fool of the district But the anger that supplied strength hitherto now failed to impart energy and he sank back wasted and exhausted The Corporal bent over him and spoke something in a low whisper but whether the words were heard or not the sick man now lay still breathing heavily Can you do nothing for him asked Craggs peevishly nothing but anger him To be sure I can if you let me said Billy producing a very ancient lancet case of boxwood tipped with ivory I ll just take a dash of blood from the temporal artery to relieve the cerebrum and then we ll put cowld on his head and keep him quiet And with a promptitude that showed at least self confidence he proceeded to accomplish the operation every step of which he effected skilfully and well There now said he feeling the pulse as the blood continued to flow freely the circulation is relieved at once it s the same as opening a sluice in a mill dam He s better already He looks easier said Craggs Ay and he feels it continued Billy Just notice the respiratory organs and see how easy the intercostials is doing their work now Bring me a bowl of clean water some vinegar and any ould rags you have Craggs obeyed but not without a sneer at the direction All over the head said Billy all over it back and front and with the blessing of the Virgin I ll have that hair off of him if he is n t cooler towards evening So saying he covered the sick man with the wetted cloths and bathed his hands in the cooling fluid Now to exclude the light and save the brain from stimulation and excitation said Billy with a pompous enunciation of the last syllables and then quies rest peace And with this direction imparted with a caution to enforce its benefits he moved stealthily towards the door and passed out
6848_252322_000036_000000	train-clean-100	 What do you think of him asked the Corporal eagerly 
none	none	He ll do he ll do said Billy
6848_252322_000037_000001	train-clean-100	 He s a sanguineous temperament and he ll bear the lancet 
6848_252322_000037_000002	train-clean-100	It s just like weatherin a point at say 
none	none	If you have a craft that will carry canvas there s always a chance for you He perceived that you were not a doctor said Craggs when they reached the corridor Did he faix cried Billy half indignantly He might have perceived that I did n t come in a coach that I had n t my hair powdered nor gold knee buckles in my smallcloths but for all that it would be going too far to say that I was n t a doctor T is the same with physic and poetry you take to it or you don t take to it 
6848_252322_000039_000003	train-clean-100	There s chaps ay and far from stupid ones either that could n t compose you ten hexameters if ye d put them on a hot griddle for it and there s others that would talk rhyme rather than rayson 
none	none	And so with the ars medicatrix everybody has n t an eye for a hectic or an ear for a cough non contigit cuique adire Corintheum T is n t every one can toss pancakes as Horace says Hush be still muttered Craggs here s the young master And as he spoke a youth of about fifteen well grown and handsome but poorly even meanly clad approached them
6848_252322_000041_000000	train-clean-100	 Have you seen my father 
6848_252322_000041_000001	train-clean-100	What do you think of him asked he eagerly 
none	none	Tis a critical state he s in your honor said Billy bowing but I think he ll come round deplation deplation deplation actio actio actio relieve the gorged vessels and don t drown the grand hydraulic machine the heart them s my sentiments Turning from the speaker with a look of angry impatience the boy whispered some words in the Corporal s ear
6848_252322_000044_000000	train-clean-100	 What could I do sir was the answer it was this fellow or nothing 
none	none	And better a thousand times better nothing said the boy than trust his life to the coarse ignorance of this wretched quack And in his passion the words were uttered loud enough for Billy to overhear them
6848_252322_000046_000000	train-clean-100	 Don t be hasty your honor said Billy submissively and don t be unjust 
none	none	The realms of disaze is like an unknown tract of country or a country that s only known a little just round the coast as it might be once ye re beyond that one man is as good a guide as another coeteris paribus that is with equal lights What have you done Have you given him anything broke in the boy hurriedly
6848_252322_000048_000000	train-clean-100	 I took a bleeding from him little short of sixteen ounces from the temporial said Billy proudly and I ll give him now a concoction of meadow saffron with a pinch of saltpetre in it to cause diaphoresis d ye mind 
none	none	Meanwhile we re disgorging the arachnoid membranes with cowld applications and we re relievin the cerebellum by repose I challenge the Hall added Billy stoutly to say is n t them the grand principles of traitment Ah young gentleman said he after a few seconds pause don t be hard on me because I m poor and in rags nor think manely of me because I spake with a brogue and maybe bad grammar for you see even a crayture of my kind can have a knowledge of disaze just as he may have a knowledge of nature by observation What is sickness after all but just one of the phenomenons of all organic and inorganic matter a regular sort of shindy in a man s inside like a thunderstorm or a hurry cane outside 
6848_252322_000048_000004	train-clean-100	Watch what s coming look out and see which way the mischief is brewin and make your preparations That s the great study of physic 
6848_252322_000049_000000	train-clean-100	The boy listened patiently and even attentively to this speech and when Billy had concluded he turned to the Corporal and said Look to him Craggs and let him have his supper and when he has eaten it send him to my room 
none	none	Billy bowed an acknowledgment and followed the Corporal to the kitchen That s my lord s son I suppose said he as he seated himself and a fine young crayture too puer ingenuus with a grand frontal development And with this reflection he addressed himself to the coarse but abundant fare which Craggs placed before him and with an appetite that showed how much he relished it This is elegant living ye have here mister Craggs said Billy as he drained his tankard of beer and placed it with a sigh on the table many happy years of it to ye I could n t wish ye anything better The life is not so bad said Craggs but it s lonely sometimes Life need never be lonely so long as a man has health and his faculties said Billy give me nature to admire a bit of baycon for dinner and my fiddle to amuse me and I would n t change with the King of Sugar Candy I was there said Craggs it s a fine island My lord wants to see the doctor said a woman entering hastily And the doctor is ready for him said Billy rising and leaving the kitchen with all the dignity he could assume CHAPTER III BILLY TRAYNOR POET PEDLAR AND PHYSICIAN
6848_252323_000004_000000	train-clean-100	 Didn t I tell you how it would be said Billy as he re entered the kitchen now crowded by the workpeople anxious for tidings of the sick man 
none	none	The head is re leaved the congestive symptoms is allayed and when the artarial excitement subsides he ll be out of danger
6848_252323_000005_000000	train-clean-100	 Musha but I m glad muttered one he d be a great loss to us 
none	none	True for you Patsey there s eight or nine of us here would miss him if he was gone Troth he doesn t give much employment but we couldn t spare him croaked out a third when the entrance of the Corporal cut short further commentary and the party gathered around the cheerful turf fire with that instinctive sense of comfort impressed by the swooping wind and rain that beat against the windows It s a dreadful night outside I would n t like to cross the lough in it said one Then that s just what I m thinking of this minit said Billy
6848_252323_000009_000001	train-clean-100	 I ll have to be up at the office for the bags at six o clock 
none	none	Faix you ll not see Leenane at six o clock to morrow
6848_252323_000011_000000	train-clean-100	 Sorra taste of it muttered another there s a sea runnin outside now that would swamp a life boat 
none	none	I ll not lose an illigant situation of six pounds ten a year and a pair of shoes at Christmas for want of a bit of courage said Billy I d have my dismissal if I wasn t there as sure as my name is Billy Traynor And better for you than lose your life Billy said one And it s not alone myself I d be thinking of said Billy but every man in this world high and low has his duties My duty added he somewhat pretentiously is to carry the King s mail and if anything was to obstruckt or impade or delay the correspondience it s on me the blame would lie The letters wouldn t go the faster because you were drowned broke in the Corporal No sir said Billy rather staggered by the grin of approval that met this remark no sir what you ob sarve is true but nobody reflects on the sintry that dies at his post If you must and will go I ll give you the yawl said Craggs and I ll go with you myself
6848_252323_000018_000000	train-clean-100	 Spoke like a British Grenadier cried Billy with enthusiasm 
none	none	Carbineer if the same to you master said the other quietly I never served in the infantry Tros Tyriusve mihi cried Billy which is as much as to say To storm the skies or lay siege to the moon Give me one of the line or a heavy dragoon it s the same to me as the poet says And a low murmur of the company seemed to accord approval to the sentiment I wish you d give us a tune Billy said one coaxingly
6848_252323_000025_000000	train-clean-100	 Or a song would be better observed another 
none	none	Faix cried a third tis himself could do it and in Frinch or Latin if ye wanted it The Germans was the best I ever knew for music broke in Craggs I was brigaded with Arentschild s Hanoverians in Spain and they used to sit outside the tents every evening and sing 
6848_252323_000027_000002	train-clean-100	By Jove how they did sing all together like the swell of a church organ 
6848_252323_000028_000000	train-clean-100	 Yes you re right said Billy but evidently yielding an unwilling assent to this doctrine 
none	none	The Germans has a fine national music and they re great for harmony But harmony and melody is two different things
6848_252323_000029_000000	train-clean-100	 And which is best Billy asked one of the company 
none	none	Musha but I pity your ignorance said Billy with a degree of confusion that raised a hearty laugh at his expense Well but where s the song exclaimed another Ay said Craggs we are forgetting the song 
6848_252323_000032_000001	train-clean-100	Now for it Billy 
none	none	Since all is going on so well above stairs I ll draw you a gallon of ale boys and we ll drink to the master s speedy recovery It was a rare occasion when the Corporal suffered himself to expand in this fashion and great was the applause at the unexpected munificence Billy at the same moment took out his fiddle and began that process of preparatory screwing and scraping which no matter how distressing to the surrounders seems to afford intense delight to performers on this instrument 
6848_252323_000034_000001	train-clean-100	In the present case it is but fair to say there was neither comment nor impatience on the contrary they seemed to accept these convulsive throes of sound as an earnest of the grand flood of melody that was coming 
6848_252323_000034_000002	train-clean-100	That Billy was occupied with other thoughts than those of tuning was however apparent for his lips continued to move rapidly and at moments he was seen to beat time with his foot as though measuring out the rhythm of a verse 
none	none	I have it now ladies and gentlemen he said making a low obeisance to the company and so saying he struck up a very popular tune the same to which a reverend divine wrote his words of The night before Larry was Stretched and in a voice of a deep and mellow fulness managed with considerable taste sang A fig for the chansons of France Whose meaning is always a riddle The music to sing or to dance Is an Irish tune played on the fiddle To your songs of the Rhine and the Rhone I m ready to cry out I am satis Just give us something of our own In praise of our Land of Potatoes Tol lol de lol et cetera What care I for sorrows of those Who speak of their heart as a cuore How expect me to feel for the woes Of him who calls love an amore Let me have a few words about home With music whose strains I d remember And I ll give you all Florence and Rome Tho they have a blue sky in December Tol lol de lol et cetera With a pretty face close to your own I m sore there s no rayson for sighing Nor when walkin beside her alone Why the blazes be talking of dying That s the way tho in France and in Spain Where love is not real but acted You must always portend you re insane Or at laste that you re partly distracted Tol lol de lol et cetera It is very unlikely that the reader will estimate Billy s impromptu as did the company in fact it possessed the greatest of all claims to their admiration for it was partly incomprehensible and by the artful introduction of a word here and there of which his hearers knew nothing the poet was well aware that he was securing their heartiest approval Nor was Billy insensible to such flatteries The irritabile genus has its soft side and can enjoy to the uttermost its own successes It is possible if Billy had been in another sphere with much higher gifts and surrounded by higher associates that he might have accepted the homage tendered him with more graceful modesty and seemed at least less confident of his own merits but under no possible change of places or people could the praise have bestowed more sincere pleasure
6848_252323_000046_000000	train-clean-100	 You re right there Jim Morris said he turning suddenly round towards one of the company you never said a truer thing than that The poetic temperament is riches to a poor man 
none	none	Wherever I go in all weathers wet and dreary and maybe footsore with the bags full and the mountain streams all flowin over I can just go into my own mind just the way you d go into an inn and order whatever you wanted I don t need to be a king to sit on a throne I don t want ships nor coaches nor horses to convay me to foreign lands 
6848_252323_000046_000003	train-clean-100	I can bestow kingdoms 
none	none	When I haven t tuppence to buy tobacco and without a shoe to my foot and my hair through my hat I can be dancin wid princesses and handin empresses in to tay Musha musha muttered the surrounders as though they were listening to a magician who in a moment of unguarded familiarity condescended to discuss his own miraculous gifts And resumed Billy it isn t only what ye are to yourself and your own heart but what ye are to others that without that sacret bond between you wouldn t think of you at all I remember once on a time I was in the north of England travelling partly for pleasure and partly with a view to a small speculation in Sheffield ware cheap penknives and scissors pencil cases bodkins and the like and I wandered about for weeks through what they call the Lake Country a very handsome place but nowise grand or sublime like what we have here in Ireland more wood forest timber and better off people but nothing beyond that
6848_252323_000049_000000	train-clean-100	 Well one evening it was in August I came down by a narrow path to the side of a lake where there was a stone seat put up to see the view from and in front was three wooden steps of stairs going down into the water where a boat might come in 
none	none	It was a lovely spot and well chosen for you could count as many as five promontories running out into the lake and there was two islands all wooded to the water s edge and behind all in the distance was a great mountain with clouds on the top and it was just the season when the trees is beginnin to change their colors and there was shades of deep gold and dark olive and russet brown all mingling together with the green and glowing in the lake below under the setting sun and all was quiet and still as midnight and over the water the only ripple was the track of a water hen as she scudded past between the islands and if ever there was peace and tranquillity in the world it was just there 
6848_252323_000049_000002	train-clean-100	Well I put down my pack in the leaves for I did n t like to see or think of it and I stretched myself down at the water s edge and I fell into a fit of musing 
none	none	It s often and often I tried to remember the elegant fancies that came through my head and the beautiful things that I thought I saw that night out on the lake fornint me Ye see I was fresh and fastin I never tasted a bit the whole day and my brain maybe was all the better for somehow janius real janius thrives best on a little starvation 
6848_252323_000049_000005	train-clean-100	And from musing I fell off asleep and it was the sound of voices near that first awoke me 
none	none	For a minute or two I believed I was dreaming the words came so softly to my ear for they were spoken in a low gentle voice and blended in with the slight splash of oars that moved through the water carefully as though not to lose a word of him that was speakin It s clean beyond me to tell you what he said and maybe if I could ye would n t be able to follow it for he was discoorsin about night and the moon and all that various poets said about them ye d think that he had books and was reading out of them so glibly came the verses from his lips 
6848_252323_000050_000001	train-clean-100	I never listened to such a voice before so soft so sweet so musical and the words came droppin down like the clear water filterin over a rocky ledge and glitterin like little spangles over moss and wild flowers 
none	none	It wasn t only in English but Scotch ballads too and once or twice in Italian that he recited till at last he gave out in all the fulness of his liquid voice them elegant lines out of Pope s Homer As when the moon refulgent lamp of night O er heaven s clear azure spreads her sacred light When not a breath disturbs the deep serene And not a cloud o ercasts the solemn scene Around her throne the vivid planets roll And stars unnumbered gild the glowing pole O er the dark trees a yellower verdure shed And top with silver every mountain s head Then shine the vales the rocks in prospect rise A flood of glory bursts from all the skies The conscious swains rejoicing in the sight Eye the blue vault and bless the useful light
6848_252323_000053_000000	train-clean-100	 The Lord forgive me but when he came to the last words and said useful light I couldn t restrain myself but broke out That s mighty like a bull anyhow and reminds me of the ould song 
none	none	Good luck to the moon she s a fine noble creature And gives us the daylight all night in the dark
6848_252323_000055_000000	train-clean-100	 Before I knew where I was the boat glided in to the steps and a tall man a little stooped in the shoulders stood before me 
6848_252323_000056_000000	train-clean-100	 Is it you said he with a quiet laugh that accuses Pope of a bull 
none	none	It is says I and what s more there isn t a poet from Horace downwards that I won t show bulls in there s bulls in Shakspeare and in Milton there s bulls in the ancients I ll point out a bull in Aristophanes What have we here said he turning to the others A poor crayture says I like Goldsmith s chest of drawers
6848_252323_000060_000000	train-clean-100	 With brains reduced a doable debt to pay To dream by night sell Sheffield ware by day 
none	none	Well with that he took a fit of laughing and handing the rest out of the boat he made me come along at his side discoorsin me about my thravels and all I seen and all I read till we reached an elegant little cottage on a bank right over the lake and then he brought me in and made me take tay with the family and I spent the night there and when I started the next morning there was n t a screed of my pack that they did n t buy penknives and whistles and nut crackers and all just as they said for keepsakes Good luck to them and happy hearts wherever they are for they made mine happy that day ay and for many an hour afterwards when I just think over their kind words and pleasant faces More than one of the company had dropped off asleep during Billy s narrative and of the others their complaisance as listeners appeared taxed to the utmost while the Corporal snored loudly like a man who had a right to indulge himself to the fullest extent There s the bell again muttered one that s from the lord s room and Craggs starting up by the instinct of his office hastened off to his master s chamber My lord says you are to remain here said he as he re entered a few minutes later he is satisfied with your skill and I m to send off a messenger to the post to let them know he has detained you I m obaydient said Billy with a low bow and now for a brief repose And so saying he drew a long woollen nightcap from his pocket and putting it over his eyes resigned himself to sleep with the practised air of one who needed but very little preparation to secure slumber CHAPTER IV A VISITOR The old Castle of Glencore contained but one spacious room and this served all the purposes of drawing room dining room and library It was a long and lofty chamber with a raftered ceiling from which a heavy chandelier hung by a massive chain of iron Six windows all in the same wall deeply set and narrow admitted a sparing light In the opposite wall stood two fireplaces large massive and monumental the carved supporters of the richly chased pediment being of colossal size and the great shield of the house crowning the pyramid of strange and uncouth objects that were grouped below The walls were partly occupied by bookshelves partly covered by wainscot and here and there displayed a worn out portrait of some bygone warrior or dame who little dreamed how much the color of their effigies should be indebted to the sad effects of damp and mildew The furniture consisted of every imaginable type from the carved oak and ebony console to the white and gold of Versailles taste and the modern compromise of comfort with ugliness which chintz and soft cushions accomplish Two great screens thickly covered with prints and drawings most of them political caricatures of some fifty years back flanked each fireplace making as it were in this case two different apartments At one of those on a low sofa sat or rather lay Lord Glencore pale and wasted by long illness His thin hand held a letter to shade his eyes from the blazing wood fire and the other hand hung listlessly at his side The expression of the sick man s face was that of deep melancholy not the mere gloom of recent suffering but the deep cut traces of a long carried affliction a sorrow which had eaten into his very heart and made its home there At the second fireplace sat his son and though a mere boy the lineaments of his father marked the youth s face with a painful exactness The same intensity was in the eyes the same haughty character sat on the brow and there was in the whole countenance the most extraordinary counterpart of the gloomy seriousness of the older face He had been reading but the fast falling night obliged him to desist and he sat now contemplating the bright embers of the wood fire in dreamy thought Once or twice was he disturbed from his revery by the whispered voice of an old serving man asking for something with that submissive manner assumed by those who are continually exposed to the outbreaks of another s temper and at last the boy who had hitherto scarcely deigned to notice the appeals to him flung a bunch of keys contemptuously on the ground with a muttered malediction on his tormentor What s that cried out the sick man startled at the sound Tis nothing my lord but the keys that fell out of my hand replied the old man humbly mister Craggs is away to Leenane and I was going to get out the wine for dinner Where s mister Charles asked Lord Glencore He s there beyant muttered the other in a low voice while he pointed towards the distant fireplace but he looks tired and weary and I did n t like to disturb him Tired weary with what Where has he been what has he been doing cried he hastily Charles Charles I say And slowly rising from his seat and with an air of languid indifference the boy came towards him Lord Glencore s face darkened as he gazed on him Where have you been asked he sternly Yonder said the boy in an accent like the echo of his own There s mister Craggs now my lord said the old butler as he looked out of the window and eagerly seized the opportunity to interrupt the scene there he is and a gentleman with him Ha go and meet him Charles it s Harcourt Go and receive him show him his room and then bring him here to me The boy heard without a word and left the room with the same slow step and the same look of apathy Just as he reached the hall the stranger was entering it He was a tall well built man with the mingled ease and stiffness of a soldier in his bearing his face was handsome but somewhat stern and his voice had that tone which implies the long habit of command You re a Massy that I ll swear to said he frankly as he shook the boy s hand the family face in every lineament And how is your father Better he has had a severe illness So his letter told me I was up the Rhine when I received it and started at once for Ireland He has been very impatient for your coming said the boy he has talked of nothing else Ay we are old friends Glencore and I have been schoolfellows chums at college and messmates in the same regiment said he with a slight touch of sorrow in his tone Will he be able to see me now Is he confined to bed No he will dine with you I m to show you your room and then bring you to him That s better news than I hoped for boy By the way what s your name Charles Conyngham To be sure Charles how could I have forgotten it So Charles this is to be my quarters and a glorious view there is from this window What s the mountain yonder Ben Creggan We must climb that summit some of these days Charley I hope you re a good walker You shall be my guide through this wild region here for I have a passion for explorings And he talked away rapidly while he made a brief toilet and refreshed himself from the fatigues of the road Now Charley I am at your orders let us descend to the drawing room You ll find my father there said the boy as he stopped short at the door and Harcourt staring at him for a second or two in silence turned the handle and entered Lord Glencore never turned his head as the other drew nigh but sat with his forehead resting on the table extending his hand only in welcome My poor fellow said Harcourt grasping the thin and wasted fingers my poor fellow how glad I am to be with you again And he seated himself at his side as he spoke You had a relapse after you wrote to me Glencore slowly raised his head and pushing back a small velvet skull cap that he wore said You d not have known me George Eh see how gray I am I saw myself in the glass to day for the first time and I really could n t believe my eyes In another week the change will be just as great the other way It was some kind of a fever was it not I believe so said the other sighing And they bled you and blistered you of course These fellows are like the farriers they have but the one system for everything Who was your torturer where did you get him from A practitioner of the neighborhood the wild growth of the mountain said Glencore with a sickly smile but I must n t be ungrateful he saved my life if that be a cause for gratitude And a right good one I take it How like you that boy is Glencore I started back when he met me It was just as if I was transported again to old school days and had seen yourself as you used to be long ago Do you remember the long meadow Glencore Harcourt said he falteringly don t talk to me of long ago at least not now and then as if thinking aloud added How strange that a man without a hope should like the future better than the past How old is Charley asked Harcourt anxious to engage him on some other theme He ll be fifteen I think his next birthday he seems older does n t he Yes the boy is well grown and athletic What has he been doing have you had him at a school At a school said Glencore starting no he has lived always here with myself I have been his tutor I read with him every day till that illness seized me He looks clever is he so Like the rest of us George he may learn but he can t be taught The old obstinacy of the race is strong in him and to rouse him to rebel all you have to do is to give him a task but his faculties are good his apprehension quick and his memory if he would but tax it excellent Here s Craggs come to tell us of dinner give me your arm George we haven t far to go this one room serves us for everything You re better lodged than I expected your letters told me to look for a mere barrack and the place stands so well Yes the spot was well chosen although I suppose its founders cared little enough about the picturesque The dinner table was spread behind one of the massive screens and under the careful direction of Craggs and old Simon was well and amply supplied fish and game the delicacies of other localities being here in abundance Har court had a traveller s appetite and enjoyed himself thoroughly while Glencore never touched a morsel and the boy ate sparingly watching the stranger with that intense curiosity which comes of living estranged from all society Charley will treat you to a bottle of Burgundy Har court said Glencore as they drew round the fire he keeps the cellar key Let us have two Charley said Harcourt as the boy arose to leave the room and take care that you carry them steadily The boy stood for a second and looked at his father as if interrogating and then a sudden flush suffused his face as Glencore made a gesture with his hand for him to go You don t perceive how you touched him to the quick there Harcourt You talked to him as to how he should carry the wine he thought that office menial and beneath him and he looked at me to know what he should do What a fool you have made of the boy said Harcourt bluntly By Jove it was time I should come here When the boy came back he was followed by the old butler carefully carrying in a small wicker contrivance Hibernice called a cooper three cobwebbed and well crusted bottles Now Charley said Jarcourt gayly if you want to see a man thoroughly happy just step up to my room and fetch me a small leather sack you ll find there of tobacco and on the dressing table you ll see my meerschaum pipe be cautious with it for it belonged to no less a man than Poniatowski the poor fellow who died at Leipsic The lad stood again irresolute and confused when a signal from his father motioned him away to acquit the errand Thank you said Harcourt as he re entered you see I am not vain of my meerschaum without reason The carving of that bull is a work of real art and if you were a connoisseur in such matters you d say the color was perfect Have you given up smoking Glencore you used to be fond of a weed I care but little for it said Glencore sighing Take to it again my dear fellow if only that it is a bond tween yourself and every one who whiffs his cloud There are wonderfully few habits I was going to say enjoyments and I might say so but I ll call them habits that consort so well with every condition and every circumstance of life that become the prince and the peasant suit the garden of the palace and the red watch fire of the bivouac relieve the weary hours of a calm at sea or refresh the tired hunter in the prairies You must tell Charley some of your adventures in the West The Colonel has passed two years in the Rocky Mountains said Glencore to his son Ay Charley I have knocked about the world as much as most men and seen too my share of its wonders If accidents by sea and land can interest you if you care for stories of Indian life and the wild habits of a prairie hunter I m your man Your father can tell you more of salons and the great world of what may be termed the high game of life I have forgotten it as much as if I had never seen it said Glencore interrupting and with a severity of voice that showed the theme displeased him And now a pause ensued painful perhaps to the others but scarcely felt by Harcourt as he smoked away peacefully and seemed lost in the windings of his own fancies Have you shooting here Glencore asked he at length There might be if I were to preserve the game And you do not Do you fish No never You give yourself up to farming then Not even that the truth is Harcourt I literally do nothing A few newspapers a stray review or so reach me in these solitudes and keep me in a measure informed as to the course of events but Charley and I con over our classics together and scrawl sheets of paper with algebraic signs and puzzle our heads over strange formulas wonderfully indifferent to what the world is doing at the other side of this little estuary You of all men living to lead such a life as this a fellow that never could cram occupation enough into his short twenty four hours broke in Harcourt Glencore s pale cheek flushed slightly and an impatient movement of his fingers on the table showed how ill he relished any allusion to his own former life Charley will show you to morrow all the wonders of our erudition Harcourt said he changing the subject we have got to think ourselves very learned and I hope you ll be polite enough not to undeceive us You ll have a merciful critic Charley said the Colonel laughing for more reasons than one Had the question been how to track a wolf or wind an antelope to outmanoeuvre a scout party or harpoon a calf whale I d not yield to many but if you throw me amongst Greek roots or double equations I m only Samson with his hair en crop The solemn clock over the mantelpiece struck ten and the boy arose as it ceased That s Charley s bedtime said Glencore and we are determined to make no stranger of you George He ll say good night And with a manner of mingled shyness and pride the boy held out his hand which the soldier shook cordially saying To morrow then Charley I count upon you for my day and so that it be not to be passed in the library I ll acquit myself creditably I like your boy Glencore said he as soon as they were alone Of course I have seen very little of him and if I had seen more I should be but a sorry judge of what people would call his abilities But he is a good stamp Gentleman is written on him in a hand that any can read and by Jove let them talk as they will but that s half the battle of life He is a strange fellow you ll not understand him in a moment said Glencore smiling half sadly to himself Not understand him Glencore I read him like print man You think that his shy bashful manner imposes upon me not a bit of it I see the fellow is as proud as Lucifer All your solitude and estrangement from the world have n t driven out of his head that he s to be a Viscount one of these days and somehow wherever he has picked it up he has got a very pretty notion of the importance and rank that same title confers Let us not speak of this now Harcourt I m far too weak to enter upon what it would lead to It is however the great reason for which I entreated you to come here And to morrow at all events in a day or two we can speak of it fully And now I must leave you You ll have to rough it here George but as there is no man can do so with a better grace I can spare my apologies only I beg don t let the place be worse than it need be Give your orders get what you can and see if your tact and knowledge of life cannot remedy many a difficulty which our ignorance or apathy have served to perpetuate I ll take the command of the garrison with pleasure said Harcourt filling up his glass and replenishing the fire And now a good night s rest to you for I half suspect I have already jeopardied some of it The old campaigner sat till long past midnight The generous wine his pipe the cheerful wood fire were all companionable enough and well suited thoughts which took no high or heroic range but were chiefly reveries of the past some sad some pleasant but all tinged with the one philosophy which made him regard the world as a campaign wherein he who grumbles or repines is but a sorry soldier and unworthy of his cloth It was not till the last glass was drained that he arose to seek his bed and presently humming some old air to himself he slowly mounted the stairs to his chamber CHAPTER V COLONEL HARCOUUT S LETTER 
6695-252325-0000	train-other-500	As we desire throughout this tale to make the actors themselves wherever it be possible the narrators using their words in preference to our own we shall now place before the reader
6695-252325-0001	train-other-500	a letter written by Colonel Harcourt about a week after his arrival at Glencore which will at least serve to rescue him and ourselves from the task of repetition It was addressed to Sir Horace Upton
7495_252342_000019_000000	train-clean-360	Horace Upton 
6695-252325-0002	train-other-500	Her Majesty s Envoy at Stuttgard one who had formerly served in the same regiment with Glencore and himself but who left the army early to follow the career of diplomacy
none	none	 wherein still a young man 
6695-252325-0003	train-other-500	he had risen to the rank of a minister It is not important at this moment to speak more particularly of his character than that it was in almost every respect the opposite of his correspondent s Where the one was frank open and unguarded
6695-252325-0004	train-other-500	the other was cold cautious and reserved where one believed the other doubted where one was hopeful the other had nothing but misgivings
6695-252325-0005	train-other-500	Harcourt would have twenty times a day wounded the feelings or jarred against the susceptibility of his best friend Upton could not be brought to trench upon the slightest prejudice of his greatest enemy
6695-252325-0006	train-other-500	We might continue this contrast to every detail of their characters but enough has now been said and we proceed to the letter in question Glencore Castle Dear Upton
6695-252325-0007	train-other-500	True to my promise to give you early tidings of our old friend I sit down to pen a few lines which if a rickety table and some infernal lampblack for ink should make illegible you ll have to wait for the elucidation till my arrival
6695-252325-0008	train-other-500	I found Glencore terribly altered
none	none	 I d not have known him 
6695-252325-0009	train-other-500	He used to be muscular and rather full in habit he is now a mere skeleton His hair and mustache were coal black they are a motley gray He was straight as an arrow pretentiously erect many thought he is stooped now
6695-252325-0010	train-other-500	and bent nearly double His voice too the most clear and ringing in the squadron is become a hoarse whisper You remember what a passion he had for dress and how heartily we all deplored the chance of his being colonel
6695-252325-0011	train-other-500	well knowing what precious caprices of costly costume would be the consequence well a discharged corporal in a cast off mufti is stylish compared to him I don t think he has a hat
6695-252325-0012	train-other-500	I have only seen an oilskin cap but his coat his one coat is a curiosity of industrious patchwork and his trousers are a pair of our old overalls the same pattern we wore at Hounslow when the King reviewed us
6695-252325-0013	train-other-500	Great as these changes are they are nothing to the alteration in the poor fellow s disposition He that was generous to munificence is now an absolute miser
6695-252325-0014	train-other-500	descending to the most pitiful economy and moaning over every trifling outlay He is irritable too to a degree Far from the jolly light hearted comrade ready to join in the laugh against himself and enjoy a jest of which he was the object
6695-252325-0015	train-other-500	he suspects a slight in every allusion and bristles up to resent a mere familiarity as though it were an insult Of course I put much of this down to the score of illness and of bad health before he was so ill
6695-252325-0016	train-other-500	but depend upon it he s not the man we knew him Heaven knows if he ever will be so again The night I arrived here he was more natural more like himself in fact than he has ever been since
6695-252325-0017	train-other-500	His manner was heartier and in his welcome there was a touch of the old jovial good fellow who never was so happy as when sharing his quarters with a comrade Since that he has grown punctilious anxiously asking me if I am comfortable
6695-252325-0018	train-other-500	and teasing me with apologies for what I don t miss and excuses about things that I should never have discovered wanting I think I see what is passing within him he wants to be confidential and he does n t know how to go about it
6695-252325-0019	train-other-500	I suppose he looks on me as rather a rough father to confess to he is n t quite sure what kind of sympathy if any he ll meet with from me and he more than half dreads a certain careless outspoken way in which I have now and then addressed his boy
6695-252325-0020	train-other-500	of whom more anon I may be right or I may be wrong in this conjecture but certain it is that nothing like confidential conversation has yet passed between us and each day seems to render the prospect of such only less and less likely
6695-252325-0021	train-other-500	I wish from my heart you were here you are just the fellow to suit him just calculated to nourish the susceptibilities that I only shock I said as much t other day in a half careless way and he immediately caught it up and said
6695-252325-0022	train-other-500	Ay George Upton is a man one wants now and then in life and when the moment comes there is no such thing as a substitute for him In a joking manner I then remarked Why not come over to see him
none	none	 Leave this cried he venture in the world again expose myself to its brutal insolence or still 
6695-252325-0023	train-other-500	more brutal pity In a torrent of passion he went on in this strain till I heartily regretted that I had ever touched this unlucky topic I date his greatest reserve from that same moment
6695-252325-0024	train-other-500	and I am sure he is disposed to connect me with the casual suggestion to go over to Stuttgard and deems me in consequence one utterly deficient in all true feeling and delicacy
none	none	 I need n t tell you that my stay here 
6695-252325-0025	train-other-500	is the reverse of a pleasure I m never what fine people call bored anywhere and I could amuse myself gloriously in this queer spot I have shot some half dozen seals
none	none	 hooked the heaviest salmon I ever saw rise to a fly 
6695-252325-0026	train-other-500	and have had rare coursing not to say that Glencore s table with certain reforms I have introduced is very tolerable and his cellar unimpeachable
6695-252325-0027	train-other-500	I ll back his chambertin against your Excellency s and I have discovered a bin of red hermitage that would convert a whole vineyard of the smallest Lafitte
none	none	 into Sneyd s claret 
6695-252325-0028	train-other-500	but with all these seductions I can t stand the life of continued restraint I m reduced to Glencore evidently sent for me to make some revelations which now that he sees me he cannot accomplish
6695-252325-0029	train-other-500	For aught I know there may be as many changes in me to his eyes as to mine there are in him I only can vouch for it that if I ride three stone heavier
none	none	 I have n t the worse place 
6695-252325-0030	train-other-500	and I don t detect any striking falling off in my appreciation of good fare and good fellows I spoke of the boy he is a fine lad somewhat haughty perhaps a little spoiled by the country people calling him the young lord
6695-252325-0031	train-other-500	but a generous fellow and very like Glencore when he first joined us at Canterbury By way of educating him himself Glencore has been driving Virgil and decimal fractions into him and the boy bred in the country
6695-252325-0032	train-other-500	never out of it for a day can t load a gun or tie a hackle Not the worst thing about the lad is his inordinate love for Glencore whom he imagines to be about the greatest and most gifted being that ever lived
6695-252325-0033	train-other-500	I can scarcely help smiling at the implicitness of this honest faith but I take good care not to smile on the contrary I give every possible encouragement to the belief I conclude the disenchantment will arrive only too early at last
6695-252325-0034	train-other-500	You ll not know what to make of such a lengthy epistle from me and you ll doubtless torture that fine diplomatic intelligence of yours to detect the secret motive of my long windedness but the simple fact is it has rained incessantly for the last three days
6695-252325-0035	train-other-500	and promises the same cheering weather for as many more Glencore doesn t fancy that the boy s lessons should be broken in upon and hinc istae litterae that s classical for you I wish I could say when I am likely to beat my retreat
none	none	 I d stay not very willingly perhaps but still I d stay 
6695-252325-0036	train-other-500	if I thought myself of any use but I cannot persuade myself that I am such Glencore is now about again feeble of course and much pulled down but able to go about the house and the garden
6695-252325-0037	train-other-500	I can contribute nothing to his recovery and I fear as little to his comfort I even doubt if he desires me to prolong my visit but such is my fear of offending him that I actually dread to allude to my departure till I can sound my way as to how he ll take it
6695-252325-0038	train-other-500	This fact alone will show you how much he is changed from the Glencore of long ago Another feature in him totally unlike his former self struck me the other evening We were talking of old messmates Croydon Stanhope Loftus and yourself
6695-252325-0039	train-other-500	and instead of dwelling as he once would have done exclusively on your traits of character and disposition he discussed nothing but your abilities and the capacity by which you could win your way to honors and distinction
none	none	 I need n t say how in such a valuation 
6695-252325-0040	train-other-500	you came off best Indeed he professes the highest esteem for your talents and says You ll see Upton either a cabinet minister or ambassador at Paris yet and this he repeated in the same words last night
6695-252325-0041	train-other-500	as if to show it was not dropped as a mere random observation I have some scruples about venturing to offer anything bordering on a suggestion to a great and wily diplomatist like yourself
6695-252325-0042	train-other-500	but if an illustrious framer of treaties and protocols would condescend to take a hint from an old dragoon colonel
none	none	 I d say that a few lines from your crafty pen might possibly unlock this poor fellow s heart 
6695-252325-0043	train-other-500	and lead him to unburthen to you what he evidently cannot persuade himself to reveal to me I can see plainly enough that there is something on his mind but I know it just as a stupid old hound feels there is a fox in the cover
6695-252325-0044	train-other-500	but cannot for the life of him see how he s to draw him A letter from you would do him good at all events even the little gossip of your gossiping career would cheer and amuse him He said very plaintively two nights ago
none	none	 They ve all forgotten me 
6695-252325-0045	train-other-500	When a man retires from the world he begins to die
none	none	 and the great event after all is only the coup de grace 
6695-252325-0046	train-other-500	to a long agony of torture Do write to him then the address is Glencore Castle Leenane Ireland where I suppose I shall be still a resident for another fortnight to come
6695-252325-0047	train-other-500	Glencore has just sent for me but I must close this for the post or it will be too late Yours ever truly George Harcourt I open this to say that he sent for me to ask your address whether through the Foreign Office or direct to Stuttgard
none	none	 You ll probably not hear for some days for he writes with extreme difficulty and I leave it to your wise discretion to write to him or not in the interval 
6695-252325-0048	train-other-500	Poor fellow he looks very ill to day He says that he never slept the whole night and that the laudanum he took to induce drowsiness only excited and maddened him I counselled a hot jorum of mulled porter before getting into bed
6695-252325-0049	train-other-500	but he deemed me a monster for the recommendation and seemed quite disgusted besides Could n t you send him over a despatch
none	none	 I think such a document from Stuttgard ought to be an unfailing soporific CHAPTER VI QUEER COMPANIONSHIP When Harcourt repaired to Glencore s bedroom where he still lay wearied and feverish after a bad night he was struck by the signs of suffering in the sick man s face The cheeks were bloodless and fallen iq the lips pinched and in the eyes there shone that unnatural brilliancy which results from an over wrought and over excited brain Sit down here George said he pointing to a chair beside the bed I want to talk to you I thought every day that I could muster courage for what I wish to say but somehow when the time arrived I felt like a criminal who entreats for a few hours more of life even though it be a life of misery It strikes me that you were never less equal to the effort than now said Harcourt laying his hand on the other s pulse Don t believe my pulse George said Glencore smiling faintly The machine may work badly but it has wonderful holding out I ve gone through enough added he gloomily to kill most men and here I am still breathing and suffering This place doesn t suit you Glencore There are not above two days in the month you can venture to take the air And where would you have me go sir he broke in fiercely Would you advise Paris and the Boulevards or a palace in the Piazza di Spagna at Rome or perhaps the Chiaja at Naples would be public enough Is it that I may parade disgrace and infamy through Europe that I should leave this solitude I want to see you in a better climate Glencore in a place where the sun shines occasionally This suits me said the other bluntly and here I have the security that none can invade none molest me But it is not of myself I wish to speak it is of my boy Harcourt made no reply but sat patiently to listen to what was coming It is time to think of him added Glencore slowly The other day it seems but the other day and he was a mere child a few years more to seem when past like a long dreary night and he will be a man Very true said Harcourt and Charley is one of those fellows who only make one plunge from the boy into all the responsibilities of manhood Throw him into a college at Oxford or the mess of a regiment to morrow and this day week you ll not know him from the rest Glencore was silent if he had heard he never noticed Harcourt s remark Has he ever spoken to you about himself Harcourt asked he after a pause Never except when I led the subject in that direction and even then reluctantly as though it were a topic he would avoid Have you discovered any strong inclination in him for a particular kind of life or any career in preference to another None and if I were only to credit what I see of him I d say that this dull monotony and this dreary uneventful existence is what he likes best of all the world You really think so cried Glencore with an eagerness that seemed out of proportion to the remark So far as I see rejoined Harcourt guardedly and not wishing to let his observation carry graver consequences than he might suspect So that you deem him capable of passing a life of a quiet unambitious tenor neither seeking for distinctions nor fretting after honors How should he know of their existence Glencore What has the boy ever heard of life and its struggles It s not in Homer or Sallust he d learn the strife of parties and public men And why need he ever know them broke in Glencore fiercely If he doesn t know them now he s sure to be taught them hereafter A young fellow who will succeed to a title and a good fortune Stop Harcourt cried Glencore passionately Has anything of this kind ever escaped you in intercourse with the boy Not a word not a syllable Has he himself ever by a hint or by a chance word implied that he was aware of Glencore faltered and hesitated for the word he sought for did not present itself Harcourt however released him from all embarrassment by saying With me the boy is rarely anything but a listener he hears me talk away of tiger shooting and buffalo hunting scarcely ever interrupting me with a question But I can see in his manner with the country people when they salute him and call him my lord But he is not my lord broke in Glencore Of course he is not that I am well aware of He never will never shall be cried Glencore in a voice to which a long pent up passion imparted a terrible energy How what do you mean Glencore said Harcourt eagerly Has he any malady is there any deadly taint That there is by Heaven cried the sick man grasping the curtain with one hand while he held the other firmly clenched upon his forehead a taint the deadliest that can stain a human heart Talk of station rank title what are they if they are to be coupled with shame ignominy and sorrow The loud voice of the herald calls his father Sixth Viscount of Glencore but a still louder voice proclaims his mother a With a wild burst of hysteric laughter he threw himself face downwards on the bed and now scream after scream burst from him till the room was filled by the servants in the midst of whom appeared Billy who had only that same day returned from Leenane whither he had gone to make a formal resignation of his functions as letter carrier This is nothing but an accessio nervosa said Billy clear the room ladies and gentlemen and lave me with the patient And Harcourt gave the signal for obedience by first taking his departure Lord Glencore s attack was more serious than at first it was apprehended and for three days there was every threat of a relapse of his late fever but Billy s skill was once more successful and on the fourth day he declared that the danger was past During this period Harcourt s attention was for the first time drawn to the strange creature who officiated as the doctor and who in despite of all the detracting influences of his humble garb and mean attire aspired to be treated with the deference due to a great physician If it s the crown and the sceptre makes the king said he tis the same with the science that makes the doctor and no man can be despised when he has a rag of ould Galen s mantle to cover his shoulders So you re going to take blood from him asked Harcourt as he met him on the stairs where he had awaited his coming one night when it was late No sir tis more a disturbance of the great nervous centres than any derangement of the heart and arteries said Billy pompously that s what shows a real doctor to distinguish between the effects of excitement and inflammation which is as different as fireworks is from a bombardment Not a bad simile Master Billy come in and drink a glass of brandy and water with me said Harcourt right glad at the prospect of such companionship Billy Traynor too was flattered by the invitation and seated himself at the fire with an air at once proud and submissive You ve a difficult patient to treat there said Harcourt when he had furnished his companion with a pipe and twice filled his glass he s hard to manage I take it Yer right said Billy every touch is a blow every breath of air is a hurricane with him There s no such thing as traitin a man of that timperament it s the same with many of them ould families as with our racehorses they breed them too fine Egad I think you are right said Harcourt pleased with an illustration that suited his own modes of thinking Yes sir said Billy gaining confidence by the approval a man is a ma chine and all the parts ought to be balanced and as the ancients say in equilibrio If preponderance here or there whether it be brain or spinal marrow cardiac functions or digestive ones you disthroy him and make that dangerous kind of constitution that like a horse with a hard mouth or a boat with a weather helm always runs to one side That s well put well explained said Harcourt who really thought the illustration appropriate Now my lord there continued Billy is all out of balance every bit of him Bleed him and he sinks stimulate him and he goes ragin mad T is their physical conformation makes their character and to know how to cure them in sickness one ought to have some knowledge of them in health How came you to know all this You are a very remarkable fellow Billy I am sir I m a phenumenon in a small way And many people thinks when they see and convarse with me what a pity it is I hav n t the advantages of edication and instruction and that s just where they re wrong complately wrong Well I confess I don t perceive that I ll show you then There s a kind of janius natural to men like myself in Ireland I mean for I never heerd of it elsewhere that s just like our Irish emerald or Irish diamond wonderful if one considers where you find it astonishin if you only think how azy it is to get but a regular disappointment a downright take in if you intend to have it cut and polished and set No sir with all the care and culture in life you ll never make a precious stone of it You ve not taken the right way to convince me by using such an illustration Billy I ll try another then said Billy We are like Willy the Whisps showing plenty of light where there s no road to travel but of no manner of use on the highway or in the dark streets of a village where one has business Your own services here are the refutation to your argument Billy said Harcourt filling his glass Tis your kindness to say so sir said Billy with gratified pride but the sacrat was he thrusted me that was the whole of it All the miracles of physic is confidence just as all the magic of eloquence is conviction You have reflected profoundly I see said Harcourt I made a great many observations at one time of my life the opportunity was favorable When and how was that I travelled with a baste caravan for two years sir and there s nothing taches one to know mankind like the study of bastes Not complimentary to humanity certainly said Harcourt laughing Yes but it is though for it is by a consideration of the fero naturo that you get at the raal nature of mere animal existence You see there man in the rough as a body might say just as he was turned out of the first workshop and before he was infiltrated with the divinus afflatus the ethereal essence that makes him the first of creation There s all the qualities good and bad love hate vengeance gratitude grief joy ay and mirth there they are in the brutes but they re in no subjection except by fear Now it s out of man s motives his character is moulded and fear is only one amongst them D ye apprehend me Perfectly fill your pipe And he pushed the tobacco towards him I will and I ll drink the memory of the great and good man that first intro duced the weed amongst us Here s Sir Walter Raleigh By the same token I was in his house last week In his house where Down at Greyhall You Englishmen savin your presence always forget that many of your celebrities lived years in Ireland for it was the same long ago as now a place of decent banishment for men of janius a kind of straw yard where ye turned out your intellectual hunters till the sayson came on at home I m sorry to see Billy that with all your enlightenment you have the vulgar prejudice against the Saxon And that s the rayson I have it because it is vulgar said Billy eagerly Vulgar means popular common to many and what s the best test of truth in anything but universal belief or whatever comes nearest to it I wish I was in Parliament I just wish I was there the first night one of the nobs calls out That s vulgar and I d just say to him Is there anything as vulgar as men and women Show me one good thing in life that is n t vulgar Show me an object a painter copies or a poet describes that is n t so Ayeh cried he impatiently when they wanted a hard word to fling at us why didn t they take the right one But you are unjust Billy the ungenerous tone you speak of is fast disappearing Gentlemen nowadays use no disparaging epithets to men poorer or less happily circumstanced than themselves Faix said Billy it isn t sitting here at the same table with yourself that I ought to gainsay that remark And Harcourt was so struck by the air of good breeding in which he spoke that he grasped his hand and shook it warmly And what is more continued Billy from this day out I ll never think so He drank off his glass as he spoke giving to the libation all the ceremony of a solemn vow D ye hear that them s oars there s a boat coming in You have sharp hearing master said Harcourt laughing I got the gift when I was a smuggler replied he I could put my ear to the ground of a still night and tell you the tramp of a revenue boot as well as if I seen it And now I ll lay sixpence it s Pat Morissy is at the bow oar there he rows with a short jerking stroke there s no timing That s himself and it must be something urgent from the post office that brings him over the lough to night The words were scarcely spoken when Craggs entered with a letter in his hand This is for you Colonel said he it was marked immediate and the post mistress despatched it by an express The letter was a very brief one but in honor to the writer we shall give it a chapter to itself CHAPTER VII A GREAT DIPLOMATIST My dear Harcourt I arrived here yesterday and by good fortune caught your letter at F O where it was awaiting the departure of the messenger for Germany Your account of poor Glencore is most distressing At the same time my knowledge of the man and his temper in a measure prepared me for it You say that he wishes to see me and intends to write Now there is a small business matter between us which his lawyer seems much disposed to push on to a difficulty if not to worse To prevent this if possible at all events to see whether a visit from me might not be serviceable I shall cross over to Ireland on Tuesday and be with you by Friday or at latest Saturday Tell him that I am coming but only for a day My engagements are such that I must be here again early in the following week On Thursday I go down to Windsor There is wonderfully little stirring here but I keep that little for our meeting You are aware my dear friend what a poor shattered broken down fellow I am so that I need not ask you to give me a comfortable quarter for my one night and some shell fish if easily procurable for my one dinner Yours ever and faithfully H U We have already told our reader that the note was a brief one and yet was it not altogether uncharacteristic Sir Horace Upton it will spare us both some repetition if we present him at once was one of a very composite order of human architecture a kind of being in fact of which many would deny the existence till they met and knew them so full of contradictions real and apparent was his nature Chivalrous in sentiment and cunning in action noble in aspiration and utterly sceptical as regards motives one half of his temperament was the antidote to the other Fastidious to a painful extent in matters of taste he was simplicity itself in all the requirements of his life and with all a courtier s love of great people not only tolerating but actually preferring the society of men beneath him In person he was tall and with that air of distinction in his manner that belongs only to those who unite natural graces with long habits of high society His features were finely formed and would have been strikingly handsome were the expression not spoiled by a look of astuteness a something that implied a tendency to overreach which marred their repose and injured their uniformity Not that his manner ever betrayed this weakness far from it his was a most polished courtesy It was impossible to conceive an address more bland or more conciliating His very gestures his voice languid by a slight habit of indisposition seemed as though exerted above their strength in the desire to please and making the object of his attentions to feel himself the mark of peculiar honor There ran through all his nature through everything he did or said or thought a certain haughty humility which served while it assigned an humble place to himself to mark out one still more humble for those about him There were not many things he could not do indeed he had actually done most of those which win honor and distinction in life He had achieved a very gallant but brief military career in India made a most brilliant opening in Parliament where his abilities at once marked him out for office was suspected to be the writer of the cleverest political satire and more than suspected to be the author of the novel of the day With all this he had great social success He was deep enough for a ministerial dinner and fast enough for a party of young Guardsmen at Greenwich With women too he was especially a favorite there was a Machiavelian subtlety which he could throw into small things a mode of making the veriest trifles little Chinese puzzles of ingenuity that flattered and amused them In a word he had great adaptiveness and it was a quality he indulged less for the gratification of others than for the pleasure it afforded himself He had mixed largely in society not only of his own but of every country of Europe He knew every chord of that complex instrument which people call the world like a master and although a certain jaded and wearied look a tone of exhaustion and fatigue seemed to say that he was tired of it all that he had found it barren and worthless the real truth was he enjoyed life to the full as much as on the first day in which he entered it and for this simple reason that he had started with an humble opinion of mankind their hopes fears and ambitions and so he continued not disappointed to the end The most governing notion of his own life was an impression that he had a disease of the chest some subtle and mysterious affection which had defied the doctors and would go on to defy them to the last He had been dangerously wounded in the Burmese war and attributed the origin of his malady to this cause Others there were who said that the want of recognition to his services in that campaign was the direst of all the injuries he had received And true it was a most brilliant career had met with neither honors nor advancement and Upton left the service in disgust carrying away with him only the lingering sufferings of his wound To suggest to him that his malady had any affinity to any known affection was to outrage him since the mere supposition would reduce him to a species of equality with some one else a thought infinitely worse than any mere physical suffering and indeed to avoid this shocking possibility he vacillated as to the locality of his disorder making it now in the lung now in the heart at one time in the bronchial tubes at another in the valves of the aorta It was his pleasure to consult for this complaint every great physician of Europe and not alone consult but commit himself to their direction and this with a credulity which he could scarcely have summoned in any other cause It was difficult to say how far he himself believed in this disorder the pressure of any momentous event the necessity of action never finding him unequal to any effort no matter how onerous Give him a difficulty a minister to outwit a secret scheme to unravel a false move to profit by and he rose above all his pulmonary symptoms and could exert himself with a degree of power and perseverance that very few men could equal none surpass Indeed it seemed as though he kept this malady for the pastime of idle hours as other men do a novel or a newspaper but would never permit it to interfere with the graver business of life We have perhaps been prolix in our description but we have felt it the more requisite to be thus diffuse since the studious simplicity which marked all his manner might have deceived our reader and which the impression of his mere words have failed to convey You will be glad to hear Upton is in England Glen core said Harcourt as the sick man was assisted to his seat in the library and what is more intends to pay you a visit Upton coming here exclaimed Glencore with an expression of mingled astonishment and confusion how do you know that He writes me from Long s to say that he ll be with us by Friday or if not by Saturday What a miserable place to receive him exclaimed Glencore As for you Harcourt you know how to rough it and have bivouacked too often under the stars to care much for satin curtains But think of Upton here How is he to eat where is he to sleep By Jove we ll treat him handsomely Don t you fret yourself about his comforts besides I ve seen a great deal of Upton and with all his fastidiousness and refinement he s a thorough good fellow at taking things for the best Invite him to Chatsworth and the chances are he ll find fault with twenty things with the place the cookery and the servants but take him down to the Highlands lodge him in a shieling with bannocks for breakfast and a Fyne herring for supper and I ll wager my life you ll not see a ruffle in his temper nor hear a word of impatience out of his mouth I know that he is a well bred gentleman said Glencore half pettishly but I have no fancy for putting his good manners to a severe test particularly at the cost of my own feelings I tell you again he shall be admirably treated he shall have my room and as for his dinner Master Billy and I are going to make a raid amongst the lobster pots And what with turbot oysters grouse pie and mountain mutton I ll make the diplomatist sorrow that he is not accredited to some native sovereign in the Arran islands instead of some mere German Hertzog He can only stay one day One day That s all he is over head and ears in business and he goes down to Windsor on Thursday so that there is no help for it I wish I may be strong enough I hope to Heaven that I may rally Glencore stopped suddenly as he got thus far but the agitation the words cost him seemed most painful I say again don t distress yourself about Upton leave the care of entertaining him to me I ll vouch for it that he leaves us well satisfied with his welcome It was not of that I was thinking said he impatiently I have much to say to him things of great importance It may be that I shall be unequal to the effort I cannot answer for my strength for a day not for an hour Could you not write to him and ask him to defer his coming till such time as he can spare me a week or at least some days My dear Glencore you know the man well and that we are lucky if we can have him on his own terms not to think of imposing ours he is sure to have a number of engagements while he is in England Well be it so said Glencore sighing with the air of a man resigning himself to an inevitable necessity CHAPTER VIII THE GREAT MAN S ARRIVAL Not come Craggs said Harcourt as late on the Saturday evening the Corporal stepped on shore after crossing the lough No sir no sign of him I sent a boy away to the top of the Devil s Mother where you have a view of the road for eight miles but there was nothing to be seen You left orders at the post office to have a boat in readiness if he arrived Yes Colonel said he with a military salute and Harcourt now turned moodily towards the Castle Glencore had scarcely ever been a very cheery residence but latterly it had become far gloomier than before Since the night of Lord Glencore s sudden illness there had grown up a degree of constraint between the two friends which to a man of Harcourt s disposition was positive torture They seldom met save at dinner and then their reserve was painfully evident The boy too in unconscious imitation of his father grew more and more distant and poor Harcourt saw himself in that position of all others the most intolerable the unwilling guest of an unwilling host Come or not come muttered he to himself I ll bear this no longer There is besides no reason why I should bear it I m of no use to the poor fellow he does not want he never sees me If anything my presence is irksome to him so that happen what will I ll start to morrow or next day at farthest He was one of those men to whom deliberation on any subject was no small labor but who once that they have come to a decision feel as if they had acquitted a debt and need give themselves no further trouble in the matter In the enjoyment of this newly purchased immunity he entered the room where Glencore sat impatiently awaiting him Another disappointment said the Viscount anxiously Yes Craggs has just returned and says there s no sign of a carriage for miles on the Oughterard road I ought to have known it said the other in a voice of guttural sternness He was ever the same an appointment with him was an engagement meant only to be binding on those who expected him Who can say what may have detained him He was in London on business public business too and even if he had left town how many chance delays there are in travelling I have said every one of these things over to myself Harcourt but they don t satisfy me This is a habit with Upton I ve seen him do the same with his Colonel when he was a subaltern I ve heard of his arrival late to a Court dinner and only smiling at the dismay of the horrified courtiers Egad said Harcourt bluntly I don t see the advantage of the practice One is so certain of doing fifty things in this daily life to annoy one s friends through mere inadvertence or forgetfulness that I think it is but sorry fun to incur their ill will by malice prepense That is precisely why he does it Come come Glencore old Rixson was right when he said Heaven help the man whose merits are canvassed while they wait dinner for him I ll order up the soup for if we wait any longer we ll discover Upton to be the most graceless vagabond that ever walked I know his qualities good and bad said Glencore rising and pacing the room with slow uncertain steps few men know him better None need tell me of his abilities none need instruct me as to his faults What others do by accident he does by design He started in life by examining how much the world would bear from him he has gone on profiting by the experience and improving on the practice Well if I don t mistake me much he ll soon appear to plead his own cause I hear oars coming speedily in this direction And so saying Harcourt hurried away to resolve his doubts at once As he reached the little jetty over which a large signal fire threw a strong red light he perceived that he was correct and was just in time to grasp Upton s hand as he stepped on shore How picturesque all this Harcourt said he in his soft low voice a leaf out of Rob Roy Well am I not the mirror of punctuality eh We looked for you yesterday and Glencore has been so impatient Of course he has it is the vice of your men who do nothing How is he Does he dine with us Fritz take care those leather pillows are properly aired and see that my bath is ready by ten o clock Give me your arm Harcourt what a blessing it is to be such a strong fellow So it is by Jove I am always thankful for it And you how do you get on You look well Do I said he faintly and pushing back his hair with an almost fine ladylike affectation I m glad you say so It always rallies me a little to hear I m better You had my letter about the fish Ay and I ll give you such a treat No no my dear Harcourt a fried mackerel or a whiting and a few crumbs of bread nothing more If you insist it shall be so but I promise you I ll not be of your mess that s all This is a glorious spot for turbot and such oysters Oysters are forbidden me and don t let me have the torture of temptation What a charming place this seems to be very wild very rugged Wild rugged I should think it is muttered Harcourt This pathway though does not bespeak much care I wish our friend yonder would hold his lantern a little lower How I envy you the kind of life you lead here so tranquil so removed from all bores By the way you get the newspapers tolerably regularly Yes every day That s all right If there be a luxury left to any man after the age of forty it is to be let alone It s the best thing I know of What a terrible bit of road They might have made a pathway Come don t grow faint hearted Here we are this is Glencore Wait a moment Just let him raise that lantern Really this is very striking a very striking scene altogether The doorway excellent and that little watch tower with its lone star light a perfect picture You ll have time enough to admire all this and we are keeping poor Glencore waiting said Harcourt impatiently Very true so we are Glencore s son Upton said Harcourt presenting the boy who stood half pride half bashfulness in the porch My dear boy you see one of your father s oldest friends in the world said Upton throwing one arm on the boy s shoulder apparently caressing but as much to aid himself in ascending the stair I m charmed with your old Schloss here my dear said he as they moved along Modern architects cannot attain the massive simplicity of these structures They have a kind of confectionery style with false ornament and inappropriate decoration that bears about the same relation to the original that a suit of Drury Lane tinfoil does to a coat of Milanese mail armor This gallery is in excellent taste And as he spoke the door in front of him opened and the pale sorrow struck and sickly figure of Glencore stood before him Upton with all his self command could scarcely repress an exclamation at the sight of one whom he had seen last in all the pride of youth and great personal powers while Glencore with the instinctive acuteness of his morbid temperament as quickly saw the impression he had produced and said with a deep sigh Ay Horace a sad wreck Not so my dear fellow said the other taking the thin cold hand within both his own as seaworthy as ever after a little dry docking and refitting It is only a craft like that yonder and he pointed to Harcourt that can keep the sea in all weathers and never care for the carpenter You and I are of another build And you how are you asked Glencore relieved to turn attention away from himself while he drew his arm within the other s The same poor ailing mortal you always knew me said Upton languidly doomed to a life of uncongenial labor condemned to climates totally unstated to me I drag along existence only astonished at the trouble I take to live knowing pretty well as I do what life is worth Jolly companions every one By Jove said Har court for a pair of fellows who were born on the sunny side of the road I must say you are marvellous instances of gratitude That excellent hippopotamus said Upton has no thought for any calamity if it does not derange his digestion How glad I am to see the soup Now Glencore you shall witness no invalid s appetite As the dinner proceeded the tone of the conversation grew gradually lighter and pleasanter Upton had only to permit his powers to take their free course to be agreeable and now talked away on whatever came uppermost with a charming union of reflectiveness and repartee If a very rigid purist might take occasional Gallicisms in expression and a constant leaning to French modes of thought none could fail to be delighted with the graceful ease with which he wandered from theme to theme adorning each with some trait of that originality which was his chief characteristic Harcourt was pleased without well knowing how or why while to Glencore it brought back the memory of the days of happy intercourse with the world and all the brilliant hours of that polished circle in which he had lived To the pleasure then which his powers conferred there succeeded an impression of deep melancholy so deep as to attract the notice of Harcourt who hastily asked If he felt ill Not worse said he faintly but weak weary and I know Upton will forgive me if I say good night What a wreck indeed exclaimed Upton as Glencore left the room with his son I d not have known him And yet until the last half hour I have not seen him so well for weeks past I m afraid something you said about Alicia Villars affected him said Harcourt My dear Harcourt how young you are in all these things said Upton as he lighted his cigarette A poor heart stricken fellow like Glencore no more cares for what you would think a painful allusion than an old weather beaten sailor would for a breezy morning on the Downs at Brighton His own sorrows lie too deeply moored to be disturbed by the light winds that ruffle the surface And to think that all this is a woman s doing Is n t that what s passing in your mind eh most gallant Colonel By Jove and so it was They were the very words I was on the point of uttering said Harcourt half nettled at the ease with which the other read him And of course you understand the source of the sorrow I m not quite so sure of that said Harcourt more and more piqued at the tone of bantering superiority with which the other spoke Yes you do Harcourt I know you better than you know yourself Your thoughts were these Here s a fellow with a title a good name good looks and a fine fortune going out of the world of a broken heart and all for a woman You knew her said Harcourt anxious to divert the discussion from himself Intimately Ninetta della Torre was the belle of Florence what am I saying of all Italy when Glencore met her about eighteen years ago The Palazzo della Torre was the best house in Florence The old Prince her grandfather her father was killed in the Russian campaign was spending the last remnant of an immense fortune in every species of extravagance Entertainments that surpassed those of the Pitti Palace in splendor fetes that cost fabulous sums banquets voluptuous as those of ancient Rome were things of weekly occurrence Of course every foreigner with any pretension to distinction sought to be presented there and we English happened just at that moment to stand tolerably high in Italian estimation I am speaking of some eighteen or twenty years back before we sent out that swarm of domestic economists who under the somewhat erroneous notion of foreign cheapness by a system of incessant higgle and bargain cutting down every one s demand to the measure of their own pockets end by making the word Englishman a synonym for all that is mean shabby and contemptible The English of that day were of another class and assuredly their characteristics as regards munificence and high dealing must have been strongly impressed upon the minds of foreigners seeing how their successors very different people have contrived to trade upon the mere memory of these qualities ever since Which all means that my lord stood cheating better than those who came after him said Harcourt bluntly He did so and precisely for that very reason he conveyed the notion of a people who do not place money in the first rank of all their speculations and who aspire to no luxury that they have not a just right to enjoy But to come back to Glencore He soon became a favored guest at the Palazzo della Torre His rank name and station combined with very remarkable personal qualities obtained for him a high place in the old Prince s favor and Ninetta deigned to accord him a little more notice than she bestowed on any one else I have in the course of my career had occasion to obtain a near view of royal personages and their habits and I can say with certainty that never in any station no matter how exalted have I seen as haughty a spirit as in that girl To the pride of her birth rank and splendid mode of life were added the consciousness of her surpassing beauty and the graceful charm of a manner quite unequalled She was incomparably superior to all around her and strangely enough she did not offend by the bold assertion of this superiority It seemed her due and no more Nor was it the assumption of mere flattered beauty Her house was the resort of persons of the very highest station and in the midst of them some even of royal blood she exacted all the deference and all the homage that she required from others And they accorded it asked Harcourt half contemptuously They did and so had you also if you had been in their place Believe me most gallant Colonel there is a wide difference between the empty pretension of mere vanity and the daring assumption of conscious power This girl saw the influence she wielded As she moved amongst us she beheld the homage not always willing that awaited her She felt that she had but to distinguish any one man there and he became for the time as illustrious as though touched by the sword or ennobled by the star of his sovereign The courtier like attitude of men in the presence of a very beautiful woman is a spectacle full of interest In the homage vouchsafed to mere rank there enters always a sense of humiliation and in the observances of respect men tender to royalty the idea of vassalage presents itself most prominently whereas in the other case the chivalrous devotion is not alloyed by this meaner servitude and men never lift their heads more haughtily than after they have bowed them in lowly deference to loveliness A thick short snort from Harcourt here startled the speaker who inspired by the sounds of his own voice and the flowing periods he uttered had fallen into one of those paroxysms of loquacity which now and then befell him That his audience should have thought him tiresome or prosy would indeed have seemed to him something strange but that his hearer should have gone off asleep was almost incredible It is quite true said Upton to himself he snores like a warrior taking his rest What wonderful gifts some fellows are endowed with and to enjoy life there is none of them all like dulness Can you show me to my room said he as Craggs answered his ring at the bell The Corporal bowed an assent The Colonel usually retires early I suppose said Upton Yes sir at ten to a minute Ah it is one nearly half past one now I perceive said he looking at his watch That accounts for his drowsiness muttered he between his teeth Curious vegetables are these old campaigners Wish him good night for me when he awakes will you And so saying he proceeded on his way with all that lassitude and exhaustion which it was his custom to throw into every act which demanded the slightest exertion Any more stairs to mount mister Craggs said he with a bland but sickly smile Yes sir two flights more Oh dear couldn t you have disposed of me on the lower floor I don t care where or how but something that requires no climbing It matters little however for I m only here for a day We could fit up a small room sir off the library Do so then A most humane thought for if I should remain another night Not at it yet cried he peevishly at the aspect of an almost perpendicular stair before him This is the last flight sir and you ll have a splendid view for your trouble when you awake in the morning There is no view ever repaid the toil of an ascent mister Craggs whether it be to an attic or the Righi Would you kindly tell my servant mister Schoefer where to find me and let him fetch the pillows and put a little rosemary in a glass of water in the room it corrects the odor of the night lamp And I should like my coffee early say at seven though I don t wish to be disturbed afterwards Thank you mister Craggs good night Oh one thing more You have a doctor here would you just mention to him that I should like to see him to morrow about nine or half past Good night good night And with a smile worthy of bestowal upon a court beauty and a gentle inclination of the head the very ideal of gracefulness Sir Horace dismissed mister Craggs and closed the door CHAPTER IX A MEDICAL VISIT mister Schoefer moved through the dimly lighted chamber with all the cat like stealthiness of an accomplished valet arranging the various articles of his master s wardrobe and giving so far as he was able the semblance of an accustomed spot to this new and strange locality Already indeed it was very unlike what it had been during Harcourt s occupation Guns whips fishing tackle dog leashes and landing nets had all disappeared as well as uncouth specimens of costume for boating or the chase and in their place were displayed all the accessories of an elaborate toilet laid out with a degree of pomp and ostentation somewhat in contrast to the place A richly embroidered dressing gown lay on the back of a chair before which stood a pair of velvet slippers worked in gold On the table in front of these a whole regiment of bottles of varied shape and color were ranged the contents being curious essences and delicate odors every one of which entered into some peculiar stage of that elaborate process Sir Horace Upton went through each morning of his life as a preparation for the toils of the day Adjoining the bed stood a smaller table covered with various medicaments tinctures essences infusions and extracts whose subtle qualities he was well skilled in and but for whose timely assistance he would not have believed himself capable of surviving throughout the day Beside these was a bulky file of prescriptions the learned documents of doctors of every country of Europe all of whom had enjoyed their little sunshine of favor and all of whom had ended by mistaking his case These had now been placed in readiness for the approaching consultation with Glencore s doctor and mister Schoefer still glided noiselessly from place to place preparing for that event I m not asleep Fritz said a weak plaintive voice from the bed Let me have my aconite eighteen drops a full dose to day for this journey has brought back the pains Yes Excellenz said Fritz in a voice of broken accentuation I slept badly continued his master in the same complaining tone The sea beat so heavily against the rocks and the eternal plash plash all night irritated and worried me Are you giving me the right tincture Yes Excellenz was the brief reply You have seen the doctor what is he like Fritz A strange grimace and a shrug of the shoulders were mister Schoefer s only answer I thought as much said Upton with a heavy sigh They called him the wild growth of the mountains last night and I fancied what that was like to prove Is he young A shake of the head implied not Nor old Another similar movement answered the question Give me a comb Fritz and fetch the glass here And now Sir Horace arranged his silky hair more becomingly and having exchanged one or two smiles with his image in the mirror lay back on the pillow saying Tell him I am ready to see him mister Schoefer proceeded to the door and at once presented the obsequious figure of Billy Traynor who having heard some details of the rank and quality of his new patient made his approaches with a most deferential humility It was true Billy knew that my Lord Glencore s rank was above that of Sir Horace but to his eyes there was the far higher distinction of a man of undoubted ability a great speaker a great writer a great diplomatist and Billy Traynor for the first time in his life found himself in the presence of one whose claims to distinction stood upon the lofty basis of personal superiority Now though bashful ness was not the chief characteristic of his nature he really felt abashed and timid as he drew near the bed and shrank under the quick but searching glance of the sick man s cold gray eyes Place a chair and leave us Fritz said Sir Horace and then turning slowly round smiled as he said I m happy to make your acquaintance sir My friend Lord Glencore has told me with what skill you treated him and I embrace the fortunate occasion to profit by your professional ability I m your humble slave sir said Billy with a deep rich brogue and the manner of the speaker and his accent seemed so to surprise Upton that he continued to stare at him fixedly for some seconds without speaking You studied in Scotland I believe said he with one of the most engaging smiles while he hazarded the question Indeed then I did not sir said Billy with a heavy sigh all I know of the ars medicatrix I picked up currendo per campos as one may say vagabondizing through life and watching my opportunities Nature gave me the Hippocratic turn and I did my best to improve it So that you never took out a regular diploma said Sir Horace with another and still blander smile Sorra one sir I m a doctor just as a man is a poet by sheer janius T is the study of nature makes both one and the other that is when there s the raal stuff the divinus afflatus inside Without you have that you re only a rhymester or a quack You would then trace a parallel between them said Upton graciously To be sure sir Ould Heyric says that the poet and the physician is one For he who reads the clouded skies And knows the utterings of the deep Can surely see in human eyes The sorrows that so heart locked sleep The human system is just a kind of universe of its own and the very same faculties that investigate the laws of nature in one case is good in the other I don t think the author of King Arthur supports your theory said Upton gently Blackmoor was an ass but maybe he was as great a bosthoon in physic as in poetry rejoined Billy promptly Well Doctor said Sir Horace with one of those plaintive sighs in which he habitually opened the narrative of his own suffering let us descend to meaner things and talk of myself You see before you one who in some degree is the reproach of medicine That file of prescriptions beside you will show that I have consulted almost every celebrity in Europe and that I have done so unsuccessfully it is only necessary that you should look on these worn looks these wasted fingers this sickly feeble frame Vouchsafe me a patient hearing for a few moments while I give you some insight into one of the most intricate cases perhaps that has ever engaged the faculty It is not our intention to follow Sir Horace through his statement which in reality comprised a sketch of half the ills that the flesh is heir to Maladies of heart brain liver lungs the nerves the arteries even the bones contributed their aid to swell the dreary catalogue which indeed contained the usual contradictions and exaggerations incidental to such histories We could not assuredly expect from our reader the patient attention with which Billy listened to this narrative Never by a word did he interrupt the description not even a syllable escaped him as he sat and even when Sir Horace had finished speaking he remained with slightly drooped head and clasped hands in deep meditation It s a strange thing said he at last but the more I see of the aristocracy the more I m convinced that they ought to have doctors for themselves alone just as they have their own tailors and coachmakers chaps that could devote themselves to the study of physic for the peerage and never think of any other disorders but them that befall people of rank Your mistake Sir Horace was in consulting the regular middle class practitioner who invariably imagined there must be a disease to treat And you set me down as a hypochondriac then said Upton smiling Nothing of the kind You have a malady sure enough but nothing organic Tis the oceans of tinctures the sieves full of pills the quarter casks of bitters you re takin has played the divil with you The human machine is like a clock and it depends on the proportion the parts bear to each other whether it keeps time You may make the spring too strong or the chain too thick or the balance too heavy for the rest of the works and spoil everything just by over security That s what your doctors was doing with their tonics and cordials They didn t see here s a poor washy frame with a wake circulation and no vigor If we nourish him his heart will go quicker to be sure but what will his brain be at There s the rub His brain will begin to go fast too and already it s going the pace T is soothin and calmin you want allaying the irritability of an irrascible fretful nature always on the watch for self torment Say bathin early hours a quiet mopin kind of life that would maybe tend to torpor and sleepiness them s the first things you need and for exercise a little work in the garden that you d take interest in And no physic asked Sir Horace Sorra screed not as much as a powder or a draught barrin said he suddenly catching the altered expression of the sick man s face a little mixture of hyoscyamus I ll compound for you myself This and friction over the region of the heart with a mild embrocation is all my tratement And you have hopes of my recovery asked Sir Horace faintly My name isn t Billy Traynor if I d not send you out of this hale and hearty before two months I read you like a printed book You really give me great confidence for I perceive you understand the tone of my temperament Let us try this same embrocation at once I ll most implicitly obey you in everything My head on a block then but I ll cure you said Billy who determined that no scruples on his side should mar the trust reposed in him by the patient But you must give yourself entirely up to me not only as to your eatin and drinkin but your hours of recreation and study exercise amusement and all must be at my biddin It is the principle of harmony between the moral and physical nature constitutes the whole sacret of my system To be stimulatin the nerves and lavin the arteries dormant is like playing a jig to minuet time all must move in simultaneous action and the cerebellum the great flywheel of the whole must be made to keep orderly time D ye mind I follow you with great interest said Sir Horace to whose subtle nature there was an intense pleasure in the thought of having discovered what he deemed a man of original genius under this unpromising exterior There is but one bar to these arrangements I must leave this at once I ought to go to day I must be off to morrow Then I ll not take the helm when I can t pilot you through the shoals said Billy To begin my system and see you go away before I developed my grand invigoratin arcanum would be only to destroy your confidence in an elegant discovery Were I only as certain as you seem to be began Sir Horace and then stopped You d stay and be cured you were goin to say Well if you did n t feel that same trust in me you d be right to go for it is that very confidence that turns the balance Ould Babbington used to say that between a good physician and a bad one there was just the difference between a pound and a guinea But between the one you trust and the one you don t there s all the way between Billy Traynor and the Bank of Ireland On that score every advantage is with you said Upton with all the winning grace of his incomparable manner and I must now bethink me how I can manage to prolong my stay here And with this he fell into a musing fit letting drop occasionally some stray word or two to mark the current of his thoughts The Duke of Headwater s on the thirteenth Ardroath Castle the Tuesday after More hampton for the Derby day These easily disposed of Prince Boratinsky about that Warsaw affair must be attended to a letter yes a letter will keep that question open Lady Grencliffe is a difficulty if I plead illness she ll say I m not strong enough to go to Russia I ll think it over And with this he rested his head on his hands and sank into profound reflection Yes Doctor said he at length as though summing up his secret calculations health is the first requisite If you can but restore me you will be I am above the mere personal consideration you will be the means of conferring an important service on the King s Government A variety of questions some of them deep and intricate are now pending of which I alone understand the secret meaning A new hand would infallibly spoil the game and yet in my present condition how could I hear the fatigues of long interviews ministerial deliberations incessant note writing and evasive conversations Utterly unpossible exclaimed the doctor As you observe it is utterly impossible rejoined Sir Horace with one of his own dubious smiles and then in a manner more natural resumed We public men have the sad necessity of concealing the sufferings on which others trade for sympathy We must never confess to an ache or a pain lest it be rumored that we are unequal to the fatigues of office and so is it that we are condemned to run the race with broken health and shattered frame alleging all the while that no exertion is too much no effort too great for us And maybe after all it s that very struggle that makes you more than common men said Billy There s a kind of irritability that keeps the brain at stretch and renders it equal to higher efforts than ever accompany good everyday health Dyspepsia is the soul of a prose writer and a slight ossification of the aortic valves is a great help to the imagination Do you really say so asked Sir Horace with all the implicit confidence with which he accepted any marvel that had its origin in medicine Don t you feel it yourself sir asked Billy Do you ever pen a reply to a knotty state paper as nately as when you ve the heartburn are you ever as epigrammatic as when you re driven to a listen slipper and when do you give a minister a jobation as purtily as when you are laborin under a slight indigestion Not that it would sarve a man to be permanently in gout or the colic but for a spurt like a cavalry charge there s nothing like eatin something that disagrees with you An ingenious notion said the diplomatist smiling And now I ll take my lave said Billy rising I m going out to gather some mountain colchicum and sorrel to make a diaphoretic infusion and I ve to give Master Charles his Greek lesson and blister the colt he s thrown out a bone spavin and after that Handy Care s daughter has the shakin ague and the smith at the forge is to be bled all before two o dock when the lord sends for me But the rest of the day and the night too I m your honor s obaydient And with a low bow repeated in a more reverential man ner at the door Billy took his leave and retired CHAPTER X A DISCLOSURE Have you seen Upton asked Glencore eagerly of Harcourt as he entered his bedroom Yes he vouchsafed me an audience during his toilet just as the old kings of France were accustomed to honor a favorite with one And is he full of miseries at the dreary place the rough fare and deplorable resources of this wild spot Quite the reverse he is charmed with everything and everybody The view from his window is glorious the air has already invigorated him For years he has not breakfasted with the same appetite and he finds that of all the places he has ever chanced upon this is the one veritable exact spot which suits him This is very kind on his part said Glencore with a faint smile Will the humor last Harcourt That is the question I trust it will at least it may well endure for the short period he means to stay although already he has extended that and intends remaining till next week Better still said Glencore with more animation of voice and manner I was already growing nervous about the brief space in which I was to crowd in all that I want to say to him but if he will consent to wait a day or two I hope I shall be equal to it In his present mood there is no impatience to be off on the contrary he has been inquiring as to all the available means of locomotion and by what convenience he is to make various sea and land excursions We have no carriage we have no roads even said Glencore peevishly He knows all that but he is concerting measures about a certain turf kish I think they call it which by the aid of pillows to lie on and donkeys to drag can be made a most useful vehicle while for longer excursions he has suggested a conveniency of wheels and axles to the punt rendering it equally eligible on land or water Then he has been designing great improvements in horticulture and giving orders about a rake a spade and a hoe for himself I m quite serious said Harcourt as Glencore smiled with a kind of droll incredulity It is perfectly true and as he hears that the messenger occasionally crosses the lough to the post when there are no letters there he hints at a little simple telegraph for Leenane which should announce what the mail contains and which might be made useful to convey other intelligence In fact all my changes here will be as for nothing to his reforms and between us you ll not know your own house again if you even be able to live in it You have already done much to make it more habitable Harcourt said Glencore feelingly and if I had not the grace to thank you for it I m not the less grateful To say truth my old friend I half doubted whether it was an act of friendship to attach me ever so lightly to a life of which I am well weary Ceasing as I have done for years back to feel interest in anything I dread whatever may again recall me to the world of hopes and fears that agitated sea of passion wherein I have no longer vigor to contend To speak to me then of plans to carry out schemes to accomplish was to point to a future of activity and exertion and here he dropped his voice to a deep and mournful tone can have but one future the dark and dreary one before the grave Harcourt was too deeply impressed by the solemnity of these words to venture on a reply and he sat silently contemplating the sorrow struck but placid features of the sick man There is nothing to prevent a man struggling and successfully too against mere adverse fortune continued Glencore I feel at times that if I had been suddenly reduced to actual beggary left without a shilling in the world there are many ways in which I could eke out subsistence A great defeat to my personal ambition I could resist The casualty that should exclude me from a proud position and public life I could bear up against with patience and I hope with dignity Loss of fortune loss of influence loss of station loss of health even dearer than them all can be borne There is but one intolerable ill one that no time alleviates no casuistry diminishes loss of honor Ay Harcourt rank and riches do little for him who feels himself the inferior of the meanest that elbows him in a crowd and the man whose name is a scoff and a jibe has but one part to fill to make himself forgotten I hope I m not deficient in a sense of personal honor Glencore said Harcourt but I must say that I think your reasoning on this point is untenable and wrong Let us not speak more of it said Glencore faintly I know not how I have been led to allude to what it is better to bear in secret than to confide even to friendship and he pressed the strong fingers of the other as he spoke in his own feeble grasp Leave me now Harcourt and send Upton here It may be that the time is come when I shall be able to speak to him You are too weak to day Glencore too much agitated Pray defer this interview No Harcourt these are my moments of strength The little energy now left to me is the fruit of strong excitement Heaven knows how I shall be to morrow Harcourt made no further opposition but left the room in search of Upton It was full an hour later when Sir Horace Upton made his appearance in Glencore s chamber attired in a purple dressing gown profusely braided with gold loose trousers as richly brocaded and a pair of real Turkish slippers resplendent with costly embroidery a small fez of blue velvet with a deep gold tassel covered the top of his head at either side of which his soft silky hair descended in long massy waves apparently negligently but in reality arranged with all the artistic regard to effect of a consummate master From the gold girdle at his waist depended a watch a bunch of keys a Turkish purse an embroidered tobacco bag a gorgeously chased smelling bottle and a small stiletto with a topaz handle In one hand he carried a meerschaum the other leaned upon a cane and with all the dependence of one who could not walk without its aid The greeting was cordial and affectionate on both sides and when Sir Horace after a variety of preparations to ensure his comfort at length seated himself beside the bed his features beamed with all their wonted gentleness and kindness I m charmed at what Harcourt has been telling me Upton said Glencore and that you really can exist in all the savagery of this wild spot I m in ecstasy with the place Glencore My memory cannot recall the same sensations of health and vigor I have experienced since I came here Your cook is first rate your fare is exquisite the quiet is a positive blessing and that queer creature your doctor is a very remarkable genius So he is said Glencore gravely One of those men of original mould who leave cultivation leagues behind and arrive at truth by a bound He certainly treated me with considerable skill I m satisfied of it his conversation is replete with shrewd and intelligent observation and he seems to have studied his art more like a philosopher than a mere physician of the schools And depend upon it Glencore the curative art must mainly depend upon the secret instinct which divines the malady less by the rigid rules of acquired skill than by that prerogative of genius which however exerted arrives at its goal at once Our conversation had scarcely lasted a quarter of an hour when he revealed to me the exact seat of all my sufferings and the most perfect picture of my temperament And then his suggestions as to treatment were all so reasonable so well argued A clever fellow no doubt of it said Glencore But he is far more than that Glencore Cleverness is only a manufacturing quality that man supplies the raw article also It has often struck me as very singular that such heads are not found in our class they belong to another order altogether It is possible that the stimulus of necessity engenders the greatest of all efforts calling to the operations of the mind the continued strain for contrivance and thus do we find the most remarkable men are those every step of whose knowledge has been gained with a struggle I suspect you are right said Glencore and that our old system of school education wherein all was rough rugged and difficult turned out better men than the present day habit of everything made easy and everybody made any thing Flippancy is the characteristic of our age and we owe it to our teaching By the way what do you mean to do with Charley said Upton Do you intend him for Eton I scarcely know I make plans only to abandon them said Glencore gloomily I m greatly struck with him He is one of those fellows however who require the nicest management and who either rise superior to all around them or drop down into an indolent dreamy existence conscious of power but too bashful or too lazy to exert it You have hit him off Upton with all your own subtlety and it was to speak of that boy I have been so eager to see you Glencore paused as he said these words and passed his hand over his brow as though to prepare himself for the task before him Upton said he at last in a voice of deep and solemn meaning the resolution I am about to impart to you is not unlikely to meet your strenuous opposition you will be disposed to show me strong reasons against it on every ground you may refuse me that amount of assistance I shall ask of you to carry out my purpose but if your arguments were all unanswerable and if your denial to aid me was to sever the old friendship between us I d still persist in my determination For more than two years the project has been before my mind The long hours of the day the longer ones of the night have found me deep in the consideration of it I have repeated over to myself everything that my ingenuity could suggest against it I have said to my own heart all that my worst enemy could utter were he to read the scheme and detect my plan I have done more I have struggled with myself to abandon it but in vain My heart is linked to it it forms the one sole tie that attaches me to life Without it the apathy that I feel stealing over me would be complete and my existence become a mournful dream In a word Upton all is passionless within me save one sentiment and I drag on life merely for a Vendetta Upton shook his head mournfully as the other paused here and said This is disease Glencore Be it so the malady is beyond cure said he sternly Trust me it is not so said Upton gently you listened to my persuasions on a more Ay that I did cried Glencore interrupting and have I ever ceased to rue the day I did so But for your arguments and I had not lived this life of bitter self reproaching misery but for you and my vengeance had been sated ere this Remember Glencore said the other that you had obtained all the world has decreed as satisfaction He met you and received your fire you shot him through the chest not mortally it is true but to carry to his grave a painful lingering disease To have insisted on his again meeting you would have been little less than murder No man could have stood your friend in such a quarrel I told you so then I repeat it now he could not fire at you what then was it possible for you to do Shoot him shoot him like a dog cried Glencore while his eyes gleamed like the glittering eyes of an enraged beast You talk of his lingering life of pain think of mine have some sympathy for what I suffer Would all the agony of his whole existence equal one hour of the torment he has bequeathed to me its shame and ignominy These are things which passion can never treat of my dear Glencore Passion alone can feel them said the other sternly Keep subtleties for those who use like weapons As for me no casuistry is needed to tell me I am dishonored and just as little to tell me I must be avenged If you think differently it were better not to discuss this question further between us but I did think I could have reckoned upon you for I felt you had barred my first chance of a vengeance Now then for your plan Glencore said Upton who with all the dexterity of his calling preferred opening a new channel in the discussion to aggravating difficulties by a further opposition I must rid myself of her There s my plan cried Glencore savagely You have it all in that resolution Of no avail is it that I have separated my fortune from hers so long as she bears my name and renders it infamous in every city of Europe Is it to you who live in the world who mix with men of every country that I need tell this If a man cannot throw off such a shame he must sink under it But you told me you had an unconquerable aversion to the notion of seeking a divorce So I had so I have The indelicate the ignominious course of a trial at law with all its shocking exposure would be worse than a thousand deaths To survive the suffering of all the licensed ribaldry of some gowned coward aspersing one s honor calumniating inventing and when invention failed suggesting motives the very thought of which in secret had driven a man to madness To endure this to read it to know it went published over the wide globe till one s shame became the gossip of millions and then with a verdict extorted from pity damages awarded to repair a broken heart and a sullied name to carry this disgrace before one s equals to be again discussed sifted and cavilled at No Upton this poor shattered brain would give way under such a trial to compass it in mere fancy is already nigh to madness It must be by other means than these that I attain my object The terrible energy with which he spoke actually frightened Upton who fancied that his reason had already begun to show signs of decline The world has decreed resumed Glencore that in these conflicts all the shame shall be the husband s but it shall not be so here She shall have her share ay and by Heaven not the smaller share either Why what would you do asked Upton eagerly Deny my marriage call her my mistress cried Glencore in a voice shaken with passion and excitement But your boy your son Glencore He shall be a bastard You may hold up your hands in horror and look with all your best got up disgust at such a scheme but if you wish to see me swear to accomplish it I ll do so now before you ay on my knees before you When we eloped from her father s house at Castellamare we were married by a priest at Capri of the marriage no trace exists The more legal ceremony was performed before you as Charge d Affaires at Naples of that I have the registry here nor except my courier Sanson is there a living witness If you determine to assert it you will do so without a fragment of proof since every document that could substantiate it is in my keeping You shall see them for yourself She is therefore in my power and will any man dare to tell me how I should temper that power But your boy Glencore your boy Is my boy s station in the world a prouder one by being the son of the notorious Lady Glencore or as the offspring of a nameless mistress What avail to him that he should have a title stained by her shame Where is he to go In what land is he to live where her infamy has not reached Is it not a thousand times better that he enter life ignoble and unknown to start in the world s race with what he may of strength and power than drag on an unhonored existence shunned by his equals and only welcome where it is disgrace to find companionship But you surely have never contemplated all the consequences of this rash resolve It is the extinction of an ancient title the alienation of a great estate when once you have declared your boy illegitimate He is a beggar I know it the penalty he must pay is a heavy one But think of her Upton think of the haughty Viscountess revelling in splendor and even in all her shame the flattered welcomed guest of that rotten corrupt society she lives in Imagine her in all the pride of wealth and beauty sought after adulated worshipped as she is suddenly struck down by the brand of this disgrace and left upon the world without fortune without rank without even a name To be shunned like a leper by the very meanest of those it had once been an honor when she recognized them Picture to yourself this woman degraded to the position of all that is most vile and contemptible She that scarcely condescended to acknowledge as her equals the best born and the highest sunk down to the hopeless infamy of a mistress They tell me she laughed on the day I fainted at seeing her entering the San Carlos at Naples laughed as they carried me down the steps into the fresh air Will she laugh now think you Shall I be called Le Pauvre Sire when she hears this Was there ever a vengeance more terrible more complete Again I say Glencore you have no right to involve others in the penalty of her fault Laying aside every higher motive you can have no more right to deny your boy s claim to his rank and fortune than I or any one else It cannot be alienated nor extinguished by his birth he became the heir to your title and estates He has no birth sir he is a bastard who shall deny it You may added he after a second s pause but where s your proof Is not every probability as much against you as all documentary evidence since none will ever believe that I could rob myself of the succession and make over my fortune to Heaven knows what remote relation And do you expect me to become a party to this crime asked Upton gravely You balked me in one attempt at vengeance and I think you owe me a reparation Glencore said Upton solemnly we are both of us men of the world men who have seen life in all its varied aspects sufficiently to know the hollowness of more than half the pretension men trade upon as principle we have witnessed mean actions and the very lowest motives amongst the highest in station and it is not for either of us to affect any overstrained estimate of men s honor and good faith but I say to you in all sincerity that not alone do I refuse you all concurrence in the act you meditate but I hold myself open to denounce and frustrate it You do cried Glencore wildly while with a bound he sat up in his bed grasping the curtain convulsively for support Be calm Glencore and listen to me patiently You declare that you will use the confidence of this morning against me cried Glencore while the lines in his face became indented more deeply and his bloodless lips quivered with passion You take your part with her I only ask that you would hear me You owe me four thousand five hundred pounds Sir Horace Upton said Glencore in a voice barely above a whisper but every accent of which was audible I know it Glencore said Upton calmly You helped me by a loan of that sum in a moment of great difficulty Your generosity went farther for you took what nobody else would my personal security Glencore made no reply but throwing back the bedclothes slowly and painfully arose and with tottering and uncertain steps approached a table With a trembling hand he unlocked a drawer and taking out a paper opened and scanned it over There s your bond sir said he with a hollow cavernous voice as he threw it into the fire and crushed it down into the flames with a poker There is now nothing between us You are free to do your worst And as he spoke a few drops of dark blood trickled from his nostril and he fell senseless upon the floor CHAPTER XI SOME LIGHTS AND SHADOWS OF DIPLOMATIC LIFE There is a trait in the lives of great diplomatists of which it is just possible some one or other of my readers may not have heard which is that none of them have ever attained to any great eminence without an attachment we can find no better word for it to some woman of superior understanding who has united within herself great talents for society with a high and soaring ambition They who only recognize in the world of politics the dry details of ordinary parliamentary business poor law questions sanitary rules railroad bills and colonial grants can form but a scanty notion of the excitement derived from the high interests of party and the great game played by about twenty mighty gamblers with the whole world for the table and kingdoms for counters In this grand role women perform no ignoble part nay it were not too much to say that theirs is the very motive power of the whole vast machinery Had we any right to step beyond the limits of our story for illustration it would not be difficult to quote names enough to show that we are speaking not at hazard but from book and that great events derive far less of their impulse from the lords than from the ladies of creation Whatever be the part they take in these contests their chief attention is ever directed not to the smaller battle field of home questions but to the greater and wider campaign of international politics Men may wrangle and hair split and divide about a harbor bill or a road cession but women occupy themselves in devising how thrones may be shaken and dynasties disturbed how frontiers may be changed and nationalities trafficked for strange as it may seem the stupendous incidents which mould human destinies are more under the influence of passion and intrigue than the commonest events of every day life Our readers may and not very unreasonably begin to suspect that it was in some moment of abstraction we wrote Glencore at the head of these pages and that these speculations are but the preface to some very abstruse reflections upon the political condition of Europe But no they are simply intended as a prelude to the fact that Sir Horace Upton was not exempt from the weakness of his order and that he too reposed his trust upon a woman s judgment The name of his illustrious guide was the Princess Sabloukoff by birth a Pole but married to a Russian of vast wealth and high family from whom she separated early in life to mingle in the world with all the prestige of position riches and greater than either extreme beauty and a manner of such fascination as made her name of European celebrity When Sir Horace first met her he was the junior member of our Embassy at Naples and she the distinguished leader of fashion in that city We are not about to busy ourselves with the various narratives which professed to explain her influence at Court or the secret means to which she owed her ascendency over royal highnesses and her sway over cardinals Enough that she possessed such and that the world knew it The same success attended her at Vienna and at Paris She was courted and sought after everywhere and if her arrival was not feted with the public demonstrations that await royalty it was assuredly an event recognized with all that could flatter her vanity or minister to her self esteem When Sir Horace was presented to her as an Attache she simply bowed and smiled He renewed his acquaintance some ten years later as a Secretary when she vouchsafed to say she remembered him A third time after a lapse of years he came before her as a Charge d Affaires when she conversed with him and lastly when time had made him a Minister and with less generosity had laid its impress upon herself she gave him her hand and said My dear Horace how charming to see an old friend if you will be good enough to let me call you so And he was so he accepted the friendship as frankly as it was proffered He knew that time was when he could have no pretension to this distinction but the beautiful Princess was no longer young the fascinations she had wielded were already a kind of Court tradition archdukes and ambassadors were no more her slaves nor was she the terror of jealous queens and Court favorites Sir Horace knew all this but he also knew that she being such his ambition had never dared to aspire to her friendship and it was only in her days of declining fortune that he could hope for such distinction All this may seem very strange and very odd dear reader but we live in very strange and very odd times and more than one half the world is only living on second hand second hand shawls and second hand speeches second hand books and Court suits and opinions are all rife and why not second hand friendships Now the friendship between a bygone beauty of forty and we will not say how many more years and a hackneyed half disgusted man of the world of the same age is a very curious contract There is no love in it as little is there any strong tie of esteem but there is a wonderful bond of self interest and mutual convenience Each seems to have at last found one that understands him similarity of pursuit has engendered similarity of taste They have each seen the world from exactly the same point of view and they have come out of it equally heart wearied and tired stored with vast resources of social knowledge and with a keen insight into every phase of that complex machinery by which one half the world cheats the other Madame de Sabloukoff was still handsome she had far more than what is ill naturedly called the remains of good looks She had a brilliant complexion lustrous dark eyes and a profusion of the most beautiful hair She was besides a most splendid dresser Her toilet was the very perfection of taste and if a little inclining to over magnificence not the less becoming to one whose whole air and bearing assumed something of queenly dignity In the world of society there is a very great prestige attends those who have at some one time played a great part in life The deposed king the ex minister the banished general and even the bygone beauty receive a species of respectful homage which the wider world without doors is not always ready to accord them Good breeding in fact concedes what mere justice might deny and they who have to fall back upon souvenirs for their greatness always find their advantage in associating with the class whose prerogative is good manners The Princess Sabloukoff was not however one of those who can live upon the interest of a bygone fame She saw that when the time of coquetry and its fascinations has passed still with faculties like hers there was yet a great game to be played Hitherto she had only studied characters now she began to reflect upon events The transition was an easy one to which her former knowledge contributed largely its assistance There was scarcely a royalty hardly a leading personage in Europe she did not know personally and well She had lived in intimacy with ministers and statesmen and great politicians She knew them in all that life of the salon where men alternately expand into frankness and practise the wily devices of their crafty callings She had seen them in all the weaknesses too of inferior minds eager after small objects tormented by insignificant cares They who habitually dealt with these mighty personages only beheld them in their dignity of station or surrounded by the imposing accessories of office What an advantage then to regard them closer and nearer to be aware of their shortcomings and acquainted with the secret springs of their ambitions The Princess and Sir Horace very soon saw that each needed the other When Robert Macaire accidentally met an accomplished gamester who turned the king as often as he did and could reciprocate every trick and artifice with him he threw down the cards saying Embrassons nous nous sommes freres Now the illustration is a very ignoble one but it conveys no very inexact idea of the bond which united these two distinguished individuals Sir Horace was one of those fine acute intelligences which may be gapped and blunted if applied to rough work but are splendid instruments where you would cut cleanly and cut deep She saw this at once He too recognized in her a wonderful knowledge of life joined to vast powers of employing it with profit No more was wanting to establish a friendship between them Dispositions must be to a certain degree different between those who are to live together as friends but tastes must be alike Theirs were so They had the same veneration for the same things the same regard for the same celebrities and the same contempt for the small successes which were engaging the minds of many around them If the Princess had a real appreciation of the fine abilities of Sir Horace he estimated at their full value all the resources of her wondrous tact and skill and the fascinations which even yet surrounded her Have we said enough to explain the terms of this alliance or must we make one more confession and own that her insidious praise a flattery too delicate and fine ever to be committed to absolute eulogy convinced Sir Horace that she alone of all the world was able to comprehend the vast stores of his knowledge and the wide measure of his capacity as a statesman In the great game of statecraft diplomatists are not above looking into each other s hands but this must always be accomplished by means of a confederate How terribly alike are all human rogueries whether the scene be a conference at Vienna or the tent of a thimblerig at Ascot La Sabloukoff was unrivalled in the art She knew how to push raillery and persiflage to the very frontiers of truth and even peep over and see what lay beyond Sir Horace traded on the material with which she supplied him and acquired the reputation of being all that was crafty and subtle in diplomacy How did Upton know this Whence came he by that What mysterious source of information is he possessed of Who could have revealed such a secret to him were questions often asked in that dreary old drawing room of Downing Street where men s destinies are shaped and the fate of millions decided from four o clock to six of an afternoon Often and often were the measures of the Cabinet shaped by the tidings which arrived with all the speed of a foreign courier over and over again were the speeches in Parliament based upon information received from him It has even happened that the news from his hand has caused the telegraph of the Admiralty to signalize the Thunderer to put to sea with all haste In a word he was the trusted agent of our Government whether ruled by a Whig or a Tory and his despatches were ever regarded as a sure warranty for action The English Minister at a Foreign Court labors under one great disadvantage which is that his policy and all the consequences that are to follow it are rarely if ever shaped with any reference to the state of matters then existing in his own country Absorbed as he is in great European questions how can he follow with sufficient attention the course of events at home or recognize in the signs and tokens of the division list the changeful fortunes of party He may be advising energy when the cry is all for temporizing counselling patience and submission when the nation is eager for a row recommend religious concessions in the very week that Exeter Hall is denouncing toleration or actually suggesting aid to a Government that a popular orator has proclaimed to be everything that is unjust and ignominious It was Sir Horace Upton s fortune to have fallen into one of these embarrassments He had advised the Home Government to take some measures or at least look with favor on certain movements of the Poles in Russia in order the better to obtain some concessions then required from the Cabinet of the Czar The Premier did not approve of the suggestion nor was it like to meet acceptance at home We were in a pro Russian fever at the moment Some mob disturbances at Norwich a Chartist meeting at Stockport and something else in Wales had frightened the nation into a hot stage of conservatism and never was there such an ill chosen moment to succor Poles or awaken dormant nationalities Upton s proposal was rejected He was even visited with one of those disagreeable acknowledgments by which the Foreign Office reminds a speculative minister that he is going ultra crepidam When an envoy is snubbed he always asks for leave of absence If the castigation be severe he invariably on his return to England goes to visit the Leader of the Opposition This is the ritual Sir Horace however only observed it in half He came home but after his first morning s attendance at the Foreign Office he disappeared none saw or heard of him He knew well all the value of mystery and he accordingly disappeared from public view altogether When therefore Harcourt s letter reached him proposing that he should visit Glencore the project came most opportunely and that he only accepted it for a day was in the spirit of his habitual diplomacy since he then gave himself all the power of an immediate departure or permitted the option of remaining gracefully in defiance of all pre engage ments and all plans to be elsewhere We have been driven for the sake of this small fact to go a great way round in our history but we promise our readers that Sir Horace was one of those people whose motives are never tracked without a considerable detour The reader knows now why he was at Glencore he already knew how The terrible interview with Glencore brought back a second relapse of greater violence than the first and it was nigh a fortnight ere he was pronounced out of danger It was a strange life that Harcourt and Upton led in that dreary interval Guests of one whose life was in utmost peril they met in that old gallery each day to talk in half whispered sentences over the sick man s case and his chances of recovery Harcourt frankly told Upton that the first relapse was the consequence of a scene between Glencore and himself Upton made no similar confession He reflected deeply however over all that had passed and came to the conclusion that in Glencore s present condition opposition might prejudice his chance of recovery but never avail to turn him from his project He also set himself to study the boy s character and found it in all respects the very type of his father s Great bashfulness united to great boldness timidity and distrust were there side by side with a rash impetuous nature that would hesitate at nothing in pursuit of an object Pride however was the great principle of his being the good and evil motive of all that was in him He had pride on every subject His name his rank his station a consciousness of natural quickness a sense of aptitude to learn whatever came before him all gave him the same feeling of pride There s a deal of good in that lad said Harcourt to Upton one evening as the boy had left the room I like his strong affection for his father and that unbounded faith he seems to have in Glencore s being better than every one else in the world It is an excellent religion my dear Harcourt if it could only last said the diplomat smiling amiably And why should n t it last asked the other impatiently Just because nothing lasts that has its origin in ignorance The boy has seen nothing of life has had no opportunity for forming a judgment or instituting a comparison between any two objects The first shot that breaches that same fortress of belief down will come the whole edifice You d give a lad to the Jesuits then to be trained up in every artifice and distrust Far from it Harcourt I think their system a mistake all through The science of life must be self learned and it is a slow acquisition All that education can do is to prepare the mind to receive it Now to employ the first years of a boy s life by storing him with prejudices is just to encumber a vessel with a rotten cargo that she must throw overboard before she can load with a profitable freight And is it in that category you d class his love for his father asked the Colonel Of course not but any unnatural or exaggerated estimate of him is a great error to lead to an equally unfair depreciation when the time of deception is past To be plain Harcourt is that boy fitted to enter one of our great public schools stand the hard rough usage of his own equals and buffet it as you or I have done Why not or at least why should n t he become so after a month or two Just because in that same month or two he d either die broken hearted or plunge his knife into the heart of some comrade who insulted him Not a bit of it You don t know him at all Charley is a fine give and take fellow a little proud perhaps because he lives apart from all that are his equals Let Glencore just take courage to send him to Harrow or Rugby and my life on it but he ll be the manliest fellow in the school I ll undertake without Harrow or Rugby that the boy should become something even greater than that said Upton smiling Oh I know you sneer at my ideas of what a young fellow ought to be said Harcourt but somehow you did not neglect these same pursuits yourself You can shoot as well as most men and you ride better than any I know of One likes to do a little of everything Harcourt said Upton not at all displeased at this flattery and somehow it never suits a fellow who really feels that he has fair abilities to do anything badly so that it comes to this one does it well or not at all Now you never heard me touch the piano Never Just because I m only an inferior performer and so I only play when perfectly alone Egad if I could only master a waltz or one of the melodies I d be at it whenever any one would listen to me You re a good soul and full of amiability Harcourt said Upton but the words sounded very much as though he said You re a dear good sensible creature without an atom of self respect or esteem Indeed so conscious was Harcourt that the expression meant no compliment that he actually reddened and looked away At last he took courage to renew the conversation and said And what would you advise for the boy then I d scarcely lay down a system but I ll tell you what I would not do I d not bore him with mathematics I d not put his mind on the stretch in any direction I d not stifle the development of any taste that may be struggling within him but rather encourage and foster it since it is precisely by such an indication you ll get some clew to his nature Do you understand me I m not quite sure I do but I believe you d leave him to something like utter idleness What to you my dear Harcourt would be utter idleness I ve no doubt but not to him perhaps Again the Colonel looked mortified but evidently knew not how to resent this new sneer Well said he after a pause the lad will not require to be a genius So much the better for him probably at all events so much the better for his friends and all who are to associate with him Here he looked fixedly at Upton who smiled a most courteous acquiescence in the opinion a politeness that made poor Harcourt perfectly ashamed of his own rudeness and he continued hurriedly He ll have abundance of money The life Glencore leads here will be like a long minority to him A fine old name and title and the deuce is in it if he can t rub through life pleasantly enough with such odds I believe you are right after all Harcourt said Upton sighing and now speaking in a far more natural tone it is rubbing through with the best of us and no more If you mean that the process is a very irksome one I enter my dissent at once broke in Harcourt I m not ashamed to own that I like life prodigiously and if I be spared to say so I m sure I ll have the same story to tell fifteen or twenty years hence and yet I m not a genius No said Upton smiling a bland assent Nor a philosopher either said Harcourt irritated at the acknowledgment Certainly not chimed in Upton with another smile Nor have I any wish to be one or the other rejoined Harcourt now really provoked I know right well that if I were in trouble or difficulty to morrow if I wanted a friend to help me with a loan of some thousand pounds it is not to a genius or a philosopher I d look for the assistance It is ever a chance shot that explodes a magazine and so is it that a random speech is sure to hit the mark that has escaped all the efforts of skilful direction Upton winced and grew pale at these last words and he fixed his penetrating gray eyes upon the speaker with a keenness all his own Harcourt however bore the look without the slightest touch of uneasiness The honest Colonel had spoken without any hidden meaning nor had he the slightest intention of a personal application in his words Of this fact Upton appeared soon to be convinced for his features gradually recovered their wonted calmness How perfectly right you are my dear Harcourt said he mildly The man who expects to be happier by the possession of genius is like one who would like to warm himself through a burning glass Egad that is a great consolation for us slow fellows said Harcourt laughing and now what say you to a game at ecarte for I believe it is just the one solitary thing I am more than your match in I accept inferiority in a great many others said Upton blandly but I must decline the challenge for I have a letter to write and our post here starts at daybreak Well I d rather carry the whole bag than indite one of its contents said the Colonel rising and with a hearty shake of the hand he left the room A letter was fortunately not so great an infliction to Upton who opened his desk at once and with a rapid hand traced the following lines Mv dear Princess My last will have told you how and when I came here I wish I but knew in what way to explain why I still remain Imagine the dreariest desolation of Calabria in a climate of fog and sea drift sunless skies leafless trees impassable roads the out door comforts the joys within depending on a gloomy old house with a few gloomier inmates and a host on a sick bed Yet with all this I believe I am better the doctor a strange unsophisticated creature a cross between Galen and Caliban seems to have hit off what the great dons of science never could detect the true seat of my malady He says and he really reasons out his case ingeniously that the brain has been working for the inferior nerves not limiting itself to cerebral functions but actually performing the humbler office of muscular direction and so forth in fact a field marshal doing duty for a common soldier I almost fancy I can corroborate his view from internal sensations I have a kind of secret instinct that he is right Poor brain why it should do the work of another department with abundance of occupation of its own I cannot make out But to turn to something else This is not a bad refuge just now They cannot make out where I am and all the inquiries at my club are answered by a vague impression that I have gone back to Germany which the people at F O are aware is not the case I have already told you that my suggestion has been negatived in the Cabinet it was ill timed Allington says but I ventured to remind his Lordship that a policy requiring years to develop and more years still to push to a profitable conclusion is not to be reduced to the category of mere a propos measures He was vexed and replied weakly and angrily I rejoined and left him Next day he sent for me but my reply was I was leaving town and I left I don t want the Bath because it would be ill timed so that they must give me Vienna or be satisfied to see me in the House and the Opposition Your tidings of Brekenoff came exactly in the nick Allington said pompously that they were sure of him so I just said Ask him if they would like our sending a Consular Agent to Cracow It seems that he was so flurried by a fancied detection that he made a full acknowledgment of all But even at this Allington takes no alarm The malady of the Treasury benches is deafness with a touch of blindness What a cumbrous piece of bungling machinery is this boasted representative government of ours No promptitude no secrecy Everything debated and discussed and discouraged before begun every blot hit for an antagonist to profit by Even the characters of our public men exposed and their weaknesses displayed to view so that every state of Europe may see where to wound us and through whom There is no use in the Countess remaining here any longer the King never noticed her at the last ball she is angry at it and if she shows her irritation she ll spoil all I always thought Josephine would fail in England It is indeed a widely different thing to succeed in the small Courts of Germany and our great whirlpool of saint James You could do it my dear friend but where is the other dare attempt it Until I hear from you again I can come to no resolution One thing is clear they do not or they will not see the danger I have pointed out to them All the home policy of our country is drifting day by day towards a democracy how in the name of common sense then is our foreign policy to be maintained at the standard of the Holy Alliance What an absurd juxtaposition is there between popular rights and an alliance with the Czar This peril will overtake them one day or another and then to escape from national indignation the minister whoever he may be will be driven to make war But I can t wait for this and yet were I to resign my resignation would not embarrass them it would irritate and annoy but not disconcert Brekenoff will surely go home on leave You ought to meet him he is certain to be at Ems It is the refuge of disgraced diplomacy Try if something cannot be done with him He used to say formerly yours were the only dinners now in Europe He hates Allington This feeling and his love for white truffles are I believe the only clews to the man Be sure however that the truffles are Piedmontese they have a slight flavor of garlic rather agreeable than otherwise Like Josephine s lisp it is a defect that serves for a distinction The article in the Beau Monde was clever prettily written and even well worked out but state affairs are never really well treated save by those who conduct them One must have played the game himself to understand all the nice subtleties of the contest These your mere reviewer or newspaper scribe never attains to and then he has no reserves none of those mysterious concealments that are to negotiations like the eloquent pauses of conversation the moment when dialogue ceases and the real interchange of ideas begins The fine touch the keen apercu belongs alone to those who have had to exercise these same qualities in the treatment of great questions and hence it is that though the Public be often much struck and even enlightened by the powerful article or the able leader the Statesman is rarely taught anything by the journalist save the force and direction of public opinion I had a deal to say to you about poor Glencore whom you tell me you remember but how to say it He is broken hearted literally broken hearted by her desertion of him It was one of those ill assorted leagues which cannot hold together Why they did not see this and make the best of it sensibly dispassionately even amicably it is difficult to say An Englishman it would seem must always hate his wife if she cannot love him and after all how involuntary are all affections and what a severe penalty is this for an unwitting offence He ponders over this calamity just as if it were the crushing stroke by which a man s whole career was to be finished forever The stupidity of all stupidities is in these cases to fly from the world and avoid society By doing this a man rears a barrier he never can repass he proclaims aloud his sentiment of the injury quite forgetting all the offence he is giving to the hundred and fifty others who in the same predicament as himself are by no means disposed to turn hermits on account of it Men make revolutionary governments smash dynasties transgress laws but they cannot oppose convenances I need scarcely say that there is nothing to be gained by reason ing with him He has worked himself up to a chronic fury and talks of vengeance all day long like a Corsican For company here I have an old brother officer of my days of tinsel and pipe clay an excellent creature whom I amuse myself by tormenting There is also Glencore s boy a strange dreamy kind of haughty fellow an exaggeration of his father in disposition but with good abilities These are not the elements of much social agreeability but you know dear friend how little I stand in need of what is called company Your last letter charming as it was has afforded me all the companionship I could desire I have re read it till I know it by heart I could almost chide you for that delightful little party in my absence but of course it was as all you ever do is perfectly right and after all I am perhaps not sorry that you had those people when I was away so that we shall be more chez nous when we meet But when is that to be Who can tell My medico insists upon five full weeks for my cure Allington is very likely in his present temper to order me back to my post You seem to think that you must be in Berlin when Seckendorf arrives so that But I will not darken the future by gloomy forebodings I could leave this that is if any urgency required it at once but if possible it is better I should remain at least a little longer My last meeting with Glencore was unpleasant Poor fellow his temper is not what it used to be and he is forgetful of what is due to one whose nerves are in the sad state of mine You shall hear all my complainings when we meet dear Princess and with this I kiss your hand begging you to accept all mes hommages et mon estime H U Your letter must be addressed Leenane Ireland Your last had only Glencore on it and not very legible either so that it made what I wished I could do the tour of Scotland before reaching me Sir Horace read over his letter carefully as though it had been a despatch and when he had done folded it up with an air of satisfaction He had said nothing that he wished unsaid and he had mentioned a little about everything he desired to touch upon He then took his drops from a queer looking little phial he carried about with him and having looked at his face in a pocket glass he half closed his eyes in revery Strange confused visions were they that flitted through his brain Thoughts of ambition the most daring fancies about health speculations in politics finance religion literature the arts society all came and went Plans and projects jostled each other at every instant Now his brow would darken and his thin lips close tightly as some painful impression crossed him now again a smile a slight laugh even betrayed the passing of some amusing conception It was easy to see how such a nature could suffice to itself and how little he needed of that give and take which companionship supplies He could to steal a figure from our steam language he could bank his fires and await any emergency and while scarcely consuming any fuel prepare for the most trying demand upon his powers A hasty movement of feet overhead and the sound of voices talking loudly aroused him from his reflections while a servant entered abruptly to say that Lord Glencore wished to see him immediately Is his Lordship worse asked Upton No sir but he was very angry with the young lord this evening about something and they say that with the passion he opened the bandage on his head and set the vein a bleed ing again Billy Traynor is there now trying to stop it I ll go upstairs said Sir Horace rising and beginning to fortify himself with caps and capes and comforters precautions that he never omitted when moving from one room to the other CHAPTER XII A NIGHT AT SEA Glencore s chamber presented a scene of confusion and dismay as Upton entered The sick man had torn off the bandage from his temples and so roughly as to reopen the half closed artery and renew the bleeding Not alone the bedclothes and the curtains but the faces of the attendants around him were stained with blood which seemed the more ghastly from contrast with their pallid cheeks They moved hurriedly to and fro scarcely remembering what they were in search of and evidently deeming his state of the greatest peril Traynor the only one whose faculties were unshaken by the shock sat quietly beside the bed his fingers firmly compressed upon the orifice of the vessel while with the other hand he motioned to them to keep silence Glencore lay with closed eyes breathing long and labored inspirations and at times convulsed by a slight shivering His face and even his lips were bloodless and his eyelids of a pale livid hue So terribly like the approach of death was his whole appearance that Upton whispered in the doctor s ear Is it over Is he dying No Upton said Glencore for with the acute hearing of intense nervousness he had caught the words It is not so easy to die There now no more talkin no discoorsin azy and quiet is now the word Bind it up and leave me leave me with him and Glencore pointed to Upton I dar n t move out of this spot said Billy addressing Upton You d have the blood coming out per saltim if I took away my finger You must be patient Glencore said Upton gently you know I m always ready when you want me And you ll not leave this you ll not desert me cried the other eagerly Certainly not I have no thought of going away There now hould your prate both of ye or by my conscience I ll not take the responsibility upon me I will not said Billy angrily Tis just a disgrace and a shame that ye haven t more discretion Glencore s lips moved with a feeble attempt at a smile and in his faint voice he said We must obey the doctor Upton but don t leave me Upton moved a chair to the bedside and sat down without a word Ye think an artery is like a canal with a lock gate to it I believe said Billy in a low grumbling voice to Upton and you forget all its vermicular motion as ould Fabricius called it and that it is only by a coagalum a kind of barrier like a mud breakwater that it can be plugged Be off out of that ye spalpeens be off every one of yez and leave us tranquil and paceable This summary command was directed to the various servants who were still moving about the room in imaginary occupation The room was at last cleared of all save Upton and Billy who sat by the bedside his hand still resting on the sick man s forehead Soothed by the stillness and reduced by the loss of blood Glencore sank into a quiet sleep breathing softly and gently as a child Look at him now whispered Billy to Upton and you ll see what philosophy there is in ascribin to the heart the source of all our emotions He lies there azy and comfortable just because the great bellows is working smoothly and quietly They talk about the brain and the spinal nerves and the soliar plexus but give a man a wake washy circulation and what is he He s just like a chap with the finest intentions in the world but not a sixpence in his pocket to carry them out A fine well regulated steady batin heart is like a credit on the bank you draw on it and your draft is n t dishonored What was it brought on this attack asked Upton in a whisper A shindy he had with the boy I was n t here there was nobody by But when I met Master Charles on the stairs he flew past me like lightning and I just saw by a glimpse that something was wrong He rushed out with his head bare and his coat all open and it sleetin terribly Down he went towards the lough at full speed and never minded all my callin after him Has he returned asked Upton Not as I know sir We were too much taken up with the lord to ask for him I ll just step down and see said Sir Horace who arose and left the room on tiptoe To Upton s inquiry all made the same answer None had seen the young lord none could give any clew as to whither he had gone Sir Horace at once hastened to Harcourt s room and after some vigorous shakes succeeded in awakening the Colonel and by dint of various repetitions at last put him in possession of all that had occurred We must look after the lad cried Harcourt springing from his bed and dressing with all haste He is a rash hot headed fellow but even if it were nothing else he might get his death in such a night as this The wind dashed wildly against the window panes as he spoke and the old timbers of the frame rattled fearfully Do you remain here Upton I ll go in search of the boy Take care Glencore hears nothing of his absence And with a promptitude that bespoke the man of action Harcourt descended the stairs and set out The night was pitch dark sweeping gusts of wind bore the rain along in torrents and the thunder rolled incessantly its clamor increased by the loud beating of the waves as they broke upon the rocks Upton had repeated to Harcourt that Billy saw the boy going towards the sea shore and in this direction he now followed His frequent excursions had familiarized him with the place so that even at night Harcourt found no difficulty in detecting the path and keeping it About half an hour s brisk walking brought him to the side of the lough and the narrow flight of steps cut in the rock which descended to the little boat quay Here he halted and called out the boy s name several times The sea however was running mountains high and an immense drift sweeping over the rocks fell in sheets of scattered foam beyond them so that Harcourt s voice was drowned by the uproar A small shealing under the shelter of the rock formed the home of a boatman and at the crazy door of this humble cot Harcourt now knocked violently The man answered the summons at once assuring him that he had not heard or seen any one since the night closed in adding at the same time that in such a tempest a boat s crew might have landed without his knowing it To be sure continued he after a pause I heard a chain rattlin on the rock soon after I went to bed and I ll Just step down and see if the yawl is all right Scarcely had he left the spot when his voice was heard calling out from below She s gonel the yawl is gone the lock is broke with a stone and she s away How could this be No boat could live in such a sea cried Harcourt eagerly She could go out fast enough sir The wind is northeast due but how long she ll keep the say is another matter Then he ll be lost cried Harcourt wildly Who sir who is it asked the man Your master s son cried he wringing his hands in anguish Oh murther murther screamed the boatman we ll never see him again T is out to say into the wild ocean he ll be blown Is there no shelter no spot he could make for Barrin the islands there s not a spot between this and America But he could make the islands you are sure of that If the boat was able to live through the say But sure I know him well he ll never take in a reef or sail but sit there with the helm hard up just never carin what came of him Oh musha musha what druv him out such a night as this Come it s no time for lamenting my man get the launch ready and let us follow him Are you afraid Afraid replied the man with a touch of scorn in his voice faix it s little fear troubles me But may be you won t like to be in her yourself when she s once out I ve none belongin to me father mother chick or child but you may have many a one that s near to you My ties are perhaps as light as your own said Harcourt Come now be alive I ll put ten gold guineas in your hand if you can overtake him I d rather see his face than have two hundred said the man as springing into the boat he began to haul out the tackle from under the low half deck and prepare for sea Is your honor used to a boat or ought I to get another man with me asked the sailor Trust me my good fellow I have had more sailing than yourself and in more treacherous seas too said Harcourt who throwing off his cloak proceeded to help the other with an address that bespoke a practised hand The wind blew strongly off the shore so that scarcely was the foresail spread than the boat began to move rapidly through the water dashing the sea over her bows and plunging wildly through the waves Give me a hand now with the halyard said the boatman and when the mainsail is set you ll see how she ll dance over the top of the waves and never wet us She s too light in the water if anything said Harcourt as the boat bounded buoyantly under the increased press of canvas Your honor s right she d do better with half a ton of iron in her Stand by sir always with the peak halyards get the sail aloft in when I give you the word Leave the tiller to me my man said Harcourt taking it as he spoke You ll soon see that I m no new hand at the work She s doing it well said the man Keep her up keep her up there s a spit of land runs out here in a few minutes more we ll have say room enough The heavier roll of the waves and the increased force of the wind soon showed that they had gained the open sea while the atmosphere relieved of the dark shadows of the mountain seemed lighter and thinner than in shore We re to make for the islands you say sir Yes What distance are they off About eighteen miles Two hours if the wind lasts and we can bear it And could the yawl stand this said Harcourt as a heavy sea struck the bow and came in a cataract over them Better than ourselves if she was manned Luff luff that s it And as the boat turned up to wind sheets of spray and foam flew over her Master Charles hasn t his equal for steerin if he wasn t alone Keep her there now steady sir Here s a squall coming cried Harcourt I hear it hissing Down went the peak but scarcely in time for the wind catching the sail laid the boat gunwale under After a struggle she righted but with nearly one third of her filled with water I d take in a reef or two reefs said the man but if she could n t rise to the say she ll fill and go down We must carry on at all events So say I It s no time to shorten sail with such a sea running The boat now flew through the water the sea itself impelling her as with every sudden gust the waves struck the stern She s a brave craft said Harcourt as she rose lightly over the great waves and plunged down again into the trough of the sea but if we ever get to land again I ll have combings round her to keep her dryer Here it comes here it comes sir Nor were the words well out when like a thunder clap the wind struck the sail and bent the mast over like a whip For an instant it seemed as if she were going down by the prow but she righted again and shivering in every plank held on her way That s as much as she could do said the sailor and I would not like to ax her to do more I agree with you said Harcourt secretly stealing his feet back again into his shoes which he had just kicked off It s freshening it is every minute said the man and I m not sure that we could make the islands if it lasts Well what then There s nothing for it but to be blown out to say said he calmly as having filled his tobacco pipe he struck a light and began to smoke The very thing I was wishing for said Harcourt touching his cigar to the bright ashes How she labors Do you think she can stand this She can if it s no worse sir But it looks heavier weather outside As well as I can see it s only beginnin Harcourt listened with a species of admiration to the calm and measured sentiment of the sailor who fully conscious of all the danger yet never by a word or gesture showed that he was flurried or excited You have been out on nights as bad as this I suppose said Harcourt Maybe not quite sir for it s a great say is runnin and with the wind off shore we could n t have this if there was n t a storm blowing farther out From the westward you mean Yes sir a wind coming over the whole ocean that will soon meet the land wind And does that often happen The words were but out when with a loud report like a cannon shot the wind reversed the sail snapping the strong sprit in two and bringing down the whole canvas clattering into the boat With the aid of a hatchet the sailor struck off the broken portion of the spar and soon cleared the wreck while the boat now reduced to a mere foresail labored heavily sinking her prow in the sea at every bound Her course too was now altered and she flew along parallel to the shore the great cliffs looming through the darkness and seeming as if close to them The boy the boy cried Harcourt what has become of him He never could have lived through that squall If the spar stood there was an end of us too said the sailor she d have gone down by the stern as sure as my name is Peter It is all over by this time muttered Harcourt sorrowfully Pace to him now said the sailor as he crossed himself and went over a prayer The wind now raged fearfully claps like the report of cannon struck the frail boat at intervals and laid her nearly keel uppermost while the mast bent like a whip and every rope creaked and strained to its last endurance The deafening noise close at hand told where the waves were beating on the rock bound coast or surging with the deep growl of thunder through many a cavern They rarely spoke save when some emergency called for a word Each sat wrapped up in his own dark reveries and unwilling to break them Hours passed thus long dreary hours of darkness that seemed like years of suffering so often in this interval did life hang in the balance As morning began to break with a grayish blue light to the westward the wind slightly abated blowing more steadily too and less in sudden gusts while the sea rolled in large round waves unbroken above and showing no crest of foam Do you know where we are asked Harcourt Yes sir we re off the Rooks Point and if we hold on well we ll soon be in slacker water Could the boy have reached this think you The man shook his head mournfully without speaking How far are we from Glencore About eighteen miles sir but more by land You can put me ashore then somewhere hereabouts Yes sir in the next bay there s a creek we can easily run into You are quite sure he couldn t have been blown out to sea How could he sir There s only one way the wind could dhrive him If he isn t in the Clough Bay he s in glory All the anxiety of that dreary night was nothing to what Harcourt now suffered in his eagerness to round the Rooks Point and look in the bay beyond it Controlling it as he would still would it break out in words of impatience and even anger Don t curse the boat yer honor said Peter respectfully but calmly she s behaved well to us this night or we d not be here now But are we to beat about here forever asked the other angrily She s doin well and we ought to be thankful said the man and his tone even more than his words served to reprove the other s impatience I ll try and set the mainsail on her with the remains of the sprit Harcourt watched him as he labored away to repair the damaged rigging but though he looked at him his thoughts were far away with poor Glencore upon his sick bed in sorrow and in suffering and perhaps soon to hear that he was childless From these he went on to other thoughts What could have occurred to have driven the boy to such an act of desperation Harcourt invented a hundred imaginary causes to reject them as rapidly again The affection the boy bore to his father seemed the strongest principle of his nature There appeared to be no event possible in which that feeling would not sway and control him As he thus ruminated he was aroused by the sudden cry of the boatman There s a boat sir dismasted ahead of us and drifting out to say I see her I see her cried Harcourt out with the oars and let s pull for her Heavily as the sea was rolling they now began to pull through the immense waves Harcourt turning his head at every instant to watch the boat which now was scarcely half a mile ahead of them She s empty there s no one in her said Peter mournfully as steadying himself by the mast he cast a look seaward Row on let us get beside her said Harcourt She s the yawl I know her now cried the man And empty Washed out of her with a say belike said Peter resuming his oar and tugging with all his strength A quarter of an hour s hard rowing brought them close to the dismasted boat which drifting broadside on the sea seemed at every instant ready to capsize There s something in the bottom in the stern sheets screamed Peter It s himself O blessed Virgin it s himself And with a bound he sprang from his own boat into the other Illustration one hundred twenty six The next instant he had lifted the helpless body of the boy from the bottom of the boat and with a shout of joy screamed out He s alive he s well it s only fatigue Harcourt pressed his hands to his face and sank upon his knees in prayer CHAPTER XIII A VOW ACCOMPLISHED Just as Upton had seated himself at that fragal meal of weak tea and dry toast he called his breakfast Harcourt suddenly entered the room splashed and road stained from head to foot and in his whole demeanor indicating the work of a fatiguing journey Why I thought to have had my breakfast with you cried he impatiently and this is like the diet of a convalescent from fever Where is the salmon where the grouse pie where are the cutlets and the chocolate and the poached eggs and the hot rolls and the cherry bounce Say rather where are the disordered livers worn out stomachs fevered brains and impatient tempers my worthy Colonel said Upton blandly Talleyrand himself once told me that he always treated great questions starving And he made a nice mess of the world in consequence blustered out Harcourt A fellow with an honest appetite and a sound digestion would never have played false to so many masters It is quite right that men like you should read history in this wise said Upton smiling as he dipped a crust in his tea and ate it Men like me are very inferior creatures no doubt broke in Harcourt angrily but I very much doubt if men like you had come eighteen miles on foot over a mountain this morning after a night passed in an open boat at sea ay in a gale by Jove such as I sha n t forget in a hurry You have hit it perfectly Harcourt suum caique and if only we could get the world to see that each of us has his speciality we should all of us do much better By the vigorous tug he gave the bell and the tone in which he ordered up something to eat it was plain to see that he scarcely relished the moral Upton had applied to his speech With the appearance of the good cheer however he speedily threw off his momentary displeasure and as he ate and drank his honest manly face lost every trace of annoyance Once only did a passing shade of anger cross his countenance It was when suddenly looking up he saw Upton s eyes settled on him and his whole features expressing a most palpable sensation of wonderment and compassion Ay cried he I know well what s passing in your mind this minute You are lost in your pitying estimate of such a mere animal as I am but hang it all old fellow why not be satisfied with the flattering thought that you are of another stamp a creature of a different order It does not make one a whit happier sighed Upton who never shrunk from accepting the sentiment as his own I should have thought otherwise said Harcourt with a malicious twinkle of the eye for he fancied that he had at last touched the weak point of his adversary No my dear Harcourt the crasso naturo have rather the best of it since no small share of this world s collisions are actually physical shocks and that great strong pipkin that encloses your brains will stand much that would smash the poor egg shell that shrouds mine Whenever you draw a comparison in my favor I always find at the end I come off worst said Harcourt bluntly and Upton laughed one of his rich musical laughs in which there was indeed nothing mirthful but something that seemed to say that his nature experienced a sense of enjoyment higher perhaps than anything merely comic could suggest You came off best this time Harcourt said he good humoredly and such a thorough air of frankness accompanied the words that Harcourt was disarmed of all distrust at once and joined in the laugh heartily But you have not yet told me Harcourt said the other where you have been and why you spent your night on the sea The story is not a very long one replied he and at once gave a full recital of the events which our reader has already had before him in our last chapter adding in conclusion I have left the boy in a cabin at Belmullet he is in a high fever and raving so loud that you could hear him a hundred yards away I told them to keep cold water on his head and give him plenty of it to drink nothing more till I could fetch our doctor over for it will be impossible to move the boy from where he is for the present Glencore has been asking for him already this morning He did not desire to see him but he begged of me to go to him and speak with him And have you told him that he was from home that he passed the night away from this No I merely intimated that I should look after him waiting for your return to guide myself afterwards I don t suspect that when we took him from the boat the malady had set in he appeared rather like one overcome by cold and exhaustion It was about two hours after he had taken some food and seemed stronger when I said to him Come Charley you ll soon be all right again I have sent a fellow to look after a pony for you and you ll be able to ride back won t you Ride where cried he eagerly Home of course said I to Glencore Home I have no home cried he and the wild scream he uttered the words with I ll never forget It was just as if that one thought was the boundary between sense and reason and the instant he had passed it all was chaos and confusion for now his raving began the most frantic imaginations always images of sorrow and with a rapidity of utterance there was no following Of course in such cases the delusions suggest no clew to the cause but all his fancies were about being driven out of doors an outcast and a beggar and of his father rising from his sick bed to curse him Poor boy Even in this his better nature gleamed forth as he cried Tell him and he said the words in a low whisper tell him not to anger himself he is ill very ill and should be kept tranquil Tell him then that I am going going away forever and he ll hear of me no more As Harcourt repeated the words his own voice faltered and two heavy drops slowly coursed down his bronzed cheeks You see added he as if to excuse the emotion that was n t like raving for he spoke this just as he might have done if his very heart was breaking Poor fellow said Upton and the words were uttered with real feeling Some terrible scene must have occurred between them resumed Harcourt of that I feel quite certain I suspect you are right said Upton bending over his teacup and our part in consequence is one of considerable delicacy for until Glencore alludes to what has passed we of course can take no notice of it The boy is ill he is in a fever we know nothing more I ll leave you to deal with the father the son shall be my care I have told Traynor to be ready to start with me after breakfast and have ordered two stout ponies for the journey I conclude there will be no objection in detaining the doctor for the night what think you Upton Do you consult the doctor on that head meanwhile I ll pay a visit to Glencore I ll meet you in the library And so saying Upton rose and gracefully draping the folds of his dressing gown and arranging the waving lock of hair which had escaped beneath his cap he slowly set out towards the sick man s chamber Of all the springs of human action there was not one in which Sir Horace Upton sympathized so little as passion That any man could adopt a line of conduct from which no other profit could result than what might minister to a feeling of hatred jealousy or revenge seemed to him utterly contemptible It was not indeed the morality of such a course that he called in question although he would not have contested that point It was its meanness its folly its insufficiency His experience of great affairs had imbued him with all the importance that was due to temper and moderation He scarcely remembered an instant where a false move had damaged a negotiation that it could not be traced to some passing trait of impatience or some lurking spirit of animosity biding the hour of its gratification He had long learned to perceive how much more temperament has to do in the management of great events than talent or capacity and his opinion of men was chiefly founded on this quality of their nature It was then with an almost pitying estimate of Glenoore that he now entered the room where the sick man lay Anxious to be alone with him Glenoore had dismissed all the attendants from his room and sat propped up by pillows eagerly awaiting his approach Upton moved through the dimly lighted room like one familiar to the atmosphere of illness and took his seat beside the bed with that noiseless quiet which in him was a kind of instinct It was several minutes before Glencore spoke and then in a low faint voice he said Are we alone Upton Yes said the other gently pressing the wasted fingers which lay on the counterpane before him You forgive me Upton said he and the words trembled as he uttered them You forgive me Upton though I cannot forgive myself My dear friend a passing moment of impatience is not to breach the friendship of a lifetime Your calmer judgment would I know not be unjust to me But how am I to repair the wrong I have done you By never alluding to it never thinking of it again Glenoore It is so unworthy so ignoble in me cried Glenoore bitterly and a tear fell over his eyelid and rested on his wan and worn cheek Let us never think of it my dear Glenoore Life has real troubles enough for either of us not to dwell on those which we may fashion out of our emotions I promise you I have forgotten the whole incident Glenoore sighed heavily but did not speak at last he said Be it so Upton and covering his face with his hand lay still and silent Well said he after a long pause the die is cast Upton I have told him Told the boy said Upton He nodded an assent It is too late to oppose me now Upton the thing is done I didn t think I had strength for it but revenge is a strong stimulant and I felt as though once more restored to health as I proceeded Poor fellow he bore it like a man Like a man do I say No but better than man ever bore such crushing tidings He asked me to stop once while his head reeled and said In a minute I shall be myself again and so he was too you should have seen him Upton as he rose to leave me So much of dignity was there in his look that my heart misgave me and I told him that still as my son he should never want a friend and a protector He grew deadly pale and caught at the bed for support Another moment and I d not have answered for myself I was already relenting but I thought of her and my resolution came back in all its force Still I dared not look on him The sight of that wan cheek those quivering lips and glassy eyes would certainly have unmanned me I turned away When I looked round he was gone As he ceased to speak a clammy perspiration burst forth over his face and forehead and he made a sign to Upton to wet his lips It is the last pang she is to cost me Upton but it is a sore one said he in a low hoarse whisper My dear Glencore this is all little short of madness even as revenge it is a failure since the heaviest share of the penalty recoils upon yourself How so cried he impetuously Is it thus that an ancient name is to go out forever Is it in this wise that a house noble for centuries is to crumble into ruin I will not again urge upon you the cruel wrong you are doing Over that boy s inheritance you have no more right than over mine you cannot rob him of the protection of the law No power could ever give you the disposal of his destiny in this wise I have done it and I will maintain it sir cried Glencore and if the question is as you vaguely hint to be one of law No no Glencore do not mistake me Hear me out sir said he passionately If it is to be one of law let Sir Horace Upton give his testimony tell all that he knows and let us see what it will avail him You may it is quite open to you place us front to front as enemies You may teach the boy to regard me as one who has robbed him of his birthright and train him up to become my accuser in a court of justice But my cause is a strong one it cannot be shaken and where you hope to brand me with tyranny you will but visit bastardy upon him Think twice then before you declare this combat It is one where all your craft will not sustain you My dear Glencore it is not in this spirit that we can speak profitably to each other If you will not hear my reasons calmly and dispassionately to what end am I here You have long known me as one who lays claim to no more rigid morality than consists with the theory of a worldly man s experiences I affect no high flown sentiments I am as plain and practical as may be and when I tell you that you are wrong in this affair I mean to say that what you are about to do is not only bad but impolitic In your pursuit of a victim you are immolating yourself Be it so I go not alone to the stake there is another to partake of the torture cried Glencore wildly and already his flushed cheek and flashing eyes betrayed the approach of a feverish access If I am not to have any influence with you then resumed Upton I am here to no purpose If to all that I say to arguments you cannot answer you obstinately persist in opposing an insane thirst for revenge I see not why you should desire my presence You have resolved to do this great wrong It is already done sir broke in Glencore Wherein then can I be of any service to you I am coming to that I had come to it before had you not interrupted me I want you to be guardian to the boy I want you to replace me in all that regards authority over him You know life well Upton You know it not alone in its paths of pleasure and success but you understand thoroughly the rugged footway over which humble men toil wearily to fortune None can better estimate a man s chances of success nor more surely point the road by which he is to attain it The provision which I destine for him will be an humble one and he will need to rely upon his own efforts You will not refuse me this service Upton I ask it in the name of our old friendship There is but one objection I could possibly have and yet that seems to be insurmountable And what may it be cried Glencore Simply that in acceding to your request I make myself an accomplice in your plan and thus aid and abet the very scheme I am repudiating What avails your repudiation if it will not turn me from my resolve That it will not I ll swear to you as solemnly as ever an oath was taken I tell you again the thing is done For the consequences which are to follow on it you have no responsibility these are my concern I should like a little time to think over it said Upton with the air of one struggling with irresolution Let me have this evening to make up my mind to morrow you shall have my answer Be it so then said Glencore and turning his face away waved a cold farewell with his hand We do not purpose to follow Sir Horace as he retired nor does our task require that we should pry into the secret recesses of his wily nature enough if we say that in asking for time his purpose was rather to afford another opportunity of reflection to Glencore than to give himself more space for deliberation He had found by the experience of his calling that the delay we often crave for to resolve a doubt has sufficed to change the mind of him who originated the difficulty I ll give him some hours at least thought he to ponder over what I have said Who knows but the argument may seem better in memory than in action Such things have happened before now And having finished this reflection he turned to peruse the pamphlet of a quack doctor who pledged himself to cure all disorders of the circulation by attending to tidal influences and made the moon herself enter into the materia medica What Sir Horace believed or did not believe in the wild rhapsodies of the charlatan is known only to himself Whether his credulity was fed by the hope of obtaining relief or whether his fancy only was aroused by the speculative images thus suggested it is impossible to say It is not altogether improbable that he perused these things as Charles Fox used to read all the trashiest novels of the Minerva Press and find in the very distorted and exaggerated pictures a relief and a relaxation which more correct views of life had failed to impart Hard headed men require strange indulgences CHAPTER XIV 
6695-252334-0000	train-other-500	BILLY TRAYNOR AND THE COLONEL It was a fine breezy morning as the Colonel set out with Billy Traynor for Belmullet The bridle path by which they travelled led through a wild and thinly inhabited tract now dipping down between grassy hills
6695-252334-0001	train-other-500	now tracing its course along the cliffs over the sea Tall ferns covered the slopes protected from the west winds
none	none	 and here and there little copses of stunted oak showed the traces of what once had been forest 
6695-252334-0002	train-other-500	It was on the whole a silent and dreary region so that the travellers felt it even relief as they drew nigh the bright blue sea and heard the sonorous booming of the waves as they broke along the shore
6695-252334-0003	train-other-500	It cheers one to come up out of those dreary dells and hear the pleasant plash of the sea said Harcourt and his bright face showed that he felt the enjoyment So it does sir said Billy And yet
6695-252334-0004	train-other-500	Homer makes his hero go heavy hearted as he hears the ever sounding sea What does that signify Doctor said Harcourt impatiently Telling me what a character in a fiction feels affects me no more than telling me what he does
6695-252334-0005	train-other-500	Why man the one is as unreal as the other The fellow that created him fashioned his thoughts as well as his actions
none	none	 To be sure he did 
6695-252334-0006	train-other-500	but when the fellow is a janius what he makes is as much a crayture as either you or myself Come come Doctor no mystification I don t mean any broke in Billy What I want to say is this
6695-252334-0007	train-other-500	that as we read every character to elicit truth truth in the working of human motives truth in passion
none	none	 truth in all the struggles of our poor weak natures why would n t a great janius like Homer 
6695-252334-0008	train-other-500	or Shakspeare or Milton be better able to show us this in some picture drawn by themselves than you or I be able to find it out for ourselves Harcourt shook his head doubtfully Well now said Billy returning to the charge
6695-252334-0009	train-other-500	did you ever see a waxwork model of anatomy Every nerve and siny of a nerve was there
none	none	 not a vein nor an artery wanting 
6695-252334-0010	train-other-500	The artist that made it all just wanted to show you where everything was but he never wanted you to believe it was alive or ever had been But with janius it s different
6695-252334-0011	train-other-500	He just gives you some traits of a character he points him out to you passing just as I would to a man going along the street
none	none	 and there he is alive for ever and ever 
6695-252334-0012	train-other-500	not like you and me that will be dead and buried to morrow or next day and the most known of us three lines in a parish registhry but he goes down to posterity an example an illustration
6695-252334-0013	train-other-500	or a warning maybe to thousands and thousands of living men Don t talk to me about fiction What he thought and felt is truer than all that you and I and a score like us ever did or ever will do
6695-252334-0014	train-other-500	The creations of janius are the landmarks of humanity and well for us is it that we have such to guide us All this may be very fine said Harcourt contemptuously
6695-252334-0015	train-other-500	but give me the sentiments of a living man or one that has lived in preference to all the imaginary characters that have ever adorned a story
6695-252334-0016	train-other-500	Just as I suppose that you d say that a soldier in the Blues or some big hulking corporal in the Guards is a finer model of the human form than ever Praxiteles chiselled
6695-252334-0017	train-other-500	I know which I d rather have alongside of me in a charge Doctor said Harcourt laughing and then to change the topic he pointed to a lone cabin on the sea shore miles away as it seemed from all other habitations
6695-252334-0018	train-other-500	That s Michel Cady s sir said Traynor he lives by birds hunting them saygulls and cormorants through the crevices of the rocks and stealing the eggs There isn t a precipice that he won t climb not a cliff that he won t face
none	none	 Well if that be his home the pursuit does not seem a profitable one 
6695-252334-0019	train-other-500	Tis as good as breaking stones on the road for four pence a day or carrying sea weed five miles on your back to manure the potatoes said Billy mournfully That s exactly the very thing that puzzles me said Harcourt
6695-252334-0020	train-other-500	why in a country so remarkable for fertility every one should be so miserably poor And you never heard any explanation of it Never at least never one that satisfied me Nor ever will you said Billy
6695-252334-0021	train-other-500	sententiously And why so Because said he drawing a long breath as if preparing for a discourse because there s no man capable of going into the whole subject
6695-252334-0022	train-other-500	for it s not merely an economical question or a social one but it is metaphysical and religious and political and ethnological and historical ay and geographical too
6695-252334-0023	train-other-500	You have to consider first who and what are the aborigines A conquered people that never gave in they were conquered Who are the rulers A Saxon race that always felt that they were infarior to them they ruled over
6695-252334-0024	train-other-500	By Jove Doctor I must stop you there I never heard any acknowledgment of this inferiority you speak of
none	none	 I d like to get a goold medal for arguin it out with you 
6695-252334-0025	train-other-500	said Billy And after all I don t see how it would resolve the original doubt said Harcourt I want to know why the people are so poor
none	none	 and I don t want to hear of the battle of Clontarf or the Danes at Dundalk 
6695-252334-0026	train-other-500	There it is you d like to narrow down a great question of race language traditions and laws to a little miserable dispute about labor and wages O Manchester Manchester
6695-252334-0027	train-other-500	how ye re in the heart of every Englishman rich or poor gentle or simple You say you never heard of any confession of inferiority
none	none	 Of course you did n t but quite the reverse a very confident sense of being far better than the poor Irish and I ll tell you how and why just as you yourself after a discusshion with me 
6695-252334-0028	train-other-500	when you find yourself dead bate and not a word to reply you ll go home to a good dinner and a bottle of wine dry clothes and a bright fire and no matter how hard my argument pushed you you ll remember that I m in rags
6695-252334-0029	train-other-500	in a dirty cabin with potatoes to ate and water to drink and you ll say at all events
none	none	 I m better off than he is 
6695-252334-0030	train-other-500	and there s your superiority neither more or less
none	none	 there it is 
6695-252334-0031	train-other-500	And all the while I m saying the same thing to myself
none	none	 Sorrow matter for his fine broadcloth and his white linen and his very best roast beef that he s atin I m his master In all that dignifies the spacies in them grand qualities that makes us poets rhetoricians 
6695-252334-0032	train-other-500	and the like in those elegant attributes that as the poet says In all our pursuits Lifts us high above brutes in these I say again I m his master
6695-252334-0033	train-other-500	As Billy finished his growing panegyric upon his country and himself he burst out in a joyous laugh and cried Did ye ever hear conceit like that Did ye ever expect to see the day
none	none	 that a ragged poor blackguard like me would dare to say as much to one like you And after all 
6695-252334-0034	train-other-500	it s the greatest compliment I could pay you How so Billy I don t exactly see that Why that if you weren t a gentleman
none	none	 a raal gentleman born and bred I could never have ventured to tell you what I said now It is because in your own refined feelings you can pardon all the coarseness of mine that I have my safety You re as great a courtier as you are a scholar Billy said Harcourt laughing meanwhile I m not likely to be enlightened as to the cause of Irish poverty T is a whole volume I could write on the same subject said Billy for there s so many causes in operation com binin and assistin and aggravatin each other But if you want the head and front of the mischief in one word it is this that no Irishman ever gave his heart and sowl to his own business but always was mindin something else that he had nothin to say to and so ye see the priest does be thinkin of politics the parson s thinkin of the priest the people are always on the watch for a crack at the agent or the tithe proctor and the landlord instead of looking after his property is up in Dublin dinin with the Lord Leftinint and abusin his tenants I don t want to screen myself nor say I m better than my neighbors for though I have a larned profession to live by I d rather be writin a ballad and singin it too down Thomas Street than I d be lecturin at the Surgeons Hall You are certainly a very strange people said Harcourt And yet there s another thing stranger still which is that your countrymen never took any advantage of our eccentricities to rule us by 
6695-252334-0035	train-other-500	and if they had any wit in their heads
none	none	 they d have seen easy enough that all these traits are exactly the clews to a nation s heart 
6695-252334-0036	train-other-500	That s what Pitt meant when he said Let me make the songs of a people and I don t care who makes the laws Look down now in that glen before you as far as you can see There s Belmullet and ain t you glad to be so near your journey s end
6695-252334-0037	train-other-500	for you re mighty tired of all this discoorsin On the contrary Billy even when I disagree with what you say I m pleased to hear your reasons at the same time I m glad we are drawing nigh to this poor boy
6695-252334-0038	train-other-500	and I only trust we may not be too late Billy muttered a pious concurrence in the wish and they rode along for some time in silence
6695-252334-0039	train-other-500	There s the Bay of Belmullet now under your feet cried Billy as he pulled up short and pointed with his whip seaward There s five fathoms and fine anchoring ground on every inch ye see there
6695-252334-0040	train-other-500	There s elegant shelter from tempestuous winds There s a coast rich in herrings oysters lobsters and crabs farther out there s cod and haddock and mackerel in the sayson There s sea wrack for kelp
6695-252334-0041	train-other-500	and every other con vanience any one can require and a poorer set of devils than ye ll see when we get down there there s nowhere to be found Well well if idleness is bliss it s folly to work hard
none	none	 And with this paraphrase Billy made way for the Colonel as the path had now become too narrow for two abreast and in this way they descended to the shore CHAPTER XV A SICK BED Although the cabin in which the sick boy lay was one of the best in the village its interior presented a picture of great poverty It consisted of a single room in the middle of which a mud wall of a few feet in height formed a sort of partition abutting against which was the bed the one bed of the entire family now devoted to the guest Two or three coarsely fashioned stools a rickety table and a still more rickety dresser comprised all the furniture The floor was uneven and fissured and the solitary window was mended with an old hat thus diminishing the faint light which struggled through the narrow aperture A large net attached to the rafters hung down in heavy festoons overhead the corks and sinks dangling in dangerous proximity to the heads underneath Several spars and oars littered one corner and a newly painted buoy filled another but in spite of all these encumbrances there was space around the fire for a goodly company of some eight or nine of all ages who were pleasantly eating their supper from a large pot of potatoes that smoked and steamed in front of them God save all here cried Billy as he preceded the Colonel into the cabin Save ye kindly was the courteous answer in a chorus of voices at the same time seeing a gentleman at the door the whole party arose at once to receive him Nothing could have surpassed the perfect good breeding with which the fisherman and his wife did the honors of their humble home and Harcourt at once forgot the poverty struck aspect of the scene in the general courtesy of the welcome He s no better your honor no better at all said the man as Harcourt drew nigh the sick bed He does be always ravin ravin on beggin and implorin that we won t take him back to the Castle and if he falls asleep the first thing he says when he wakes up is Where am I tell me I m not at Glencore and he keeps on screechin Tell me tell me so Harcourt bent down over the bed and gazed at him Slowly and languidly the sick boy raised his heavy lids and returned the stare You know me Charley boy don t you said he softly Yes muttered he in a weak tone Who am I Charley Tell me who is speaking to you Yes said he again Poor fellow Bighed Harcourt he does not know me Where s the pain asked Billy suddenly The boy placed his hand on his forehead and then on his temples Look up look at me said Billy Ay there it is the pupil does not contract there s mischief in the brain He wants to say something to you sir said he to Harcourt he s makin signs to you to stoop down Harcourt put his ear close to the sick boy s lips and listened No my dear child of course not said he after a pause You shall remain here and I will stay with you too In a few days your father will come A wild yell a shriek that made the cabin ring now broke from the boy followed by another and then a third and then with a spring he arose from the bed and tried to escape Weak and exhausted as he was such was the strength supplied by fever it was all that they could do to subdue him and replace him in the bed violent convulsions followed this severe access and it was not till after hours of intense suffering that he calmed down again and seemed to slumber There s more than we know of here Colonel said Billy as he drew him to one side There s moral causes as well as malady at work There may be but I know nothing of them said Harcourt and in the frank air of the speaker the other did not hesitate to repose his trust If we hope to save him we ought to find out where the mischief lies said Billy for if ye remark his ravin is always upon one subject he never wanders from that He has a dread of home Some altercation with his father has doubtless impressed him with this notion Ah that isn t enough we must go deeper we want a clew to the part of the brain engaged Meanwhile here s at him with the antiphlogistic touch and he opened his lancet case and tucked up his cuffs Houlde the basin Biddy There Harvey himself couldn t do it nater than that It s an elegant study to be feelin a pulse while the blood is flowin It comes at first like a dammed up cataract a regular out pouring just as a young girl would tell her love all wild and tumultuous then after a time she gets more temperate the feelings are relieved and the ardor is moderated till at last wearied and worn out the heart seems to ask for rest and then ye ll remark a settled faint smile coming over the lips and a clammy coldness in the face He s fainting sir broke in Biddy He is ma am and it s myself done it said Billy Oh dear oh dear If we could only do with the moral heart what we can with the raal physical one what wonderful poets we d be What hopes have you whispered Harcourt The best the very best There s youth and a fine constitution to work upon and what more does a doctor want As ould Marsden said You can t destroy these in a fortnight so the patient must live But you must help me Colonel and you can help me Command me in any way Doctor Here s the modus then You must go back to the Castle and find out if you can what happened between his father and him It does not signify now nor will it for some days but when he comes to the convalescent stage it s then we ll need to know how to manage him and what subjects to keep him away from T is the same with the brain as with a sprained ankle you may exercise if you don t twist it but just come down once on the wrong spot and maybe ye won t yell out You ll not quit him then I m a senthry on his post waiting to get a shot at the enemy if he shows the top of his head Ah sir if ye only knew physic ye d acknowledge there s nothing as treacherous as dizaze Ye hunt him out of the brain and then he is in the lungs Ye chase him out of that and he skulks in the liver At him there and he takes to the fibrous membranes and then it s regular hide and go seek all over the body Trackin a bear is child s play to it And so saying Billy held the Colonel s stirrup for him to mount and giving his most courteous salutation and his best wishes for a good journey he turned and re entered the cabin CHAPTER XVI THE PROJECT It was not without surprise that Harcourt saw Glencore enter the drawing room a few minutes before dinner Very pale and very feeble he slowly traversed the room giving a hand to each of his guests and answering the inquiries for his health by a sickly smile while he said As you see me I am going to dine with you to day Harcourt said he with an attempt at gayety of manner Upton tells me that a little exertion of this kind will do me good Upton s right cried the Colonel especially if he added that you should take a glass or two of that admirable Burgundy My life on t but that is the liquor to set a man on his legs again I did n t remark that this was exactly the effect it produced upon you t other night said Upton with one of his own sly laughs That comes of drinking it in bad company retorted Harcourt a man is driven to take two glasses for one As the dinner proceeded Glencore rallied considerably taking his part in the conversation and evidently enjoying the curiously contrasted temperaments at either side of him The one all subtlety refinement and finesse the other out spoken rude and true hearted rarely correct in a question of taste but invariably right in every matter of honorable dealing Though it was clear enough that Upton relished the eccentricities whose sallies he provoked it was no less easy to see how thoroughly he appreciated the frank and manly nature of the old soldier nor could all the crafty habits of his acute mind overcome the hearty admiration with which he regarded him It is in the unrestricted ease of these little dinners where two or three old friends are met that social intercourse assumes its most charming form The usages of the great world which exact a species of uniformity of breeding and manners are here laid aside and men talk with all the bias and prejudices of their true nature dashing the topics discussed with traits of personality and even whims that are most amusing How little do we carry away of tact or wisdom from the grand banquets of life and what pleasant stores of thought what charming memories remain to us after those small gatherings How as I write this one little room rises to my recollection with its quaint old sideboard of carved oak its dark brown cabinets curiously sculptured its heavy old brocade curtains and all its queer devices of knick knackery where such meetings once were held and where throwing off the cares of life shut out from them as it were by the massive folds of the heavy drapery across the door we talked in all the fearless freedom of old friendship rambling away from theme to theme contrasting our experiences balancing our views in life and mingling through our converse the racy freshness of a boy s enjoyment with the sager counsels of a man s reflectiveness Alas how very early is it sometimes in life that we tread the banquet hall deserted But to our story the evening wore pleasantly on Upton talked as few but himself could do upon the public questions of the day and Harcourt with many a blunt interruption made the discourse but more easy and amusing The soldier was indeed less at his ease than the others It was not alone that many of the topics were not such as he was most familiar with but he felt angry and indignant at Glencore s seeming indifference as to the fate of his son Not a single reference to him even occurred his name was never even passingly mentioned Nothing but the careworn sickly face the wasted form and dejected expression before him could have restrained Harcourt from alluding to the boy He bethought him however that any indiscretion on his part might have the gravest consequences Upton too might have said something to quiet Glencore s mind At all events I ll wait said he to himself for wherever there is much delicacy in a negotiation I generally make a mess of it The more genially therefore did Glencore lend himself to the pleasure of the conversation the more provoked did Harcourt feel at his heartlessness and the more did the struggle cost him to control his own sentiments Upton who detected the secret working of men s minds with a marvellous exactness saw how the poor Colonel was suffering and that in all probability some unhappy explosion would at last ensue and took an opportunity of remarking that though all this chit chat was delightful for them Glencore was still a sick man We must n t forget Harcourt said he that a chicken broth diet includes very digestible small talk and here we are leading our poor friend through politics war diplomacy and the rest of it just as if he had the stomach of an old campaigner and And the brain of a great diplomatist Say it out man and avow honestly the share of excellence you accord to each of us broke in Harcourt laughing I would to Heaven we could exchange sighed Upton languidly The saints forbid exclaimed the other and it would do us little good if we were able Why so I d never know what to do with that fine intellect if I had it and as for you what with your confounded pills and mixtures your infernal lotions and embrocations you d make my sound system as bad as your own in three months time You are quite wrong my dear Harcourt I should treat the stomach as you would do the brain give it next to nothing to do in the hopes it might last the longer There now good night said Harcourt he s always the better for bitters whether he gives or takes them And with a good humored laugh he left the room Glencore s eyes followed him as he retired and then as they closed an expression as of long repressed suffering settled down on his features so marked that Upton hastily asked Are you ill are you in pain Glencore In pain Yes said he these two hours back I have been suffering intensely but there s no help for it Must you really leave this to morrow Upton I must This letter from the Foreign Office requires my immediate presence in London with a very great likelihood of being obliged to start at once for the Continent And I had so much to say so many things to consult you on sighed the other Are you equal to it now asked Upton I must try at all events You shall learn my plan He was silent for some minutes and sat with his head resting on his hand in deep reflection At last he said Has it ever occurred to you Upton that some incident of the past some circumstance in itself insignificant should rise up as it were in after life to suit an actual emergency just as though fate had fashioned it for such a contingency I cannot say that I have experienced what you describe if indeed I fully understand it I ll explain better by an instance You know now here his voice became slow and the words fell with a marked distinctness you know now what I intend by this woman Well just as if to make my plan more feasible a circumstance intended for a very different object offers itself to my aid When my uncle Sir Miles Herrick heard that I was about to marry a foreigner he declared that he would never leave me a shilling of his fortune I am not very sure that I cared much for the threat when it was uttered My friends however thought differently and though they did not attempt to dissuade me from my marriage they suggested that I should try some means of overcoming this prejudice at all events that I should not hurry on the match without an effort to obtain his consent I agreed not very willingly indeed and so the matter remained The circumstance was well known amongst my two or three most intimate friends and constantly discussed by them I need n t tell you that the tone in which such things are talked of as often partakes of levity as seriousness They gave me all manner of absurd counsels one more outrageously ridiculous than the other At last one day we were picnicking at Baia Old Clifford you remember that original who had the famous schooner yacht The Breeze well he took me aside after dinner and said Glencore I have it I have just hit upon the expedient Your uncle and I were old chums at Christ Church fifty years ago What if we were to tell him that you were going to marry a daughter of mine I don t think he d object I m half certain he d not I have been abroad these five and thirty years Nobody in England knows much about me now Old Herrick can t live forever he is my senior by a good ten or twelve years and if the delusion only lasts his time But perhaps you have a daughter broke I in I have and she is married already so there is no risk on that score I need n t repeat all that he said for nor that I urged against the project for though it was after dinner and we all had drunk very freely the deception was one I firmly rejected When a man shows a great desire to serve you on a question of no common difficulty it is very hard to be severe upon his counsels however unscrupulous they may be In fact you accept them as proofs of friendship only the stronger seeing how much they must have cost him to offer Upton smiled dubiously and Glencore blushing slightly said You don t concur in this I perceive Not exactly said Upton in his silkiest of tones I rather regard these occasions as I should do the generosity of a man who filling my hand with base money should say Pass it if you can In this case however resumed Glencore he took his share of the fraud or at least was willing to do so for I distinctly said No to the whole scheme He grew very warm about it at one moment appealing to my good sense not to kick seven thousand a year out of the window at the next in half quarrelsome mood asking if it were any objection I had to be connected with his family To get rid of a very troublesome subject and to end a controversy that threatened to disturb a party I said at last We ll talk it over to morrow Clifford and if your arguments be as good as your heart then perhaps they may yet convince me This ended the theme and we parted I started the next day on a shooting excursion into Calabria and when I got back it was not of meeting Clifford I was thinking I hastened to meet the Delia Torres and then came our elopement You know the rest We went to the East passed the winter in Upper Egypt and came to Cairo in spring where Charley was born I got back to Naples after a year or two and then found that my uncle had just died and in consequence of my marrying the daughter of his old and attached friend Sir Guy Clifford had reversed the intention of his will and by a codicil left me his sole heir It was thus that my marriage and even my boy s birth became inserted in the Peerage my solicitor in his vast eagerness for my interests having taken care to indorse the story with his own name The disinherited nephews and nieces the half cousins and others soon got wind of the real facts and contested the will on the ground of its being executed under a delusion I of course would not resist their claim and satisfied myself by denying the statement as to my marriage and so after affording the current subject of gossip for a season I was completely forgotten the more as we went to live abroad and never mixed with English And now Upton it is this same incident I would utilize for the present occasion though as I said before when it originally occurred it had a very different signification I don t exactly see how said Upton In this wise My real marriage was never inserted in the Peerage I ll now manage that it shall so appear to give me the opportunity of formally contradicting it and alluding to the strange persistence with which having married me some fifteen years ago to a lady who never existed they now are pleased to unite me to one whose character might have secured me against the calumny I ll threaten an action for libel et cetera obtain a most full explicit and abject apology and then when this has gone the round of all the journals of Europe her doom is sealed But she has surely letters writings proofs of some sort No Upton I have not left a scrap in her possession she has not a line not a letter to vindicate her On the night I broke open her writing desk I took away everything that bore the traces of my own hand I tell you again she is in my power and never was power less disposed to mercy Once more my dear friend said Upton I am driven to tell you that I cannot be a profitable counsellor in a matter to every detail of which I object Consider calmly for one moment what you are doing See how in your desire to be avenged upon her you throw the heaviest share of the penalty on your own poor boy I am not her advocate now I will not say one word to mitigate the course of your anger towards her but remember that you are actually defrauding him of his birthright This is not a question where you have a choice There is no discretionary power left you I ll do it said Glencore with a savage energy In other words to wreak a vengeance upon one you are prepared to immolate another not only guiltless but who possesses every claim to your love and affection And do you think that if I sacrifice the last tie that attaches me to life Upton that I retire from this contest heart whole No far from it I go forth from the struggle broken blasted friendless And do you mean that this vengeance should outlive you Suppose for instance that she should survive you It shall be to live on in shame then cried he savagely And were she to die first In that case I have not thought well enough about that It is possible it is just possible but these are subtleties Upton to detach me from my purpose or weaken my resolution to carry it through You would apply the craft of your calling to the case and by suggesting emergencies open a road to evasions Enough for me the present I neither care to prejudge the future nor control it I know cried he suddenly and with eyes flashing angrily as he spoke I know that if you desire to use the confidence I have reposed in you against me you can give me trouble and even difficulty but I defy Sir Horace Upton with all his skill and all his cunning to outwit me There was that in the tone in which he uttered these words and the exaggerated energy of his manner that convinced Upton Glencore s reason was not intact It was not what could amount to aberration in the ordinary sense but sufficient evidence was there to show that judgment had become so obscured by passion that the mental power was weakened by the moral Tell me therefore Upton cried he before we part do you leave this house my friend or my enemy It is as your sincere attached friend that I now dispute with you inch by inch a dangerous position with a judgment under no influence from passion viewing this question by the coldest of all tests mere expediency There it is broke in Glencore you claim an advantage over me because you are devoid of feeling but this is a case sir where the sense of injury gives the instinct of reparation Is it nothing to me think you that I am content to go down dishonored to my grave but also to be the last of my name and station Is it nothing that a whole line of honorable ancestry is extinguished at once Is it nothing that I surrender him who formed my sole solace and companionship in life You talk of your calm unbiassed mind but I tell you till your brain be on fire like mine and your heart swollen to very bursting that you have no right to dictate to me Besides it is done The blow has fallen added he with a deeper solemnity of voice The gulf that separates us is already created She and I can meet no more But why continue this contest It was to aid me in directing that boy s fortunes I first sought your advice not to attempt to dissuade me from what I will not be turned from In what way can I serve you said Upton calmly Will you consent to be his guardian I will Glencore seized the other s hand and pressed it to his heart and for some seconds he could not speak This is all that I ask Upton said he It is the greatest boon friendship could accord me I need no more Could you have remained here a day or two more we could have settled upon some plan together as to his future life as it is we can arrange it by letter He must leave this said Upton thoughtfully Of course at once How far is Harcourt to be informed in this matter have you spoken to him already No nor mean to do so I should have from him nothing but reproaches for having betrayed the boy into false hopes of a station he was never to fill You must tell Harcourt I leave it to yourself to find the suitable moment We shall need his assistance said Upton whose quick faculties were already busily travelling many a mile of the future I ll see him to night and try what can be done In a few days you will have turned over in your mind what you yourself destine for him the fortune you mean to give It is already done said Glencore laying a sealed letter on the table All that I purpose in his behalf you will find there All this detail is too much for you Glencore said the other seeing that a weary depressed expression had come over him while his voice grew weaker with every word I shall not leave this till late to morrow so that we can meet again And now good night CHAPTER XVII A TETE A TETE When Harcourt was aroused from his sound sleep by Upton and requested in the very blandest tones of that eminent diplomatist to lend him every attention of his very remarkable faculties he was not by any means certain that he was not engaged in a strange dream nor was the suspicion at all dispelled by the revelations addressed to him Just dip the end of that towel in the water Upton and give it to me cried he at last and then wiping his face and forehead said Have I heard you aright there was no marriage Upton nodded assent What a shameful way he has treated this poor boy then cried the other I never heard of anything equal to it in cruelty and I conclude it was breaking this news to the lad that drove him out to sea on that night and brought on this brain fever By Jove I d not take his title and your brains to have such a sin on my conscience We are happily not called on to judge the act said Upton cautiously And why not Is it not every honest man s duty to reprobate whatever he detects dishonorable or disgraceful I do judge him and sentence him too and I say moreover that a more cold blooded piece of cruelty I never heard of He trains up this poor boy from childhood to fancy himself the heir to his station and fortune he nurses in him all the pride that only a high rank can cover and then when the lad s years have brought him to the period when these things assume all their value he sends for him to tell him he is a bastard It is not impossible that I think worse of Glencore s conduct than you do yourself said Upton gravely But you never told him so I ll be sworn you never said to him it was a rascally action I ll lay a hundred pounds on it you only expostulated on the inexpediency or the inconvenience or some such trumpery consideration and did not tell him in round numbers that what he had done was an infamy Then I fancy you d lose your money pretty much as you are losing your temper that is without getting anything in requital What did you say to him then said Harcourt slightly abashed A great deal in the same strain as you have just spoken in doubtless not as warm in vituperation but possibly as likely to produce an effect nor is it in the least necessary to dwell upon that What Glencore has done and what I have said about it both belong to the past They are over they are irrevocable It is to what concerns the present and the future I wish now to address myself and to interest you Why the boy s name was in the Peerage I read it there myself My dear Harcourt you must have paid very little attention to me a while ago or you would have understood how that occurred And here were all the people the tenantry on the estate calling him the young lord and the poor fellow growing up with the proud consciousness that the title was his due There is not a hardship of the case I have not pictured to my own mind as forcibly as you can describe it said Upton but I really do not perceive that any reprobation of the past has in the slightest assisted me in providing for the future And then murmured Harcourt for all the while he was pursuing his own train of thought quite irrespective of all Upton was saying and then he turns him adrift on the world without friend or fortune It is precisely that he may have both the one and the other that I have come to confer with you now replied Upton Glencore has made a liberal provision for the boy and asked me to become his guardian I have no fancy for the trust but I did n t see how I could decline it In this letter he assigns to him an income which shall be legally secured to him He commits to me the task of directing his education and suggesting some future career and for both these objects I want your counsel Education prospects why what are you talking about A poor fellow who has not a name nor a home nor one to acknowledge him what need has he of education or what chance of prospects I d send him to sea and if he wasn t drowned before he came to manhood I d give him his fortune whatever it was and say Go settle in some of the colonies You have no right to train him up to meet fresh mortifications and insults in life to be flouted by every fellow that has a father and outraged by every cur whose mother was married And are the colonies especially inhabited by illegitimate offspring said Upton dryly At least he d not be met with a rebuff at every step he made The rude life of toil would be better than the polish of a civilization that could only reflect upon him Not badly said Harcourt said Upton smiling but as to the boy I have other prospects He has if I mistake not very good faculties You estimate them even higher I don t see why they should be neglected If he merely possess the mediocrity of gifts which make men tolerable lawyers and safe doctors why perhaps he may turn them into some channel If he really can lay claim to higher qualities they must not be thrown away Which means that he ought to be bred up to diplomacy said Harcourt Perhaps said the other with a bland inclination of the head And what can an old dragoon like myself contribute to such an object asked Harcourt You can be of infinite service in many ways said Upton and for the present I wish to leave the boy in your care till I can learn something about my own destiny This of course I shall know in a few days Meanwhile you ll look after him and as soon as his removal becomes safe you ll take him away from this it does not much matter whither probably some healthy secluded spot in Wales for a week or two would be advisable Glencore and he must not meet again if ever they are to do so it must be after a considerable lapse of time Have you thought of a name for him or is his to be still Massy asked Harcourt bluntly He may take the maternal name of Glencore s family and be called Doyle and the settlements could be drawn up in that name I ll be shot if I like to have any share in the whole transaction Some day or other it will all come out and who knows how much blame may be imputed to us perhaps for actually advising the entire scheme said Harcourt You must see my dear Harcourt that you are only refusing aid to alleviate an evil and not to devise one If this boy Well well I give in I d rather comply at once than be preached into acquiescence Even when you do not convince me I feel ashamed to oppose myself to so much cleverness so I repeat I m at your orders Admirably spoken said Upton with a smile My greatest difficulty of all said Harcourt will be to meet Glencore again after this I know I feel I never can forgive him Perhaps he will not ask forgiveness Harcourt said the other with one of his slyest of looks Glencore is a strange self opinionated fellow and has amongst other odd notions that of going the road he likes best himself Besides there is another consideration here and with no man will it weigh more than with yourself Glencore has been dangerously ill at this moment we can scarcely say that he has recovered his state is yet one of anxiety and doubt You are the last who would forget such infirmity nor is it necessary to secure your pity that I should say how seriously the poor fellow is now suffering I trust he ll not speak to me about this business said Harcourt after a pause Very probably he will not He will know that I have already told you everything so that there will be no need of any communication from him I wish from my heart and soul I had never come here I would to Heaven I had gone away at once as I first intended I like that boy I feel he has fine stuff in him and now Come come Harcourt it s the fault of all soft hearted fellows like yourself that their kindliness degenerates into selfishness and they have such a regard for their own feelings that they never agree to anything that wounds them Just remember that you and I have very small parts in this drama and the best way we can do is to fill them without giving ourselves the airs of chief characters You re at your old game Upton you are always ready to wet yourself provided you give another fellow a ducking Only if he get a worse one or take longer to dry after it remarked Upton laughing Quite true by Jove chimed in the other you take special care to come off best And now you re going added he as Upton rose to withdraw and I m certain that I have not half comprehended what you want from me You shall have it in writing Harcourt I ll send you a clear despatch the first spare moment I can command after I reach town The boy will not be fit to move for some time to come and so good bye You don t know where they are going to send you I cannot frame even a conjecture sighed Upton languidly I ought to be in the Brazils for a week or so about that slave question and then the sooner I reach Constantinople the better Sha n t they want you at Paris asked Harcourt who felt a kind of quiet vengeance in developing what he deemed the weak vanity of the other Yes sighed he again but I can t be everywhere And so saying he lounged away while it would have taken a far more subtle listener than Harcourt to say whether he was mystifying the other or the dupe of his own self esteem CHAPTER XVIII BILLY TRAYNOR AS ORATOR Three weeks rolled over an interval not without its share of interest for the inhabitants of the little village of Leenane since on one morning mister Craggs had made his appearance on his way to Clifden and after an absence of two days returned to the Castle The subject for popular discussion and surmise had not yet declined when a boat was seen to leave Glencore heavily laden with trunks and travelling gear and as she neared the land the lord was detected amongst the passengers looking very ill almost dying he passed up the little street of the village scarcely noticing the uncovered heads which saluted him respectfully Indeed he scarcely lifted up his eyes and as the acute observers remarked never once turned a glance towards the opposite shore where the Castle stood He had not reached the end of the village when a chaise with four horses arrived at the spot No time was lost in arranging the trunks and portmanteaus and Lord Glencore sat moodily on a bank listlessly regarding what went forward At length Craggs came up and touching his cap in military fashion announced all was ready Lord Glencore arose slowly and looked languidly around him his features wore a mingled expression of weariness and anxiety like one not fully awakened from an oppressive dream He turned his eyes on the people who at a respectful distance stood around and in a voice of peculiar melancholy said Good bye A good journey to you my Lord and safe back again to us cried a number together Eh what what was that cried he suddenly and the tones were shrill and discordant in which he spoke A warning gesture from Craggs imposed silence on the crowd and not a word was uttered I thought they said something about coming back again muttered Glencore gloomily They were wishing you a good journey my Lord replied Craggs Oh that was it was it And so saying with bent down head he walked feebly forward and entered the carriage Craggs was speedily on the box and the next moment they were away It is no part of our task to dwell on the sage speculations and wise surmises of the village on this event They had not it is true much evidence before them but they were hardy guessers and there was very little within the limits of possibility which they did not summon to the aid of their imaginations All however were tolerably agreed upon one point that to leave the place while the young lord was still unable to quit his bed and too weak to sit up was unnatural and unfeeling traits which after all they thought not very surprising since the likes of them lords never cared for anybody Colonel Harcourt still remained at Glencore and under his rigid sway the strictest blockade of the coast was maintained nor was any intercourse whatever permitted with the village A boat from the Castle meeting another from Leenane half way in the lough received the letters and whatever other resources the village supplied All was done with the rigid exactness of a quarantine regulation and if the mainland had been scourged with plague stricter measures of exclusion could scarcely have been enforced In comparison with the present occupant of the Castle the late one was a model of amiability and the village as is the wont in the case now discovered a vast number of good qualities in the lord when they had lost him After a while however the guesses the speculations and the comparisons all died away and the Castle of Glencore was as much dreamland to their imaginations as seen across the lough in the dim twilight of an autumn evening its towers might have appeared to their eyes It was about a month after Lord Glencore s departure of a fine soft evening in summer Billy Traynor suddenly appeared in the village Billy was one of a class who whatever their rank in life are always what Coleridge would have called noticeable men He was soon therefore surrounded with a knot of eager and inquiring friends all solicitous to know something of the life he was leading what they were doing beyant at the Castle It s a mighty quiet studious kind of life said Billy but agrees with me wonderfully for I may say that until now I never was able to give my janius fair play Professional life is the ruin of the student and being always obleeged to be thinkin of the bags destroyed my taste for letters A grin of self approval at his own witticism closed this speech But is it true Billy the lord is going to break up house entirely and not come back here asked Peter Slevin the sacristan whose rank and station warranted his assuming the task of cross questioner There s various ways of breakin up a house said Billy Ye may do so in a moral sinse or in a physical sinse you may obliterate or extinguish or without going so far you may simply obfuscate do you perceave Yes said the sacristan on whom every eye was now bent to see if he was able to follow subtleties that had outwitted the rest And whin I say obfuscate resumed Billy I open a question of disputed etymology bekase tho Lucretius thinks the word obfuscator original there s many supposes it comes from ob and fucus the dye the ancients used in their wool as we find in Horace lana fuco medicata while Cicero employs it in another sense and says facere fucum which is as much as to say humbuggin somebody do ye mind Begorra he might guess that anyhow muttered a shrewd little tailor with a significance that provoked hearty laughter And now continued Billy with an air of triumph we ll proceed to the next point Ye needn t trouble yerself then said Terry Lynch for Peter has gone home And so to the amusement of the meeting it turned out to be the case the sacristan had retired from the controversy Come in here to missus Moore s Billy and take a glass with us said Terry it isn t often we see you in these parts If the honorable company will graciously vouchsafe and condescind to let me trate them to a half gallon said Billy it will be the proudest event of my terrestrial existence The proposition was received with a cordial enthusiasm flattering to all concerned and in a few minutes after Billy Traynor sat at the head of a long table in the neat parlor of The Griddle with a company of some fifteen or sixteen very convivially disposed friends around him If I was Caesar or Lucretius or Nebuchadnezzar I couldn t be prouder said Billy as he looked down the board And let moralists talk as they will there s a beautiful expansion of sentiment there s a fine genial overflowin of the heart in gatherin s like this where we mingle our feelin s and our philosophy and our love and our learning walk hand in hand like brothers pass the sperits mister Shea If we look to the ancient writers what do we see Lemons bring in some lemons Mickey What do we see I say but that the very highest enjoyment of the haythen gods was Hot wather why won t they send in more hot wather Begorra if I was a haythen god I d like a little whisky in it muttered Terry dryly Where was I asked Billy a little disconcerted by this sally and the laugh it excited I was expatiatin upon celestial convivialities The nodes coenoeque deum them elegant hospitalities where wisdom was moistened with nectar and wit washed down with ambrosia It is not by coorse to be expected continued he modestly that we mere mortials can compete with them elegant refections But as Ovid says we can at least diem jucundam decipere The unknown tongue had now restored to Billy all the reverence and respect of his auditory and he continued to expatiate very eloquently on the wholesome advantages to be derived from convivial intercourse both amongst gods and men rather slyly intimating that either on the score of the fluids or the conversation his own leanings lay towards the humanities For after all said he tis our own wakenesses is often the source of our most refined enjoyments No missus Cassidy ye need n t be blushin I m considerin my subject in a high ethnological and metaphysical sinse missus Cassidy s confusion and the mirth it excited here interrupted the orator The meeting is never tired of hearin you Billy said Terry Lynch but if it was plazin to ye to give us a song we d enjoy it greatly Ah said Billy with a sigh I have taken my partin kiss with the Muses non mihi licet increpare digitis lyram No more to feel poetic fire No more to touch the soundin lyre But wiser coorses to begin I now forsake my violin An honest outburst of regret and sorrow broke from the assembly who eagerly pressed for an explanation of this calamitous change The thing is this said Billy if a man is a creature of mere leisure and amusement the fine arts and by the fine arts I mean music paintin and the ladies is an elegant and very refined subject of cultivation but when you raise your cerebrial faculties to grander and loftier considerations to explore the difficult ragions of polemic or political truth to investigate the subtleties of the schools and penetrate the mysteries of science then take my word for it the fine arts is just snares devil a more than snares And whether it is soft sounds seduces you or elegant tints or the union of both women I mane you ll never arrive at anything great or tri um phant till you wane yourself away from the likes of them vanities Look at the haythen mythology consider for a moment who is the chap that represents Music a lame blackguard with an ugly face they call Pan Ay indeed Pan If you wanted to see what respect they had for the art it s easy enough to guess when this crayture represints it and as to Paintin on my conscience they have n t a god at all that ever took to the brush Pass up the sperits Mickey said he somewhat blown and out of breath by this effort Maybe said he I m wearin you No no no loudly responded the meeting Maybe I m imposin too much of personal details on the house added he pompously Not at all never a bit cried the company Because resumed he slowly if I did so I d have at least the excuse of say in like the great Pitt These may be my last words from this place An unfeigned murmur of sorrow ran through the meeting and he resumed Ay ladies and gintlemin Billy Traynor is takin his farewell benefit he s not humbuggin I m not like them chaps that s always positively goin but stays on at the unanimous request of the whole world No I m really goin to leave you What for Where to Billy broke from a number of voices together I ll tell ye said he at least so far as I can tell because it would n t be right nor decent to print the whole of the papers for the house as they say in parliamint I m going abroad with the young lord we are going to improve our minds and cultivate our janiuses by study and foreign travel We are first to settle in Germany where we re to enter a University and commince a coorse of modern tongues French Sweadish and Spanish imbibin at the same time a smatterin of science such as chemistry conchology and the use of the globes Oh dear oh dear murmured the meeting in wonder and admiration I m not goin to say that we ll neglect mechanics metaphysics and astrology for we mane to be cosmonopolists in knowledge As for myself ladies and gintlemin it s a proud day that sees me standin here to say these words I that was ragged without a shoe to my foot without breeches never mind I was as the poet says nudus nummis ac vestimentis I have n t sixpence in my pack I have n t small clothes to my back carryin the bag many a weary mile through sleet and snow for six pounds tin per annum and no pinsion for wounds or superannuation and now I m to be it is n t easy to say what to the young lord a spacies of humble companion not maniai do you mind nothing manial what the Latins called a famulus which was quite a different thing from a servus The former bein a kind of domestic adviser a deputy assistant monitor general as a body might say There now if I discoorsed for a month I could n t tell you more about myself and my future prospects I own to you that I m proud of my good luck and I would n t exchange it to be Emperor of Jamaica or King of the Bahamia Islands If we have been prolix in our office of reporter to Billy Traynor our excuse is that his discourse will have contributed so far to the reader s enlightenment as to save us the task of recapitulation At the same time it is but justice to the accomplished orator that we should say we have given but the most meagre outline of an address which to use the newspaper phrase occupied three hours in the delivery The truth was Billy was in vein the listeners were patient the punch strong nor is it every speaker who has had the good fortune of such happy accessories CHAPTER XIX THE CASCINE AT FLORENCE It was spring and in Italy one of those half dozen days at very most when the feeling of winter departed a gentle freshness breathes through the air trees stir softly and as if by magic the earth becomes carpeted with flowers whose odors seem to temper as it were the exciting atmosphere An occasional cloud fleecy and jagged sails lazily aloft marking its shadow on the mountain side In a few days a few hours perhaps the blue sky will be unbroken the air hushed a hot breath will move among the leaves or pant over the trickling fountains In this fast flitting period we dare not call it season the Cascine of Florence is singularly beautiful on one side the gentle river stealing past beneath the shadowing foliage on the other the picturesque mountain towards Fiesole dotted with its palaces and terraced gardens The ancient city itself is partly seen and the massive Duomo and the Palazzo Vecchio tower proudly above the trees What other people of Europe have such a haunt what other people would know so thoroughly how to enjoy it The day was drawing to a close and the Piazzone was now filled with equipages There were the representatives of every European people and of nations far away over the seas splendid Russians brilliant French splenetic supercilious English and ponderous Germans mingled with the less marked nationalities of Belgium and Holland and even America Everything that called itself Fashion was there to swell the tide and although a choice military band was performing with exquisite skill the favorite overtures of the day the noise and tumult of conversation almost drowned their notes Now the Cascine is to the world of society what the Bourse is to the world of trade It is the great centre of all news and intelligence where markets and bargains of intercourse are transacted and where the scene of past pleasure is revived and the plans of future enjoyment are canvassed The great and the wealthy are there to see and to meet with each other The proud equipages lie side by side like great liners while phaetons like fast frigates shoot swiftly by and solitary dandies flit past in varieties of conveyance to which sea craft can offer no analogies All are busy eager and occupied Scandal holds here its festival and the misdeeds of every capital of Europe are now being discussed The higher themes of politics occupy but few the interests of literature attract still less It is essentially of the world they talk and it must be owned they do it like adepts The last witticism of Paris the last duel at Berlin who has fled from his creditors in England who has run away from her husband at Naples all are retailed with a serious circumstantiality that would lead one to believe that gossip maintained its own correspondent in every city of the Continent Moralists might fancy perhaps that in the tone these subjects are treated they would mingle a reprobation of the bad and a due estimate of the opposite if it ever occurred at all but as surely would they be disappointed Never were censors more lenient never were critics so charitable The transgressions against good breeding the gaucheries of manner the solecisms in dress language or demeanor do indeed meet with sharp reproof and cutting sarcasm but in recompense for such severity how gently do they deal with graver offences For the felonies they can always discover the attenuating circumstances for the petty larcenies of fashion they have nothing but whipcord Amidst the various knots where such discussions were carried on one was eminently conspicuous It was around a handsome open carriage whose horses harnessing and liveries were all in the most perfect taste The equipage might possibly have been deemed showy in Hyde Park but in the Bois de Boulogne or the Cascine it must be pronounced the acme of elegance Whatever might have been the differences of national opinion on this point there could assuredly have been none as to the beauty of those who occupied it Though a considerable interval of years divided them the aunt and her niece had a wonderful resemblance to each other They were both the rarest of all forms of beauty blond Italians that is with light hair and soft gray eyes They had a peculiar tint of skin deeper and mellower than we see in Northern lands and an expression of mingled seriousness and softness that only pertains to the South of Europe There was a certain coquetry in the similarity of their dress which in many parts was precisely alike and although the niece was but fifteen and the aunt above thirty it needed not the aid of flattery to make many mistake one for the other Beauty like all other Beaux Arts has its distinctions The same public opinion that enthrones the sculptor or the musician confers its crown on female loveliness and by this acclaim were they declared Queens of Beauty To any one visiting Italy for the first time there would have seemed something very strange in the sort of homage rendered them a reverence and respect only accorded elsewhere to royalties a deference that verged on actual humiliation and yet all this blended with a subtle familiarity that none but an Italian can ever attain to The uncovered head the attitude of respectful attention the patient expectancy of notice the glad air of him under recognition were all there and yet through these there was dashed a strange tone of intimacy as though the observances were but a thin crust over deeper feelings La Contessa for she was especially the Countess as one illustrious man of our own country was the Duke possessed every gift which claims preeminence in this fair city She was eminently beautiful young charming in her manners with ample fortune and lastly ah good reader you would surely be puzzled to supply that lastly the more as we say that in it lies an excellence without which all the rest are of little worth and yet with it are objects of worship almost of adoration she was separated from her husband There must have been an epidemic a kind of rot among husbands at one period for we scarcely remember a very pretty woman from five and twenty to five and thirty who had not been obliged to leave hers from acts of cruelty or acts of brutality et cetera that only husbands are capable of or of which their poor wives are ever the victims If the moral geography of Europe be ever written the region south of the Alps will certainly be colored with that tint whatever it be that describes the blessedness of a divorced existence In other lands especially in our own the separated individual labors under no common difficulty in his advances to society The story there must be a story of his separation is told in various ways all of course to his disparagement Tyrant or victim it is hard to say under which title he comes out best so much for the man but for the woman there is no plea judgment is pronounced at once without the merits Fugitive or fled from who inquires she is one that few men dare to recognize The very fact that to mention her name exacts an explanation is condemnatory What a boon to all such must it be that there is a climate mild enough for their malady and a country that will suit their constitution and not only that but a region which actually pays homage to their infirmity and makes of their martyrdom a triumph As you go to Norway for salmon fishing to Bengal to hunt tigers to saint Petersburg to eat caviare so when divorced if you really know the blessing of your state go take a house on the Arno Vast as are the material resources of our globe the moral ones are infinitely greater nor need we despair some day or other of finding an island where a certificate of fraudulent bankruptcy will be deemed a letter of credit and an evidence of insolvency be accepted as qualification to open a bank La Contessa inhabited a splendid palace furnished with magnificence her gardens were one of the sights of the capital not only for their floral display but that they contained a celebrated group by Canova of which no copy existed Her gallery was if not extensive enriched with some priceless treasures of art and with all these she possessed high rank for her card bore the name of La Comtesse de Glencore nee Comtesse della Torre The reader thus knows at once if not actually as much as we do ourselves all that we mean to impart to him and now let us come back to that equipage around which swarmed the fashion of Florence eagerly pressing forward to catch a word a smile or even a look and actually perched on every spot from which they could obtain a glimpse of those within A young Russian Prince with his arm in a sling had just recited the incident of his late duel a Neapolitan Minister had delivered a rose colored epistle from a Royal Highness of his own court A Spanish Grandee had deposited his offering of camellias which actually covered the front cushions of the carriage and now a little lane was formed for the approach of the old Duke de Brignolles who made his advance with a mingled courtesy and haughtiness that told of Versailles and long ago A very creditable specimen of the old noblesse of France was the Duke and well worthy to be the grandson of one who was Grand Marechal to Louis XIV Tall thin and slightly stooped from age his dark eye seemed to glisten the brighter beneath his shaggy white eyebrows He had served with distinction as a soldier and been an ambassador at the court of the Czar Paul in every station he had filled sustaining the character of a true and loyal gentleman a man who could reflect nothing but honor upon the great country he belonged to It was amongst the scandal of Florence that he was the most devoted of La Contessa s admirers but we are quite willing to believe that his admiration had nothing in it of love At all events she distinguished him by her most marked notice He was the frequent guest of her choicest dinners and the constant visitor at her evenings at home It was then with a degree of favor that many an envious heart coveted she extended her hand to him as he came forward which he kissed with all the lowly deference he would have shown to that of his prince Mon cher Duc said she smiling I have such a store of grievances to lay at your door The essence of violets is not violets but verbena Charming Comtesse I had it direct from Pierrot s Pierrot is a traitor then that s all and where s Ida s Arab is he to be here to day or to morrow When are we to see him Why I only wrote to the Emir on Tuesday last Mais a quoi bon l Emir if he can t do impossibilities Surely the very thought of him brings up the Arabian Nights and the Calif Haroun By the way thank you for the poignard It is true Damascus is it not Of course I d not have dared To be sure not I told the Archduchess it was I wore it in my Turkish dress on Wednesday and you false man would n t come to admire me You know what a sad day was that for me madam said he solemnly It was the anniversary of her fate who was your only rival in beauty as she had no rival in undeserved misfortunes Pauvre Reine sighed the Countess and held her bouquet to her face What great mass of papers is that you have there Duke resumed she Can it be a journal It is an English newspaper my dear Countess As I know you do not receive any of his countrymen I have not asked your permission to present the Lord Selby but hearing him read out your name in a paragraph here I carried off his paper to have it translated for me You read English don t you Very imperfectly and I detest it said she impatiently but Prince Volkoffsky can I am sure oblige you And she turned away her head in ill humor It is here somewhere Parbleu I thought I marked the place muttered the Duke as he handed the paper to the Russian Is n t that it This is all about theatres Madame Pasta and the Haymarket Ah well it is lower down here perhaps Court news The Grand Duke of Saxe Weimar No no not that Oh here it is Great Scandal in High Life A very singular correspondence has just passed and will soon we believe be made public between the Heralds College and Lord Glencore Here the reader stopped and lowered his voice at the next word Read on Prince C est mon mari said she coldly while a very slight movement of her upper lip betrayed what might mean scorn or sorrow or even both The Prince however had now run his eyes over the paragraph and crushing the newspaper in his hand hurried away from the spot The Duke as quickly followed and soon overtook him Who gave you this paper Duke cried the Russian angrily It was Lord Selby He was reading it aloud to a friend Then he is an infame and I ll tell him so cried the other passionately Which is he the one with the light moustache or the shorter one And without waiting for reply the Russian dashed between the carriages and thrusting his way through the prancing crowd of moving horses arrived at a spot where two young men evidently strangers to the scene were standing calmly surveying the bright panorama before them The Lord Selby said the Russian taking off his hat and saluting one of them That s his Lordship replied the one he addressed pointing to his friend I am the Prince Volkoffsky aide de camp to the Emperor said the Russian and hearing from my friend the Duke de Brignolles that you have just given him this newspaper that he might obtain the translation of a passage in it which concerns Lady Glencore and have the explanation read out at her own carriage publicly before all the world I desire to tell you that your Lordship is unworthy of your rank that you are an infame and if you do not resent this a polisson This man is mad Selby said the short man with the coolest air imaginable Quite sane enough to give your friend a lesson in good manners and you too sir if you have any fancy for it said the Russian I d give him in charge to the police by Jove if there were police here said the same one who spoke before he can t be a gentleman There s my card sir said the Russian and for you too sir said he presenting another to him who spoke Where are you to be heard of said the short man At the Russian legation said the Prince haughtily and turned away You re wrong Baynton he is a gentleman said Lord Selby as he pocketed the card though certainly he is not a very mild tempered specimen of his order You did n t give the newspaper as he said Nothing of the kind I was reading it aloud to you when the royal carriages came suddenly past and in taking off my hat to salute I never noticed that the old Duke had carried off the paper I know he can t read English and the chances are he has asked this Scythian gentleman to interpret for him So then the affair is easily settled said the other quietly Of course it is was the answer and they both lounged about among the carriages which already were thinning and after a while set out towards the city They had but just reached the hotel when a stranger presented himself to them as the Count de Marny He had come as the friend of Prince Volkoffsky who had fully explained to him the event of that afternoon Well said Baynton we are of opinion your friend has conducted himself exceedingly ill and we are here to receive his excuses I am afraid messieurs said the Frenchman bowing that it will exhaust your patience if you continue to wait for them Might it not be better to come and accept what he is quite prepared to offer you satisfaction Be it so said Lord Selby he ll see his mistake some time or other and perhaps regret it Where shall it be and when At the Fossombroni Villa about two miles from this To morrow morning at eight if that suit you Quite well I have no other appointment Pistols of course You have the choice otherwise my friend would have preferred the sword Take him at his word Selby whispered Baynton you are equal to any of them with the rapier If your friend desire the sword I have no objection I mean the rapier The rapier be it said the Frenchman and with a polite assurance of the infinite honor he felt in forming their acquaintance and the gratifying certainty that they were sure to possess of his highest consideration he bowed backed and withdrew Well mannered fellow the Frenchman said Baynton as the door closed and the other nodded assent and rang the bell for dinner CHAPTER XX THE VILLA FOSSOMBRONI The grounds of the Villa Fossombroni were at the time we speak of the Chalk Farm or the Fifteen Acres of Tuscany The villa itself long since deserted by the illustrious family whose name it bore had fallen into the hands of an old Pied montese noble ruined by a long life of excess and dissipation He had served with gallantry in the imperial army of France but was dismissed the service for a play transaction in which his conduct was deeply disgraceful and the Colonel Count Tasseroni of the eighth Hussars of the Guards was declared unworthy to wear the uniform of a Frenchman For a number of years he had lived so estranged from the world that many believed he had died but at last it was known that he had gone to reside in a half ruined villa near Florence which soon became the resort of a certain class of gamblers whose habits would have speedily attracted notice if practised within the city The quarrels and altercations so inseparable from high play were usually settled on the spot in which they occurred until at last the villa became famous for these meetings and the name of Fossombroni in a discussion was the watchword for a duel It was of a splendid spring morning that the two Englishmen arrived at this spot which even on the unpleasant errand that they had come struck them with surprise and admiration The villa itself was one of those vast structures which the country about Florence abounds in Gloomy stern and jail like without while within splendid apartments opened into each other in what seems an endless succession Frescoed walls and gorgeously ornamented ceilings gilded mouldings and rich tracery were on every side and these too in chambers where the immense proportions and the vast space recalled the idea of a royal residence Passing in by a dilapidated grille which once had been richly gilded they entered by a flight of steps a great hall which ran the entire length of the building Though lighted by a double range of windows neglect and dirt had so dimmed the panes that the place was almost in deep shadow Still they could perceive that the vaulted roof was a mass of stuccoed tracery and that the colossal divisions of the wall were of brilliant Sienna marble At one end of this great gallery was a small chapel now partly despoiled of its religious decorations which were most irreverently replaced by a variety of swords and sabres of every possible size and shape and several pairs of pistols arranged with an evident eye to picturesque grouping What are all these inscriptions here on the walls Baynton cried Selby as he stood endeavoring to decipher the lines on a little marble slab a number of which were dotted over the chapel Strange enough this by Jove muttered the other reading to himself half aloud Francesco Ricordi ucciso da Gieronimo Gazzi twenty nine Settembre eighteen eighteen What does that mean asked Selby It is to commemorate some fellow who was killed here in eighteen Are they all in the same vein asked the other It would seem so Here s one Gravamente ferito badly wounded with a postscript that he died the same night What s this large one here in black marble inquired Selby To the memory of Carlo Luigi Guiccidrini detto il Carnefice called the slaughterer cut down to the forehead by Pietro Baldasseroni on the night of July eighth eighteen nineteen I confess any other kind of literature would amuse me as well said Selby turning back again into the large hall Baynton had scarcely joined him when they saw advancing towards them through the gloom a short thickset man dressed in a much worn dressing gown and slippers He removed his skull cap as he approached and said The Count Tasseroni at your orders We have come here by appointment said Baynton Yes yes I know it all Volkoffsky sent me word He was here on Saturday He gave that French colonel a sharp lesson Ran the sword clean through the chest To be sure he was wounded too but only through the arm but La Marque has got his passport You ll have him up there soon then said Baynton pointing towards the chapel I think not We have not done it latterly said the Count musingly The authorities don t seem to like it and of course we respect the authorities That s quite evident said Baynton who turned to translate the observation to his friend Selby whispered a word in his ear What does the signore say inquired the Count My friend thinks that they are behind the time Per Baccho Let him be easy as to that I have known some to think that the Russian came too soon I never heard of one who wished him earlier There they are now they always come by the garden And so saying he hastened off to receive them How is this fellow to handle a sword if his right arm be wounded said Selby Don t you know that these Russians use the left hand indifferently with the right in all exercises It may be awkward for you but depend upon it he ll not be inconvenienced in the least As he spoke the others entered the other end of the hall The Prince no sooner saw the Englishmen than he advanced towards them with his hat off My lord said he rapidly I have come to make you an apology and one which I trust you will accept in all the frankness that I offer it I have learned from your friend the Duc de Brignolles how the incident of yesterday occurred I see that the only fault committed was my own Will you pardon then a momentary word of ill temper occasioned by what I wrongfully believed to be a great injury Of course I knew it was all a mistake on your part I told Colonel Baynton here you d see so yourself when it is too late perhaps I thank you sincerely said the Russian bowing your readiness to accord me this satisfaction makes your forgiveness more precious to me And now as another favor will you permit me to ask you one question Yes certainly Why when you could have so easily explained this misconception on my part did you not take the trouble of doing so Selby looked confused blushed looked awkwardly from side to side and then with a glance towards his friend seemed to say Will you try and answer him I think you have hit it yourself Prince said Baynton It was the trouble the bore of an explanation deterred him He hates writing and he thought there would be a shower of notes to be replied to meetings discussions and what not and so he said Let him have his shot and have done with it The Russian looked from one to the other as he listened and seemed really as if not quite sure whether this speech was uttered in seriousness or sarcasm The calm phlegmatic faces of the Englishmen the almost apathetic expression they wore soon convinced him that the words were truthfully spoken and he stood actually confounded with amazement before them Lord Selby and his friend freely accepted the polite invitation of the Prince to breakfast and they all adjourned to a small but splendidly decorated room where everything was already awaiting them There are few incidents in life which so much predispose to rapid intimacy as the case of an averted duel The revulsion from animosity is almost certain to lead to if not actual friendship what may easily become so In the present instance the very diversities of national character gave a zest and enjoyment to the meeting and while the Englishmen were charmed by the fascination of manners and conversational readiness of their hosts the Russians were equally struck with a cool imperturbability and impassiveness of which they had never seen the equal By degrees the Russian led the conversation to the question by which their misunderstanding originated You know my Lord Glencore perhaps said he Never saw scarcely ever heard of him said Selby in his dry laconic tone Is he mad or a fool asked the Prince half angrily I served in a regiment once where he commanded a troop said Baynton and they always said he was a good sort of fellow You read that paragraph this morning I conclude said the Russian You saw how he dares to stigmatize the honor of his wife to degrade her to the rank of a mistress and at the same time to bastardize the son who ought to inherit his rank and title I read it said Selby dryly and I had a letter from my lawyer about it this morning Indeed exclaimed he anxious to hear more and yet too delicate to venture on a question Yes he writes to me for some title deeds or other I did n t pay much attention exactly to what he says Glen core s man of business had addressed a letter to him The Russian bowed and waited for him to resume but apparently he had rather fatigued himself by such unusual loquacity and so he lay back in his chair and puffed his cigar in indolent enjoyment A goodish sort of thing for you it ought to be said Baynton between the puffs of his tobacco smoke and with a look towards Selby I suspect it may said the other without the slightest change of tone or demeanor Where is it somewhere in the south Mostly Devon There s something in Wales too if I remember aright Nothing Irish No thank Heaven nothing Irish and his grim Lordship made the nearest advance to a smile of which his unplastic features seemed capable Do I understand you aright my Lord said the Prince that you receive an accession of fortune by this event I shall if I survive Glencore was the brief reply You are related then Some cousinship I forget how it is Do you remember Baynton I m not quite certain I think it was a Coventry married one of Jack Conway s sisters and she afterwards became the wife of Sir something Massy Isn t that it Yes that s it muttered the other in the tone of a man who was tired of a knotty problem And according to your laws this Lord Glencore may marry again cried the Russian I should think so if he has no wife living said Selby but I trust for my sake he ll not And what if he should and should be discovered the wedded husband of another That would be bigamy said Selby Would they hang him Baynton I think not scarcely rejoined the Colonel The Prince tried in various ways to obtain some insight into Lord Glencore s habits his tastes and mode of life but all in vain They knew indeed very little but even that little they were too indolent to repeat Lord Selby s memory was often at fault too and Baynton s had ill supplied the deficiency Again and again did the Russian mutter curses to himself over the apathy of these stony islanders At moments he fancied that they suspected his eagerness and had assumed their most guarded caution against him but he soon perceived that this manner was natural to them not prompted in the slightest degree by any distrust whatever After all thought the Russian how can I hope to stimulate a man who is not excited by his own increase of fortune Talk of Turkish fatalism these fellows would shame the Moslem Do you mean to prolong your stay at Florence my Lord asked the Prince as they arose from the table I scarcely know What do you say Baynton A week or so I fancy muttered the other And then on to Rome perhaps The two Englishmen looked at each other with an air of as much confusion as if subjected to a searching examination in science Well I shouldn t wonder said Selby at last with a sigh Yes it may come to that said Baynton like a man who had just overcome a difficulty You ll be in time for the Holy Week and all the ceremonies said the Prince Mind that Baynton said his Lordship who wasn t going to carry what he felt to be another man s load and Baynton nodded acquiescence And after that comes the season for Naples you have a month or six weeks perhaps of such weather as nothing in all Europe can vie with You hear Baynton said Selby I ve booked it muttered the other and so they took leave of their entertainer and set out towards Florence Neither you nor I dear reader will gain anything by keeping them company for they say scarcely a word by the way They stop at intervals and cast their eyes over the glorious landscape at their feet Their glances are thrown over the fairest scene of the fairest of all lands and whether they turn towards the snow captain Apennines by Vall ombrosa or trace the sunny vineyards along the Val d Arno they behold a picture such as no canvas ever imitated still they are mute and uncommunicative Whatever of pleasure their thoughts suggest each keeps for himself Objects of wonder strange sights and new may present themselves but they are not to be startled out of national dignity by so ignoble a sentiment as surprise And so they jog onward doubtless richer in reflection than eloquent in communion and so we leave them Let us not be deemed unjust or ungenerous if we assert that we have met many such as these They are not individuals they are a class and strange enough too a class which almost invariably pertains to a high and distinguished rank in society It would be presumptuous to ascribe such demeanor to insensibility There is enough in their general conduct to disprove the assumption As little is it affectation it is simply an acquired habit of stoical indifference supposed to be why Heaven knows the essential ingredient of the best breeding If the practice extinguish all emotion and obliterate all trace of feeling from the heart we deplore the system If it only gloss over the working of human sympathy we pity the men At all events they are very uninteresting company with whom longer dalliance would only be wearisome CHAPTER XXI 
7495_252341_000000_000001	train-clean-360	SOME TRAITS OF LIFE
7495_252341_000001_000000	train-clean-360	It was the night Lady Glencore received and as usual the street was crowded with equipages which somehow seemed to have got into inextricable confusion some endeavoring to turn back while others pressed forward the court of the palace being closely packed with carriages which the thronged street held in fast blockade 
7495_252341_000001_000001	train-clean-360	As the apartments which faced the street were not ever used for these receptions the dark unlighted windows suggested no remark but they who had entered the courtyard were struck by the gloomy aspect of the vast building not only that the entrance and the stairs were in darkness but the whole suite of rooms usually brilliant as the day were now in deep gloom 
7495_252341_000001_000002	train-clean-360	From every carriage window heads were protruded wondering at this strange spectacle and eager inquiries passed on every side for an explanation 
7495_252341_000001_000003	train-clean-360	The explanation of sudden illness was rapidly disseminated but as rapidly contradicted and the reply given by the porter to all demands quickly repeated from mouth to mouth Her Ladyship will not receive 
none	none	Can no one explain this mystery cried the old Princess Borinsky as heavy with fat and diamonds she hung out of her carriage window Oh there s Major Scaresby he is certain to know if it be anything malicious 
7495_252341_000003_000000	train-clean-360	Scaresby was however too busy in recounting his news to others to perceive the signals the old Princess held out and it was only as her chasseur six feet three of green and gold bent down to give her Highness s message that the Major hurried off in all the importance of a momentary scandal to the side of her carriage 
7495_252341_000004_000000	train-clean-360	 Here I am all impatience 
7495_252341_000004_000001	train-clean-360	What is it Scaresby 
none	none	Tell me quickly cried she A smash my dear Princess nothing more or less said he in a voice which nature seemed to have invented to utter impertinences so harsh and grating and yet so painfully distinct in all its accents as complete a smash as ever I heard of
7495_252341_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 You can t mean that her fortune is in peril 
7495_252341_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 I suppose that must suffer also 
none	none	It is her character her station as one of us that s shipwrecked here Go on go on cried she impatiently I wish to hear it all
7495_252341_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 All is very briefly related then said he 
7495_252341_000009_000001	train-clean-360	 The charming Countess you remember ran away with a countryman of mine young Glencore of the eighth Hussars I used to know his father intimately 
7495_252341_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 Never mind his father 
none	none	That s exactly what Glencore did 
7495_252341_000011_000001	train-clean-360	He came over here and fell in love with the girl and they ran off together but they forgot to get married Princess 
none	none	Ha ha ha And he laughed with a cackle a demon could not have rivalled
7495_252341_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t believe a word of it I ll never believe it cried the Princess 
7495_252341_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 That s exactly what I was recommending to the Mar quesa Guesteni 
7495_252341_000013_000001	train-clean-360	I said you need n t believe it 
7495_252341_000013_000002	train-clean-360	Why how do we go anywhere nowadays except by not believing the evil stories that are told of our entertainers 
none	none	Yes yes but I repeat that this is an infamous calumny 
7495_252341_000014_000001	train-clean-360	She a Countess of a family second to none in all Italy her father a Grand d Espagne 
none	none	I ll go to her this moment
7495_252341_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 She ll not see you 
none	none	She has just refused to see La Genori said the Major tartly Though if a cracked reputation might have afforded any sympathy she might have admitted her
7495_252341_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 What is to be done exclaimed the Princess sorrowfully 
7495_252341_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 Just what you suggested a few moments ago don t believe it 
7495_252341_000017_000001	train-clean-360	Hang me but good houses and good cooks are growing too scarce to make one credulous of the ills that can be said of their owners 
none	none	I wish I knew what course to take muttered the Princess
7495_252341_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 I ll tell you then 
none	none	Get half a dozen of your own set together to morrow morning vote the whole story an atrocious falsehood and go in a body and tell the Countess your mind 
7495_252341_000019_000002	train-clean-360	You know as well as I Princess that social credit is as great a bubble as commercial we should all of us be bankrupts if our books were seen 
none	none	Ay by Jove and the similitude goes farther too for when one old established house breaks there is generally a crash in the whole community around it While they thus talked a knot had gathered around the carriage all eager to hear what opinion the Princess had formed on the catastrophe 
7495_252341_000021_000000	train-clean-360	Various were the sentiments expressed by the different speakers some sorrowfully deploring the disaster others more eagerly inveighing against the infamy of the man who had proclaimed it 
7495_252341_000021_000001	train-clean-360	Many declared that they had come to the determination to discredit the story 
7495_252341_000021_000002	train-clean-360	Not one however sincerely professed that he disbelieved it 
none	none	Can it be as the French moralist asserts that we have a latent sense of satisfaction in the misfortunes of even our best friends or is it as we rather suspect that true friendship is a rarer thing than is commonly believed and has little to do with those conventional intimacies which so often bear its name Assuredly of all this well bred well dressed and wellborn company now thronging the courtyard of the palace and the street in front of it the tone was as much sarcasm as sorrow and many a witty epigram and smart speech were launched over a disaster which might have been spared such levity 
7495_252341_000023_000001	train-clean-360	At length the space slowly began to thin 
none	none	Slowly carriage after carriage drove off the heaviest grief of their occupants often being over a lost soiree an unprofited occasion to display toilette and jewels while a few more reflective discussed what course was to be followed in future and what recognition extended to the victim 
7495_252341_000024_000000	train-clean-360	The next day Florence sat in committee over the lost Countess 
7495_252341_000024_000001	train-clean-360	Witnesses were heard and evidence taken as to her case 
7495_252341_000024_000002	train-clean-360	They all agreed it was a great hardship a terrible calamity but still if true what could be done 
7495_252341_000025_000000	train-clean-360	Never was there a society less ungenerously prudish and yet there were cases this one of them which transgressed all conventional rule Like a crime which no statute had ever contemplated it stood out self accused and self condemned 
7495_252341_000025_000001	train-clean-360	A few might perhaps have been merciful but they were overborne by numbers 
7495_252341_000025_000002	train-clean-360	Lady Glencore s beauty and her vast fortune were now counts in the indictment against her and many a jealous rival was not sorry at this hour of humiliation 
7495_252341_000025_000003	train-clean-360	The despotism of beauty is not a very mild sway after all and perhaps the Countess had exercised her rule right royally 
none	none	At all events it was the young and the good looking who voted her exclusion and only those who could not enter into competition with her charms who took the charitable side 
7495_252341_000025_000005	train-clean-360	They discussed and debated the question all day but while they hesitated over the reprieve the prisoner was beyond the law 
7495_252341_000025_000006	train-clean-360	The gate of the palace locked and barred all day refused entrance to every one at night it opened to admit the exit of a travelling carriage 
7495_252341_000025_000007	train-clean-360	The next morning large bills of sale posted over the walls declared that all the furniture and decorations were to be sold 
none	none	The Countess had left Florence none knew whither
7495_252341_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 I must really have those large Sevres jars said one 
7495_252341_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 And I the small park phaeton cried another 
7495_252341_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 I hope she has not taken Horace with her he was the best cook in Italy 
7495_252341_000029_000001	train-clean-360	Splendid hock she had I wonder is there much of it left 
7495_252341_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 I wish we were certain of another bad reputation to replace her grunted out Scaresby they are the only kind of people who give good dinners and never ask for returns 
none	none	And thus these dear friends guests of a hundred brilliant fetes discussed the fall of her they once had worshipped 
7495_252341_000032_000000	train-clean-360	It may seem small minded and narrow to stigmatize such conduct as this Some may say that for the ordinary courtesies of society no pledges of friendship are required no real gratitude incurred 
none	none	Be it so 
7495_252341_000032_000002	train-clean-360	Still the revulsion from habits of deference and respect to disparagement and even sarcasm is a sorry evidence of human kindness and the threshold over which for years we had only passed as guests might well suggest sadder thoughts as we tread it to behold desolation 
none	none	The fair Countess had been the celebrity of that city for many a day The stranger of distinction sought her as much as a matter of course as he sought presentation to the sovereign Her salons had the double eminence of brilliancy in rank and brilliancy in wit her entertainments were cited as models of elegance and refinement and now she was gone The extreme of regret that followed her was the sorrow of those who were to dine there no more the grief of him who thought he should never have a house like it The respectable vagabonds of society are a large family much larger than is usually supposed 
7495_252341_000034_000001	train-clean-360	They are often well born almost always well mannered invariably well dressed 
7495_252341_000034_000002	train-clean-360	They do not at first blush appear to discharge any very great or necessary function in life but we must by no means from that infer their inutility 
7495_252341_000034_000003	train-clean-360	Naturalists tell us that several varieties of insect existence we rashly set down as mere annoyances have their peculiar spheres of usefulness and good and doubtless these same loungers contribute in some mysterious manner to the welfare of that state which they only seem to burden 
none	none	We are told that but for flies for instance we should be infested with myriads of winged tormentors insinuating themselves into our meat and drink and rendering life miserable Is there not something very similar performed by the respectable class I allude to 
7495_252341_000034_000006	train-clean-360	Are they not invariably devouring and destroying some vermin a little smaller than themselves and making thus a healthier atmosphere for their betters 
none	none	If good society only knew the debt it owes to these defenders of its privileges a Vagabonds Home and Aged Asylum would speedily figure amongst bur national charities We have been led to these thoughts by observing how distinctly different was Major Scaresby s tone in talking of the Countess when he addressed his betters or spoke in his own class 
7495_252341_000035_000001	train-clean-360	To the former he gave vent to all his sarcasm and bitterness they liked it just because they would n t condescend to it themselves 
none	none	To his own he put on the bullying air of one who said How should you possibly know what vices such great people have any more than you know what they have for dinner I live amongst them I understand them I am aware that what would be very shocking in you is quite permissible to them They know how to be wicked you only know how to be gross And thus Scaresby talked and sneered and scoffed making such a hash of good and evil such a Maelstrom of right and wrong that it were a subtle moralist who could have extracted one solitary scrap of uncontaminated meaning from all his muddy lucubrations 
7495_252341_000036_000000	train-clean-360	He however effected this much he kept the memory of her who had gone alive by daily calumnies 
none	none	He embalmed her in poisons each morning appearing with some new trait of her extravagance till the world grown sick of himself and his theme vowed they would hear no more of either and so she was forgotten Ay good reader utterly forgotten 
7495_252341_000037_000001	train-clean-360	The gay world for so it likes to be called has no greater element of enjoyment amongst all its high gifts than its precious power of forgetting 
7495_252341_000037_000002	train-clean-360	It forgets not only all it owes to others gratitude honor and esteem but even the closer obligations it has contracted with itself 
7495_252341_000037_000003	train-clean-360	The Palazzo della Torre was for a fortnight the resort of the curious and the idle 
none	none	At the sale crowds appeared to secure some object of especial value to each and then the gates were locked the shutters closed and a large ill written notice on the door announced that any letters for the proprietor were to be addressed to Pietro Arretini Via del Sole 
7495_252342_000001_000000	train-clean-360	CHAPTER XXII 
none	none	AN UPTONIAN DESPATCH 
7495_252342_000002_000000	train-clean-360	British Legation Naples 
none	none	My dear Harcourt It would seem that a letter of mine to you must have miscarried a not unfrequent occurrence when entrusted to our Foreign Office for transmission 
7495_252342_000002_000002	train-clean-360	Should it ever reach you you will perceive how unjustly you have charged me with neglecting your wishes 
7495_252342_000002_000003	train-clean-360	I have ordered the Sicilian wine for your friend I have obtained the Royal leave for you to shoot in Calabria and I assure you it is rather a rare incident in my life to have forgotten nothing required of me 
none	none	Perhaps you who know me well will do me this justice and be the more grateful for my present promptitude It was quite a mistake sending me here for anything there is to be done Spencer or Lonsdale would perfectly suffice I ought to have gone to Vienna and so they know at home but it s the old game played over again 
7495_252342_000003_000002	train-clean-360	Important questions 
7495_252342_000003_000003	train-clean-360	why my dear friend there is not a matter between this country and our own that rises above the capacity of a Colonel of Dragoons 
7495_252342_000003_000004	train-clean-360	Meanwhile really great events are preparing in the East of Europe not that I am going to inflict them upon you nor ask you to listen to speculations which even those in authority turn a deaf ear to 
7495_252342_000004_000000	train-clean-360	It is very kind of you to think of my health 
7495_252342_000004_000001	train-clean-360	I am still a sufferer the old pains rather aggravated than relieved by this climate 
7495_252342_000004_000002	train-clean-360	You are aware that though warm the weather here has some exciting property some excess or other of a peculiar gas in the atmosphere prejudicial to certain temperaments 
7495_252342_000004_000003	train-clean-360	I feel it greatly and though the season is midsummer I am obliged to dress entirely in a light costume of buckskin and take Marsalla baths which refresh me at least for the while 
7495_252342_000004_000004	train-clean-360	I have also taken to smoke the leaves of the nux vomica steeped in arrack and think it agrees with me 
7495_252342_000004_000005	train-clean-360	The King has most kindly placed a little villa at Ischia at my disposal but I do not mean to avail myself of the politeness 
7495_252342_000004_000006	train-clean-360	The Duke of San Giustino has also offered me his palace at Baia but I don t fancy leaving this just now where there is a doctor a certain Luigi Buffeloni who really seems to have hit off my case 
7495_252342_000004_000007	train-clean-360	He calls it arterial arthriticis a kind of inflammatory action of one coat of the arterial system his notion is highly ingenious and wonderfully borne out by the symptoms 
7495_252342_000004_000008	train-clean-360	I wish you would ask Brodie or any of our best men whether they have met with this affection what class it affects and what course it usually takes My Italian doctor implies that it is the passing malady of men highly excitable and largely endowed with mental gifts 
7495_252342_000004_000009	train-clean-360	He may or may not be correct in this 
7495_252342_000004_000010	train-clean-360	It is only nature makes the blunder of giving the sharpest swords the weakest scabbards 
7495_252342_000004_000011	train-clean-360	What a pity the weapon cannot be worn naked 
none	none	You ask me if I like this place 
7495_252342_000005_000001	train-clean-360	I do perhaps as well as I should like anywhere 
7495_252342_000005_000002	train-clean-360	There is a wonderful sameness over the world just now preluding I have very little doubt some great outburst of nationality from all the countries of Europe just as periods of Puritanism succeed intervals of gross licentiousness 
none	none	Society here is therefore what you see it in London or Paris well bred people like Gold are current everywhere 
7495_252342_000006_000001	train-clean-360	There is really little peculiar to observe 
7495_252342_000006_000002	train-clean-360	I don t perceive that there is more levity than elsewhere 
7495_252342_000006_000003	train-clean-360	The difference is perhaps that there is less shame about it since it is under the protection of the Church 
7495_252342_000007_000000	train-clean-360	I go out very little my notion is that the Diplomatist like the ancient Augur must not suffer himself to be vulgarized by contact 
7495_252342_000007_000001	train-clean-360	He can only lose not gain by that mixed intercourse with the world 
7495_252342_000007_000002	train-clean-360	I have a few who come when I want them and go in like manner 
7495_252342_000007_000003	train-clean-360	They tell me what is going on far better and more truthfully than paid employees and they cannot trace my intentions through my inquiries and hasten off to retail them at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
7495_252342_000007_000004	train-clean-360	Of my colleagues I see as little as possible though when we do meet I feel an unbounded affection for them 
none	none	So much for my life dear Harcourt on the whole a very tolerable kind of existence which if few would envy still fewer would care to part with I now come to the chief portion of your letter This boy of Glencore s I rather like the account you give of him better than you do yourself Imaginative and dreamy he may be but remember what he was and where we have placed him 
7495_252342_000008_000002	train-clean-360	A moonstruck romantic youth at a German University

detailing the reply which Harcourt sent and all that thereupon ensued between them We pass over then some months of time and arrive at the late autumn It is a calm still morning the sea streaked with tinted shadows is without a ripple the ships of many nations that float on it are motionless their white sails hung out to bleach their ensigns drooping beside the masts Over the summit of Vesuvius for we are at Naples a light blue cloud hangs the solitary one in all the sky A mild plaintive song the chant of some fishermen on the rocks is the only sound save the continuous hum of that vast city which swells and falls at intervals Close beside the sea seated on a rock are two figures One is that of a youth of some eighteen or nineteen years his features eminently handsome wear an expression of gloomy pride as in deep preoccupation he gazes out over the bay to all seeming indifferent to the fair scene before him and wrapped in his own sad thoughts The other is a short square built almost uncouth figure overshadowed by a wide straw hat which seems even to diminish his stature a suit of black wide and ample enough for one twice his size gives his appearance a grotesqueness to which his features contribute their share It is indeed a strange physiognomy to which Celt and Calmuc seem equally to contribute The low overhanging forehead the intensely keen eye sparkling with an almost imp like drollery are contrasted by a firmly compressed mouth and a far projecting under jaw that imply sternness even to cruelty a mass of waving black hair that covers neck and shoulders adds a species of savagery to a head which assuredly has no need of such aid Bent down over a large quarto volume he never lifts his eyes but intently occupied his lips are rapidly repeating the words as he reads them Do you mean to pass the morning here asks the youth at length or where shall I find you later on I ll do whatever you like best said the other in a rich brogue I m agreeable to go or stay ad utrumque pa ratus And Billy Traynor for it was he shut up his venerable volume I don t wish to disturb you said the boy mildly you can read I cannot I have a fretful impatient feeling over me that perhaps will go off with exercise I ll set out then for a walk and come back here towards evening then go and dine at the Rocca and afterwards whatever you please If you say that then said Billy in a voice of evident delight we ll finish the day at the Professor Tadeucci s and get him to go over that analysis again I have no taste for chemistry It always seems to me to end where it began said the boy impatiently Where do all researches tend to how are you elevated in intellect how are your thoughts higher wider nobler by all these mixings and manipulations Is it nothing to know how thunder and lightning is made to understand electricity to dive into the secrets of that old crater there and see the ingredients in the crucible that was bilin three thousand years ago These things appeal more grandly to my imagination when the mystery of their forces is unrevealed I like to think of them as dread manifestations of a mighty will rather than gaseous combinations or metallic affinities And what prevents you said Billy eagerly Is the grandeur of the phenomenon impaired because it is in part intelligible Ain t you elevated as a reasoning being when you get what I may call a peep into God s workshop rather than by implicitly accepting results just as any old woman accepts a superstition There is something ignoble in mechanism said the boy angrily Don t say that while your heart is beatin and your arteries is contractin never say it as long as your lungs dilate or collapse It s mechanism makes water burst out of the ground and swelling into streams flow as mighty rivers through the earth It s mechanism raises the sap to the topmost bough of the cedar tree that waves over Lebanon T is the same power moves planets above just to show us that as there is nothing without a cause there is one great and final Cause behind all And will you tell me said the boy sneeringly that a sunbeam pours more gladness into your heart because a prism has explained to you the composition of light God s blessings never seemed the less to me because he taught me the beautiful laws that guide them said Billy reverently every little step that I take out of darkness is on the road at least to Him In part abashed by the words in part admonished by the tone of the speaker the boy was silent for some minutes You know Billy said he at length that I spoke in no irreverence that I would no more insult your convictions than I would outrage my own It is simply that it suits my dreamy indolence to like the wonderful better than the intelligible and you must acknowledge that there never was so palatable a theory for ignorance Ay but I don t want you to be ignorant said Billy earnestly and there s no greater mistake than supposing that knowledge is an impediment to the play of fancy Take my word for it Master Charles imagination no more than any one else does not work best in the dark I certainly am no adept under such circumstances said the boy I have n t told you what happened me in the studio last night I went in without a candle and trying to grope my way to the table I overturned the large olive jar full of clay against my Niobe and smashed her to atoms Smashed Niobe cried Billy in horror In pieces I stood over her sadder than ever she felt herself and I have not had the courage to enter the studio since Come come let us see if she couldn t be restored said Billy rising Let us go down there together You may if you have any fancy there s the key said the boy I ll return there no more till the rubbish be cleared away And so saying he moved off and was soon out of sight Deeply grieving over this disaster Billy Traynor hastened from the spot but he had only reached the garden of the Chiaja when he heard a faint weak voice calling him by his name he turned and saw Sir Horace Upton who seated in a sort of portable arm chair was enjoying the fresh air from the sea Quite a piece of good fortune to meet you Doctor said he smiling neither you nor your pupil have been near me for ten days or more Tis our own loss then your Excellency said Billy bowing even a chance few minutes in your company is like whetting the intellectual razor I feel myself sharper for the whole day after Then why not come oftener man Are you afraid of wearing the steel all away T is more afraid I am of gapping the fine edge of your Excellency by contact with my own ruggedness said Billy obsequiously You were intended for a courtier Doctor said Sir Horace smiling If there was such a thing as a court fool nowadays I d look for the place The age is too dull for such a functionary They ll not find ten men in any country of Europe equal to the office said Sir Horace One has only to see how lamentably dull are the journals dedicated to wit and drollery to admit this fact though written by many hands how rare it is to chance upon what provokes a laugh You ll have fifty metaphysicians anywhere before you ll hit on one Moliere Will you kindly open that umbrella for me This autumnal sun they say gives sunstroke And now what do you think of this boy He ll not make a diplomatist that s clear He ll not make anything just for one simple reason because he could be whatever he pleased An intellectual spendthrift sighed Sir Horace What a hopeless bankruptcy it leads to My notion is twould be spoiling him entirely to teach him a trade or a profession Let his great faculties shoot up without being trimmed or trained don t want to twist or twine or turn them at all but just see whether he won t out of his uncurbed nature do better than all our discipline could effect There s no better colt than the one that was never backed till he was a five year old He ought to have a career said Sir Horace thoughtfully Every man ought to have a calling if only that he may be able to abandon it Just as a sailor has a point of departure said Billy Precisely said Sir Horace pleased at being so well appreciated You are aware Doctor resumed he after a pause that the lad will have little or no private fortune There are family circumstances that I cannot enter into nor would your own delicacy require it that will leave him almost dependent on his own efforts Now as time is rolling over we should bethink us what direction it were wisest to give his talents for he has talents He has genius and talents both said Billy he has the raw material and the workshop to manufacture it I am rejoiced to hear such an account from one so well able to pronounce said Sir Horace blandly and Billy bowed and blushed with a sense of happiness that none but humble men so praised could ever feel I should like much to hear what you would advise for him said Upton He s so full of promise said Billy that whatever he takes to he ll be sure to fancy he d be better at something else See now it isn t a bull I m sayin but I ll make a blunder of it if I try to explain Go on I think I apprehend you By coorse you do Well it s that same feelin makes me cautious of sayin what he ought to do For after all a variety of capacity implies discursiveness and discursiveness is the mother of failure You speak like an oracle Doctor If I do it s because the priest is beside me said Billy howmg My notion is this I d let him cultivate his fine gifts for a year or two in any way he liked in work or idleness for they ll grow in the fallow as well as in the tilled land I d let him be whatever he liked striving always as he s sure to be striving after something higher and greater and better than he ll ever reach and then when he has felt both his strength and his weakness I d try and attach him to some great man in public life set a grand ambition before him and say Go on He s scarcely the stuff for public life muttered Sir Horace He is said Billy boldly He d be easily abashed easily deterred by failure Sorra bit Success might cloy but failure would never damp him I can t fancy him a speaker Rouse him by a strong theme and a flat contradiction and you ll see what he can do And then his lounging idle habits He ll do more in two hours than any one else in two days You are a warm admirer my dear Doctor said Sir Horace smiling blandly I should almost rather have such a friend than the qualities that win the friendship Have you a message for me Antoine said he to a servant who stood at a little distance waiting the order to approach The man came forward and whispered a few words Sir Horace s cheek gave a faint the very faintest possible sign of flush as he listened and uttering a brief Very well dismissed the messenger Will you give me your arm Doctor said he languidly and the elegant Sir Horace Upton passed down the crowded promenade leaning on his uncouth companion without the slightest consciousness of the surprise and sarcasm around him No man more thoroughly could appreciate conventionalities he would weigh the effect of appearances to the veriest nicety but in practice he seemed either to forget his knowledge or despise it So that as leaning on the little dwarf s arm he moved along his very air of fashionable languor seemed to heighten the absurdity of the contrast Nay he actually seemed to bestow an almost deferential attention to what the other said bowing blandly his acquiescence and smiling with an urbanity all his own Of the crowd that passed nearly all knew the English Minister Uncovered heads were bent obsequiously graceful salutations met him as he went while a hundred conjectures ran as to who and what might be his companion He was a Mesmeric Professor a Writer in Cipher a Rabbi an Egyptian Explorer an Alchemist an African Traveller and at last Monsieur Thiers and so the fine world of Naples discussed the humble individual whom you and I dear reader are acquainted with as Billy Traynor CHAPTER XXIV HOW A RECEPTION COMES TO ITS CLOSE On the evening of that day the handsome saloons of the great Hotel Universo were filled with a brilliant assemblage to compliment the Princess Sabloukoff on her arrival We have already introduced this lady to the reader and have no need to explain the homage and attention of which she was the object There is nothing which so perfectly illustrates the maxim of ignotum pro magnifico as the career of politics certain individuals obtaining as they do a pre eminence and authority from a species of mysterious prestige about them and a reputation of having access at any moment to the highest personage in the world of state affairs Doubtless great ministers are occasionally not sorry to see the public full cry on a false scent and encourage to a certain extent this mystification but still it would be an error to deny to such persons as we speak of a knowledge if not actually an influence in great affairs When the Swedish Chancellor uttered his celebrated sarcasm on the governing capacities of Europe the political salon as a state engine was not yet in existence What additional energy might it have given to his remark had he known that the tea table was the chapel of ease to the council room and gossip a new power in the state Despotic governments are always curious about public opinion they dread while affecting to despise it They however make a far greater mistake than this for they imagine its true exponent to be the society of the highest in rank and station It is not necessary to insist upon an error so palpable and yet it is one of which nearly every capital of Europe affords example and the same council chamber that would treat a popular movement with disdain would tremble at the epigram launched by some elegant of society The theory is that the masses act but never think the higher ranks think and set the rest in motion Whether well or ill founded one consequence of the system is to inundate the world with a number of persons who no matter what their station or pretensions are no other than spies If it be observed that generally speaking there is nothing worth recording that society too much engaged with its own vicissitudes troubles itself little with those of the state let it be remembered that the governments which employ these agencies are in a position to judge of the value of what they receive and as they persevere in maintaining them they are doubtless in some degree remunerated To hold this high detective employ a variety of conditions are essential The individual must have birth and breeding to gain access to the highest circles conciliating manners and ample means If a lady she is usually young and a beauty or has the fame of having once been such The strangest part of all is that her position is thoroughly appreciated She is recognized everywhere for what she is and yet her presence never seems to impose a restraint or suggest a caution She becomes in reality less a discoverer than a depositary of secrets Many have something to communicate and are only at a loss as to the channel They have found out a political puzzle hit a state blot or unravelled a cabinet mystery Others are in possession of some personal knowledge of royalty They have marked the displeasure of the Queen Dowager or seen the anger of the Crown Prince Profitable as such facts are they are nothing without a market Thus it is that these characters exercise a wider sphere of influence than might be naturally ascribed to them and possess besides a terrorizing power over society the chief members of which are at their mercy It is doubtless not a little humiliating that such should be the instruments of a government and that royalty should avail itself of such agencies but the fact is so and perhaps an inquiry into the secret working of democratic institutions might not make one a whit more proud of Popular Sovereignty Amongst the proficients in the great science we speak of the Princess held the first place Mysterious stories ran of her acquaintance with affairs the most momentous there were narratives of her complicity in even darker events Her name was quoted by Savary in his secret report of the Emperor Paul s death an allusion to her was made by one of the assassins of Murat and a gloomy record of a celebrated incident in Louis Philippe s life ascribed to her a share in a terrible tragedy Whether believed or not they added to the prestige that attended her and she was virtually a puissance in European politics To all the intriguists in state affairs her arrival was actually a boon She could and would give them out of her vast capital enough to establish them successfully in trade To the minister of police she brought accurate descriptions of suspected characters the signalements of Carbonari that were threatening half the thrones of Europe To the foreign secretary she brought tidings of the favor in which a great Emperor held him and a shadowy vision of the grand cross he was one day to have She had forbidden books for the cardinal confessor and a case of smuggled cigars for the minister of finance The picturesque language of a Journal de Modes could alone convey the rare and curious details of dress which she imported for the benefit of the court ladies In a word she had something to secure her a welcome in every quarter and all done with a tact and a delicacy that the most susceptible could not have resisted If the tone and manner of good society present little suitable to description they are yet subjects of great interest to him who would study men in their moods of highest subtlety and astuteness To mere passing careless observation the reception of the Princess was a crowded gathering of a number of well dressed people in which the men were in far larger proportion than the other sex There was abundance of courtesy not a little of that half flattering compliment which is the small change of intercourse some not much scandal and a fair share of small talk It was late when Sir Horace Upton entered and advancing to where the Princess stood kissed her gloved hand with all the submissive deference of a courtier The most lynx eyed observer could not have detected either in his manner or in hers that any intimacy existed between them much less friendship least of all anything still closer His bearing was a most studied and respectful homage hers a haughty but condescending acceptance of it and yet with all this there was that in those around that seemed to say This man is more master here than any of us He did not speak long with the Princess but respectfully yielding his place to a later arrival fell back into the crowd and soon after took a seat beside one of the very few ladies who graced the reception In all they were very few we are bound to acknowledge for although La Sabloukoff was received at court and all the embassies they who felt or affected to feel any strictness on the score of morals avoided rather than sought her intimacy She covered over what might have seemed this disparagement of her conduct by always seeking the society of men as though their hardy and vigorous intellects were more in unison with her own than the graceful attributes of the softer sex and in this tone did the few lady friends she possessed appear also to concur It was their pride to discuss matters of state and politics and whenever they condescended to more trifling themes they treated them with a degree of candor and in a spirit that allowed men to speak as unreservedly as though no ladies were present Let us be forgiven for prolixity since we are speaking less of individuals than of a school a school too on the increase and one whose results will be more widely felt than many are disposed to believe As the evening wore on the guests bartered the news and bons mots scraps of letters from royal hands were read epigrams from illustrious characters repeated racy bits of courtly scandal were related and shrewd explanations hazarded as to how this was to turn out and that was to end It was a very strange language they talked so much seemed left for inference so much seemed left to surmise There was a shadowy indistinctness as it were over all and yet their manner showed a perfect and thorough appreciation of whatever went forward Through all this treatment of great questions one striking feature pre eminently displayed itself a keen appreciation of how much the individual characters the passions the prejudices the very caprices of men in power modified the acts of their governments and thus you constantly heard such remarks as If the Duke of Wellington disliked the Emperor less or so long as Metternich has such an attachment to the Queen Dowager when we get over Carini s dread of the Archduchess or if we could only reconcile the Prince to a visit from Nesselrode showing that private personal feelings were swaying the minds of those whose contemplation might have seemed raised to a far loftier level And then what a mass of very small gossip abounded incidents so slight and insignificant that they only were lifted into importance by the actors in them being Kings and Kaisers By what accidents great events were determined on what mere trifles vast interests depended it were doubtless no novelty to record still it would startle many to be told that a casual pique a passing word launched at hazard some petty observance omitted or forgotten have changed the destinies of whole nations It is in such circles as these that incidents of this kind are recounted Each has some anecdote trivial and unimportant it may be but still illustrating the life of those who live under the shadow of Royalty The Princess herself was inexhaustible in these stores of secret biography there was not a dynastic ambition to be consolidated by a marriage not a Coburg alliance to patch up a family compact that she was not well versed in She detected in the vaguest movements plans and intentions and could read the signs of a policy in indications that others would have passed without remark One by one the company retired and at length Sir Horace found himself the last guest of the evening Scarcely had the door closed on the last departure when drawing his arm chair to the side of the fire opposite to that where the Princess sat he took out his cigar case and selecting a cheroot deliberately lighted and commenced to smoke it I thought they d never go said she with a sigh but I know why they remained they all thought the Prince of Istria was coming They saw his carriage stop here this evening and heard he had sent up to know if I received I wrote on a card To morrow at dinner at eight so be sure you are here to meet him Sir Horace bowed and smiled his acceptance And your journey dear Princess said he between the puffs of his smoke was it pleasant It might have been well enough but I was obliged to make a great detour The Duchess detained me at Parma for some letters and then sent me across the mountains of Pontremoli a frightful road on a secret mission to Massa To Massa of all earthly places Even so They had sent down there some eight or nine months ago the young Count Wahnsdorf the Archduchess Sophia s son who having got into all manner of dissipation at Vienna and lost largely at play it was judged expedient to exile him for a season and as the Duke of Modena offered his aid to their plans he was named to a troop in a dragoon regiment and appointed aide de camp to his Royal Highness Are you attending or has your Excellency lost the clew of my story I am all ears only waiting anxiously to hear who is she Oh then you suspect a woman in the case I am sure of it dear Princess The very accents of your voice prepared me for a bit of romance Yes you are right he has fallen in love so desperately in love that he is incessant in his appeals to the Duchess to intercede with his family and grant him leave to marry To marry whom asked Sir Horace That s the very question which he cannot answer himself and when pressed for information can only reply that she is an angel Now angels are not always of good family they have sometimes very humble parents and very small fortunes Helas sighed the diplomatist pitifully This angel it would seem is untraceable She arrived with her mother or what is supposed to be her mother from Corsica they landed at Spezzia with an English passport calling them Madame and Mademoiselle Harley On arriving at Massa they took a villa close to the town and established themselves with all the circumstance of people well off as to means They however neither received visits nor made acquaintance with any one They even so far withdrew themselves from public view that they rarely left their own grounds and usually took their carriage airing at night You are not attending I see On the contrary I am an eager listener only it is a story one has heard so often I never heard of any one preserving the incognito except where disclosure would have revealed a shame Your Excellency mistakes replied she the incognito is sometimes like a feigned despatch in diplomacy a means of awakening curiosity Ces ruses ne se font plus Princess they were the fashion in Talleyrand s time now we are satisfied to mystify by no meaning If the weapons of the old school are not employed there is another reason perhaps said she with a dubious smile That modern arms are too feeble to wield them you mean said he bowing courteously Ah it is but too true Princess and he sighed what might mean regret over the fact or devotion to herself perhaps both At all events his submission served as a treaty of peace and she resumed And now revenons a nos moutons said she or at least to our lambs This Wahnsdorf is quite capable of contracting a marriage without any permission if they appear inclined to thwart him and the question is What can be done The Duke would send these people away out of his territory only that if they be English as their passports imply he knows that there will be no end of trouble with your amiable Government which is never paternal till some one corrects one of her children If Wahnsdorf be sent away where are they to send him Besides in all these cases the creature carries his malady with him and is sure to marry the first who sympathizes with him In a word there were difficulties on all sides and the Duchess sent me over in observation as they say rather than with any direct plan of extrication And you went Yes I passed twenty four hours I couldn t stay longer for I promised the Cardinal Caraffa to be in Rome on the eighteenth about those Polish nunneries As to Massa I gathered little more than I had heard beforehand I saw their villa I even penetrated as far as the orangery in my capacity of traveller the whole a perfect Paradise I m not sure I did not get a peep at Eve herself at a distance however I made great efforts to obtain an interview but all unsuccessfully The police authorities managed to summon two of the servants to the Podesta on pretence of some irregularity in their papers but we obtained nothing out of them and what is more I saw clearly that nothing could be effected by a coup de main The place requires a long siege and I had not time for that Did you see Wahnsdorf Yes I had him to dinner with me alone at the hotel for to avoid all observation I only went to the Palace after nightfall He confessed all his sins to me and like every other scapegrace thought marriage was a grand absolution for past wickedness He told me too how he made the acquaintance of these strangers They were crossing the Magra with their carriage on a raft when the cable snapped and they were all carried down the torrent He happened to be a passenger at the time and did something very heroic I ve no doubt but I cannot exactly remember what but it amounted to either being or being supposed to be their deliverer He thus obtained leave to pay his respects at the villa But even this gratitude was very measured they only admitted him at rare intervals and for a very brief visit In fact it was plain he had to deal with consummate tacticians who turned the mystery of their seclusion and the honor vouchsafed him to an ample profit He told them his name and his rank Yes and he owned that they did not seem at all impressed by the revelation He describes them as very naughty very condescending in manner tres grandes dames in fact but unquestionably born to the class they represent They never dropped a hint of whence they had come or any circumstance of their past lives but seemed entirely engrossed by the present which they spent principally in cultivating the arts they both drew admirably and the young lady had become a most skilful modellist in clay her whole day being passed in a studio which they had just built I urged him strongly to try and obtain permission for me to see it but he assured me it was hopeless the request might even endanger his own position with them I could perceive that though very much in love Wahns dorf was equally taken with the romance of this adventure He had never been a hero to himself before and he was perfectly enchanted by the novelty of the sensation He never affected to say that he had made the least impression on the young lady s heart but he gave me to understand that the nephew of an Emperor need not trouble his head much on that score He is a very good looking well mannered weak boy who if he only reach the age of thirty without some great blunder will pass for a very dignified Prince for the rest of his life Did you give him any hopes Of course if he only promised to follow my counsels and as these same counsels are yet in the oven he must needs wait for them In a word he is to write to me everything and I to him and so we parted I should like to see these people said Upton languidly I m sure of it rejoined she but it is perhaps unnecessary and there was that in the tone which made the words very significant Chelmsford he s now Secretary at Turin might perhaps trace them said he he always knows everything of those people who are secrets to the rest of the world For the present I am disposed to think it were better not to direct attention towards them replied she What we do here must be done adroitly and in such a way as that it can be disavowed if necessary or abandoned if unsuccessful Said with all your own tact Princess said Sir Horace smiling I can perceive however that you have a plan in your head already Is it not so No said she with a faint sigh I took wonderfully little interest in the affair It was one of those games where the combinations are so few you don t condescend to learn it Are you aware of the hour Actually three o clock said he standing up Really Princess I am quite shocked And so am I said she smiling on se compromet si facilement dans ce bas monde Good night And she courtesied and withdrew before he had time to take his hat and retire CHAPTER XXV A DUKE AND HIS MINISTER In this age of the world when everybody has been everywhere seen everything and talked with everybody it may savor of an impertinence if we ask of our reader if he has ever been at Massa It may so chance that he has not and if so as assuredly has he yet an untasted pleasure before him Now to be sure Massa is not as it once was The little Duchy whose capital it formed has been united to a larger state The distinctive features of a metropolis and the residence of a sovereign prince are gone The life and stir and animation which surround a court have subsided grass grown streets and deserted squares replace the busy movement of former days a dreamy weariness seems to have fallen over every one as though life offered no more prizes for exertion and that the day of ambition was set forever Yet are there features about the spot which all the chances and changes of political fortune cannot touch Dynasties may fall and thrones crumble but the eternal Apennines will still rear their snow clad summits towards the sky Along the vast plain of ancient olives the perfumed wind will still steal at evening and the blue waters of the Mediterranean plash lazily among the rocks over which the myrtle and the arbutus are hanging There amidst them all half hid in clustering vines bathed in soft odors from orange groves with plashing fountains glittering in the sun and foaming streams gushing from the sides of marble mountains there stands Massa ruined decayed and deserted but beautiful in all its desolation and fairer to gaze on than many a scene where the tide of human fortune is at the flood As you wander there now passing the deep arch over which hundreds of feet above you the ancient fortress frowns and enter the silent streets you would find it somewhat difficult to believe how a very few years back this was the brilliant residence of a court the gay resort of strangers from every land of Europe that showy equipages traversed these weed grown squares and highborn dames swept proudly beneath these leafy alleys Hard indeed to fancy the glittering throng of courtiers the merry laughter of light hearted beauty beneath these trellised shades where moodily and slow some solitary figure now steals along pondering sad thoughts over the bygone But a few a very few years ago and Massa was in the plenitude of its prosperity The revenues of the state were large more than sufficient to have maintained all that such a city could require and nearly enough to gratify every caprice of a prince whose costly tastes ranged over every theme and found in each a pretext for reckless expenditure He was one of those men whom Nature having gifted largely takes out the compensation by a disposition of instability and fickleness that renders every acquirement valueless He could have been anything orator poet artist soldier statesman and yet in the very diversity of his abilities there was that want of fixity of purpose that left him ever short of success till he himself wearied by repeated failures distrusted his own powers and ceased to exert them Such a man under the hard pressure of a necessity might have done great things as it was born to a princely station and with a vast fortune he became a reckless spendthrift a dreamy visionary at one time an enthusiastic dilettante at another There was not a scheme of government he had not eagerly embraced and abandoned in turn He had attracted to his little capital all that Europe could boast of artistic excellence and as suddenly he had thrown himself into the most intolerant zeal of Papal persecution denouncing every species of pleasure and ordaining a more than monastic self denial and strictness There was only one mode of calculating what he might be which was by imagining the very opposite to what he then was Extremes were his delight and he undulated between Austrian tyranny and democratic licentiousness in politics just as he vacillated between the darkest bigotry of his church and open infidelity At the time when we desire to present him to our readers the exact year is not material he was fast beginning to weary of an interregnum of asceticism and severity He had closed theatres and suppressed all public rejoicings and for an entire winter he had sentenced his faithful subjects to the unbroken sway of the Priest and the Friar a species of rule which had banished all strangers from the Duchy and threatened by the injury to trade the direst consequences to his capital To have brought the question formally before him in all its details would have ensured the downfall of any minister rash enough for such daring There was indeed but one man about the court who had courage for the enterprise and to him we would devote a few lines as we pass He was an Englishman named Stubber He had originally come out to Italy with horses for his Highness and been induced by good offers of employment to remain He was not exactly stable groom nor trainer nor was he of the dignity of master of the stables but he was something whose attributes included a little of all and something more One thing he assuredly was a consummately clever fellow who could apply all his native Yorkshire shrewdness to a new sphere and make of his homespun faculties the keen intelligence by which he could guide himself in novel and difficult circumstances A certain freedom of speech with a bold hardihood of character based it is true upon a conscious sense of honor had brought him more than once under the notice of the Prince His Highness felt such pleasure in the outspoken frankness of the man that he frequently took opportunities of conversing with him and even asking his advice Never deterred by the subject whatever it was Stubber spoke out his mind and by the very force of strong native sense and an unswerving power of determination soon impressed his master that his best counsels were to be had from the Yorkshire jockey and not from the decorated and gilded throng who filled the antechambers To elevate the groom to the rank of personal attendant to create him a Chevalier and then a Count were all easy steps to such a Prince At the time we speak of Stubber was chief of the Cabinet the trusted adviser of his master in knottiest questions of foreign politics the arbiter of the most difficult points with other states the highest authority in home affairs and the absolute ruler over the Duke s household and all who belonged to it He was one of those men of action who speedily distinguish themselves wherever the game of life is being played Smart to discern the character of those around him prompt to avail himself of their knowledge little hampered by the scruples which conventionalities impose on men bred in a higher station he generally attained his object before others had arranged their plans to oppose him To these qualities he added a rugged unflinching honesty and a loyal attachment to the person of his Prince Strong in his own conscious rectitude and in the confiding regard of his sovereign Stubber stood alone against all the wiles and machinations of his formidable rivals Were we giving a history of this curious court and its intrigues we could relate some strange stories of the mechanism by which states are ruled We have however no other business with the subject than as it enters into the domain of our own story and to this we return It was a calm evening of the early autumn as the Prince accompanied by Stubber alone and unattended by even a groom rode along one of the alleys of the olive wood which skirts the sea shore beneath Massa His Highness was unusually moody and thoughtful and as he sauntered carelessly along seemed scarcely to notice the objects about him What month are we in Stubber asked he at length September Altezza was the short reply Per Bacco so it is and in this very month we were to have been in Bohemia with the Archduke Stephen the best shooting in all Europe and the largest stock of pheasants in the whole world perhaps and I that love field sports as no man ever loved them Eh Stubber and he turned abruptly round to seek a confirmation of what he asserted Either Stubber did not fully agree in the judgment or did not deem it necessary to record his concurrence but the Prince was obliged to reiterate his statement adding I might say indeed it is the one solitary dissipation I have ever permitted myself Now this was a stereotyped phrase of his Highness and employed by him respecting music literature field sports picture buying equipage play and a number of other pursuits not quite so pardonable in each of which for the time his zeal would seem to be exclusive A scarcely audible ejaculation a something like a grunt from Stubber was the only assent to this proposition And here I am added the Prince testily the only man of my rank in Europe perhaps without society amusement or pleasure condemned to the wearisome details of a petty administration and actually a slave yes sir I say a slave What the deuce is this My horse is sinking above his pasterns Where are we Stubber and with a vigorous dash of the spurs he extricated himself from the deep ground I often told your Highness that these lands were ruined for want of drainage You may remark how poor the trees are along here the fruit too is all deteriorated all for want of a little skill and industry And if your Highness remarked the appearance of the people in that village every second man has the ague on him They did look very wretched And why is it not drained Why isn t everything done as it ought Stubber eh Why is n t your Highness in Bohemia Want of means my good Stubber no money My man Landelli tells me the coffer is empty and until this new tax on the Colza comes in we shall have to live on our credit or our wits I forget which but I conclude they are about equally productive Landelli is a ladro said Stubber He has money enough to build a new wing to his chateau in Serravezza and to give fifty thousand scudi of fortune to his daughter though he can t afford your Highness the common necessaries of your station Per Bacco Billy you are right you must look into these accounts yourself They always confuse me I have looked into them and your Highness shall have two hundred thousand francs to morrow on your dressing table and as much more within the week Well done Billy you are the only fellow who can unmask these rogueries If I had only had you with me long ago Well well well it is too late to think of it What shall we do with this money Bohemia is out of the question now Shall we rebuild the San Felice It is really too small the stage is crowded with twenty people on it There s that gate towards Carrara when is it to be completed There s a figure wanted for the centre pedestal As for the fountain it must be done by the municipality It is essentially the interest of the townspeople You d advise me to spend the money in draining these low lands or in a grant to that new company for a pier at Marina but I ll not I have other thoughts in my head Why should not this be the centre of art to the whole Peninsula Carrara is a city of sculptors Why not concentrate their efforts here by a gallery I have myself some glorious things the best group Canova ever modelled the original Ariadne too far finer than the thing people go to see at Frankfort Then there s Tanderini s Shepherd with the Goats Who lives yonder Stubber What a beautiful garden it is And he drew up short in front of a villa whose grounds were terraced in a succession of gardens down to the very margin of the sea Plants and shrubs of other climates were mingled with those familiar to Italy making up a picture of singular beauty by diversity of color and foliage Isn t this the Ombretta Stubber Yes Altezza but the Morelli have left it It is let now to a stranger a French lady Some call her English I believe To be sure I remember There was a demand about a formal permission to reside here Landelli advised me not to sign it that she might turn out English or have some claim upon England which was quite equivalent to placing the Duchy and all within it under that blessed thing they call British protection There are worse things than even that muttered Stubber British occupation perhaps you mean well you may be right At all events I did not take Landelli s advice for I gave the permission and I have never heard more of her She must be rich I take it See what order this place is kept in that conservatory is very large indeed and the orange trees are finer than ours They seem very fine indeed said Stubber I say sir that we have none such at the Palace I ll wager a zecchino they have come from Naples And look at that magnolia I tell you Stubber this garden is very far superior to ours Your Highness has not been in the Palace gardens lately perhaps I was there this morning and they are really in admirable order I ll have a peep inside of these grounds Stubber said the Duke who no longer attentive to the other only followed out his own train of thought At the same instant he dismounted and without giving himself any trouble about his horse made straight for a small wicket which lay invitingly open in front of him The narrow skirting of copse passed the Duke at once found himself in the midst of a lovely garden laid out with consummate skill and taste and offering at intervals the most beautiful views of the surrounding scenery Although much of what he beheld around him was the work of many years there were abundant traces of innovation and improvement Some of the statues were recently placed and a small temple of Grecian architecture seemed to have been just restored A heavy curtain hung across the doorway drawing back which the Duke entered what he at once perceived to be a sculptor s studio Casts and models lay carelessly about and a newly begun group stood enshrouded in the wetted drapery with which artists clothe their unfinished labors No mean artist himself the Duke examined critically the figures before him nor was he long in perceiving that the artist had committed more than one fault in drawing and proportion This is amateur work said he to himself and yet not without cleverness and a touch of genius too Your dilettante scorns anatomy and will not submit to drudgery hence here are muscles incorrectly developed and their action ill expressed So saying he sat down before the model and taking up one of the tools at his side began to correct some of the errors in the work It was exactly the kind of task for which his skill adapted him Too impatient and too discursive to accomplish anything of his own he was admirably fitted to correct the faults of another and so he worked away vigorously totally forgetting where he was how he had come there and as utterly oblivious of Stubber whom he had left without Growing more and more interested as he proceeded he arose at length to take a better view of what he had done and standing some distance off exclaimed aloud Per Bacco I have made a good thing of it there s life in it now So indeed is there cried a gentle voice behind him and turning he beheld a young and very beautiful girl whose dress was covered by the loose blouse of a sculptor How I thank you for this said she blushing deeply as she courtesied before him I have had no teaching and never till this moment knew how much I needed it And this is your work then said the Duke who turned again towards the model Well there is promise in it There is even more Still you have hard labor before you if you would be really an artist There is a grammar in these things and he who would speak the tongue must get over the declensions I know but little myself Oh do not say so cried she eagerly I feel that I am in a master s presence The Duke started partly struck by the energy of her manner in part by the words themselves It is often difficult for men in his station to believe that they are not known and recognized and so he stood wondering at her and thinking who she could be that did not know him to be the Prince You mistake me said he gently and with that dignity which is the birthright of those born to command I am but a very indifferent artist I have studied a little it is true but other pursuits and idleness have swept away the small knowledge I once possessed and left me as to art pretty much as I am in morals that is I know what is right but very often I can t accomplish it You are from Carrara I conclude said the young girl timidly still curious to hear more about him Pardon me said he smiling I am a native of Massa and live here And are you not a sculptor by profession asked she still more eagerly No said he laughing pleasantly I follow a more precarious trade nor can I mould the clay I work in so deftly At least you love art said she with an enthusiasm heightened by the changes he had effected in her group Now it is my turn to question Signorina said he gayly Why with a talent like yours have you not given yourself to regular study You live in a land where instruction should not be difficult to obtain Carrara is one vast studio there must be many there who would not alone be willing but even proud to have such a pupil Have you never thought of this I have thought of it said she pensively but my aunt with whom I live desires to see no one to know no one even now added she blushing deeply I find myself conversing with an utter stranger in a way She stopped overwhelmed with confusion and he finished her sentence for her In a way which shows how naturally a love of art establishes a confidence between those who profess it As he spoke the curtain was drawn back and a lady entered who though several years older bore such a likeness to the young girl that she might readily have been taken for her sister It is at length time I should make my excuses for this intrusion madame said he turning towards her and then in a few words explained how the accidental passing by the spot and the temptation of the open wicket had led him to a trespass which added he smiling I can only say I shall be charmed if you will condescend to retaliate I too have some objects of art and gardens which are thought worthy of a visit We live here sir apart from the world It is for that reason we have selected this residence replied she coldly I shall respect your seclusion madame answered he with a deep bow and only beg once more to tender my sincere apologies for the past He moved towards the door as he spoke the ladies courtesied deeply and with a still lowlier reverence he passed out The Duke lingered in the garden as though unwilling to leave the spot For a while some doubt as to whether he had been recognized passed through his mind but he soon satisfied himself that such was not the case and the singularity of the situation amused him I am culling a souvenir madame said he plucking a moss ross as the lady passed I will give you a better one sir said she detaching one from her bouquet and handing it to him And so they parted Per Bacco Stubber I have seen two very charming women They are evidently persons of condition find out all about them and let me hear it to morrow And so say ing his Highness rode away thinking pleasantly over his adventure and fancying a hundred ways in which it might be amusingly carried out The life of princes is rarely fertile in surprises perhaps therefore the uncommon and unusual are the pleasantest of all their sensations CHAPTER XXVI ITALIAN TROUBLES Stubber knew his master well There was no need for any perquisitions on his part the ladies the studio and the garden were totally forgotten ere nightfall Some rather alarming intelligence had arrived from Carrara which had quite obliterated every memory of his late adventure That little town of artists had long been the resort of an excited class of politicians and it was more than rumored that the Carbonari had established there a lodge of their order Inflammatory placards had been posted through the town violent denunciations of the Government vengeance even on the head of the sovereign openly proclaimed and a speedy day promised when the wrongs of an enslaved people should be avenged in blood The messenger who brought the alarming tidings to Massa carried with him many of the inflammatory documents as well as several knives and poniards discovered by the activity of the police in a ruined building at the sea shore No arrests had as yet been made but the authorities were in possession of information with regard to various suspicious characters and the police prepared to act at a moment s notice It was an hour after midnight when the Council met and the Duke sat pale agitated and terrified at the table with Landelli the Prime Minister Caprini the Secretary for Foreign Affairs and General Ferrucio the War Minister a venerable ecclesiastic Monsignore Abbati occupying the lowest place in virtue of his humble station as confessor of his Highness He who of all others enjoyed his master s confidence and whose ready intelligence was most needed in the emergency was not present his title of Minister of the Household not qualifying him for a place at the Council Whatever the result the deliberation was a long one Even while it continued there was time to despatch a courier to Carrara and receive the answer he brought back and when the Duke returned to his room it was already far advanced in the morning Fatigued and harassed he dismissed his valet at once and desired that Stubber might attend him When he arrived however his Highness had fallen off asleep and lay dressed as he was on his bed Stubber sat noiselessly beside his master his mind deeply pondering over the events which although he had not been present at the Council had all been related to him It was not the first time he had heard of that formidable conspiracy which under the title of the Carbonari had established themselves in every corner of Europe In the days of his humbler fortune he had known several of them intimately he had been often solicited to join their band but while steadily refusing this he had detected much which to his keen intelligence savored of treachery to the cause amongst them This cause was necessarily recruited from those whose lives rejected all honest and patient labor They were the disappointed men of every station from the highest to the lowest The ruined gentleman the beggared noble the bankrupt trader the houseless artisan the homeless vagabond were all there bold daring and energetic fearless as to the present reckless as to the future They sought for any change no matter what seeing that in the convulsion their own condition must be bettered Few troubled their heads how these changes were to be accomplished they cared little for the real grievances they assumed to redress their work was demolition It was to the hour of pillage alone they looked for the recompense of their hardihood Some unquestionably took a different view of the agencies and the objects dreamy speculative men with high aspirations hoped that the cruel wrongs which tyranny inflicted on many a European state might be effectually curbed by a glorious freedom when each man s actions should be made comformable to the benefit of the community and the will of all be typified in the conduct of each There was however another class and to these Stubber had given deep attention It was a party whose singular activity and energy were always in the ascendant ever suggesting bold measures whose results could scarcely be more than menaces and advocating actions whose greatest effect could not rise above acts of terror and dismay And thus while the leaders plotted great political convulsions and the masses dreamed of sack and pillage these latter dealt in acts of assassination the vengeance of the poniard and the poison cup These were the men Stubber had studied with no common attention He fancied he saw in them neither the dupes of their own excited imaginations nor the reckless followers of rapine but an order of men equal to the former by intelligence but far transcending the last in crime and infamy In his own early experiences he had perceived that more than one of these had expatriated themselves suddenly carrying away to foreign shores considerable wealth and that too under circumstances where the acquisition of property seemed scarcely possible Others he had seen as suddenly throwing off their political associates rise into stations of rank and power and one memorable case he knew where the individual had become the chief adviser of the very state whose destruction he had sworn to accomplish Such a one he now fancied he had detected among the advisers of his Prince and deeply ruminating on this theme he sat at the bedside Is it a dream Stubber or have we really heard bad news from Carrara Has Fraschetti been stabbed or not Yes your Highness he has been stabbed exactly two inches below where he was wounded in September last then it was his pocket book saved him now it was your Highness s picture which like a faithful follower he always carried about him Which means that you disbelieve the whole story Every word of it And the poniards found at the Bocca di Magra Found by those who placed them there And the proclamations Blundering devices See here is one of them printed on the very paper supplied to the Government offices There s he water mark with the crown and your own cipher on it Per Bacco so it is Let me show this to Landelli Wait awhile your Highness let us trace this a little farther No arrests have been made None Nor will any The object in view is already gained they have terrified you and secured the next move What do you mean Simply that they have persuaded you that this state is the hotbed of revolutionists that your own means of security and repression are unequal to the emergency that disaffection exists in the army and that whether for the maintenance of the Government or your safety you have only one course remaining Which is To call in the Austrians Per Bacco it is exactly what they have advised How did you come to know it Who is the traitor at the Council board I wish I could tell you the name of one who was not such Why your Highness these fellows are not your Ministers except in so far as they are paid by you They are Metternich s people they receive their appointments from Vienna and are only accountable to the cabinet held at Schoenbrunn If wise and moderate counsels prevailed here if our financial measures prospered if the people were happy and contented how long think you would Lombardy submit to be ruled by the rod and the bayonet Do you imagine that you will be suffered to give an example to the Peninsula of a good administration But so it is broke in the Prince I defy any man to assert the opposite The country is prosperous the people are contented the laws justly administered and I hesitate not to say myself as popular as any sovereign of Europe And I tell your Highness just as distinctly that the country is ground down with taxation even to export duties on the few things we have to export that the people are poor to the very verge of starvation that if they do not take to the highways as brigands it is because some traditions as honest men yet survive amongst them that the laws only exist as an agent of tyranny arrest and imprisonment being at the mere caprice of the authorities Nor is there a means by which an innocent man can demand his trial and insist on being confronted with his accuser Your jails are full crowded to a state of pestilence with supposed political offenders men that in a free country would be at large toiling industriously for their families and whose opinions could never be dangerous if not festering in the foul air of a dungeon And as to your own popularity all I say is don t walk in the Piazza at Carrara after dusk No nor even at noonday And you dare to speak thus to me Stubber said the Prince his face covered with a deadly pallor as he spoke and his white lips trembling but less in passion than in fear And why not sir Of what value could such a man as I am be to your service if I were not to tell you what you ll never hear from others the plain simple truth Is it not clear enough that if I only thought of my own benefit I d say whatever you d like best to hear I d tell you like Landelli that the taxes were well paid or say as Cerreccio did t other day that your army would do credit to any state in Europe when he well knew at the time that the artillery was in mutiny from arrears of pay and the cavalry horses dying from short rations I am well weary of all this said the Duke with a sigh If the half of what I hear of my kingdom every day be but true my lot in life is worse than a galley slave s One assures me that I am bankrupt another calls me a vassal of Austria a third makes me out a Papal spy and you aver that if I venture into the streets of my own town in the midst of my own people I am almost sure to be assassinated Take no man s word sir for what while you can see for yourself it is your own duty to ascertain said Stubber resolutely If you really only desire a life of ease and indolence forgetting what you owe to yourself and those you rule over send for the Austrians Ask for a brigade and a general You ll have them for the asking They d come at a word and try your people at the drum head and flog and shoot them with as little disturbance to you as need be You may pension off the judges for a court martial is a far speedier tribunal and a corporal s guard is quite an economy in criminal justice Trade will not perhaps prosper with martial law nor is a state of siege thought favorable to commerce No matter You ll sleep safe so long as you keep within doors and the band under your window will rouse the spirit of nationality in your heart as it plays God preserve the Emperor You forget yourself sir and you forget me said the Duke sternly as he drew himself up and threw a look of insolent pride at the speaker Mayhap I do your Highness was the ready answer and out of that very forgetfulness let your Highness take a warning I say once more I distrust the people about you and as to this conspiracy at Carrara I ll wager a round sum on it that it was hatched on t other side of the Alps and paid for in good florins of the Holy Roman Empire At all events give me time to investigate the matter Let me have till the end of the week to examine into it and if I find nothing to confirm my views I ll say not one word against all the measures of precaution that your Council are bent on importing from Austria Take your own way I promise nothing said the Duke haughtily and with a motion of his hand dismissed his adviser CHAPTER XXVII CARRARA To all the luxuriant vegetation and cultivated beauty of Massa glowing in the golden glories of its orange groves steeped in the perfume of its thousand gardens Carrara offers the very strongest contrast Built in a little cleft of the Apennines it is begirt with great mountains wild barren and desolate Some dark and precipitous have no traces in their sides but those of the torrents which are formed by the melting snows others show the white caves as they are called of that pure marble which has made the name of the spot famous throughout Europe High in the mountain sides escarped amidst rocks and zig zagging over many a dangerous gorge and deep abyss are the rough roads trodden by the weary oxen trailing along their massive loads and straining their stout chests to drag the great white blocks of glittering stone Far down below crossed and recrossed by splashing torrents sprinkled with the spray of a hundred cataracts stands Carrara itself a little marble city of art every house a studio every citizen a sculptor Hither are sent all the marvellous conceptions of genius the models which mighty imaginations have begotten to be converted into imperishable stone Here are the grand conceptions gathered for every land and clime treasures destined to adorn the great galleries of nations or the splendid palaces of kings Some of these studios are of imposing size and vast proportions and not devoid of a certain architectural pretension a group a figure or a bas relief usually adorning the space over the door and by its subject giving some indication of the tastes of the proprietor Thus Madonnas and saints are of frequent occurrence and the majority of the artists display their faith by an image of the saint whose patronage they claim Others exhibit some ideal conception and a few denote their nationality by the bust of their sovereign or some prince of his house One of these buildings a short distance from the town and so small as to be little more than a mere crypt was distinguished by the chaste and simple elegance of its design and the tasteful ornament with which its owner had decorated the most minute details of the building He was a young artist who had arrived in Carrara friendless and unknown but whose abilities had soon obtained for him consideration and employment At first the tasks intrusted to him were the humbler ones of friezes and decorative art but at length his skill becoming acknowledged to his hands were confided the choicest conceptions of Danneker the most rare creations of Canova Little or nothing was known of him his habits were of the strictest seclusion he went into no society he formed no friendships His solitary life after a while ceased to attract any notice and men saw him pass and come and go without question almost without greeting and save when some completed work was about to be packed off to its destination the name of Sebastian Greppi was rarely heard in Carrara His strict retirement had not however exempted him from the jealous suspicions of the authorities on the contrary the seeming mystery of his life had sharpened their curiosity and aroused their zeal and more than once was he summoned to the Prefecture to answer some frivolous questions about his passport or his means of subsistence It was on one of these errands that he stood one morning in the antechamber of the Podesta s court awaiting his turn to be called and interrogated The heat of a crowded chamber the wearisome delay perhaps too some vexation at the frequency of these irritating calls had partially excited him and when he was at length introduced his manner was confused and his replies vague and almost wandering Two strangers whose formal permission to reside were then being filled up by a clerk were accommodated with seats in the room and listened with no slight interest to a course of inquiry so strange and novel to their ears Greppi cried the harsh voice of the President come forward and a youth stood up dressed in the blue blouse of a common workman and wearing the coarse shoes of the very humblest laborer but yet in the calm dignity of his mien and the mild character of his sad but handsome features already proclaiming that he came of a class whose instincts denote good blood Greppi you have a servant it would seem whose name is not in your passport How is this He is an humble friend who shares my fortunes sir said the artist They asked no passport from him when we crossed the Tuscan frontier and he has been here some months without any demand for one Does he assist you in your work He does sir by advice and counsel but he is not a sculptor Poor fellow he never dreamed that his presence here could have attracted any remark His tongue and accent betray a foreign origin Greppi Be it so so do mine perhaps Are we the less submissive to the laws The laws can make themselves respected said the Podesta sternly Where is this man how is he called He is known as Guglielmo sir At this moment he is ill he has caught the fever of the Campagna and is confined to bed We shall send to ascertain the fact was the reply Then my word is doubted said the youth haughtily The Podesta started but more in amazement than anger There was indeed enough to astonish him in the haughty ejaculation of the poorly clad boy I am given to believe that you are not as your passport would imply a native of Capri nor a Neapolitan born said the Podesta If my passport be regular and my conduct blameless what have you or any one to do with my birthplace Is there any charge alleged against me You are forgetting where you are boy but I may take measures to remind you of it said the Podesta whispering to a sergeant of the gendarmes at his side I hope I have said nothing that could offend you said the boy eagerly I scarcely know what I have said My wish is to submit myself in all obedience to the laws to live quietly and follow my trade If my presence here give displeasure to the authorities I will however sorry take my departure though I cannot say whither to The last words were uttered falteringly and in a kind of soliloquy and only overheard by the two strangers who now having received their papers arose to withdraw Will you call at our inn and speak with us That s my card said one as he passed out and gave a visiting card into the youth s hand He took it without a word indeed he was too deeply engaged in his own thoughts to pay much attention to the request The sergeant will accompany you my good youth to your lodgings and verify what you have stated as to your companion To morrow you will appear here again to answer certain questions we shall put to you as to your subsistence and the means by which you live Is it a crime to have wherewithal to subsist upon asked the boy He whose means of living are disproportionate to his evident station may well be an object of suspicion said the other with a sneer And who is to say what is my station or what becomes it Will you take upon you to pronounce upon the question cried the boy boldly Mayhap it is what I shall do very soon was the calm answer Then let me have done with this I ll leave the place as soon as my friend be able to bear removal Even that I ll not promise for Why you ll not detain me here by force exclaimed the youth \ A cold ambiguous smile was the only reply he received to this speech Well let us see when this restraint is to begin cried the boy passionately as he moved towards the door but no impediment was offered to his departure On the contrary the servant at a signal from the Prefect threw wide the two sides of the folding doors and the youth passed out down the stairs and into the street His mind obscured by passion his heart bursting with indignation he threaded his way through many a narrow lane and alley till he reached a small rustic bridge crossing over which he ascended a narrow flight of steps cut in the solid rock and gained a little terrace on which stood a small cottage of the humblest kind As usual in Italy during the summer time the glass sashes of the windows had been removed and the shutters closed Opening one of these gently with his hand he peeped in and as suddenly a voice cried out Are you come back Oh how my heart was aching to see you here again Come in quickly and let me touch your hand The next moment the boy was seated by the bed where lay a man greatly emaciated by sickness and bearing in his worn features the traces of a severe tertian It s going off now said he but the fit was a long one This morning it began at eight o clock but I m throwing it off now and I ll soon be better My poor fellow said the boy caressing the cold fingers within his own hands it was in these midnight rambles of mine you caught the terrible malady As it ever has been your fidelity is fatal to you I told you a thousand times that I was born to hard luck and carried more than enough to swamp all who might try to succor me And don t I say as the ould heathen philosopher did of fortune Nullum numen habes si sit prudentia Is it necessary to say that the speaker was Billy Traynor and the boy his pupil Prudentia said the youth scoffingly may mean anything from trickery to downright meanness since by such acts as these men grow great in life Prudentia is thrift and self denial but it is more too it is a compromise between a man s dignity and his worldly success it is the compact that says Bear this that that may happen and so I ll none of it Tell me how you fared with the Prefect asked Billy You shall hear and judge for yourself said the other and related as well as his memory would serve him the circumstances of his late interview Well well said Billy it might be worse I knew you d say so poor fellow said the youth affectionately you accept the rubs of life as cheerfully as I take them with impatience But after all this is matter of temperament too You can forgive I love better to resist Mine is the better philosophy though said Billy since it will last one s lifetime Forgiveness must dignify old age when your virtue of resistance be no longer possible I never wish to reach the time when I may be too old for it said the boy passionately Hush don t say that It s not for you to determine how long you are to live nor in what frame of mind years are to find you He paused and there was a long unbroken silence between them I have been at the post said the youth at last and found that letter which by the Neapolitan postmark must have been despatched many weeks since Billy Traynor took up the letter whose seal was yet unbroken and having examined it carefully returned it to him saying You did n t answer his last I think No and I half hoped he might have felt offended and given up the correspondence What have we to do with ambassadors or great ministers Billy Ours is not the grand highway in life but the humble path on the mountain side I m content if it only lead upwards said the sick man and the words were uttered firmly but with the solemn fervor of prayer CHAPTER XXVIII A NIGHT SCENE As young Massy for so we like best to call him sat with the letter in his hand a card fell to the ground from between his fingers and taking it up he read the name Lord Selby What does this mean Billy asked he whom can it belong to Oh I remember now There were some strangers at the Podesta s office this morning when I was there and one of them asked me to call at this inn and speak with them He has seen the Alcibiades exclaimed Billy eagerly He has been at the studio How should he rejoined the youth I have not been there myself for two days here is the key He has heard of it then of that I m certain since he could not be in town here an hour without some one telling him of it Massy smiled half sadly and shook his head Go and see him at all events said Billy and be sure to put on your coat and a hat for one would n t know what ye were at all in that cap and dirty blouse I ll go as I am or not at all said the other rising I am Sebastian Greppi a young sculptor At least added he bitterly I have about the same right to that name that I have to any other He turned abruptly away as he spoke and gained the open air There for a few moments he stood seemingly irresolute and then wiping away a heavy tear that had fallen on his cheek he slowly descended the steps towards the bridge When he reached the inn the strangers had just dined but left word that when he called he should be introduced at once and Massy followed the waiter into a small garden where in a species of summer house they were seated at their wine One of them arose courteously as the youth came forward and placing a chair for him and filling out a glass of wine invited him to join them Give him one of your cigars Baynton said the other they are better than mine And Massy accepted and began smoking without a word That fellow at the police office gave you no further trouble I hope said my lord in a half languid tone and with that amount of difficulty that showed he was no master of Italian No replied Massy for the present he has done nothing more I m not so certain however that to morrow or next day I shall not be ordered away from this On what grounds Suspicion Heavens knows of what That s infamous I say Eh Baynton Detestable muttered the other And whereto can you go I scarcely know as yet since the police are in communication throughout the whole Peninsula and they transmit your character from state to state They d not credit this in England Baynton No not a word of it rejoined the other You re a Neapolitan I think I heard him say So my passport states Ah he won t say that he is one though interposed his Lordship in English Do you mind that Baynton Yes I remarked it was the reply And how came you here originally asked Selby turning towards the youth I came here to study and to work There is always enough to be had to do in this place copying the works of great masters and at one s spare moments there is time to try something of one s own And have you done anything of that kind Yes I have begun I have attempted two or three We should like to see them eh Baynton Of course when we ve finished our wine It s not far off is it A few minutes walk but not worth even that when the place is full of things really worth seeing There s Danneker s Bathing Nymph and Canova s Dead Cupid and Rauch s Antigone all within reach Mind that Baynton we must see all these to morrow Could you come about with us and show us what we ought to see Who knows if I shall not be on the road to morrow said the youth smiling faintly Oh I think not if there s really nothing against you if it s only mere suspicion Just so said the other and drank off his wine And you are able to make a good thing of it here by copying I mean asked his Lordship languidly I can live said the youth and as I labor very little and idle a great deal that is saying enough perhaps I m not sure the police are not right about him after all Baynton said his Lordship he doesn t seem to care much about his trade and Massy was unable to repress a smile at the remark You don t understand English do you asked Selby with a degree of eagerness very unusual to him Yes I am English by birth was the answer English and how came you to call yourself a Neapolitan What was the object of that I wished to excite less notice and less observation here and if possible to escape the jealousy with which Englishmen are regarded by the authorities for this I obtained a passport at Naples Baynton eyed him suspiciously as he spoke and as he sipped his wine continued to regard him with a keen glance And how did you manage to get a Neapolitan passport Our Minister Sir Horace Upton managed that for me Oh you are known to Sir Horace then Yes A quick interchange of looks between my lord and his friend showed that they were by no means satisfied that the young sculptor was simply a worker in marble and a fashioner in modelling clay Have you heard from Sir Horace lately asked Lord Selby I received this letter to day but I have not read it and he showed the unopened letter as he spoke The police may then have some reasonable suspicions about your residence here said his Lordship slowly My Lord said Massy rising I have had enough of this kind of examination from the Podesta himself this morning not to care to pass my evening in a repetition of it Who I am what I am and with what object here are scarcely matters in which you have any interest and assuredly were not the subjects on which I expected you should address me I beg now to take my leave He moved towards the garden as he spoke bowing respectfully to each Wait a moment pray don t go sit down again I never meant of course I could n t mean so eh Baynton said his Lordship stammering in great confusion Of course not broke in Baynton his Lordship s inquiries were really prompted by a sincere desire to serve you Just so a sincere desire to serve you In fact seeing you as I may say in the toils Exactly so in the toils He thought very naturally that his influence and his position might you understand for these fellows know perfectly well what an English peer is they take a proper estimate of the power of Great Britain His Lordship nodded assentingly as though any stronger corroboration might not be exactly graceful on his part and Baynton went on Now you perfectly comprehend why you see at once the whole thing and I m sure instead of feeling any soreness or irritation at my lord s interference that in point of fact Just so broke in his Lordship pressing Massy into a seat at his side just so that s it It requires no ordinary tact for any man to reseat himself at a table from which he has risen in anger or irritation and Massy had far too little knowledge of life to overcome this difficulty gracefully He tried indeed to seem at ease he endeavored even to be cheerful but the efforts were all unsuccessful My lord was no very acute observer at any time he was besides so constitutionally indolent that the company which exacted least was ever the most palatable to him As for Baynton he was only too happy whenever least reference was made to his opinion and so they sat and sipped their wine with wonderfully little converse between them You have a statue or a group or something or other have n t you said my lord after a very long interval I have a half finished model said the youth not without a certain irritation at the indifference of his questioner Scarcely light enough to look at it to night eh Baynton Scarcely was the dry answer We can go in the morning though eh The other nodded a cool assent My lord now filled his glass drank it off and refilled with the air of a man nerving himself for a great undertaking and such was indeed the case He was about to deliver himself of a sentiment and the occasion was one to which Baynton could not lend his assistance I have been thinking said he that if that same estate we spoke of Baynton that Welsh property you know and that thing in Ireland should fall in I d buy some statues and have a gallery Devilish costly work you d find it muttered Baynton Well I suppose it is not more so than a racing stable after all Perhaps not Besides I look upon that property if it does ever come to me as a kind of windfall it was one of those pieces of fortune one could n t have expected you know Then turning towards the youth as if to apologize for a discussion in which he could take no part he said We were talking of a property which by the eccentricity of its owner may one day become mine And which doubtless some other had calculated on inheriting said the youth Well that may be very true I never thought about that eh Baynton Why should you was the short response Gain and loss loss and gain muttered the youth moodily are the laws of life I say Baynton what a jolly moonlight there is out there in the garden Would n t it be a capital time this to see your model eh If you are disposed to take the trouble said the youth rising and blushing modestly and the others stood up at the same moment Nothing passed between them as they followed the young sculptor through many an intricate by way and narrow lane and at last reached the little stream on whose bank stood his studio What have we here exclaimed Baynton as he saw it is this a little temple It is my workshop said the boy proudly and produced the key to open the door Scarcely had he crossed the threshold however than his foot struck a roll of papers and stooping down he caught up a large placard headed Morte al Tiranno in large capitals Holding the sheet up to the moonlight he saw that it contained a violent and sanguinary appeal to the wildest passions of the Carbonari one of those savage exhortations to bloodshedding which were taken from the terrible annals of the French Revolution Some of these bore the picture of the guillotine at top others were headed with cross poniards What are all these about asked Baynton as he took up three or four of them in his hand but the youth overcome with terror could make no answer These are all sans culotte literature I take it said his Lordship but the youth was stupefied and silent Has there been any treachery at work here asked Baynton Is there a scheme to entrap you The youth nodded a melancholy and slow assent But why should you be obnoxious to these people Have you any enemies amongst them I cannot tell gloomily muttered the youth And this is your statue said Baynton as opening a large shutter he suffered a flood of moonlight to fall on the figure Illustration two hundred forty two Fine a work of great merit Baynton broke in his Lordship whose apathy was at last overcome by admiration But the youth stood regardless of their comments his eyes bent upon the ground nor did he heed them as they moved from side to side examining the statue in all its details and in words of high praise speaking their approval I ll buy this muttered his Lordship I ll give him an order too for another work leaving the subject to himself A clever fellow certainly replied the other Whom does he mean the figure to represent It is Alcibiades as he meets his death broke in the youth he is summoned to the door as though to welcome a friend and he falls pierced by a poisoned arrow there is but legend to warrant the fact I cared little for the incident I was full of the man as he contended with seven chariots in the Olympic games and proudly rode the course with his glittering shield of ivory and gold and his waving locks all perfumed I thought of him in his gorgeous panoply and his voluptuousness lion hearted and danger seeking pampering the very flesh he offered to the spears of the enemy I pictured him to my mind embellishing life with every charm and daring death in every shape beautiful as Apollo graceful as the bounding Mercury bold as Achilles the lion s whelp as AEschylus calls him This added he in a tone of depression this is but a sorry version of what my mind had conceived I arrest you Sebastiano Greppi said a voice from behind and suddenly three gendarmes surrounded the youth who stood still and speechless with terror while a mean looking man in shabby black gathered up the printed proclamations that lay about and commenced a search for others throughout the studio Ask them will they take our bail for his appearance Baynton said my lord eagerly No use they d only laugh at us was the reply Can we be of any service to you Is there anything we can do asked his Lordship of the boy You must not communicate with the prisoner signore cried the brigadier if you don t wish to share his arrest And this doubtless said the man in black standing and holding up the lantern to view the statue this is the figure of Liberty we have heard of pierced by the deadly arrow of Tyranny You hear them cried the boy in wild indignation addressing the Englishmen you hear how these wretches draw their infamous allegations But this shall not serve them as a witness And with a spring he seized a large wooden mallet from the floor and dashed the model in pieces A cry of horror and rage burst from the bystanders and as the Englishmen stooped in sorrow over the broken statue the gendarmes secured the boy s wrists with a stout cord and led him away Go after them Baynton tell them he is an Englishman and that if he comes to harm they ll hear of it cried my lord eagerly while he muttered in a lower tone I think we might knock these fellows over and liberate him at once eh Baynton No use if we did replied the other they d overpower us afterwards Come along to the inn we ll see about it in the morning CHAPTER XXIX A COUNCIL OF STATE It was a fine mellow evening of the late autumn as two men sat in a large and handsomely furnished chamber opening upon a vast garden There was something in the dim half light the heavily perfumed air rich with the odor of the orange and the lime and the stillness that imparted a sense of solemnity to the scene where indeed few words were interchanged and each seemed to ponder long after every syllable of the other We have no mysteries with our reader and we hasten to say that one of these personages was the Chevalier Stubber confidential minister of the Duke of Massa the other was our old acquaintance Billy Traynor If there was some faint resemblance in the fortunes of these two men who sprung from the humblest walks of life had elevated themselves by their talents to a more exalted station there all likeness between them ended Each represented in some of the very strongest characteristics a nationality totally unlike that of the other the Saxon blunt imperious and decided the Celt subtle quick sighted and suspicious distrustful of all save his own skill in a moment of difficulty But you have not told me his real name yet said the Chevalier as he slowly smoked his cigar and spoke with the half listlessness of a careless inquirer I know that sir said Billy cautiously I don t see any need of it Nor your own either remarked the other Nor even that sir responded Billy calmly It comes to this then my good friend rejoined Stubber that having got yourself into trouble and having discovered by the aid of a countryman that a little frankness would serve you greatly you prefer to preserve a mystery that I could easily penetrate if I cared for it to speaking openly and freely as a man might with one of his own We have no mysteries sir We have family secrets that don t regard any one but ourselves My young ward or pupil whichever I ought to call him has maybe his own reasons for leading a life of unobtrusive obscurity and what one may term an umbrageous existence It s enough for me to know that to respect it Come come all this is very well if you were at liberty or if you stood on the soil of your own country but remember where you are now and what accusations are hanging over you I have here beside me very grave charges indeed constant and familiar intercourse with leaders of the Carbonari We don t know one of them broke in Billy Correspondence with others beyond the frontier continued the Chevalier Nor that either interrupted Billy Treasonable placards found by the police in the very hands of the accused insolent conduct to the authorities when arrested attempted escape all these duly certified on oath Devil may care for that oaths are as plenty with these blaguards as clasp knives and for the same purpose too Here s what it is now said he crossing his arms on the table and staring steadfastly at the other we came here to study and work to perfect ourselves in the art of modellin with good studies around us and more than all a quiet secluded little spot with nothing to distract our attention or take us out of a mind for daily labor That we made a mistake is clear enough Like everywhere else in this fine country there s nothing but tyrants on one side and assassins on the other and meek and humble as we lived we could n t escape the thievin blaguards of spies Do you know the handwriting of this address said the Chevalier showing a sealed letter directed to Sebastiano Greppi Sculptore Carrara Maybe I do maybe I don t was the gruff reply Won t you let me finish what I was savin This letter was found in the possession of the young prisoner and is of some consequence continued the other totally inattentive to the question I suppose a letter is always of consequence to him it s meant for was the half sulky reply Sure you re not goin to break the seal sure you don t mean to read it exclaimed he almost springing from his seat as he spoke I don t think I d ask your permission for anything I think fit to do my worthy fellow said the other sternly and then passing across the room he summoned a gendarme who waited at the door to enter Take this man back to the Fortezza said he calmly and while Billy Traynor slowly followed the guard the other seated himself leisurely at the table lighted his candles and perused the letter Whether disappointed by the contents or puzzled by the meaning he sat long pondering with the document before him It was late in the night when a messenger came to say that his Highness desired to see him and Stubber arose at once and hastened to the Duke s chamber In a room studiously plain and simple in all its furniture and on a low uncurtained bed lay the Prince half dressed a variety of books and papers littering the table and even the floor at his side Maps prints colored drawings some representing views of Swiss scenery others being portraits of opera celebrities were mingled with illuminated missals and richly embossed rosaries while police reports petitions rose colored billets and bon bons made up a mass of confusion wonderfully typical of the illustrious individual himself Stubber had scarcely crossed the threshold of the room when he appeared to appreciate the exact frame of his master s mind It was the very essence of his tact to catch in a moment the ruling impulse which swayed for a time that strange and vacillating nature and he had but to glance at him to divine what was passing within So then broke out the Prince here we are actually in the very midst of revolution Marocchi has been stabbed in the Piazza of Carrara Is it a thing to laugh at sir The wound has only been fatal to the breast of his surtout your Highness and so adroitly given besides that it does not correspond with the incision in his waistcoat You distrust everyone and everything Stubber and of course you attribute all that is going forward to the police Of course I do your Highness They predict events with too much accuracy not to have a hand in their fulfilment I knew three weeks ago when this outbreak was to occur who was to be assassinated since that is the phrase for Marocchi s mock wound who was to be arrested and the exact nature of the demand the Council would make of your Royal Highness to suppress the troubles And what was that asked the Duke grasping a paper in his hand as he spoke An Austrian division with a half battery of field artillery a judge advocate to try the prisoners and a provost marshal to shoot them And you d have me believe that all these disturbances are deliberate plots of a party who desire Austrian influence in the Duchy cried the Duke eagerly There may be really something in what you suspect Here s a letter I have just received from La Sabloukoff she s always keen sighted and she thinks that the Court at Vienna is playing out here the game that they have not courage to attempt in Lombardy What if this Wahnsdorf was a secret agent in the scheme eh Stubber Stubber started with well affected astonishment and appeared as if astounded at the keen acuteness of the Duke s suggestion Eh cried his Highness in evident delight That never occurred to you Stubber I d wager there s not a man in the Duchy could have hit that plot but myself Stubber nodded sententiously without a word I never liked that fellow resumed the Duke I always had my suspicion about that half reckless wasteful manner he had I know that I was alone in this opinion eh Stubber It never struck you Never your Highness never replied Stubber frankly I can t show you the Sabloukoff s letter Stubber there are certain private details for my own eye alone but she speaks of a young sculptor at Carrara a certain Let me find his name Ah here it is Sebastian Greppi a young artist of promise for whom she bespeaks our protection Can you make him out and let us see him Stubber bowed in silence I will give him an order for something There s a pedestal in the flower garden where the Psyche stood You remember I smashed the Psyche because it reminded me of Camilla Monti He shall design a figure for that place I d like a youthful Bacchus I have a clever sketch of one somewhere and it shall be tinted slightly tinted The Greeks always colored their statues Strange enough too for do you remark Stubber they never represented the iris of the eye which the Romans invariably did And yet if you observe closely you ll see that the eyelid implies the direction of the eye more accurately than in the Roman heads I m certain you never detected what I m speaking of eh Stubber Stubber candidly confessed that he had not and listened patiently while his master descanted critically on the different styles of art and his own especial tact and skill in discriminating between them You ll look after these police returns then Stubber said he at last You ll let these people understand that we can suffice for the administration of our own duchy We neither want advice from Metternich nor battalions from Radetzky The laws here are open to every man and if we have any claim to the gratitude of our people it rests on our character for justice While he spoke with a degree of earnestness that indicated sincerity there was something in the expression of his eye a half malicious drollery in its twinkle that made it exceedingly difficult to say whether his words were uttered in honesty of purpose or in mere mockery and derision Whether Stubber rightly understood their import is more than we are able to say but it is very probable that he was with all his shrewdness mystified by one whose nature was a puzzle to himself Let Marocchi return to Carrara Say we have taken the matter into our own hands Change the brigadier in command of the gendarmerie there Tell the canonico Baldetti that we look to him and his deacons for true reports of any movement that is plotting in the town I take no steps with regard to Wahnsdorf for the present but let him be closely watched And then Stubber send off an estafetta to Pietra Santa for the ortolans for I think we have earned our breakfast by all this attention to state affairs And then with a laugh whose accents gave not the very faintest clew to its meaning he lay back on his pillow again And these two prisoners your Highness what is to be done with them Whatever you please Stubber Give them the third class cross of Massa or a month s imprisonment at your own good pleasure Only no more business no papers to sign no schemes to unravel and so good night And the Chevalier retired at once from a presence which he well knew resented no injury so unmercifully as any invasion of his personal comfort CHAPTER XXX THE LIFE THEY LED AT MASSA It was with no small astonishment young Massy heard that he and his faithful follower were not alone restored to liberty but that an order of his Highness had assigned them a residence in a portion of the palace and a promise of future employment This smacks of Turkish rather than of European rule said the youth In prison yesterday in a palace to day My own fortunes are wayward enough Heaven knows not to require any additional ingredient of uncertainty What think you Traynor I m thinkin said Billy gravely that as the bastes of the field are guided by their instincts to objects that suit their natures so man ought by his reason to be able to pilot himself in difficulties choosin this avoidin that seein by the eye of prophecy where a road would lead him and makin of what seem the accidents of life steppin stones to fortune In what way does your theory apply here cried the other How am I to guess whither this current may carry me At all events there s no use wastin your strength by swimmin against it rejoined Billy To be the slave of some despot s whim the tool of a caprice that may elevate me to day and to morrow sentence me to the gallows The object I have set before myself in life is to be independent Is this then the road to it You re tryin to be what no man ever was or will be to the world s end then said Billy Sure it s the very nature and essence of our life here below that we are dependent one on the other for kindness for affection for material help in time of difficulty for counsel in time of doubt The rich man and the poor one have their mutual dependencies and if it was n t so cowld hearted and selfish as the world is it would be five hundred times worse You mistake my meaning said Massy sternly as you often do to read me a lesson on a text of your own When I spoke of independence I meant freedom from the serfdom of another s charity I would that my life here at least should be of my own procuring I get mine from you said Traynor calmly and never felt myself a slave on that account Forgive me my dear kind friend I could hate myself if I gave you a moment s pain This temper of mine does not improve by time There s one way to conquer it Don t be broodin on what s within Don t be magnifyin your evil fortunes to your own heart till you come to think the world all little and yourself all great Go out to your daily labor whatever it be with a stout spirit to do your best and a thankful grateful heart that you are able to do it Never let it out of your mind that if there s many a one your inferior winnin his way up to fame and fortune before you there s just as many better than you toilin away unseen and unnoticed wearin out genius in a garret and carryin off a Godlike intellect to an obscure grave You talk to me as though my crying sin were an overweening vanity said the youth half angrily Well it s one of them said Billy and the blunt frankness of the avowal threw the boy into a fit of laughing You certainly do not intend to spoil me Billy said he still laughing Why would I do what so many is ready to do for nothing What does the crowd that praise the work of a young man of genius care where they re leading him to It s like people callin out to a strong swimmer Go out farther and farther out to the open say where the waves is rollin big and the billows is roughest that s worthy of you in your strong might and your stout limbs Lave the still water and the shallows to the weak and the puny Your course is on the mountain wave over the bottomless ocean It s little they think if he s ever to get back again T is their boast and their pride that they said Go on and when his cold corpse comes washed to shore all they have is a word of derision and scorn for one who ventured beyond his powers How you cool down one s ardor with what pleasure you check every impulse that nerves one s heart for high daring said the youth bitterly These eternal warnings these never ending forebodings of failure are sorry stimulants to energy Is n t it better for you to have all your reverses at the hands of a crayture as humble as me said Billy while the tears glistened in his eyes What good am I except for this In a moment the boy s arms were around him while he cried out There forgive me once more and let me try if I cannot amend a temper that any but yourself had grown weary of correcting I ll work I ll labor I ll submit I ll accept the daily rubs of life as others take them and you shall be satisfied with me We shall go back to all our old pursuits my dear Billy I ll join all your ecstasies over AEschylus and believe as much as I can of Herodotus to please you You shall lead me to all the wonders of the stars and dazzle me with the brightness of visions that my intellect is lost in and in revenge I only ask that you should sit with me in the studio and read to me some of those songs of Horace that move the heart like old wine Shall I own to you what it is which sways me thus uncertainly jarring every chord of my existence making life a sea of stormy conflict Shall I tell you He grasped the other s hand with both his own as he spoke and while his lips quivered in strong emotion went on It is this then I cannot forget do all that I will I cannot root out of my heart what I once believed myself to be You know what I mean Well there it is still like the sense of a wrong or foul injustice as though I had been robbed and cheated of what never was mine This contrast between the life my earliest hopes had pictured and that which I am destined to never leaves me All your teachings and I have seen how devotedly you have addressed yourself to this lesson have not eradicated from my nature the proud instincts that guided my childhood Often and often have you warmed my blood by thoughts of a triumph to be achieved by me hereafter how men should recognize me as a genius and elevate me to honors and rewards and yet would I barter such success ten thousand times told for an hour of that high station that comes by birth alone independent of all effort the heirloom of deeds chronicled centuries back whose actors have been dust for ages That is real pride cried he enthusiastically and has no alloy of the petty vanity that mingles with the sense of a personal triumph Traynor hung his head heavily as the youth spoke and a gloomy melancholy settled on his features the sad conviction came home to him of all his counsels being fruitless all his teachings in vain and as the boy sat wrapped in a wild dreamy revery of ancestral greatness the humble peasant brooded darkly over the troubles such a temperament might evoke It is agreed then cried Massy suddenly that we are to accept of this great man s bounty live under his roof and eat his bread Well I accede as well his as another s Have you seen the home they destine for us Yes it s a real paradise and in a garden that would beat Adam s now exclaimed Traynor for there s marble fountains and statues and temples and grottos in it and it s as big as a prairie and as wild as a wilderness And better than all there s a little pathway leads to a private stair that goes up into the library of the palace a spot nobody ever enters and where you may study the whole day long without hearin a footstep All the books is there that ever was written and manuscripts without end besides and the Minister says I m to have my own kay and go in and out whenever I plaze And if there s anything wantin says be just order it on a slip of paper and send it to me and you ll have it at once When I asked if I ought to spake to the librarian himself he only laughed and said That s me but I m never there Take my word for it Doctor you ll have the place to yourself He spoke truly Billy Traynor had it indeed to himself There the gray dawn of morning and the last shadows of evening ever found him seated in one of those deep cell like recesses of the windows the table the seats the very floor littered with volumes which revelling in the luxury of wealth he had accumulated around him His greedy avidity for knowledge knew no bounds The miser s thirst for gold was weak in comparison with that intense craving that seized upon him Historians critics satirists poets dramatists metaphysicians never came amiss to a mind bent on acquiring The life he led was like the realization of a glorious dream the calm repose the perfect stillness of the spot the boundless stores that lay about him the growing sense of power as day by day his intellect expanded new vistas opened themselves before him and new and unproved sources of pleasure sprang up in his nature The never ending variety gave a zest too to his labors that averted all weariness and at last he divided his time ingeniously alternating grave and difficult subjects with lighter topics making as he said himself Aristophanes digest Plato And what of young Massy all this while His life was a dream too but of another and very different kind Visions of a glorious future alternated with sad and depressing thoughts high darings and hopeless views of what lay before him came and went and went and came again The Duke who had just taken his departure for some watering place in Germany gave him an order for certain statues the models for which were to be ready by his return at least in that sketchy state of which clay is even more susceptible than canvas The young artist chafed and fretted under the restraint of an assigned task It was gall to his haughty nature to be told that his genius should accept dictation and his fancy be fettered by the suggestions of another If he tried to combat this rebellious spirit and addressed himself steadily to labor he found that his imagination grew sluggish and his mind uncreative The sense of servitude oppressed him and though he essayed to subdue himself to the condition of an humble artist the old pride still rankled in his heart and spirited him to a haughty resistance His days thus passed over in vain attempts to work or still more unprofitable lethargy He lounged through the deserted garden or lay half dreamily in the long deep grass listening to the cicala or watching the emerald backed lizards as they lay basking in the sun He drank in all the soft voluptuous influences of a climate which steeps the senses in a luxurious stupor making the commonest existence a toil but giving to mere indolence all the zest of a rich enjoyment Sometimes he wandered into the library and noiselessly drew nigh the spot where Billy sat deeply busied in his books He would gaze silently half curiously at the poor fellow and then steal noiselessly away pondering on the blessings of that poor peasant s nature and wondering what in his own organization had denied him the calm happiness of this humble man s life CHAPTER XXXI AT MASSA Billy Traynor sat deeply sunk in study in the old recess of the palace library A passage in the Antigone had puzzled him and the table was littered with critics and commentators while manuscript notes scrawled in the most rude hand lay on every side He did not perceive in his intense preoccupation that Massy had entered and taken the place directly in front of him There the youth sat gazing steadfastly at the patient and studious features before him It was only when Traynor mastering the difficulty that had so long opposed him broke out into an enthusiastic declamation of the text that Massy unable to control the impulse laughed aloud How long are you there I never noticed you comin in said Billy half shamed at his detected ardor But a short time I was wondering at ay Billy and was envying too the concentrated power in which you address yourself to your task It is the real secret of all success and somehow it is a frame of mind I cannot achieve How is the boy Bacchus goin on asked Billy eagerly I broke him up yesterday and it is like a weight off my heart that his curly bullet head and sensual lips are not waiting for me as I enter the studio And the Cleopatra asked Traynor still more anxiously Smashed destroyed Shall I own to you Billy I see at last myself what you have so often hinted to me I have no genius for the work I never said I never thought so cried the other I only insisted that nothing was to be done without labor hard unflinching labor that easy successes were poor triumphs and bore no results There there I ll hear that sermon no more I d not barter the freedom of my own unfettered thoughts as they come and go in hours of listless idleness for all the success you ever promised me There are men toil elevates me it wearies to depression and brings no compensation in the shape of increased power Mine is an unrewarding clay that s the whole of it Cultivation only develops the rank weeds which are deep sown in the soil I d like to travel to visit some new land some scene where all association with the past shall be broken What say you I m ready and at your orders said Traynor closing his book East or west then which shall it be If sometimes my heart yearns for the glorious scenes of Palestine full of memories that alone satisfy the soul s longings there are days when I pant for the solitude of the vast savannas of the New World I feel as if to know one s self thoroughly one s nature should be tested by the perils and exigencies of a life hourly making some demand on courage and ingenuity The hunter s life does this What say you shall we try it I m ready was the calm reply We have means for such an enterprise have we not You told me some short time past that nearly the whole of our last year s allowance was untouched Yes it s all there to the good said Billy a good round sum too Let us get rid of all needless equipment then cried Massy and only retain what beseems a prairie life Sell everything or give it away at once Leave all that to me I ll manage everything only say when you make up your mind But it is made up I have resolved on the step Few can decide so readily for I leave neither home nor country behind Don t say that burst in Billy here s myself the poorest crayture that walks the earth that never knew where he was born or who nursed him yet even to me there s the tie of a native land there s the soil that reared warriors and poets and orators that I heard of when a child and gloried in as a man and better than that there s the green meadows and the leafy valleys where kind hearted men and women live and labor spakin our own tongue and feelin our own feelin s and that if we saw to morrow we d know were our own heart and hand our own The smell of the yellow furze under a griddle of oaten bread would be sweeter to me than all the gales of Araby the Blest for it would remind me of the hearth I had my share of and the roof that covered me when I was alone in the world The boy buried his face in his hands and made no answer At last raising up his head he said Let us try this life let us see if action be not better than mere thought The efforts of intellect seem to inspire a thirst there is no slaking Sleep brings no rest after them I long for the sense of some strong peril which over gives the proud feeling of a goal reached a feat accomplished I ll go wherever you like I ll be whatever you want me said Billy affectionately Let us lose no time then I would not that my present ardor should cool ere we have begun our plan What day is this The seventh Well on the eighteenth there is a ship sails from Genoa for Porto Rico It was the announcement set my heart a thinking of the project I dreamed of it two entire nights I fancied myself walking the deck on a starlit night and framing all my projects for the future The first thing I saw next morning was the same placard The Colombo will sail for Porto Rico on Friday the eighteenth An unlucky day muttered Billy interrupting I have fallen upon few that were otherwise said Massy gloomily besides he added after a pause I have no faith in omens or any care for superstitions Come let us set about our preparations Do you bethink you how to rid ourselves of all useless encumbrances here Be it my care to jot down the list of all we shall need for the voyage and the life to follow it Let us see which displays most zeal for the new enterprise Billy Traynor addressed himself with a will to the duty allotted him He rummaged through drawers and desks destroyed papers and letters laid aside all the articles which he judged suitable for preservation and then hastened off to the studio to arrange for the disposal of the few studies for they were scarcely more which remained of Massy s labors A nearly finished Faun the head of a Niobe the arm and hand of a Jove launching a thunderbolt the torso of a dead sailor after shipwreck lay amid fragments of shattered figures grotesque images some caricatures of his own works and crude models of anatomy The walls were scrawled with charcoal drawings of groups one day to be fashioned in sculpture with verses from Dante or lines from Tasso inscribed beneath proud resolves to a life of labor figured beside stanzas in praise of indolence and dreamy abandonment There were passages of Scripture too glorious bursts of the poetic rapture of the Psalms intermingled with quaint remarks on life from Jean Paul or Herder All that a discordant incoherent nature consisted of was there in some shape or other depicted and as Billy ran his eye over this curious journal for such it was he grieved over the spirit which had dictated it The whole object of all his teaching had been to give a purpose to this uncertain and wavering nature and yet everything showed him now that he had failed The blight which had destroyed the boy s early fortunes still worked its evil influences poisoning every healthful effort and dashing with a sense of shame every successful step towards fame and honor Maybe he s right after all muttered Billy to himself The New World is the only place for those who have not the roots of an ancient stock to hold them in the Old Men can be there whatever is in them and they can be judged without the prejudices of a class Having summed up as it were his own doubts in this remark he proceeded with his task While he was thus occupied Massy entered and threw himself into a chair There you may give it up Traynor Fate is ever against us do and decide on what we will Your confounded omen of a Friday was right this time What do you mean Have you altered your mind I expected you to say so said the other bitterly I knew that I should meet with this mockery of my resolution but it is uncalled for It is not I that have changed What is it then has happened do they refuse your passport Not that either I never got so far as to ask for it The misfortune is in this wise on going to the bank to learn the sum that lay to my credit and draw for it I was met by the reply that I had nothing there not a shilling Before I could demand how this could be the case the whole truth suddenly flashed across my memory and I recalled to mind how one night as I lay awake the thought occurred to me that it was base and dishonorable in me now that I was come to manhood to accept of the means of life from one who felt shame in my connection with him Why thought I is there to be the bond of dependence where there is no tie of affection to soften its severity And so I arose from my bed and wrote to Sir Horace saying that by the same post I should remit to his banker at Naples whatever remained of my last year s allowance and declined in future to accept of any further assistance This I did the same day and never told you of it partly lest you should try to oppose me in my resolve partly and here his voice faltered to spare myself the pain of revealing my motives And now that I have buoyed my heart up with this project I find myself without means to attempt it Not that I regret my act or would recall it cried he proudly but that the sudden disappointment is hard to bear I was feeding my hopes with such projects for the future when this stunning news met me and the thought that I am now chained here by necessity has become a torture What answer did Sir Horace give to your letter asked Billy I forget I believe he never replied to it or if he did I have no memory of what he said Stay there was a letter of his taken from me when I was arrested at Carrara The seal was unbroken at the time I remember the letter was given to the Minister who has it still in his keeping What care I cried Massy angrily in whose hands it may be The Minister is not here now said Billy half speaking to himself he is travelling with the Duke but when he comes back When he comes back burst in Massy impatiently with what calm philosophy you look forward to a remote future I tell you that this scheme is now a part and parcel of my very existence I can turn to no other project or journey no other road in life till at least I shall have tried it Well it is going to work in a more humble fashion said Billy calmly Leave me to dispose of all these odds and ends here This trash cried the youth fiercely Who would accept it as a gift Don t disparage it there are signs of genius even in these things but above all don t meddle with me but just leave me free to follow my own way There now go back and employ yourself preparing for the road trust the rest to me Massy obeyed without speaking It was not indeed that he ventured to believe in Traynor s resources but he was indisposed to further discussion and longed to be in solitude once more It was late at night when they met again Charles Massy was seated at a window of his room looking out into the starry blue of a cloudless sky when Traynor sat down beside him Well said he gently it s all done and finished I have sold off everything and if you will only repair the hand of the Faun which I broke in removing there s nothing more wanting That much can be done by any one said Massy haughtily I hope never to set eyes on the trumpery things again But I have promised you would do it said Traynor eagerly And how by what right could you pledge yourself for my labor Nay cried he suddenly changing the tone in which he spoke knowing my wilful nature how could you answer for what I might or might not do I knew said Billy slowly that you had a great project in your head and that to enable you to attempt it you would scorn to throw all the toil upon another I never said I was ashamed of labor said the youth reddening with shame If you had I would despair of you altogether rejoined the other Well what is it that I have to do said Massy bluntly It is to remodel the arm for I don t think you can mend it but you ll see it yourself Where is the figure in the studio No it is in a small pavilion of a villa just outside the gates It was while I was conveying it there it met this misfortune There s the name of the villa on that card You ll find the garden gate open and by taking the path through the olive wood you ll be there in a few minutes for I must go over to morrow to Carrara with the Niobe the Academy has bought it for a model A slight start of surprise and a faint flush bespoke the proud astonishment with which he heard of this triumph but he never spoke a word If you had any pride in your works you d be delighted to see where the Faun is to be placed It is in a garden handsomer even than this here with terraces rising one over the other and looking out on the blue sea from the golden strand of Via Reggio down to the headlands above Spezia The great olive wood in the vast plain lies at your feet and the white cliffs of Serravezza behind you What care I for all this said Massy gloomily Benvenuto could afford to be in love with his own works I cannot Traynor saw at once the mood of mind he was in and stole noiselessly away to his room CHAPTER XXXII THE PAVILION IN THE GARDEN Charles Massy dressed in the blouse of his daily labor and with the tools of his craft in his hand set out early in search of the garden indicated by Billy Traynor A sense of hope that it was for the last time he was to exercise his art that a new and more stirring existence was now about to open before him made his step lighter and his spirits higher as he went Once amid the deep woods and on the wide plains of the New World I shall dream no more of what judgment men may pass upon my efforts There if I suffice to myself I have no other ordeal to meet Perils may try me but not the whims and tastes of other men Thus fancying an existence of unbounded freedom and unfettered action he speedily traversed the olive wood and almost ere he knew it found himself within the garden The gorgeous profusion of beautiful flowers the graceful grouping of shrubs the richly perfumed air laden with a thousand odors first awoke him from his day dream and he stood amazed in the midst of a scene surpassing all that he had ever conceived of loveliness From the terrace where under a vine trellis he was standing he could perceive others above him rising on the mountain side while some beneath descended towards the sea which blue as a turquoise lay basking and glittering below A stray white sail or so was to be seen but there was barely wind to shake the olive leaves and waft the odors of the orange and the oleander It was yet too early for the hum of insect life and the tricklings of the tiny fountains that sprinkled the flower beds were the only sounds in the stillness It was in color outline effect and shadow a scene such as only Italy can present and Massy drank in all its influences with an eager delight Were I a rich man said he I would buy this paradise What in all the splendor of man s invention can compare with the gorgeous glory of this flowery carpet What frescoed ceiling could vie with these wide leaved palms interlaced with these twining acacias glimpses of the blue sky breaking through And for a mirror there lies Nature s own the great blue ocean What a life were it to linger days and hours here amid such objects of beauty having one s thoughts ever upwards and making in imagination a world of which these should be the types The faintest fancies that could float across the mind in such an existence would be pleasures more real more tangible than ever were felt in the tamer life of the actual world Loitering along he at length came upon the little temple which served as a studio on entering which he found his own statue enshrined in the place of honor Whether it was the frame of mind in which he chanced to be or that place and light had some share in the result for the first time the figure struck him as good and he stood long gazing at his own work with the calm eye of a critic At length detecting as he deemed some defects in design he drew nigh and began to correct them There are moments in which the mind attains the highest and clearest perception seasons in which whatever the nature of the mental operation the faculties address themselves readily to the task and labor becomes less a toil than an actual pleasure This was such Massy worked on for hours his conceptions grew rapidly under his hand into bold realities and he saw that he was succeeding It was not alone that he had imparted a more graceful and lighter beauty to his statue but he felt within himself the promptings of a spirit that grew with each new suggestion of its own Efforts that before had seemed above him he now essayed boldly difficulties that once had appeared insurmountable he now encountered with courageous daring Thus striving he lost all sense of fatigue Hunger and exhaustion were alike unremembered and it was already late in the afternoon as overcome by continued toil he threw himself heavily down and sank off into a deep sleep It was nigh sunset as he awoke The distant bell of a monastery was ringing the hour of evening prayer the solemn chime of the Venti quattro as he leaned on his arm and gazed in astonishment around him The whole seemed like a dream On every side were objects new and strange to his eyes casts and models he had never seen before busts and statues and studies all unknown to him At last his eyes rested on the Faun and he remembered at once where he was The languor of excessive fatigue however still oppressed him and he was about to lie back again in sleep when bending gently over him a young girl with a low soft accent asked if he felt ill or only tired Massy gazed without speaking at features regular as the most classic model and whose paleness almost gave them the calm beauty of the marble His steady stare slightly colored her cheek and made her voice falter a little as she repeated her question I scarcely know said he sighing heavily I feel as though this were a dream and I am afraid to awaken from it Let me give you some wine said she bending down to hand him the glass you have over fatigued yourself The Faun is by your hand is it not He nodded a slow assent Whence did you derive that knowledge of ancient art said she eagerly Your figure has the light elasticity of the classic models and yet nothing strained or exaggerated in attitude Have you studied at Rome I could do better now said the youth as rising on his elbow he strained his eyes to examine her I could achieve a real success A deep flush covered her face at these words so palpably alluding to herself and she tried to repeat her question No said he I cannot say I have ever studied all that I have done is full of faults but I feel the spring of better things within me Tell me is this your home Yes said she smiling faintly I live in the villa here with my aunt She has purchased your statue and wishes you to repair it and then to engage in some other work for her Let me assist you to rise you seem very weak I am weak and weary too said he staggering to a seat I have overworked myself perhaps I scarcely know Do not take away your hand And you are then the Sebastian Greppi of whom Carrara is so proud They call me Sebastian Greppi but I never heard that my name was spoken of with any honor You are unjust to your own fame We have often heard of you See here are two models taken from your works They have been my studies for many a day I have often wished to see you and ask if my attempt were rightly begun Then here is a hand Let me model yours said the youth gazing steadfastly at the beautifully shaped one which rested on the chair beside him Come with me to the villa and I will present you to my aunt she will be pleased to know you There lean on my arm for I see you are very weak Why are you so kind so good to me said he faintly while a tear rose slowly to his eye He arose totteringly and taking her arm walked slowly along at her side As they went she spoke kindly and encouragingly to him praised what she had seen of his works and said how frequently she had wished to know him and enjoy the benefit of his counsels in art For I too said she laughing would be a sculptor The youth stopped to gaze at her with a rapture he could not control That one of such a station surrounded by all the appliances of a luxurious existence could devote herself to the toil and labor of art implied an amount of devotion and energy that at once elevated her in his esteem She blushed deeply at his continued stare and turned at last away Oh do not feel offended with me cried he passionately If you but knew how your words have relighted within me the dying out embers of an almost exhausted ambition if you but knew how my heart has gained courage and hope how light and brightness have shone in upon me after hours and days of gloom It was but yesterday I had resolved to abandon this career forever I was bent on a new life in a new world beyond the seas These few things that a faithful companion of mine had charged himself to dispose of were to supply the means of the journey and now I think of it no more I shall remain here to work hard and study and try to achieve what may one day be called good You will sometimes deign to see what I am doing to tell me if my efforts are on the road to success to give me hope when I am weak hearted and courage when I am faint I know and feel said he proudly that I am not devoid of what accomplishes success for I can toil and toil and throw my whole soul into my work but for this I need at least one who shall watch me with an eye of interest glorying when I win sorrowing when I am defeated Where are we What palace is this cried he as they crossed a spacious hall paved with porphyry and Sienna marble This is my home said the girl and this is its mistress Just as she spoke she presented the youth to a lady who reclining on a sofa beside a window gazed out towards the sea She turned suddenly and fixed her eyes on the stranger With a wild start she sprang up and staring eagerly at him cried Who is this Where does he come from Illustration frontispiece The young girl told his name and what he was but the words did not fall on listening ears and the lady sat like one spell bound with eyes riveted on the youth s face Am I like any one you have known signora asked he as he read the effect his presence had produced on her Do I recall some other features You do said she reddening painfully And the memory is not of pleasure added the youth Far far from it it is the saddest and cruelest of all my life muttered she half to herself What part of Italy are you from Your accent is Southern It is the accent of Naples signora said he evading her question And your mother was she Neapolitan I know little of my birth signora It is a theme I would not be questioned on And you are a sculptor The artist of the Faun dearest aunt broke in the girl who watched with intense anxiety the changing expressions of the youth s features Your voice even more than your features brings up the past said the lady as a deadly pallor spread over her own face and her lips trembled as she spoke Will you not tell me something of your history When you have told me the reason for which you ask it perhaps I may said the youth half sternly There there cried she wildly in every tone in every gesture I trace this resemblance Come nearer to me let me see your hands They are seamed and hardened with toil lady said the youth as he showed them And yet they look as if there was a time when they did not know labor said she eagerly An impatient gesture as if he would not endure a continuance of this questioning stopped her and she said in a faint tone I ask your pardon for all this My excuse and my apology are that your features have recalled a time of sorrow more vividly than any words could Your voice too strengthens the illusion It may be a mere passing impression I hope and pray it is Come Ida come with me Do not leave this sir till we speak with you again So saying she took her niece s arm and left the room CHAPTER XXXIII NIGHT THOUGHTS It was with a proud consciousness of having well fulfilled his mission that Billy Traynor once more bent his steps towards Massa Besides providing himself with books of travel and maps of the regions they were about to visit he had ransacked Genoa for weapons and accoutrements and horse gear Well knowing the youth s taste for the costly and the splendid he had suffered himself to be seduced into the purchase of a gorgeously embroidered saddle mounting and a rich bridle in Mexican taste a pair of splendidly mounted pistols chased in gold and studded with large turquoises with a Damascus sabre the hilt of which was a miracle of fine workmanship were also amongst his acquisitions and poor Billy fed his imagination with the thought of all the delight these objects were certain to produce In this way he never wearied admiring them and a dozen times a day would he unpack them just to gratify his mind by picturing the enjoyment they were to afford How well you are lookin my dear boy cried he as he burst into the youth s room and threw his arms around him tis like ten years off my life to see you so fresh and so hearty Is it the prospect of the glorious time before us that has given this new spring to your existence More likely it is the pleasure I feel in seeing you back again said Massy and his cheek grew crimson as he spoke Tis too good you are to me too good said Billy and his eyes ran over in tears while he turned away his head to hide his emotion but sure it is part of yourself I do be growing every day I live At first I could n t bear the thought of going away to live in exile in a wilderness as one may say but now that I see your heart set upon it and that your vigor and strength comes back just by the mere anticipation of it I m downright delighted with the plan Indeed said the youth dreamily To be sure I am resumed Billy and I do be thinking there s a kind of poethry in carrying away into the solitary pine forest minds stored with classic lore to be able to read one s Horace beside the gushing stream that flows on nameless and unknown and con over ould Herodotus amidst adventures stranger than ever he told himself It might be a happy life said the other slowly almost moodily Ay and it will be said Billy confidently Think of yourself mounted on that saddle on a wild prairie horse galloping free as the wind itself over the wide savannas with a drove of rushing buffaloes in career before you and so eager in pursuit that you won t stop to bring down the scarlet winged bustard that swings on the branch above you There they go plungin and snortin the mad devils with a force that would sweep a fortress before them and here are we after them makin the dark woods echo again with our wild yells That s what will warm up our blood till we ll not be afeard to meet an army of dragoons themselves Them pistols once belonged to Cariatoke a chief from Scio and that blade a real Damascus was worn by an Aga of the Janissaries Isn t it a picture The youth poised the sword in his hand and laid it down without a word while Billy continued to stare at him with an expression of intensest amazement Is it that you don t care for it all now that your mind is changed and that you don t wish for the life we were talkin over these three weeks Say so at once my own darlin and here I am ready and willin never to think more of it Only tell me what s passin in your heart I ask no more I scarcely know it myself said the youth I feel as though in a dream and know not what is real and what fiction How have you passed your time What were you doin while I was away Dreaming I believe said the other with a sigh Some embers of my old ambition warmed up into a flame once more and I fancied that there was that in me that by toil and labor might yet win upwards and that if so this mere life of action would but bring repining and regret and that I should feel as one who chose the meaner casket of fate when both were within my reach So you were at work again in the studio I have been finishing the arm of the Faun in that pavilion outside the town A flush of crimson covered his face as he spoke which Billy as quickly noticed but misinterpreted Ay and they praised you I ll be bound They said it was the work of one whose genius would place him with the great ones of art and that he who could do this while scarcely more than a boy might in riper years be the great name of his century Did they not tell you so No not that not that said the other slowly Then they bade you go on and strive and labor hard to develop into life the seeds of that glorious gift that was in you Nor that sighed the youth heavily while a faint spot of crimson burned on one cheek and a feverish lustre lit up his eye They did n t dispraise what you done did they broke in Billy They could not if they wanted to do it but sure there s nobody would have the cruel heart to blight the ripenin bud of genius to throw gloom over a spirit that has to struggle against its own misgivin s You wrong them my dear friend their words were all kindness and affection They gave me hope and encouragement too They fancy that I have in me what will one day grow into fame itself and even you Billy in your most sanguine hopes have never dreamed of greater success for me than they have predicted in the calm of a moonlit saunter May the saints in heaven reward them for it said Billy and in his clasped hands and uplifted eyes was all the fervor of a prayer They have my best blessin for their goodness muttered he to himself And so I am again a sculptor said Massy rising and walking the room Upon this career my whole heart and soul are henceforth to be concentrated my fame my happiness are to be those of the artist From this day and this hour let every thought of what not what I once was but what I had hoped to be be banished from my heart I am Sebastian Greppi Never let another name escape your lips to me I will not even for a second turn from the path in which my own exertions are to win the goal Let the faraway land of my infancy its traditions its associations be but dreams for evermore Forwards forwards cried he passionately not a glance not a look towards the past Billy stared with admiration at the youth over whose features a glow of enthusiasm was now diffused and in broken unconnected words spoke encouragement and good cheer I know well said the youth how this same stubborn pride must be rooted out how these false deceitful visions of a stand and a station that I am never to attain must give place to nobler and higher aspirations and you my dearest friend must aid me in all this unceasingly unwearyingly reminding me that to myself alone must I look for anything and that if I would have a country a name or a home it is by the toil of this head and these hands they are to be won My plan is this said he eagerly seizing the other s arm and speaking with immense rapidity A life not alone of labor but of the simplest not a luxury not an indulgence our daily meals the humblest our dress the commonest nothing that to provide shall demand a moment s forethought or care no wants that shall turn our thoughts from this great object no care for the requirements that others need Thus mastering small ambitions and petty desires we shall concentrate all our faculties on our art and even the humblest may thus outstrip those whose higher gifts reject such discipline You ll not live longer under the Duke s patronage then said Traynor Not an hour I return to that garden no more There s a cottage on the mountain road to Serravezza will suit us well it stands alone and on an eminence with a view over the plain and the sea beyond You can see it from the door there to the left of the olive wood lower down than the old ruin We ll live there Billy and we ll make of that mean spot a hallowed one where young enthusiasts in art will come years hence when we have passed away to see the humble home Sebastian lived in to sit upon the grassy seat where he once sat when dreaming of the mighty triumphs that have made him glorious A wild burst of mocking laughter rung from the boy s lips as he said this but its accents were less in derision of the boast than a species of hysterical ecstasy at the vision he had conjured up And why would n t it be so exclaimed Billy ardently why would n t you be great and illustrious The moment of excitement was now over and the youth stood pale silent and almost sickly in appearance great drops of perspiration too stood on his forehead and his quivering lips were bloodless These visions are like meteor streaks said he falteringly they leave the sky blacker than they found it But come along let us to work and we ll soon forget mere speculation Of the life they now led each day exactly resembled the other Rising early the youth was in his studio at dawn the faithful Billy seated near read for him while he worked Watching with a tact that only affection ever bestows each changeful mood of the youth s mind Traynor varied the topics with the varying humors of the other and thus little of actual conversation took place between them though their minds journeyed along together To eke out subsistence even humble as theirs the young sculptor was obliged to make small busts and figures for sale and Billy disposed of them at Lucca and Pisa making short excursions to these cities as need required The toil of the day over they wandered out towards the seashore taking the path which led through the olive road by the garden of the villa At times the youth would steal away a moment from his companion and enter the little park with every avenue of which he was familiar and although Billy noticed his absence he strictly abstained from the slightest allusion to it As he delayed longer and longer to return Traynor maintained the same reserve and thus there grew up gradually a secret between them a mystery that neither ventured to approach With a delicacy that seemed an instinct in his humble nature Billy would now and then feign occupation or fatigue to excuse himself from the evening stroll and thus leave the youth free to wander as he wished till at length it became a settled habit between them to separate at nightfall to meet only on the morrow These nights were spent in walking the garden around the villa lingering stealthily amid the trees to watch the room where she was sitting to catch a momentary glimpse of her figure as it passed the window to hear perchance a few faint accents of her voice Hours long would he so watch in the silent night his whole soul steeped in a delicious dream wherein her image moved and came and went with every passing fancy In the calm moonlight he would try to trace her footsteps in the gravel walk that led to the studio and lingering near them whisper to her words of love One night as he loitered thus he thought he was perceived for as he suddenly emerged from a dark alley into a broad space where the moonlight fell strongly he saw a figure on a terrace above him but without being able to recognize to whom it belonged Timidly and fearfully he retired within the shade and crept noiselessly away shocked at the very thought of discovery The next day he found a small bouquet of fresh flowers on the rustic seat beneath the window At first he scarcely dared to touch it but with a sudden flash of hope that it had been destined for himself he pressed the flowers to his lips and hid them in his bosom Each night now the same present attracted him to the same place and thus at once within his heart was lighted a flame of hope that illuminated all his being making his whole life a glorious episode and filling all the long hours of the day with thoughts of her who thus could think of him Life has its triumphant moments its dream of entrancing ecstatic delight when suocess has crowned a hard fought struggle or when the meed of other men s praise comes showered on us The triumphs of heroism of intellect of noble endurance the trials of temptation met and conquered the glorious victory over self interest are all great and ennobling sensations but what are they all compared with the first consciousness of being loved of being to another the ideal we have made of her To this nothing the world can give is equal From the moment we have felt it life changes around us Its crosses are but barriers opposed to our strong will that to assail and storm is a duty Then comes a heroism in meeting the every day troubles of existence as though we were soldiers in a good and holy cause No longer unseen or unmarked in the great ocean of life we feel that there is an eye ever turned towards us a heart ever throbbing with our own that our triumphs are its triumphs our sorrows its sorrows Apart from all the intercourse with the world with its changeful good and evil we feel that we have a treasure that dangers cannot approach we know that in our heart of hearts a blessed mystery is locked up a well of pure thoughts that can calm down the most fevered hour of life s anxieties So the youth felt and feeling so was happy CHAPTER XXXIV A MINISTER S LETTER British Legation Naples Nov eighteen My dear Harcourt Not mine the fault that your letter has lain six weeks unanswered but having given up penwork myself for the last eight months and Crawley my private sec being ill the delay was unavoidable The present communication you owe to the fortunate arrival here of Captain Mellish who has kindly volunteered to be my amanuensis I am indeed sorely grieved at this delay I shall be desole if it occasion you anything beyond inconvenience How a private sec should permit himself the luxury of an attack of influenza I cannot conceive We shall hear of one s hairdresser having the impertinence to catch cold to morrow or next day If I don t mistake it was you yourself recommended Crawley to me and I am only half grateful for the service He is a man of small prejudices fancies that he ought to have a regular hour for dinner thinks that he should have acquaintances and will persist in imagining himself an existent something appertaining to the Legation while in reality he is only a shadowy excrescence of my own indolent habits the recipient of the trashy superfluities one commits to paper and calls despatches Latterly in my increasing laziness I have used him for more intimate correspondence and as Doctor Allitore has now denied me all manual exertion whatever I am actually wholly dependent on such aid I m sure I long for the discovery of some other mode of transmitting one s brain efforts than by the slow process of manuscript some photographic process that by a series of bright pictures might display en tableau what one is now reduced to accomplish by narrative As it ever did and ever will happen too they have deluged me with work when I crave rest Every session of Parliament must have its blue book and by the devil s luck they have decided that Italy is to furnish the present one You have always been a soldier and whenever your inspecting general came his round your whole care has been to make the troop horses look as fat the men s whiskers as trim their overalls as clean and their curb chains as bright as possible You never imagined or dreamed of a contingency when it would be desirable that the animals should be all sorebacked the whole regiment under stoppages and the trumpeter in a quinsy Had you been a diplomatist instead of a dragoon this view of things might perhaps have presented itself and the chief object of your desire have been to show that the system under which you functionated worked as ill as need be that the court to which you were accredited abhorred you its Ministers snubbed its small officials slighted you that all your communications were ill received your counsels ill taken that what you reprobated was adopted what you advised rejected in fact that the only result of your presence was the maintenance of a perpetual ill will and bad feeling and that without the aid of a line of battle ship or at least a frigate your position was no longer tenable From the moment my dear H that you can establish this fact you start into life as an able and active Minister imbued with thoroughly British principles an active asserter of what is due to his country s rights and dignity not truckling to court favor or tamely submitting to royal impertinences not like the noble lord at this place or the more subservient viscount at that but in plain words an admirable public servant whose reward whatever courts and cabinets may do will always be willingly accorded by a grateful nation I am afraid this sketch of a special envoy s career will scarcely tempt you to exchange for a mission abroad And you are quite right my dear friend It is a very unrewarding profession I often wish myself that I had taken something in the colonies or gone into the Church or some other career which had given me time and opportunity to look after my health of which by the way I have but an indifferent account to render you These people here can t hit it off at all Harcourt they keep muddling away about indigestion deranged functions and the rest of it The mischief is in the blood I mean in the undue distribution of the blood So Treysenac the man of Bagneres proved to me There is a flux and reflux in us as in the tides and when from deficient energy or lax muscular power that ceases we are all driven by artificial means to remedy the defect Treysenac s theory is position By a number of ingeniously contrived positions he accomplishes an artificial congestion of any part he pleases and in his establishment at Bagneres you may see some fifty people strung up by the arms and legs by the waists or the ankles in the most marvellous manner and with truly fabulous success I myself passed three mornings suspended by the middle like the sheep in the decoration of the Golden Fleece and was amazed at the strange sensations I experienced before I was cut down You know the obstinacy with which the medical people reject every discovery in the art and only sanction its employment when the world has decreed in its favor You will therefore not be surprised to hear that Larrey and Cooper to whom I wrote about Treysenac s theory sent me very unsatisfactory indeed very unseemly replies I have resolved however not to let the thing drop and am determined to originate a Suspensorium in England when I can chance upon a man of intelligence and scientific knowledge to conduct it Like mesmerism the system has its antipathies and thus yesterday Crawley fainted twice after a few minutes suspension by the arms But he is a bigot about anything he hears for the first time and I was not sorry at his punishment I wish you would talk over this matter with any clever medical man in your neighborhood and let me hear the result And so you are surprised you say how little influence English representations exercise over the determinations of foreign cabinets I go farther and confess no astonishment at all at the no influence My dear dragoon have you not some hundred and fifty times in this life endured a small martyrdom in seeing a very indifferent rider torment almost to madness the animal he bestrode just by sheer ignorance and awkwardness now worrying the flank with incautious heel now irritating the soft side of the mouth with incessant jerkings always counteracting the good impulses ever prompting the bad ones of his beast And have you not while heartily wishing yourself in the saddle felt the utter inutility of administering any counsels to the rider You saw and rightly saw that even if he attempted to follow your suggestions he would do so awkwardly and inaptly acting at wrong moments and without that continuity of purpose which must ever accompany an act of address and that for his safety and even for the welfare of the animal it were as well they should jog on together as they had done trusting that after a time they might establish a sort of compromise endurable if not beneficial to both Such my dear friend in brief is the state of many of those foreign governments to whom we are so profuse of our wise counsels It were doubtless much better if they ruled well but let us see if the road to this knotty consummation be by the adoption of methods totally new to them estranged from all their instincts and habits and full of perils which their very fears will exaggerate Constitutional governments like underdone roast beef suit our natures and our latitude but they would seem lamentable experiments when tried south of the Alps Liberty with us means the right to break heads at a county election and to print impertinences in newspapers With the Spaniard or the Italian it would be to carry a poniard more openly and use it more frequently than at present At all events if it be any satisfaction to you you may be assured that the rulers in all these cases are not much better off than those they rule over They lead lives of incessant terror distrust and anxiety Their existence is poisoned by ceaseless fears of treachery they know not where They change ministers as travellers change the direction of their journey to disconcert the supposed plans of their enemies and they vacillate between cruelty and mercy really not knowing in which lies their safety Don t fancy that they have any innate pleasure in harsh measures The likelihood is they hate them as much as you do yourself but they know no other system and to come back to my cavalry illustration the only time they tried a snaffle they were run away with I trust these prosings will be a warning to you how you touch upon politics again in a letter to me but I really did not wish to be a bore and now here I am ready to answer as far as in me lies all your interrogatories first premising that I am not at liberty to enter upon the question of Glencore himself and for the simple reason that he has made me his confidant And now as to the boy I could make nothing of him Harcourt and for this reason he had not what sailors call steerage way on him He went wherever you bade but without an impulse I tried to make him care for his career for the gay world for the butterfly life of young diplomacy for certain dissipations excellent things occasionally to develop nascent faculties I endeavored to interest him by literary society and savans but unsuccessfully For art indeed he showed some disposition and modelled prettily but it never rose above amateurship Now enthusiasm although a very excellent ingredient will no more make an artist than a brisk kitchen fire will provide a dinner where all the materials are wanting I began to despair of him Harcourt when I saw that there were no features about him He could do everything reasonably well because there was no hope of his doing anything with real excellence He wandered away from me to Carrara with his quaint companion the Doctor and after some months wrote me rather a sturdy letter rejecting all moneyed advances past and future and saying something very haughty and of course very stupid about the glorious sense of independence I replied but he never answered me and here might have ended all my knowledge of his history had not a letter of which I send you an extract resumed the narrative The writer is the Princess Sabloukoff a lady of whose attractions and fascinations you have often heard me speak When you have read and thought over the enclosed let me have your opinion I do not I cannot believe in the rumor you allude to Glencore is not the man to marry at his time of life and in his circumstances Send me however all the particulars you are in possession of I hope they don t mean to send you to India because you seem to dislike it For my own part I suspect I should enjoy that country immensely Heat is the first element of daily comfort and all the appliances to moderate it are ex officio luxuries besides that in India there is a splendid and enlarged selfishness in the mode of life very different from the petty egotisms of our rude Northland If you do go pray take Naples in the way The route by Alexandria and Suez they all tell me is the best and most expeditious Mellish desires me to add his remembrances hoping you have not forgotten him He served in the Fifth with you in Canada that is if you be the same George Harcourt who played Tony Lumpkin so execrably at Montreal I have told him it is probable and am yours ever H U CHAPTER XXXV HARCOURT S LODGINGS When Harcourt had finished the reading of that letter we have presented in our last chapter he naturally turned for information on the subject which principally interested him to the enclosure It was a somewhat bulky packet and from its size at once promised very full and ample details As he opened it however he discovered it was in various handwritings but his surprise was further increased by the following heading in large letters in the top of a page Sulphur Question and beginning My Lord by a reference to my despatch No four hundred seventy eight you will perceive that the difficulties which the Neapolitan Government Harcourt turned over the page It was all in the same strain Tariffs treaties dues and duties occurred in every line Three other documents of like nature accompanied this after which came a very ill written scrawl on coarse paper entitled Hints as to diet and daily exercise for his Excellency s use The honest Colonel who was not the quickest of men was some time before he succeeded in unravelling to his satisfaction the mystery before him and recognizing that the papers on his table had been destined for a different address while the letter of the Princess had in all probability been despatched to the Foreign Office and was now either confounding or amusing the authorities in Downing Street While Harcourt laughed over the blunder he derived no small gratification from thinking that nothing but great geniuses ever fell into these mistakes and was about to write off in this very spirit to Upton when he suddenly bethought him that before an answer could arrive he himself would be far away on his journey to India I asked nothing said he that could be difficult to reply to It was plain enough too that I only wanted such information as he could have given me off hand If I could but assure Glencore that the boy was worthy of him that there was stuff to give good promise of future excellence that he was honorable and manly in all his dealings who knows what effect such assurance might have had There are days when it strikes me Glencore would give half his fortune to have the youth beside him and be able to call him his own Why he cannot does not do it is a mystery which I am unable to fathom He never gave me his confidence on this head indeed he gave me something like a rebuff one evening when he erroneously fancied that I wanted to probe the mysterious secret It shows how much he knows of my nature added he laughing Why I d rather carry a man s trunk or his portmanteau on my back than his family secrets in my heart I could rest and lay down my burden in the one case in the other there s never a moment of repose And now Glencore is to be here this very day the ninth to learn my news The poor fellow comes up from Wales just to talk over these matters and I have nothing to offer him but this blundering epistle Ay here s the letter Dear Harcourt Let me have a mutton chop with you on the ninth and give me if you can the evening after it Yours Glencore A man must be ill off for counsel and advice when he thinks of such aid as mine Heaven knows I never was such a brilliant manager of my own fortunes that any one should trust his destinies in my hands Well he shall have the mutton chop and a good glass of old port after it and the evening or if he likes it the night shall be at his disposal And with this resolve Harcourt having given orders for dinner at six issued forth to stroll down to his club and drop in at the Horse Guards and learn as much as he could of the passing events of the day meaning thereby the details of whatever regarded the army list and those who walk in scarlet attire It was about five o clock of a dreary November afternoon that a hackney coach drew op at Harcourt s lodgings in Dover Street and a tall and very sickly looking man carrying his carpet bag in one hand and a dressing case in the other descended and entered the house mister Massy sir said the Colonel s servant as he ushered him in for such was the name Glencore desired to be known by And the stranger nodded and throwing himself wearily down on a sofa seemed overcome with fatigue Is your master out asked he at length Yes sir but I expect him immediately Dinner was ordered for six and he ll be back to dress half an hour before that time Dinner for two half impatiently asked the other Yes sir for two And all visitors in the evening denied admittance Did your master say so Yes sir out for every one Glencore now covered his face with his hands and relapsed into silence At length he lifted his eyes till they fell upon a colored drawing over the chimney It was an officer in hussar uniform mounted on a splendid charger and seated with all the graceful ease of a consummate horseman This much alone he could perceive from where he lay and indolently raising himself on one arm he asked if it were a portrait of his master No sir of my master s colonel Lord Glencore when he commanded the Eighth and was said to be the handsomest man in the service Show it to me cried he eagerly and almost snatched the drawing from the other s hands He gazed at it intently and fixedly and his sallow cheek once reddened slightly as he continued to look That never was a likeness said he bitterly My master thinks it a wonderful resemblance sir not of what he is now of course but that was taken fifteen years ago or more And is he so changed since that asked the sick man plaintively So I hear sir He had a stroke of some kind or fit of one sort or another brought on by fretting They took away his title I m told They made out that he had no right to it that he wasn t the real lord But here s the Colonel sir and almost as he spoke Harcourt s step was on the stair The next moment his hand was cordially clasped in that of his guest I scarcely expected you before six and how have you borne the journey cried he taking a seat beside the sofa A gentle motion of the eyebrows gave the reply Well well you ll be all right after the soup Marcom serve the dinner at once I ll not dress And mind no admittance to any one You have heard from Upton asked Glencore Yes And satisfactorily asked he more anxiously Quite so but you shall know all by and by I have got mackerel for you It was a favorite dish of yours long ago and you shall taste such mutton as your Welsh mountains can t equal I got the haunch from the Ardennes a week ago and kept it for you I wish I deserved such generous fare but I have only an invalid s stomach said Glencore smiling faintly You shall be reported well and fit for duty to day or my name is not George Harcourt The strongest and toughest fellow that ever lived could n t stand up against the united effects of low diet and low spirits To act generously and think generously you must live generously take plenty of exercise breathe fresh air and know what it is to be downright weary when you go to bed not bored mark you for that s another thing Now here comes the soup and you shall tell me whether turtle be not the best restorative a man ever took after twelve hours of the road Whether tempted by the fare or anxious to gratify the hospitable wishes of his host Glencore ate heartily and drank what for his abstemious habit was freely and so far as a more genial air and a more ready smile went fully justified Harcourt s anticipations By Jove you re more like yourself than I have seen you this many a day said the Colonel as they drew their chairs towards the fire and sat with that now banished but ever to be regretted little spider table that once emblematized after dinner blessedness between them This reminds one of long ago Glencore and I don t see why we cannot bring to the hour some of the cheerfulness that we once boasted A faint very faint smile with more of sorrow than joy in it was the other s only reply Look at the thing this way Glencore said Harcourt eagerly So long as a man has either by his fortune or by his personal qualities the means of benefiting others there is a downright selfishness in shutting himself up in his sorrow and saying to the world My own griefs are enough for me I ll take no care or share in yours Now there never was a fellow with less of this selfishness than you Do not speak to me of what I was my dear friend There s not a plank of the old craft remaining The name alone lingers and even that will soon be extinct So then you still hold to this stern resolution Shall I tell you what I think of it Perhaps you had better not do so said Glencore sternly By Jove then I will just for that menace said Harcourt I said This is vengeance on Glencore s part To whom sir did you make this remark To myself of course I never alluded to the matter to any other never So far well said Glencore solemnly for had you done so we had never exchanged words again My dear fellow said Harcourt laying his hand affectionately on the other s I can well imagine the price a sensitive nature like yours must pay for the friendship of one so little gifted with tact as I am But remember always that there s this advantage in the intercourse you can afford to hear and bear things from a man of my stamp that would be outrages from perhaps the lips of a brother As Upton in one of his bland moments once said to me Fellows like you Harcourt are the bitters of the human pharmacopoeia somewhat hard to take but very wholesome when you re once swallowed You are the best of the triad and no great praise that either muttered Glencore to himself After a pause he continued It has not been from any distrust in your friendship Harcourt that I have not spoken to you before on this gloomy subject I know well that you bear me more affection than any one of all those who call themselves my friends but when a man is about to do that which never can meet approval from those who love him he seeks no counsel he invites no confidence Like the gambler who risks all on a single throw he makes his venture from the impulse of a secret mysterious prompting within that whispers With this you are rescued or ruined Advice counsel cried he in bitter mockery tell me when have such ever alleviated the tortures of a painful malady Have you ever heard that the writhings of the sick man were calmed by the honeyed words of his friends at the bedside I here his voice became full and loud I was burdened with a load too great for me to bear It had bowed me to the earth and all but crushed me The sense of an unaccomplished vengeance was like a debt which unrequited ere I died sent me to my grave dishonored Which of you all could tell me how to endure this What shape could your philosophy assume Then I guessed aright broke in Harcourt This was done in vengeance I have no reckoning to render you sir said Glencore haughtily for any confidence of mine you are more indebted to my passion than to my inclination I came up here to speak and confer with you about this boy whose guardianship you are unable to continue longer Let us speak of that Yes said Harcourt in his habitual tone of easy good humor they are going to send me out to India again I have had eighteen years of it already but I have no Parliamentary influence nor could I trace a fortieth cousinship with the House of Lords but after all it might be worse Now as to this lad what if I were to take him out with me This artist life that he seems to have adopted scarcely promises much Let me see Upton s letter said Glencore gravely There it is But I must warn you that the really important part is wanting for instead of sending us as he promised the communication of his Russian Princess he has stuffed in a mass of papers intended for Downing Street and a lot of doctor s prescriptions for whose loss he is doubtless suffering martyrdom Is this credible cried Glencore There they are very eloquent about sulphur and certain refugees with long names and with some curious hints about Spanish flies and the flesh brush Glencore flung down the papers in indignation and walked up and down the room without speaking I d wager a trifle cried Harcourt that Madame What s her name s letter has gone to the Foreign Office in lien of the despatches and if so they have certainly gained most by the whole transaction You have scarcely considered perhaps what publicity may thus be given to my private affairs said Glencore Who knows what this woman may have said what allusions her letter may contain Very true I never did think of that muttered Harcourt Who knows what circumstances of my private history are now bandied about from desk to desk by flippant fools to be disseminated afterwards over Europe by every courier cried he with increasing passion Before Harcourt could reply the servant entered and whispered a few words in his ear But you already denied me said Harcourt You told him that I was from home Yes sir but he said that his business was so important that he d wait for your return if I could not say where he might find you This is his card Harcourt took it and read Major Scaresby from Naples What think you Glencore Ought we to admit this gentleman It may be that this visit relates to what we have been speaking about Scaresby Scaresby I know the name muttered Glencore To be sure There was a fellow that hung about Florence and Rome long ago and called himself Scaresby an ill tongued old scandal monger people encouraged in a land where newspapers are not permitted He affects to have something very pressing to communicate Perhaps it were better to have him up Don t make me known to him then or let me have to talk to him said Glencore throwing himself down on a sofa and let his visit be as brief as you can manage Harcourt made a significant sign to his servant and the moment after the Major was heard ascending the stairs Very persistent of me you ll say Colonel Harcourt Devilish tenacious of my intentions to force myself thus upon you said the Major as he bustled into the room with a white leather bag in his hand but I promised Upton I d not lie down on a bed till I saw you All the apologies should come from my side Major said Harcourt as he handed him to a chair but the fact was that having an invalid friend with me quite incapable of seeing company and having matters of some importance to discuss with him Just so broke in Scaresby and if it were not that I had given a very strong pledge to Upton I d have given my message to your servant and gone off to my hotel But he laid great stress on my seeing you and obtaining certain papers which if I understand aright have reached you in mistake being meant for the Minister at Downing Street Here s his own note however which will explain all It ran thus Dear H So I find that some of the despatches have got into your enclosure instead of that on his Majesty s service I therefore send off the insupportable old bore who will deliver this to rescue them and convey them to their fitting destination The extraordinaries will be burdened to some fifty or sixty pounds for it but they very rarely are expended so profitably as in getting rid of an intolerable nuisance Give him all the things therefore and pack him off to Downing Street I m far more uneasy however about some prescriptions which I suspect are along with them One a lotion for the cervical vertebrae of invaluable activity which you may take a copy of but strictly on honor for your own use only Scaresby will obtain the Princess s letter and hand it to you It is certain not to have been opened at F O as they never read anything not alluded to in the private correspondence This blunder has done me a deal of harm My nerves are not in a state to stand such shocks and though in fact you are not the culpable party I cannot entirely acquit you for having in part occasioned it Harcourt laughed good humoredly at this and continued If you care for it old S will give you all the last gossip from these parts and be the channel of yours to me But don t dine him he s not worth a dinner He ll only repay sherry and soda water and one of those execrable cheroots you used to be famed for Amongst the recipes let me recommend you an admirable tonic the principal ingredient in which is the oil of the star fish It will probably produce nausea vertigo and even fainting for a week or two but these symptoms decline at last and except violent hiccup no other inconvenience remains Try it at all events Yours ever H U While Harcourt perused this short epistle Scaresby on the invitation of his host had helped himself freely to the Madeira and a plate of devilled biscuits beside it giving from time to time oblique glances towards the dark corner of the room where Glencore lay apparently asleep I hope Upton s letter justifies my insistence Colonel He certainly gave me to understand that the case was a pressing one said Scaresby Quite so Major Scaresby and I have only to reiterate my excuses for having denied myself to you But you are aware of the reason and he glanced towards where Glen Core was lying Very excellent fellow Upton said the Major sipping his wine but very what shall I call it eccentric very odd not like any one else you know in the way he does things I happened to be one of his guests t other day He had detained us above an hour waiting dinner when he came in all flurried and excited and turning to me said Scaresby have you any objection to a trip to England at his Majesty s expense and as I replied None whatever indeed it would suit my book to perfection just now Well then said he get your traps together and be here within an hour I ll have all in readiness for you I did not much fancy starting off in this fashion and without my dinner too but egad he s one of those fellows that don t stand parleying and so I just took him at his word and here I am I take it the matter must be a very emergent one eh It is clear Sir Horace Upton thought so said Harcourt rather amused than offended by the other s curiosity There s a woman in it somehow I ll be bound eh Harcourt laughed heartily at this sally and pushed the decanter towards his guest Not that I d give sixpence to know every syllable of the whole transaction said Scaresby A man that has passed as I have the last twenty five years of his life between Rome Florence and Naples has devilish little to learn of what the world calls scandal I suppose you must indeed possess a wide experience said Harcourt Not a man in Europe sir could tell you as many dark passages of good society I kept a kind of book once a record of fashionable delinquencies but I had to give it up It took me half my day to chronicle even the passing events and then my memory grew so retentive by practice I did n t want the reference but could give you date and name and place for every incident that has scandalized the world for the last quarter of the century And do you still possess this wonderful gift Major Pretty well not perhaps to the same extent I once did You see Colonel Harcourt here his voice became low and confidential some twenty or indeed fifteen years back it was only persons of actual condition that permitted themselves the liberty to do these things but hang it sir now you have your middle class folk as profligate as their betters Jones or Smith or Thompson runs away with his neighbor s wife cheats at cards and forges his friend s name just as if he had the best blood in his veins and fourteen quarterings on his escutcheon What memory then I ask you could retain all the shortcomings of these people But I d really not trouble my head with such ignoble delinquents said Harcourt Nor do I sir save when as will sometimes happen they have a footing with one leg at least in good society For in the present state of the world a woman with a pretty face and a man with a knowledge of horseflesh may move in any circle they please You re a severe censor of the age we live in I see said Harcourt smiling At the same time the offences could scarcely give you much uneasiness or you d not take up your residence where they most abound If you want to destroy tigers you must frequent the jungle said Scaresby with one of his heartiest laughs Say rather if you have the vulture s appetite you must go where there is carrion cried Glencore with a voice to which passion lent a savage vehemence Eh ha very good devilish smart of your sick friend Pray present me to him said Scaresby rising No no never mind him whispered Harcourt pressing him down into his seat At some other time perhaps He is nervous and irritable Conversation fatigues him too Egad that was neatly said though I hope I shall not forget it One envies these sick fellows sometimes the venom they get from bad health But I am forgetting myself in the pleasure of your society added he rising from the table as he finished off the last glass in the decanter I shall call at Downing Street to morrow for that letter of Upton s and with your permission will deposit it in your hands afterwards Harcourt accompanied him to the door with thanks Profuse indeed was he in his recognitions desiring to get him clear off the ground before any further allusions on his part or rejoinders from Glencore might involve them all in new complications I know that fellow well cried Glencore almost ere the door closed on him He is just what I remember him some twenty years ago Dressed up in the cast off vices of his betters he has passed for a man of fashion amongst his own set while he is regarded as a wit by those who mistake malevolence for humor I ask no other test of a society than that such a man is endured in it I sometimes suspect said Harcourt that the world never believes these fellows to be as ill natured as then tongues bespeak them You are wrong George the world knows them well The estimation they are held in is for the reflective flattery by which each listener to their sarcasms soothes his own conscience as he says I could be just as bitter if I consented to be as bad I cannot at all account for Upton s endurance of such a man said Harcourt As there are men who fancy that they strengthen their animal system by braving every extreme of climate so Upton imagines that he invigorates his morale by associating with all kinds and descriptions of people and there is no doubt that in doing so he extends the sphere of his knowledge of mankind After all muttered he with a sigh it s only learning the geography of a land too unhealthy to live in Glencore arose as he said this and with a nod of leave taking retired to his room CHAPTER XXXVI A FEVERED MIND Harcourt passed the morning of the following day in watching the street for Scaresby s arrival Glencore s impatience had grown into absolute fever to obtain the missing letter and he kept asking every moment at what hour he had promised to be there and wondering at his delay Noon passed over one o clock it was now nearly half past as a carriage drove hastily to the door At last cried Glencore with a deep sigh Sir Gilbert Bruce sir requests to know if you can receive him said the servant to Harcourt Another disappointment muttered Glencore as he left the room when Harcourt motioned to the servant to introduce the visitor My dear Colonel Harcourt cried the other entering excuse a very abrupt call but I have a most pressing need of your assistance I hear you can inform me of Lord Glencore s address He is residing in North Wales at present I can give you his post town Yes but can I be certain that he will admit me if I should go down there He is living I hear in strict retirement and I am anxious for a personal interview I cannot insure you that said Harcourt He does live as you have heard entirely estranged from all society But if you write to him Ah there s the difficulty A letter and its reply takes some days And is the matter then so very imminent It is so at least it is thought to be so by an authority that neither you nor I will be likely to dispute You know his Lordship intimately I fancy Perhaps I may call myself as much his friend as any man living Well then I may confide to you my business with him It happened that a few days back Lord Adderley was on a visit with the King at Brighton when a foreign messenger arrived with despatches They were of course forwarded to him there and as the King has a passion for that species of literature he opened them all himself Now I suspect that his Majesty cares more for the amusing incidents which occasionally diversify the life of foreign courts than for the great events of politics At all events he devours them with avidity and seems conversant with the characters and private affairs of some hundreds of people he has never seen nor in all likelihood will ever see In turning over the loose pages of one of the despatches from Naples I think he came upon what appeared to be a fragment of a letter Of what it was or what it contained I have not the slightest knowledge Adderley himself has not seen it nor any one but the King All I know is that it concerns in some way Lord Glencore for immediately on reading it he gave me instructions to find him out and send him down to Brighton I am afraid were you to see Glencore your mission would prove a failure He has given up the world altogether and even a royal command would scarcely withdraw him from his retirement At all events I must make the trial You can let me have his address and perhaps you would do more and give me some sort of introduction to him something that might smooth down the difficulty of a first visit Harcourt was silent and stood for some seconds in deep thought which the other mistaking for a sign of unwillingness to comply with his request quickly added If my demand occasion you any inconvenience or if there be the slightest difficulty Nay nay I was not thinking of that said Harcourt Pray excuse me for a moment I will fetch you the address you spoke of and without waiting for more he left the room The next minute he was in Glencore s room hurriedly narrating to him all that had passed and asking him what course he should pursue Glencore heard the story with a greater calm than Harcourt dared to hope for and seemed pleased at the reiterated assurance that the King alone had seen the letter referred to and when Harcourt abruptly asked what was to be done he slowly replied I must obey his Majesty s commands I must go to Brighton But are you equal to all this Have you strength for it I think so at all events I am determined to make the effort I was a favorite with his Majesty long ago He will say nothing to hurt me needlessly nor is it in his nature to do so Tell Bruce that you will arrange everything and that I shall present myself to morrow at the palace Remember Glencore that if you say so I must be sure and keep my word Well so I mean George I was a courtier once upon a time and have not outlived my deference to a sovereign I ll be there you may answer for me From the moment that Glencore had come to this resolve a complete change seemed to pass over the nature of the man It was as though a new spring had been given to his existence The reformation that all the blandishments of friendship all the soft influences of kindness could never accomplish was more than half effected by the mere thought of an interview with a king and the possible chance of a little royal sympathy If Harcourt was astonished he was not the less pleased at all this He encouraged Glencore s sense of gratification by every means in his power and gladly lent himself to all the petty anxieties about dress and appearance in which he seemed now immersed Nothing could exceed indeed the care he bestowed on these small details ever insisting as he did that his Majesty being the best dressed gentleman in Europe these matters assumed a greater importance in his eyes I must try to recover somewhat of my former self said he There was a time when I came and went freely to Carlton House when I was somewhat more than a mere frequenter of the Prince s society They tell me that of late he is glad to see any of those who partook of his intimacy of those times who can remember the genial spirits who made his table the most brilliant circle of the world who can talk to him of Hanger and Kelly and Sheridan and the rest of them I spent my days and nights with them Warming with the recollection of a period which dissolute and dissipated as it was yet redeemed by its brilliancy many of its least valuable features Glencore poured forth story after story of a time when statesmen had the sportive ness of schoolboys and the greatest intellects loved to indulge in the wildest excesses of folly A good jest upon Eldon a smart epigram on Sidmouth a quiz against Vansittart was a fortune at Court and there grew up thus around the Prince a class who cultivated ridicule so assiduously that nothing was too high or too venerable to escape their sarcasms Though Glencore was only emerging out of boyhood a young subaltern in the Prince s own regiment when he first entered this society the impression it had made upon his mind was not the less permanent Independently of the charm of being thus admitted to the most choice circle of the land there was the fascination of intimacy with names that even amongst contemporaries were illustrious I feel in such spirits to day George cried Glencore at length that I vote we go and pass the day at Richmond We shall escape the possibility of being bored by your acquaintance We shall have a glorious stroll through the fields and a pleasant dinner afterwards at the Star and Garter Only too well pleased at this sudden change in his friend s humor Harcourt assented The day was a bright and clear one with a sharp frosty air and that elasticity of atmosphere that invigorates and stimulates They both soon felt its influence and as the hours wore on pleasant memories of the past were related and old friends remembered and talked over in a spirit that brought back to each much of the youthful sentiments they recorded If one could only go over it all again George said Glencore as they sat after dinner up to three and twenty or even a year or two later I d not ask to change a day scarcely an hour Whatever was deficient in fact was supplied by hope It was a joyous brilliant time when we all made partnership of our good spirits and traded freely on the capital Even Upton was frank and free hearted then There were some six or eight of us with just fortune enough never to care about money and none of us so rich as to be immersed in dreams of gold as ever happens with your millionnaire Why could we not have continued so to the end Harcourt adroitly turned him from the theme which he saw impending his departure for the Continent his residence there and his marriage and once more occupied him in stories of his youthful life in London when Glencore suddenly came to a stop and said I might have married the greatest beauty of the time of a family too second to none in all England You know to whom I allude Well she would have accepted me her father was not averse to the match a stupid altercation with her brother Lord Hervey at Brookes s one night an absurd dispute about some etiquette of the play table estranged me from their house I was offended at what I deemed their want of courtesy in not seeking me for I was in the right every one said so I determined not to call first They gave a great entertainment and omitted me and rather than stay in town to publish this affront I started for the Continent and out of that petty incident a discussion of the veriest trifle imaginable there came the whole course of my destiny To be sure said Harcourt with assumed calm every man s fortune in life is at the sport of some petty incident or other which at the time he undervalues And then we scoff at those men who scrutinize each move and hesitate over every step in life as triflers and little minded while if your remark be just it is exactly they who are the wise and prudent cried Glencore with warmth Had I for instance seen this occurrence trivial as it was in its true light what and where might I not have been to day My dear Glencore the luckiest fellow that ever lived were he only to cast a look back on opportunities neglected and conjunctures unprofited by would be sure to be miserable I am far from saying that some have not more than their share of the world s sorrows but take my word for it every one has his load be it greater or less and what is worse we all of us carry our burdens with as much inconvenience to ourselves as we can I know what you would say Harcourt It is the old story about giving way to passion and suffering temper to get the better of one but let me tell you that there are trials where passion is an instinct and reason works too slowly I have experienced such as this Give yourself but fair play Glencore and you will surmount all your troubles Come back into the world again I don t mean this world of balls and dinner parties of morning calls and afternoons in the Park but a really active stirring life Come with me to India and let us have a raid amongst the jaguars mix with the pleasant light hearted fellows you ll meet at every mess who ask for nothing better than their own good spirits and good health to content them with the world just look out upon life and see what numbers are struggling and swimming for existence while you at least have competence and wealth for all you wish and bear in mind that round the table where wit is flashing and the merriest laughter rings there is not a man no not one who hasn t a something heavy in his heart but yet who d feel himself a coward if his face confessed it And why am I to put this mask upon me For what and for whom have I to wear this disguise cried Glencore angrily For yourself It is in bearing up manfully before the world you ll gain the courage to sustain your own heart Ay Glencore you ll do it to morrow In the presence of royalty you ll comport yourself with dignity and reserve and you ll come out from the interview higher and stronger in self esteem You talk as if I were some country squire who would stand abashed and awe struck before his King but remember my worthy Colonel I have lived a good deal inside the tabernacle and its mysteries are no secrets to me Reason the more for what I say broke in Harcourt your deference will not obliterate your judgment your just respect will not alloy your reason I ll talk to the King sir as I talk to you said Glencore passionately nor is the visit of my seeking I have long since done with courts and those who frequent them What can royalty do for me Upton and yourself may play the courtier and fawn at levees you have your petitions to present your favors to beg for you want to get this or be excused from that but I am no supplicant I ask for no place no ribbon If the King speak to me about my private affairs he shall be answered as I would answer any one who obtrudes his rank into the place that should only be occupied by friendship It may be that he has some good counsel to offer Counsel to offer me burst in Glencore with increased warmth I would no more permit any man to give me advice unasked than I would suffer him to go to my tradespeople and pay my debts for me A man s private sorrows are his debts obligations between himself and his own heart Don t tell me sir that even a king s prerogative absolves him from the duties of a gentleman While he uttered these words he continued to fill and empty his wine glass several times as if passion had stimulated his thirst and now his flashing eyes and his heightened color betrayed the effect of wine Let us stroll out into the cool air said Harcourt See what a gorgeous night of stars it is That you may resume your discourse on patience and resignation said Glencore scoffingly No sir If I must listen to you let me have at least the aid of the decanter Your bitter maxims are a bad substitute for olives but I must have wine to swallow them I never meant them to be so distasteful to you said Harcourt good humoredly Say rather you troubled your head little whether they were or not replied Glencore whose voice was now thick from passion and drink together You and Upton and two or three others presume to lecture me who because gifted if you call it gifted I d say cursed ay sir cursed with coarser natures temperaments where higher sentiments have no place fellows that can make what they feel subordinate to what they want you appreciate that I hope that stings you does it Well sir you ll find me as ready to act as to speak There s not a word I utter here I mean to retract to morrow My dear Glencore we have both taken too much wine Speak for yourself sir If you desire to make the claret the excuse for your language I can only say it s like everything else in your conduct always a subterfuge always a scapegoat Oh George George I never suspected this in you and burying his head between his hands he burst into tears He never spoke a word as Harcourt assisted him to the carriage nor did he open his lips on the road homewards CHAPTER XXXVII THE VILLA AT SORRENTO In one of the most sequestered nooks of Sorrento almost escarped out of the rocky cliff and half hid in the foliage of orange and oleander trees stood the little villa of the Princess Sabloukoff The blue sea washed the white marble terrace before the windows and the arbutus whose odor scented the drawing room dipped its red berries in the glassy water The wildest and richest vegetation abounded on every side Plants and shrubs of tropical climes mingled with the hardier races of Northern lands and the cedar and the plantain blended their leaves with the sycamore and the ilex while as if to complete the admixture birds and beasts of remote countries were gathered together and the bustard the ape and the antelope mixed with the peacock the chamois and the golden pheasant The whole represented one of those capricious exhibitions by which wealth so often associates itself with the beautiful and despite all errors in taste succeeds in making a spot eminently lovely So was it There was often light where a painter would have wished shadow There were gorgeous flowers where a poet would have desired nothing beyond the blue heather bell There were startling effects of view managed where chance glimpses through the trees had been infinitely more picturesque There was in fact the obtrusive sense of riches in a thousand ways and places where mere unadorned nature had been far preferable and yet with all these faults sea and sky rock and foliage the scented air the silence only broken by the tuneful birds the rich profusion of color upon a sward strewn with flowers made of the spot a perfect paradise In a richly decorated room whose three windows opened on a marble terrace sat the Princess It was December but the sky was cloudless the sea a perfect mirror and the light air that stirred the leaves soft and balmy as the breath of May Her dress was in keeping with the splendor around her a rich robe of yellow silk fastened up the front with large carbuncle buttons sleeves of deep Valenciennes lace fell far over her jewelled fingers and a scarf of golden embroidery negligently thrown over an arm of her chair gave what a painter would call the warm color to a very striking picture Farther from the window and carefully protected from the air by a screen sat a gentleman whose fur lined pelisse and velvet skull cap showed that he placed more faith in the almanac than in the atmosphere From his cork soled boots to his shawl muffled about the throat all proclaimed that distrust of the weather that characterizes the invalid No treachery of a hot sun no seductions of that inveterate cheat a fine day in winter could inveigle Sir Horace Upton into any forgetfulness of his precautions He would have regarded such as a palpable weakness on his part a piece of folly perfectly unbecoming in a man of his diplomatic standing and ability He was writing and smoking and talking by turns the table before him being littered with papers and even the carpet at his feet strewn with the loose sheets of his composition There was not in his air any of the concentration or even seriousness of a man engaged in an important labor and yet the work before him employed all his faculties and he gave to it the deepest attention of abilities of which very few possessed the equal To great powers of reasoning and a very strong judgment he united a most acute knowledge of men not exactly of mankind in the mass but of that especial order with whom he had habitually to deal Stolid commonplace stupidity might puzzle or embarrass him while for any amount of craft for any degree of subtlety he was an over match The plain matter of fact intelligence occasionally gained a slight advantage over him at first the trained and polished mind of the most astute negotiator was a book he could read at sight It was his especial tact to catch up all this knowledge at once very often in a first interview and thus while others were interchanging the customary platitudes of every day courtesy he was gleaning and recording within himself the traits and characteristics of all around him A clever fellow very clever fellow Cineselli said he as he continued to write His proposition is certain commercial advantages and that we on our side leave him alone to deal his own way with his own rabble I see nothing against it so long as they continue to be rabble but grubs grow into butterflies and very vulgar populace have now and then emerged into what are called liberal politicians Only where you have the blessing of a free press said the Princess in a tone of insolent mockery Quite true Princess a free press is a tonic that with an increased dose becomes a stimulant and occasionally over excites It makes your people drunk now and then said she angrily They always sleep it off over night said he softly They very rarely pay even the penalty of the morning headache for the excess which is exactly why it will not answer in warmer latitudes Ours is a cold one and I m sure it would not suit us I m not so certain of that said he languidly I think it is eminently calculated for a people who don t know how to read She would have smiled at the remark if the sarcasm had not offended her Your Lordship will therefore see muttered he reading to himself as he wrote that in yielding this point we are while apparently making a concession in reality obtaining a very considerable advantage Rather an English habit I suspect said she smiling Picked up in the course of our Baltic trade Princess In sending us your skins you smuggled in some of your sentiments and Russian tallow has enlightened the nation in more ways than one You need it all my dear chevalier said she with a saucy smile Harzewitch told me that your diplomatic people were inferior to those of the third rate German States that in fact they never had any information I know what he calls information Princess and his remark is just Our Government is shockingly mean and never would keep up a good system of spies Spies If you mean by an odious word to inculpate the honor of a high calling Pray forgive my interruption but I am speaking in all good faith When I said spy it was in the bankrupt misery of a man who had nothing else to offer I wanted to imply that pure but small stream which conveys intelligence from a fountain to a river it was not meant to feed Was n t that a carriage I heard in the cour Oh pray don t open the window there s an odious libeccio blowing to day and there s nothing so injurious to the nervous system A cabinet messenger your Excellency said a servant entering What a bore I hoped I was safe from a despatch for at least a month to come I really believe they have no veneration for old institutions in England They don t even celebrate Christmas I m charmed at the prospect of a bag cried the Princess May I have the messenger shown in here Princess Certainly by all means Happy to see your Excellency hope your Ladyship is in good health said a smart looking young fellow who wore a much frogged pelisse and sported a very well trimmed moustache Ah Stevins how d ye do said Upton You ve had a cold journey over the Cenis Came by the Splugen your Excellency I went round by Vienna and Maurice Esterhazy took me as far as Milan The Princess stared with some astonishment That the messenger should thus familiarly style one of that great family was indeed matter of wonderment to her nor was it lessened as Upton whispered her Ask him to dine And London how is it Very empty Stevins continued he A desert was the answer Where s Lord Adderley At Brighton The King can t do without him greatly to Adderley s disgust for he is dying to have a week s shooting in the Highlands And Cantworth where is he He s off for Vienna and a short trip to Hungary I met him at dinner at the mess while waiting for the Dover packet By the way I saw a friend of your Excellency s Harcourt Not gone to India No They ve made him a governor or commander in chief of something in the Mediterranean I forget exactly where or what You have brought me a mighty bag Stevins said Upton sighing I had hoped for a little ease and rest now that the House is up They are all blue books I believe replied Stevins There s that blacking your Excellency wrote about and the cricket bats the lathe must come out by the frigate and the down mattress at the same time Just do me the favor to open the bag my dear Stevins I am utterly without aid here said Upton sighing drearily and the other proceeded to litter the table and the floor with a variety of strange and incongruous parcels Report of factory commissioners cried he throwing down a weighty quarto Yarmouth bloaters Atkinson s cerulean paste for the eyebrows Worcester sauce trade returns for Tahiti a set of shoemaking tools eight bottles of Darby s pyloric corrector buffalo flesh brushes devilish hard they seem Hume s speech on the reduction of foreign legations novels from Bull s top boots for a tiger and a mass of letters said Stevins throwing them broadcast over the sofa No despatches cried Upton eagerly Not one by Jove said Stevins Open one of those Darby s I ll take a teaspoonful at once Will you try it Stevins Thanks your Excellency I never take physic Well you dine here then said he with a sly look at the Princess Not to day your Excellency I dine with Grammont at eight Then I ll not detain you Come back here to morrow about eleven or a little later Come to breakfast if you like At what hour I don t know at any hour sighed Upton as he opened one of his letters and began to read and Stevins bowed and withdrew totally unnoticed and unrecognized as he slipped from the room One after another Upton threw down after reading half a dozen lines muttering some indistinct syllables over the dreary stupidity of letter writers in general Occasionally he came upon some pressing appeal for money some urgent request for even a small remittance by the next post and these he only smiled at while he refolded them with a studious care and neatness Why will you not help me with this chaos dear Princess said he at last I am only waiting to be asked said she but I feared that there might be secrets From you said he with a voice of deep tenderness while his eyes sparkled with an expression far more like raillery than affection The Princess however had either not seen or not heeded it for she was already deep in the correspondence This is strictly private Am I to read it said she Of course said he bowing courteously And she read Dear Upton Let us have a respite from tariffs and trade talk for a month or two and tell me rather what the world is doing around you We have never got the right end of that story about the Princess Celestine as yet Who was he Not Labinsky I ll be sworn The K insists it was Roseville and I hope you may be able to assure me that he is mistaken He is worse tempered than ever That Glencore business has exasperated him greatly Could n t your Princess the world calls her yours How good of the world and how delicate of your friend said she smiling superciliously Let us see who the writer is Oh a great man the Lord Adderley and went on with her reading couldn t your Princess find out something of real consequence to us about the Q What queen does he mean cried she stopping The Queen of Sheba perhaps said Upton biting his lips with anger while he made an attempt to take the letter from her Pardon this is interesting said she and went on We shall want it soon that is if the manufacturing districts will not kindly afford us a diversion by some open air demonstrations and a collision with the troops We have offered them a most taking bait by announcing wrongfully the departure of six regiments for India thus leaving the large towns in the North apparently ungarrisoned They are such poltroons that the chances are they ll not bite You were right about Emerson We have made his brother a Bishop and he voted with us on the Arms Bill Cole is a sterling patriot and an old Whig He says nothing shall seduce him from his party save a Lordship of the Admiralty Corruption everywhere my dear Upton except on the Treasury benches Holecroft insists on being sent to Petersburg and having ascertained that the Emperor will not accept him I have induced the K to nominate him to the post Non culpa nostra et cetera He can scarcely vote against us after such an evidence of our good will Find out what will give most umbrage to your Court and I will tell you why in my next Don t bother yourself about the Greeks The time is not come yet nor will it till it suit our policy to loosen the ties with Russia As to France there is not nor will there be in our time at least any Government there We must deal with them as with a public meeting which may reverse to morrow the resolutions they have adopted to day The French will never be formidable till they are unanimous They ll never be unanimous till we declare war with them Remember I don t want anything serious with Cineselli Irritate and worry as much as you can Send even for a ship or two from Malta but go no farther I want this for our radicals at home Our own friends are in the secret Write me a short despatch about our good relations with the Two Sicilies and send me some news in a private letter Let me have some ortolans in the bag and believe me yours Adderley There said she turning over a number of letters with a mere glance at their contents these are all trash shooting and fox hunting news which one reads in the newspapers better or at least more briefly narrated with all that death and marriage intelligence which you English are so fond of parading before the world But what is this literary gem here Where did the paper come from And that wonderful seal and still more wonderful address To his Worshipful Excellency the Truly Worthy and Right Honorable Sir Horace Upton Plenipotentiary Negotiator and Extraordinary Diplomatist living at Naples What can it mean said he languidly You shall hear said she breaking the massive seal of green wax which to the size of a crown piece ornamented one side of the epistle It is dated Schwats Tyrol and begins Venerated and Reverend Excellency when these unsymmetrically designed and not more ingeniously conceived syllables Let us see his name said she stop ping suddenly and turning to the last page read W T vulgo Billy Traynor a name cognate to your Worshipful Eminence in times past To be sure I remember him perfectly a strange creature that came out here with that boy you heard me speak of Pray read on I stopped at syllables Yes when these curiously conceived syllables then come under the visionary apertures of your acute understanding they will disclose to your much reflecting and nice discriminating mind as cruel and murderous a deed as ever a miscreant imagination suggested to a diabolically constructed and nefariously fashioned organization showing that Nature in her bland adaptiveness never imposes a mistaken fruit on a genuine arborescence Do you understand him asked she Partly perhaps continued he Let us have the subject Not to weary your exalted and never enough to be esteemed intelligence I will proceed without further ambiguous or circumgyratory evolutions to the main body of my allegation It happened in this way Charley your venerated worship knows who I mean Charley ever deep in marmorial pursuits and far progressed in sculptorial excellence with a genius that Phidias if he did not envy would esteem Really I cannot go on with these interminable parentheses said she you must decipher them yourself Upton took the letter and read it at first hastily and then recommencing with more of care and attention occasionally stopping to reflect and consider the details This is likely to be a troublesome business said he This boy has got himself into a serious scrape Love and a duel are bad enough but an Austrian state prison and a sentence of twenty years in irons are even worse So far as I can make out from my not over lucid correspondent he had conceived a violent affection for a young lady at Massa to whose favor a young Austrian of high rank at the same time pretended Wahnsdorf I m certain broke in the Princess and the girl that Mademoiselle Harley interposed Sir Horace Just so Harley Pray go on said she eagerly A very serious altercation and a duel were the consequences of this rivalry and Wahnsdorf has been dangerously wounded his life is still in peril The Harleys have been sent out of the country and my unlucky protege handed over to the Austrians has been tried condemned and sentenced to twenty years in Kuffstein a Tyrol fortress where great severity is practised from the neighborhood of which this letter is written entreating my speedy interference and protection What can you do It is not even within your jurisdiction said she carelessly True nor was the capture by the Austrians within theirs Princess It is a case where assuredly everybody was in the wrong and therefore admirably adapted for nice negotiation Who and what is the youth I have called him a protege Has he no more tender claim to the affectionate solicitude of Sir Horace Upton said she with an easy air of sarcasm None on my honor said he eagerly none at least of the kind you infer His is a very sad story which I ll tell you about at another time For the present I may say that he is English and as such must be protected by the English authorities The Government of Massa have clearly committed a great fault in handing him over to the Austrians Stubber must be brought to book for this in the first instance By this we shall obtain a perfect insight into the whole affair The Imperial family will never forgive an insult offered to one of their own blood said the Princess haughtily We shall not ask them to forgive anything my dear Princess We shall only prevent their natural feelings betraying them into an act of injustice The boy s offence whatever it was occurred outside the frontier as I apprehend How delighted you English are when you can convert an individual case into an international question You would at any moment sacrifice an ancient alliance to the trumpery claim of an aggrieved tourist said she rising angrily and swept out of the room ere Sir Horace could arise to open the door for her Upton walked slowly to the chimney and rang the bell I shall want the caleche and post horses at eight o clock Antoine Put up some things for me and get all my furs ready And with this he measured forty drops from a small phial he carried in his waistcoat pocket and sat down to pare his nails with a very diminutive penknife CHAPTER XXXVIII A DIPLOMATIST S DINNER Were we writing a drama instead of a true history we might like to linger for a few moments on the leave taking between the Princess and Sir Horace Upton They were indeed both consummate artists and they played their parts to perfection not as we see high comedy performed on the stage by those who grotesque its refinements and exaggerate its dignity lashing to storm the calm and placid lake all whose convulsive throes are many a fathom deep and whose wildest workings never bring a ripple to the surface No theirs was the true version of well bred performance A little well affected grief at separation brief as it was meant to be a little half expressed surprise on the lady s part at the suddenness of the departure a little just as vaguely conveyed complaint on the other side over the severe requirements of duty and a very little tenderness for there was no one to witness it at the thought of parting and with a kiss upon her hand whose respectful courtesy no knight errant of old could have surpassed Sir Horace backed from the presence sighed and slipped away Had our reader been a spectator instead of a peruser of the events we have lately detailed he might have fancied from certain small asperities of manner certain quicknesses of reproof and readiness at rejoinder that here were two people only waiting for a reasonable and decent pretext to go on their separate roads in life Yet nothing of this kind was the case the bond between them was not affection it was simply convenience Their partnership gave them a strength and a social solvency which would have been sorely damaged had either retired from the firm and they knew it What would the Princess s dinners have been without the polished ease of him who felt himself half the host What would all Sir Horace Upton s subtlety avail him if it were not that he had sources of information which always laid open the game of his adversaries Singly each would have had a tough struggle with the world together they were more than a match for it The highest order of diplomatist in the estimation of Upton was the man who at once knew what was possible to be done It was his own peculiar quality to possess this gift but great as his natural acuteness was it would not have availed him without those secret springs of intelligence we have alluded to There is no saying to what limit he might not have carried this faculty had it not been that one deteriorating and detracting feature marred and disfigured the fairest form of his mind He could not do all that he would disabuse himself of a very low estimate of men and their motives He did not slide into this philosophy as certain indolent people do just to save them the trouble of discriminating he did not acquire it by the hard teachings of adversity No it came upon him slowly and gradually the fruit as he believed of calm judgment and much reflection upon life As little did he accept it willingly he even labored against the conviction but strive as he might there it was and there it would remain His fixed impression was that in every circumstance and event in life there was always a dessous des cartes a deeper game concealed beneath the surface and that it was a mere question of skill and address how much of this penetrated through men s actions If this theory unravelled many a tangled web of knavery to him it also served to embarrass and confuse him in situations where inferior minds had never recognized a difficulty How much ingenuity did he expend to detect what had no existence How wearily did he try for soundings where there was no bottom Through the means of the Princess he had learned what some very wise heads do not yet like to acknowledge that the feeling of the despotic governments towards England was very different from what it had been at the close of the great war with Napoleon They had grown more dominant and exacting just as we were becoming every hour more democratic To maintain our old relations with them therefore on the old footing would be only to involve ourselves in continual difficulty with a certainty of final failure and the only policy that remained was to encourage the growth of liberal opinions on the Continent out of which new alliances might be formed to recompense us for the loss of the old ones There is a story told of a certain benevolent prince whose resources were unhappily not commensurate with his good intentions and whose ragged retinue wearied him with entreaties for assistance Be of good cheer said he one day I have ordered a field of flax to be sown and you shall all of you have new shirts Such were pretty much the position and policy of England Out of our crop of Constitutionalism we speculated on a rich harvest to be afterwards manufactured for our use and benefit We leave it to deeper heads to say if the result has been all that we calculated on and asking pardon for such digression we join Sir Horace once more When Sir Horace Upton ordered post horses to his carriage he no more knew where he was going nor where he would halt than he could have anticipated what course any conversation might take when once started He had to be sure a certain ideal goal to be reached but he was one of those men who liked to think that the casual interruptions one meets with in life are less obstruction than opportunity so that instead of deeming these subjects for regret or impatience he often accepted them as indications that there was some profit to be derived from them a kind of fatalism more common than is generally believed When he set out for Sorrento it was with the intention of going direct to Massa not that this state lay within the limits his functions ascribed to him that being probably the very fact which imparted a zest to the journey Any other man would have addressed himself to his colleague in Tuscany or wherever he might be while he being Sir Horace Upton took the whole business upon himself in his own way Young Massy s case opened to his eyes a great question viz what was the position the Austrians assumed to take in Italy For any care about the youth or any sympathy with his sufferings he distressed himself little not that he was in any respect heartless or unfeeling it was simply that greater interests were before him Here was one of those grand issues that he felt worthy of his abilities it was a cause where he was proud to hold a brief Resolving all his plans of action methodically yet rapidly arranging every detail in his own mind even to the use of certain expressions he was to employ he arrived at the palace of the Embassy where he desired to halt to take up his letters and make a few preparations before his departure His Maestro di Casa Signor Franchetti was in waiting for his arrival and respectfully assured him that all was in readiness and that his Excellency would be perfectly satisfied We had it is true continued he a difficulty about the fish but I sent off an express to Baia and we have secured a sturgeon What are you raving about caro Pipo said the Minister what is all this long story of Baia and the fish Has your Excellency forgotten that we have a grand dinner to day at eight o clock that the Prince Maximilian of Bavaria and all the foreign ambassadors are invited Is this Saturday Pipo said Sir Horace blandly Yes your Excellency Send mister Brockett to me said Sir Horace as he slowly mounted the stairs to his own apartment Sir Horace was stretched on a sofa in all the easy luxury of magnificent dressing gown and slippers when mister Brockett entered and without any preliminary of greeting he said with a quiet laugh You have let me forget all about the dinner to day Brockett I thought you knew it you took great trouble about the persons to be asked and you canvassed whether the Duc de Borodino being only a Charge d Affaires There there don t you see the the inappropriateness of what you are doing Even in England a man is not asked to criminate himself How many are coming Nineteen the Nonce is ill and has sent an apology Then the party can be eighteen Brockett you must tell them that I am ill too ill to come to dinner I know the Prince Max very well he ll not take it badly and as to Cineselli we shall see what humor he is in But they ll know that you arrived here this afternoon they ll naturally suppose They ll naturally suppose if people ever do anything so intensely stupid as naturally to suppose anything that I am the best judge of my own health and so mister Brockett you may as well con over the terms by which you may best acquaint the company with the reasons for my absence and if the Prince proposes a visit to me in the evening let him come he ll find me here in my own room Would you do me the kindness to let Antinori fetch his cupping glasses and tell Franchetti also that I ll take my chicken grilled not roasted I ll look over the treaty in the evening One mushroom only one he may give me and the Carlsbad water at twenty eight degrees I m very troublesome Brockett but I m sure you ll excuse it Thanks thanks and he pressed the Secretary s hand and gave him a smile whose blandishment had often done good service and would do so again To almost any other man in the world this interruption to his journey this sudden tidings of a formally arranged dinner which he could not or would not attend would have proved a source of chagrin and dissatisfaction Not so with Upton he liked a contrariety Whatever stirred the still waters of life even though it should be a head wind was far more grateful than a calm He laughed to himself at the various comments his company were sure to pass over his conduct he pictured to his mind the anger of some and the astonishment of others and revelled in the thought of the courtier like indignation such treatment of a Royal Highness was certain to elicit But who can answer for his health said he with an easy laugh to himself Who can promise what he may be ten days hence The appearance of his dinner if one may dignify by such a name the half of a chicken flanked by a roasted apple and a biscuit cut short his lucubrations and Sir Horace ate and sipped his Carlsbad with as much enjoyment as many another man has felt over venison and Chambertin Are they arrived Pipo said he as his servant removed the dessert of two figs and a lime Yes your Excellency they are at table How many are there Seventeen sir and mister Brockett Did the Prince seem to to feel my absence Pipo I thought he appeared very sorry for your Excellency when mister Brockett spoke to him and he whispered something to the aide de camp beside him And the others how did they take it Count Tarrocco said he d retire sir that he could not dine where the host was too ill to receive him but the Duc de Campo Stretto said it was impossible they could leave the room while a Royal Highness continued to remain in it and they all agreed with him Ha ha ha laughed Upton in a low tone I hope the dinner is a good one It is exquisite sir the Prince ate some of the caviare soup and was asking a second time for the pain des ortolans when I left the room And the wine Pipo have you given them that rare La Rose Yes your Excellency and the Klausthaller cabinet his Royal Highness asked for it Go back then now I want for nothing more only drop in here by and by and tell me how all goes on Just light that pastil before you go there that will do And once more his Excellency was left to himself In that vast palace the once home of a royal prince no sounds of the distant revelry could reach the remote quarter where he sat and all was silent and still around him and Upton was free to ruminate and reflect at ease There was a sense of haughty triumph in thinking that beneath his roof at that very moment were assembled the great representatives of almost every important state of Europe to whom he had not deigned to accord the honor of his presence but though this thought did flit across his mind far more was he intent on reflecting what might be the consequences good or evil of the incident And then said he aloud how will Printing House Square treat us What a fulminating leader shall we not have denouncing either our insolence or our incompetence ending with the words If then Sir Horace Upton be not incapacitated from illness for the discharge of his high functions it is full time for his Government to withdraw him from a sphere where his caprice and impertinence have rendered him something worse than useless and then will come a flood of petty corroborations the tourist tribe who heard of us at Berlin or called upon as at the Hague and whose unreturned cards and uninvited wives are counts in the long indictment against us What a sure road to private friendships is diplomacy How certain is one of conciliating the world s good opinion by belonging to it I wish I had followed the law or medicine muttered he they are both abstruse both interesting or been a gardener or a shipwright or a mathematical instrument maker or Whatever the next choice might have been we know not for he dropped off asleep From that pleasant slumber and a dream of Heaven knows what life of Arcadian simplicity of rippling streams and soft eyed shepherdesses he was destined to be somewhat suddenly if not rudely aroused as Franchetti introduced a stranger who would accept no denial Your people were not for letting me up Upton cried a rich mellow voice and Harcourt stood before him bronzed and weather beaten as he came off his journey You George Is it possible exclaimed Sir Horace what best of all lucky winds has driven you here I m not sure I wasn t dreaming of you this very moment I know I have had a vision of angelic innocence and simplicity which you must have had your part in but do tell me when did you arrive and whence Not till I have dined by Jove I have tasted nothing since daybreak and then it was only a mere apology for a breakfast Franchetti get something will you said Upton languidly a cutlet a fowl anything that can be had at once Nothing of the kind Signor Franchetti interposed Harcourt if I have a wolfs appetite I have a man s patience Let me have a real dinner soup fish an entree two if you like roast beef and I leave the wind up to your own discretion only premising that I like game and have a weakness for woodcocks By the way does this climate suit Bordeaux Upton They tell me so and mine has a good reputation Then claret be it and no other wine Don t I make myself at home old fellow eh said he clapping Upton on the shoulder Have I not taken his Majesty s Embassy by storm eh We surrender at discretion only too glad to receive our vanquisher Well and how do you find me looking Be candid how do I seem to your eyes Pretty much as I have seen you these last fifteen years not an hour older at all events That same delicacy of constitution is a confounded deal better than most men s strong health for it never wears out but I have always said it Upton will see us all down Sir Horace sighed as though this were too pleasant to be true Well said he at last but you have not told me what good chance has brought you here Is it the first post station on the way to India No they ve taken me off the saddle and given me a staff appointment at Corfu I m going out second in command there and whether it was to prevent my teasing them for something else or that there was really some urgency in the matter they ordered me off at once Are they reinforcing the garrison there asked Upton No not so far as I have heard It were better policy to do so than to send out a commander in chief and a drummer of great experience muttered Upton to himself but Harcourt could not catch the remark Have you any news stirring in England What do the clubs talk about asked Sir Horace Glencore s business occupied them for the last week or so now I think it is yourself furnishes the chief topic for speculation What of me asked Upton eagerly Why the rumor goes that you are to have the Foreign Office Adderley they say goes out and Conway and yourself are the favorites the odds being slightly on his side This is all news to me George said Upton with a degree of animation that had nothing fictitious about it I have had a note from Adderley in the last bag and there s not a word about these changes Possibly but perhaps my news is later What I allude to is said to have occurred the day I started Ah very true and now I remember that the messenger came round by Vienna sent there by Adderley doubtless muttered he to consult Conway before seeing me and I have little doubt with a letter for me in the event of Conway declining Well have you hit upon the solution of it said Har court who had not followed him through his half uttered observation Perhaps so said Upton slowly while he leaned his head upon his hand and fell into a fit of meditation Meanwhile Harcourt s dinner made its appearance and the Colonel seated himself at the table with a traveller s appetite Whenever any one has called you a selfish fellow Upton said he as he helped himself twice from the same dish I have always denied it and on this good ground that had you been so you had never kept the best cook in Europe while unable to enjoy his talents What a rare artist must this be What s his name Pipo how is he called said Upton languidly Monsieur Carmael your Excellency Ah to be sure a person of excellent family I ve been told he s from Provence said Upton in the same weary voice I could have sworn to his birthplace cried Harcourt no man can manage cheese and olives in cookery but a Provencal Ah what a glass of Bordeaux To your good health Upton and to the day that you may be able to enjoy this as I do said he as he tossed off a bumper It does me good even to witness the pleasure it yields said Upton blandly By Jove then I ll be worth a whole course of tonics to you for I most thoroughly appreciate all the good things you have given me By the way how are you off for dinner company here any pleasant people I have no health for pleasant people my dear Harcourt like horse exercise they only agree with you when you are strong enough not to require them Then what have you got asked the Colonel somewhat abashed Princes generals envoys and heads of departments Good heavens legions of honor and golden fleeces Just so said Upton smiling at the dismay in the other s countenance I have had such a party as you describe to day Are they gone yet Franchetti They re at coffee your Excellency but the Prince has ordered his carriage And you did not go near them asked Harcourt in amazement No I was poorly as you see me said Upton smiling Pipo tells me however that the dinner was a good one and I am sure they pardon my absence Foreign ease I ve no doubt though I can t say I like it muttered Harcourt At all events it is not for me to complain since the accident has given me the pleasure of your society You are about the only man I could have admitted said Upton with a certain graciousness of look and manner that perhaps detracted a little from its sincerity Fortunately not so to Harcourt s eyes for he accepted the speech in all honesty and good faith as he said Thank you heartily my boy The welcome is better even than the dinner and that is saying a good deal No more wine thank you I m going to have a cigar and with your leave I ll ask for some brandy and water This was addressed to Franchetti who speedily reappeared with a liqueur stand and an ebony cigar case Try these George they re better than your own said Upton dryly That I will cried Harcourt laughing I m determined to draw all my resources from the country in occupation especially as they are superior to what I can obtain from home This same career of yours Upton strikes me as rather a good thing You have all these things duty free Yes we have that privilege said Upton sighing And the privilege of drawing some few thousand pounds per annum paid messengers to and from England secret service money and the rest of it eh Upton smiled and sighed again And what do you do for all that I mean what are you expected to do Keep your party in when they are in disconcert the enemy when your friends are out And is that always a safe game asked Harcourt eagerly Not when played by unskilful players my dear George They occasionally make sad work and get bowled out themselves for their pains but there s no great harm in that neither How do you mean there s no harm in it Simply that if a man can t keep his saddle he ought n t to try to ride foremost but these speculations will only puzzle you my dear Harcourt What of Glencore You said awhile ago that the town was talking of him how and wherefore was it Haven t you heard the story then Not a word of it Well I m a bad narrator besides I don t know where to begin and even if I did I have nothing to tell but the odds and ends of club gossip for I conclude nobody knows all the facts but the King himself If I were given to impatience George you would be a most consummate plague to me said Upton but I am not Go on however in your own blundering way and leave me to glean what I can in mine Cheered and encouraged by this flattering speech Harcourt did begin but more courteous to him than Sir Horace we mean to accord him a new chapter for his revelations premising the while to our reader that the Colonel like the knife grinder had really no story to tell CHAPTER XXXIX A VERY BROKEN NARRATIVE You want to hear all about Glencore said Harcourt as seated in the easiest of attitudes in an easy chair he puffed his cigar luxuriously and when I have told you all I know the chances are you ll be little the wiser Upton smiled a bland assent to this exordium but in such a way as to make Harcourt feel less at ease than before I mean said the Colonel that I have little to offer you beyond the guesses and surmises of club talk It will be for your own intelligence to penetrate through the obscurity afterwards You understand me I believe I understand you said Upton slowly and with the same quiet smile Now this cold semi sarcastic manner of Upton was the one sole thing in the world which the honest Colonel could not stand up against he always felt as though it were the prelude to something cutting or offensive some sly impertinence that he could not detect till too late to resent some insinuation that might give the point to a whole conversation and yet be undiscovered by him till the day following Little as Harcourt was given to wronging his neighbor he in this instance was palpably unjust Upton s manner being nothing more than the impress made upon a very subtle man by qualities very unlike any of his own and which in their newness amused him The very look of satire was as often an expression of sorrow and regret that he could not be as susceptible as easy of deception as those about him Let us pardon our worthy Colonel if he did not comprehend this shrewder heads than his own had made the same mistake Half to resent this covert slyness half to arouse himself to any conflict before him he said in a tone of determination It is only fair to tell you that you are yourself to blame for anything that may have befallen poor Glencore I to blame Why my dear Harcourt you are surely dreaming As wide awake as ever I was If it had not been for a blunder of yours an unpardonable blunder seeing what has come of it sending a pack of trash to me about salt and sulphur while you forwarded a private letter about Glencore to the Foreign Office all this might not have happened I remember that it was a most disagreeable mistake I have paid heavily for it too That lotion for the cervical vertebrae has come back all torn and we cannot make out whether it be a phosphate or a prot oxide of bismuth You don t happen to remember I of course I know nothing about it I d as soon have taken a porcupine for a pillow as I d have adventured on the confounded mixture But as I was saying that blessed letter written by some Princess or other as I understand fell into the King s hands and the consequence was that he sent off immediately to Glencore an order to go down to him at Brighton Naturally enough I thought he d not go he had the good and sufficient pretext of his bad health to excuse him Nobody had seen him abroad in the world for years back and it was easy enough to say that he could not bear the journey Nothing of the kind he received the command as willingly as he might have done an invitation to dinner fifteen years ago and talked of nothing else for the whole evening after but of his old days and nights in Carlton House how gracious the Prince used to be to him formerly how constantly he was a guest at his table what a brilliant society it was how full of wit and the rest of it till by Jove what between drinking more wine than he was accustomed to take and the excitement of his own talking he became quite wild and unmanageable He was not drunk nor anything like it it was rather the state of a man whose mind had got some sudden shock for in the midst of perfectly rational conversation he would fall into paroxysms of violent passion inveighing against every one and declaring that he never had possessed one true hearted honest friend in his life It was not without great difficulty that I got him back to my lodgings for we had gone to dine at Richmond Then we put him to bed and I sent for Hunter who came on the instant Though by this time Glencore was much more calm and composed Hunter called the case brain fever had his hair cut quite close and ice applied to the head Without any knowledge of his history or even of his name Hunter pronounced him to be a man whose intellect had received some terrible shock and that the present was simply an acute attack of a long existent malady Did he use any irritants asked Upton anxiously No he advised nothing but the cold during the night Ah what a mistake sighed Upton heavily It was precisely the case for the cervical lotion I was speaking of Of course he was much worse next morning That he was not as regarded his reason however for he could talk collectedly enough but he was irritable and passionate to a degree scarcely credible would not endure the slightest opposition and so suspectful of everything and everybody that if he overheard a whisper it threw him into a convulsion of anger Hunter s opinion was evidently a gloomy one and he said to me as we went downstairs He may come through it with life but scarcely with a sound intellect This was a heavy blow to me for I could not entirely acquit myself of the fault of having counselled this visit to Brighton which I now perceived had made such a deep impression upon him I roused myself however to meet the emergency and walked down to saint James s to obtain some means of letting the King know that Glencore was too ill to keep his appointment Fortunately I met Knighton who was just setting off to Brighton and who promised to take charge of the commission I then strolled over to Brookes s to see the morning papers and lounged till about four o clock when I turned homeward Gloomy and sad I was as I reached my door and rang the bell with a cautious hand They did not hear the summons and I was forced to ring again when the door was opened by my servant who stood pale and trembling before me He s gone sir he s gone cried he almost sobbing Good Heaven cried I Dead No sir gone away driven off no one knows where I had just gone out to the chemist s and was obliged to call round at Doctor Hunter s about a word in the prescription they could n t read and when I came back he was away I then ascertained that the carriage which had been ordered the day before at a particular hour and which we had forgotten to countermand had arrived during my servant s absence Glencore hearing it stop at the door inquired whose it was and as suddenly springing out of bed proceeded to dress himself which he did in the suit he had ordered to wait on the King So apparently reasonable was he in all he said and such an air of purpose did he assume that the nurse tender averred she could not dare to interpose believing that his attack might possibly be some sort of passing access that he was accustomed to and knew best how to deal with I did not lose a moment but ordering post horses pursued him with all speed On reaching Croydon I heard he had passed about two hours before but though I did my best it was in vain I arrived at Brighton late at night only to learn that a gentleman had got out at the Pavilion and had not left it since I do not believe that all I have ever suffered in my life equalled what I went through in the two weary hours that I passed walking up and down outside that low paling that skirts the Palace garden The poor fellow in all his misery came before me in so many shapes sometimes wandering in intellect sometimes awake and conscious of his sufferings now trying to comport himself as became the presence he was in now reckless of all the world and everything What could have happened to detain him so long What had been the course of events since he passed that threshold were questions that again and again crossed me I tried to make my way in I know not exactly what I meant to do afterwards but the sentries refused me admittance I thought of scaling the enclosure and reaching the Palace through the garden but the police kept strict watch on every side At last it was nigh twelve o clock that I heard a sentry challenge some one and shortly after a figure passed out and walked towards the pier I followed determined to make inquiry no matter of whom He walked so rapidly however that I was forced to run to overtake him This attracted his notice he turned hastily and by the straggling moonlight I recognized Glencore He stood for a moment still and beckoning me towards him he took my arm in silence and we walked onward in the direction of the sea shore It was now a wild and gusty night The clouds drifted fast shutting out the moon at intervals and the sea broke harshly along the strand I cannot tell you the rush of strange and painful emotions which came upon me as I thus walked along while not a word passed between us As for myself I felt that the slightest word from me might perhaps change the whole current of his thoughts and thus destroy my only chance of any clew to what was passing within him Are you cold said he at length feeling possibly a slight tremor in my arm Not cold exactly said I but the night is fresh and I half suspect too fresh for you Feel that said he placing his hand in mine and it was burning The breeze that comes off the sea is grateful to me for I am like one on fire Then I am certain my dear Glencore said I that this is a great imprudence Let us turn back towards the inn He made no reply but with a rough motion of his arm moved forward as before Three hours and more said he with a full and stern utterance they kept me waiting There were Ministers with the King there was some foreign envoy too to be presented and if I had not gone in alone and unannounced I might still be in the ante chamber How he stared at me Harcourt and my close cropped hair It was that seemed first to strike him as he said Have you had an illness lately He looked poorly too bloated and pale and like one who fretted and I told him so We are both changed sir said I sadly changed since we met last We might almost begin to hope that another change is not far off the last and the best one I don t remember what he answered It was I think something about who came along with me from town and who was with me at Brighton I forget exactly but I know that he sent for Knighton and made him feel my pulse You ll find it rapid enough I ve no doubt Sir William said I I rose from a sick bed to come here his Majesty had deigned to wish to see me Then the King stopped me and made a sign to Knighton to withdraw Was n t it a strange situation Harcourt to be seated there beside the King alone None other present all to ourselves talking as you and I might talk of what interested us most of all the world and he showing me that letter the letter that ought to have come to me How he could do it I know not Neither you nor I George could have done so for after all she was ay and she is his wife He could not avail himself of my stratagem I said so too and he answered Ay but I can divorce her if one half of that be true and he pointed to the letter The Lady Glencore said he must know everything and be willing to tell it too She has paid the heaviest penalty ever woman paid for another Read that And I read it ay I read it four times five times over and then my brain began to burn and a thousand fancies flitted across me and though he talked on I heard not a word But that lady is my wife sir broke I in and what a part do you assign her She is to be a spy a witness perhaps in some infamous cause How shall I a peer of the realm endure to see my name thus degraded Is it Court favor can recompense me for lost or tarnished honor But it will be her own vindication said he Her own vindication these were the words George she should be clear of all reproach By Heaven he said so that I might declare it before the world And then it should be proved be proved How base a man can be even though he wear a crown Just fancy his proposition But I spurned it and said You must seek for some one with a longer chance of life sir to do this my days are too brief for such dishonor and he was angry with me and said I had forgotten the presence in which I stood It was true I had forgotten it He called me a wretched fool too as I tore up that letter That was wrong in me Harcourt was it not I did not see him go but I found myself alone in the room and I was picking up the fragments of the letter as they entered They were less than courteous to me though I told them who I was an ancient barony better than half the modern marquisates I gave them date and place for a creation that smacked of other services than theirs Knighton would come with me but I shook him off Your Court physician can carry his complaisance even to poison By George it is their chief office and I know well what snares are now in store for me And thence he went on to say that he would hasten back to his Irish solitude where none could trace him out That there his life at least would be secure and no emissaries of the King dare follow him It was in vain I tried to induce him to return even for one night to the hotel and I saw that to persist in my endeavors would be to hazard the little influence I still possessed over him I could not however leave the poor fellow to his fate without at least the assurance of a home somewhere and so I accompanied him to Ireland and left him in that strange old ruin where we once sojourned together His mind had gradually calmed down but a deep melancholy had gained entire possession of him and he passed whole days without a word I saw that he often labored to recall some of the events of the interview with the King but his memory had not retained them and he seemed like one eternally engaged in some problem which his faculties could not solve When I left him and arrived in town I found the clubs full of the incident but evidently without any real knowledge of what had occurred since the version was that Glencore had asked an audience of the King and gone down to the Pavilion to read to his Majesty a most atrocious narrative of the Queen s life in Italy offering to substantiate through his Italian connection every allegation it contained a proposal that of course was only received by the King in the light of an insult and that this reception so different from all his expectations had turned his head and driven him completely insane I believe now I have told you everything as I heard it indeed I have given you Glencore s own words since without them I could not convey to you what he intended to say The whole affair is a puzzle to me for I am unable to tell when the poor fellow s brain was wandering and when he spoke under the guidance of right reason You of course have the clew to it all I How so cried Upton You have seen the letter which caused all the trouble you know its contents and what it treats of Very true I must have read it but I have not the slightest recollection of what it was about There was something I know about Glencore s boy he was called Greppi though and might not have been recognized and there was some gossip about the Princess of Wales the Queen as they call her now and her ladies but I must frankly confess it did not interest me and I have forgotten it all Is the writer of the letter to be come at Nothing easier I ll take you over to breakfast with her to morrow morning you shall catechise her yourself Oh she is then She is the Princess Sabloukoff my dear George and a very charming person as you will be the first to acknowledge But as to this interview at Brighton I fancy even from the disjointed narrative of Glencore one can make a guess of what it portended The King saw that my Lady Glencore for so we must call her knew some very important facts about the Queen and wished to obtain them and saw too that certain scandals as the phrase goes which attached to her ladyship lay at another door He fancied not unreasonably perhaps that Glencore would be glad to hear this exculpation of his wife and he calculated that by the boon of this intelligence he could gain over Glencore to assist him in his project for a divorce Don t you perceive Harcourt of what an inestimable value it would prove to possess one single gentleman one man or one woman of station amid all this rabble that they are summoning throughout the world to bring shame upon England Then you incline to believe Lady Glencore blameless asked Harcourt anxiously I think well of every one my charming Colonel It is the only true philosophy in life Be as severe as you please on all who injure yourself but always be lenient to the faults that only damage your friends You have no idea how much practical wisdom the maxim contains nor what a fund of charity it provides I m ashamed to be so stupid but I must come back to my old question Is all this story against Glencore s wife only a calumny And I must fall back upon my old remark that all the rogues in the world are in jail the people you see walking about and at large are unexceptionably honest every man of them Ah my dear deputy assistant adjutant or commissary or whatever it be can you not perceive the more than folly of these perquisitions into character You don t require that the ice should be strong enough to sustain a twenty four pounder before you venture to put foot on it enough that it is quite equal to your own weight and so of the world at large everybody or nearly everybody has virtue enough for all we want with him This English habit for it is essentially English of eternally investigating everything is like the policy of a man who would fire a round shot every morning at his house to see if it were well and securely built I don t I can t agree with you cried Harcourt Be it so my dear fellow only don t give me your reasons and at least I shall respect your motives What would you do then in Glencore s place Let me ask you that You may as well inquire how I should behave if I were a quadruped Don t you perceive that I never could by any possibility place myself in such a false position The man who in a case of difficulty takes counsel from his passions is exactly like one who being thirsty fills himself out a bumper of aquafortis and drinks it off I wish with all my heart you d give up aphorisms and just tell me how we could serve this poor fellow for I feel that there is a gleam of light breaking through his dark fortunes When a man is in the state Glencore is now in the best policy is to let him alone They tell us that when Murat s blood was up the Emperor always left him to his own guidance since he either did something excessively brilliant or made such a blunder as recalled him to subjection again Let us treat our friend in this fashion and wait Oh my worthy Colonel if you but knew what a secret there is in that same waiting policy Many a game is won by letting the adversary move out of his turn If all this subtlety be needed to guide a man in the plain road of life what is to become of poor simple fellows like myself Let them never go far from home Harcourt and they ll always find their way back said Upton and his eyes twinkled with quiet drollery Come now said he with perfect good nature of look and voice If I won t tell you what I should counsel Glencore in this emergency I ll do the next best thing I ll tell you what advice you d give him Let us hear it then said the other You d send him abroad to search out his wife ask her forgiveness for all the wrong he has done her call out any man that whispered the shadow of a reproach against her and go back to such domesticity as it might please Heaven to accord him Certainly if the woman has been unjustly dealt with There s the rock you always split on you are everlastingly in search of a character Be satisfied when you have eaten a hearty breakfast and don t ask for a bill of health Researches are always dangerous My great grandfather who had a passion for genealogy was cured of it by discovering that the first of the family was a staymaker Let the lesson not be lost on us From all which I am to deduce that you d ask no questions take her home again and say nothing You forget Harcourt we are now discussing the line of action you would recommend I am only hinting at the best mode of carrying out your ideas Just for the pleasure of showing me that I did n t know how to walk in the road I made myself said Harcourt laughing What a happy laugh that was Harcourt How plainly too it said Thank Heaven I m not like that fellow with all his craft And you are right too my dear friend if the devil were to walk the world now he d be bored beyond endurance seeing nothing but the old vices played over again and again And so it is with all of us who have a spice of his nature we d give anything to see one new trick on the cards Good night and pleasant dreams to you And with a sigh that had in its cadence something almost painful he gave his two fingers to the honest grasp of the other and withdrew You re a better fellow than you think yourself or wish any one else to believe you muttered Harcourt as he puffed his cigar and he ruminated over this reflection till it was bedtime And Harcourt was right CHAPTER XL UPTONISM About noon on the following day Sir Horace Upton and the Colonel drove up to the gate of the villa at Sorrento and learned to their no small astonishment that the Princess had taken her departure that morning for Como If Upton heard these tidings with a sense of pain nothing in his manner betrayed the sentiment on the contrary he proceeded to do the honors of the place like its owner He showed Harcourt the grounds and the gardens pointed out all the choice points of view directed his attention to rare plants and curious animals and then led him within doors to admire the objects of art and luxury which abounded there And that I conclude is a portrait of the Princess said Harcourt as he stood before what had been a flattering likeness twenty years back Yes and a wonderful resemblance said Upton eying it through his glass Fatter and fuller now perhaps but it was done after an illness By Jove muttered Harcourt she must be beautiful I don t think I ever saw a handsomer woman You are only repeating a European verdict She is the most perfectly beautiful woman of the Continent So there is no flattery in that picture Flattery Why my dear fellow these people the very cleverest of them can t imagine anything as lovely as that They can imitate they never invent real beauty And clever you say too Esprit enough for a dozen reviewers and fifty fashionable novelists And as he spoke he smiled and coquetted with the portrait as though to say Don t mind my saying all this to your face I suppose her history is a very interesting one Her history my worthy Harcourt She has a dozen histories Such women have a life of politics a life of literature a life of the salons a life of the affections not to speak of the episodes of jealousy ambition triumph and sometimes defeat that make up the brilliant web of their existence Some three or four such people give the whole character and tone to the age they live in They mould its interests sway its fashions suggest its tastes and they finally rule those who fancy that they rule mankind Egad then it makes one very sorry for poor mankind muttered Harcourt with a most honest sincerity of voice Why should it do so my good Harcourt Is the refinement of a woman s intellect a worse guide than the coarser instincts of a man s nature Would you not yourself rather trust your destinies to the fair creature yonder than be left to the legislative mercies of that old gentleman there Hardenberg or his fellow on the other side Metternich Grim looking fellow the Prussian the other is much better said Harcourt rather evading the question I confess I prefer the Princess said Upton as he bowed before the portrait in deepest courtesy But here comes breakfast I have ordered them to give it to us here that we may enjoy that glorious sea view while we eat I thought your cook a man of genius Upton but this fellow is his master said Harcourt as he tasted his soup They are brothers twins too and they have their separate gifts said Upton affectedly My fellow they tell me has the finer intelligence but he plays deeply speculates on the Bourse and it spoils his nerve Harcourt watched the delivery of this speech to catch if there were any signs of raillery in the speaker he felt that there was a kind of mockery in the words but there was none in the manner for there was not any in the mind of him who uttered them My chef resumed Upton is a great essayist who must have time for his efforts This fellow is a feuilleton writer who is required to be new and sparkling every day of the year always varied never profound And is this your life of every day said Harcourt as he surveyed the splendid room and carried his glance towards the terraced gardens that flanked the sea Pretty much this kind of thing sighed Upton wearily And no great hardship either I should call it No certainly not said the other hesitatingly To one like myself for instance who has no health for the wear and tear of public life and no heart for its ambitions there is a great deal to like in the quiet retirement of a first class mission Is there really then nothing to do asked Harcourt innocently Nothing if you don t make it for yourself You can have a harvest if you like to sow Otherwise you may lie in fallow the year long The subordinates take the petty miseries of diplomacy for their share the sorrows of insulted Englishmen the passport difficulties the custom house troubles the police insults The Secretary calls at the offices of the Government carries messages and the answers and I when I have health for it make my compliments to the King in a cocked hat on his birthday and have twelve grease pots illuminated over my door to honor the same festival And is that all Very nearly In fact when one does anything more they generally do wrong and by a steady persistence in this kind of thing for thirty years you are called a safe man who never compromised his Government and are certain to be employed by any party in power I begin to think I might be an envoy myself said Harcourt No doubt of it we have two or three of your calibre in Germany this moment men liked and respected and what is of more consequence well looked upon at the Office I don t exactly follow you in that last remark I scarcely expected you should and as little can I make it clear to you Know however that in that venerable pile in Downing Street called the Foreign Office there is a strange mysterious sentiment partly tradition partly prejudice partly toadyism which bands together all within its walls from the whiskered porter at the door to the essenced Minister in his bureau into one intellectual conglomerate that judges of every man in the Line as they call diplomacy with one accord By that curious tribunal which hears no evidence nor ever utters a sentence each man s merits are weighed and to stand well in the Office is better than all the favors of the Court or the force of great abilities But I cannot comprehend how mere subordinates the underlings of official life can possibly influence the fortunes of men so much above them Picture to yourself the position of an humble guest at a great man s table imagine one to whose pretensions the sentiments of the servants hall are hostile he is served to all appearance like the rest of the company he gets his soup and his fish like those about him and his wine glass is duly replenished yet what a series of petty mortifications is he the victim of how constantly is he made to feel that he is not in public favor how certain too if he incur an awkwardness to find that his distresses are exposed The servants hall is the Office my dear Harcourt and its persecutions are equally polished Are you a favorite there yourself asked the other slyly A prime favorite they all like me said he throwing himself back in his chair with an air of easy self satisfaction and Harcourt stared at him curious to know whether so astute a man was the dupe of his own self esteem or merely amusing himself with the simplicity of another Ah my good Colonel give up the problem it is an enigma far above your powers to solve That nature is too complex for your elucidation in its intricate web no one thread holds the clew but all is complicated crossed and entangled Here comes a cabinet messenger again said Upton as a courier s caleche drove up and a well dressed and well looking fellow leaped out Ah Stanhope how are you said Sir Horace shaking his hand with what from him was warmth Do you know Colonel Harcourt Well Frank what news do you bring me The best of news From F O I suppose said Upton sighing Just so Adderley has told the King you are the only man capable to succeed him The Press says the same and the clubs are all with you Not one of them all I d venture to say has asked whether I have the strength or health for it said Sir Horace with a voice of pathetic intonation Why as we never knew you want energy for whatever fell to your lot to do we have the same hope still said Stanhope So say I too cried Harcourt Like many a good hunter he ll do his work best when he is properly weighted It is quite refreshing to listen to you both creatures with crocodile digestion talk to a man who suffers nightmare if he over eat a dry biscuit at supper I tell you frankly it would be the death of me to take the Foreign Office I d not live through the season the very dinners would kill me and then the House the heat the turmoil the worry of opposition and the jaunting back and forward to Brighton or to Windsor While he muttered these complaints he continued to read with great rapidity the letters which Stanhope had brought him and which despite all his practised coolness had evidently afforded him pleasure in the perusal Adderley bore it continued he just because he was a mere machine wound up to play off so many despatches like so many tunes and then he permitted a degree of interference on the King s part I never could have suffered and he liked to be addressed by the King of Prussia as Dear Adderley But what do I care for all these vanities Have I not seen enough of the thing they call the great world Is not this retreat better and dearer to me than all the glare and crash of London or all the pomp and splendor of Windsor By Jove I suspect you are right after all said Harcourt with an honest energy of voice Were I younger and stronger in health perhaps said Upton this might have tempted me Perhaps I can picture to myself what I might have made of it for you may perceive George these people have done nothing they have been pouring hot water on the tea leaves Pitt left them no more And you d have a brewing of your own I ve no doubt responded the other I d at least have foreseen the time when this compact this Holy Alliance should become impossible when the developed intelligence of Europe would seek something else from their rulers than a well concocted scheme of repression I d have provided for the hour when England must either break with her own people or her allies and I d have inaugurated a new policy based upon the enlarged views and extended intelligence of mankind I m not certain that I quite apprehend you muttered Harcourt No matter but you can surely understand that if a set of mere mediocrities have saved England a batch of clever men might have done something more She came out of the last war the acknowledged head of Europe does she now hold that place and what will she be at the next great struggle England is as great as ever she was cried Harcourt boldly Greater in nothing is she than in the implicit credulity of her people sighed Upton I only wish I could have the same faith in my physicians that she has in hers By the way Stanhope what of that new fellow they have got at saint Leonard s They tell me he builds you up in some preparation of gypsum so that you can t move or stir and that the perfect repose thus imparted to the system is the highest order of restorative They were just about to try him for manslaughter when I left England said Stanhope laughing As often the fate of genius in these days as in more barbarous times said Upton I read his pamphlet with much interest If you were going back Harcourt I d have begged of you to try him And I m forced to say I d have refused you flatly Yet it is precisely creatures of robust constitution like you that should submit themselves to these trials for the sake of humanity Frail organizations like mine cannot brave these ordeals What are they talking of in town Any gossip afloat The change of ministry is the only topic Glencore s affair has worn itself out What was that about Glencore asked Upton half indolently A strange story one can scarcely believe it They say that Glencore hearing of the King s great anxiety to be rid of the Queen asked an audience of his Majesty and actually suggested as the best possible expedient that his Majesty should deny the marriage They add that he reasoned the case so cleverly and with such consummate craft and skill it was with the greatest difficulty that the King could be persuaded that he was deranged Some say his Majesty was outraged beyond endurance others that he was vastly amused and laughed immoderately over it And the world how do they pronounce upon it There are two great parties one for Glencore s sanity the other against but as I said before the cabinet changes have absorbed all interest latterly and the Viscount and his case are forgotten and when I started the great question was who was to have the Foreign Office I believe I could tell them one who will not said Upton with a melancholy smile Dine with me both of you to day at seven no company you know There is an opera in the evening and my box is at your service if you like to go and so till then and with a little gesture of the hand he waved an adieu and glided from the room I m sorry he s not up to the work of office said Har court there s plenty of ability in him The best man we have said Stanhope so they say at the Office He s gone to lie down I take it he seemed much exhausted What say you to a walk back to town I ask nothing better said Stanhope and they started for Naples CHAPTER XLI AN EVENING IN FLORENCE That happy valley of the Val d Arno in which fair Florence stands possesses amidst all its virtues none more conspicuous than the blessed forgetfulness of the past so eminently the gift of those who dwell there Faults and follies of a few years back have so faded by time as to be already historical and as in certain climates rocks and stones become shrined by lichens and moss covered in a year or two so here in equally brief space bygones are shrouded and shadowed in a way that nothing short of cruelty and violence could once more expose to view The palace where Lady Glencore once displayed all her attractions of beauty and toilette and dispensed a hospitality of princely splendor had remained for a course of time close barred and shut up The massive gate was locked the windows shuttered and curious tourists were told that there were objects of interest within but it was impossible to obtain sight of them The crowds who once flocked there at nightfall and whose equipages filled the court now drove on to other haunts scarcely glancing as they passed at the darkened casements of the grim old edifice when at length the rumor ran that some one had arrived there Lights were seen in the porter s lodge the iron grille was observed to open and shut and tradespeople came and went within the building and finally the assurance gained ground that its former owner had returned Only think who has come back to us said one of the idlers of the Cascine as he lounged on the steps of a fashionable carriage La Nina And at once the story went far and near repeated at every corner and discussed in every circle so that had a stranger to the place but caught the passing sounds he would have heard that one name uttered in every group he encountered La Nina and why not the Countess of Glencore or at least the Countess de la Torre As when exiled royalists assume titles in accordance with fallen fortunes so in Italy injured fame seeks sympathy in the familiarity of the Christian name and Society at once accepts the designation as that of those who throw themselves upon the affectionate kindness of the world rather than insist upon its reverence and respect Many of her former friends were still there but there was also a numerous class principally foreigners who only knew of her by repute The traditions of her beauty her gracefulness the charms of her demeanor and the brilliancy of her diamonds abounded Her admirers were of all ages from those who worshipped her loveliness to that not less enthusiastic section who swore by her cook and it was indeed great tidings to hear that she had returned Some statistician has asserted that no less than a hundred thousand people awake every day in London not one of whom knows where he will pass the night Now Florence is but a small city and the lacquered boot class bear but a slight proportion to the shoeless herd of humanity Yet there is a very tolerable sprinkling of well dressed well got up individuals who daily arise without the very vaguest conception of who is to house them fire them light them and cigar them for the evening They are an interesting class and have this strong appeal to human sympathy that not one of them by any possible effort could contribute to his own support They toil not neither do they spin They have the very fewest of social qualities they possess no conversational gifts they are not even moderately good reporters of the passing events of the day And yet strange to say the world they live in seems to have some need of them Are they the last relics of a once gifted class worn out effete and exhausted degenerated like modern Greeks from those who once shook the Parthenon Or are they what anatomists call rudimentary structures the first abortive attempts of nature to fashion something profitable and good Who knows Amidst this class the Nina s arrival was announced as the happiest of all tidings and speculation immediately set to work to imagine who would be the favorites of the house what would be its habits and hours would she again enter the great world of society or would she as her quiet unannounced arrival portended seek a less conspicuous position Nor was this the mere talk of the cafes and the Cascine The salons were eagerly discussing the very same theme In certain social conditions a degree of astuteness is acquired as to who may and who may not be visited that in its tortuous intricacy of reasons would puzzle the craftiest head that ever wagged in Equity Not that the code is a severe one it is exactly in its lenity lies its difficulty so much may be done but so little may be fatal The Countess in the present case enjoyed what in England is reckoned a great privilege she was tried by her peers or something more They were however all nice discriminators as to the class of case before them and they knew well what danger there was in admitting to their guild any with a little more disgrace than their neighbors It was curious enough that she in whose behalf all this solicitude was excited should have been less than indifferent as to the result and when on the third day of the trial a verdict was delivered in her favor and a shower of visiting cards at the porter s lodge declared that the act of her recognition had passed her orders were that the cards should be sent back to their owners as the Countess had not the honor of their acquaintance Les grands coups se font respecter toujours was the maxim of a great tactician in war and politics and the adage is no less true in questions of social life We are so apt to compute the strength of resources by the amount of pretension that we often yield the victory to the mere declaration of force We are not however about to dwell on this theme our business being less with those who discussed her than with the Countess of Glencore herself In a large salon hung with costly tapestries and furnished in the most expensive style sat two ladies at opposite sides of the fire They were both richly dressed and one of them it was Lady Glencore as she held a screen before her face displayed a number of valuable rings on her fingers and a massive bracelet of enamel with a large emerald pendant The other not less magnificently attired wore an imperial portrait suspended by a chain around her neck and a small knot of white and green ribbon on her shoulder to denote her quality of a lady in waiting at Court There was something almost queenly in the haughty dignity of her manner and an air of command in the tone with which she addressed her companion It was our acquaintance the Princess Sabloukoff just escaped from a dinner and reception at the Pitti Palace and carrying with her some of the proud traditions of the society she had quitted What hour did you tell them they might come Nina asked she Not before midnight my dear Princess I wanted to have a talk with you first It is long since we have met and I have so much to tell you Cara mia said the other carelessly I know everything already There is nothing you have done nothing that has happened to you that I am not aware of I might go further and say that I have looked with secret pleasure at the course of events which to your short sightedness seemed disastrous I can scarce conceive that possible said the Countess sighing Naturally enough perhaps because you never knew the greatest of all blessings in this life which is liberty Separation from your husband my dear Nina did not emancipate you from the tiresome requirements of the world You got rid of him to be sure but not of those who regarded you as his wife It required the act of courage by which you cut with these people forever to assert the freedom I speak of I almost shudder at the contest I have provoked and had you not insisted on it You had gone back again to the old slavery to be pitied and compassionated and condoled with instead of being feared and envied said the other and as she spoke her flashing eyes and quivering brows gave an expression almost tiger like to her features What was there about your house and its habits distinctive before What gave you any pre eminence above those that surround you You were better looking yourself better dressed your salons better lighted your dinners more choice there was the end of it Your company was their company your associates were theirs The homage you received to day had been yesterday the incense of another There was not a bouquet nor a flattery offered to you that had not its facsimile doing service in some other quarter You were one of them Nina obliged to follow their laws and subscribe to their ideas and while they traded on the wealth of your attractions you derived nothing from the partnership but the same share as those about you And how will it be now asked the Countess half in fear half in hope How will it be now I ll tell you This house will be the resort of every distinguished man not of Italy but of the world at large Here will come the highest of every nation as to a circle where they can say and hear and suggest a thousand things in the freedom of unauthorized intercourse You will not drain Florence alone but all the great cities of Europe of its best talkers and deepest thinkers The statesman and the author and the sculptor and the musician will hasten to a neutral territory where for the time a kind of equality will prevail The weary minister escaping from a Court festival will come here to unbend the witty converser will store himself with his best resources for your salons There will be all the freedom of a club to these men with the added charm of that fascination your presence will confer and thus through all their intercourse will be felt the parfum de femme as Balzac calls it which both elevates and entrances But will not society revenge itself on all this It will invent a hundred calumnious reports and shocking stories but these like the criticisms on an immoral play will only serve to fill the house Men even the quiet ones will be eager to see what it is that constitutes the charm of these gatherings and one charm there is that never misses its success Have you ever experienced in visiting some great gallery or still more some choice collection of works of art a strange mysterious sense of awe for objects which you rather knew to be great by the testimony of others than felt able personally to appreciate You were conscious that the picture was painted by Raphael or the cup carved by Cellini and independently of all the pleasure it yielded you arose a sense of homage to its actual worth The same is the case in society with illustrious men They may seem slower of apprehension less ready at reply less apt to understand but there they are Originals not Copies of greatness They represent value Have we said enough to show our reader the kind of persuasion by which Madame de Sabloukoff led her friend into this new path The flattery of the argument was after all its success and the Countess was fascinated by fancying herself something more than the handsomest and the best dressed woman in Florence They who constitute a free port of their house will have certainly abundance of trade and also invite no small amount of enterprise A little after midnight the salons began to fill and from the Opera and the other theatres flocked in all that was pleasant fashionable and idle of Florence The old beau painted padded and essenced came with the younger and not less elaborately dressed fashionable great in watch chains and splendid in waistcoat buttons long haired artists and moustached hussars mingled with close shaven actors and pale faced authors men of the world of politics of finance of letters of the turf all were there There was the gossip of the Bourse and the cabinet the green room and the stable The scandal of society the events of club life the world s doings in dinners divorces and duels were all revealed and discussed amidst the most profuse gratitude to the Countess for coming back again to that society which scarcely survived her desertion They were not it is but fair to say all that the Princess Sabloukoff had depicted them but there was still a very fair sprinkling of witty pleasant talkers The ease of admission permitted any former intimate to present his friend and thus at once on the very first night of receiving the Countess saw her salons crowded They smoked and sang and laughed and played ecarte and told good stories They drew caricatures imitated well known actors and even preachers talking away with a volubility that left few listeners and then there was a supper laid out on a table too small to accommodate even by standing so that each carried away his plate and bivouacked with others of his friends here and there through the rooms All was contrived to impart a sense of independence and freedom all to convey an impression of license special to the place that made the most rigid unbend and relaxed the gravity of many who seldom laughed As in certain chemical compounds a mere drop of some one powerful ingredient will change the whole property of the mass eliciting new elements correcting this developing that and even to the eye announcing by altered color the wondrous change accomplished so here the element of womanhood infinitely small in proportion as it was imparted a tone and a refinement to this orgie which without it had degenerated into coarseness The Countess s beautiful niece Ida Delia Torre was also there singing at times with all an artist s excellence the triumphs of operatic music at others warbling over those canzonettes which to Italian ears embody all that they know of love of country How could such a reception be other than successful or how could the guests as they poured forth into the silent street at daybreak do aught but exult that such a house was added to the haunts of Florence so lovely a group had returned to adorn their fair city In a burst of this enthusiastic gratitude they sang a serenade before they separated and then as the closed curtains showed them that the inmates had left the windows they uttered the last felice Notte and departed And so Wahnsdorf never made his appearance said the Princess as she was once more alone with the Countess I scarcely expected him He knows the ill feeling towards his countrymen amongst Italians and he rarely enters society where he may meet them It is strange that he should marry one said she half musingly He fell in love there s the whole secret of it said the Countess He fell in love and his passion encountered certain difficulties His rank was one of them Ida s indifference another And how have they been got over Evaded rather than surmounted He has only his own consent after all And Ida does she care for him I suspect not but she will marry him Pique will often do what affection would fail in The secret history of the affair is this There was a youth at Massa who while he lived there made our acquaintance and became even intimate at the Villa he was a sculptor of some talent and as many thought of considerable promise I engaged him to give Ida lessons in modelling and in this way they were constantly together Whether Ida liked him or not I cannot say but it is beyond a doubt that he loved her In fact everything he produced in his art only showed what his mind was full of her image was everywhere This aroused Wahnsdorf s jealousy and he urged me strongly to dismiss Greppi and shut my doors to him At first I consented for I had a strange sense not exactly of dislike but misgiving of the youth I had a feeling towards him that if I attempted to convey to you it would seem as though in all this affair I had suffered myself to be blinded by passion not guided by reason There were times that I felt a deep interest in the youth his genius his ardor his very poverty engaged my sympathy and then stronger than all these was a strange mysterious sense of terror at sight of him for he was the very image of one who has worked all the evil of my life Was not this a mere fancy said the Princess compassionately for she saw the shuddering emotion these words had cost her It was not alone his look continued the Countess speaking now with impetuous eagerness it was not merely his features but their every play and movement his gestures when excited the very voice was his I saw him once excited to violent passion it was some taunt that Wahnsdorf uttered about men of unknown or ignoble origin and then He he himself seemed to stand before me as I have so often seen him in his terrible outbursts of rage The sight brought back to me the dreadful recollection of those scenes scenes said she looking wildly around her that if these old walls could speak might freeze your heart where you are sitting You have heard but you cannot know the miserable life we led together the frantic jealousy that maddened every hour of his existence how in all the harmless freedom of our Italian life he saw causes of suspicion and distrust how by his rudeness to this one his coldness to that he estranged me from all who have been my dearest intimates and friends dictating to me the while the custom of a land and a people I had never seen nor wished to see till at last I was left a mockery to some an object of pity to others amidst a society where once I reigned supreme and all for a man that I had ceased to love It was from this same life of misery unrewarded by the affection by which jealousy sometimes compensates for its tyranny that I escaped to attach myself to the fortunes of that unhappy Princess whose lot bore some resemblance to my own I know well that he ascribed my desertion to another cause and shall I own it to you I had a savage pleasure in leaving him to the delusion It was the only vengeance within my reach and I grasped it with eagerness Nothing was easier for me than to disprove it a mere word would have shown the falsehood of the charge but I would not utter it I knew his nature well and that the insult to his name and the stain to his honor would be the heaviest of all injuries to him and they were so He drove me from my home I banished him from the world It is true I never reckoned on the cruel blow he had yet in store for me and when it fell I was crushed and stunned There was now a declared war between us each to do their worst to the other It was less succumbing before him than to meditate and determine on the future that I fled from Florence It was not here and in such a society I should have to blush for any imputation But I had always held my place proudly perhaps too proudly here and I did not care to enter upon that campaign of defence that stooping to cultivate alliances that humble game of conciliation that must ensue I went away into banishment I went to Corsica and thence to Massa I was meditating a journey to the East I was even speculating on establishing myself there for the rest of my life when your letters changed my plans You once more kindled in my heart a love of life by instilling a love of vengeance You suggested to me the idea of coming back here boldly and confronting the world proudly Do not mistake me Nina said the Princess the Vendetta was the last thing in my thoughts I was too deeply concerned for you to be turned away from my object by any distracting influence It was that you should give a bold denial the boldest to your husband s calumny I counselled your return My advice was Disregard and by disregarding deny the foul slander he has invented Go back to the world in the rank that is yours and that you never forfeited and then challenge him to oppose your claim to it And do you think that for such a consideration as this the honor to bear the name of a man I loathe that I d face that world I know so well No no believe me I had very different reasons I was resolved that my future life my name his name should gain a European notoriety I am well aware that when a woman is made a public talk when once her name comes sufficiently often before the world let it be for what you will her beauty her will her extravagance her dress from that hour her fame is perilled and the society she has overtopped take their vengeance in slandering her character To be before the world as a woman is to be arraigned If ever there was a man who dreaded such a destiny for his wife it was he The impertinences of the Press had greater terrors for his heart than aught else in life and I resolved that he should taste them How have you mistaken how have you misunderstood me Nina said the Princess sorrowfully Not so cried she eagerly You only saw one advantage in the plan you counselled I perceived that it contained a double benefit But remember dearest Nina revenge is the most costly of all pleasures if one pays for it with all that they possess their tranquillity I myself might have indulged such thoughts as yours there were many points alike in our fortunes but to have followed such a course would be like the wisdom of one who inoculates himself with a deadly malady that he may impart the poison to another Must I again tell you that in all I have done I cared less how it might serve me than how it might wound him I know you cannot understand this sentiment I do not ask of you to sympathize with it Your talents enabled you to shape out a high and ambitious career for yourself You loved the great intrigues of state and were well fitted to conduct or control them None such gifts were mine I was and I am still a mere creature of society I never soared even in fancy beyond the triumphs which the world of fashion decrees A cruel destiny excluded me from the pleasures of a life that would have amply satisfied me and there is nothing left but to avenge myself on the cause My dearest Nina with all your self stimulation you cannot make yourself the vindictive creature you would appear said the Princess smiling How little do you know my Italian blood said the other passionately That boy he was not much more than boy that Greppi was as I told you the very image of Glencore The same dark skin the same heavy brow the same cold stern look which even a smile did not enliven even to the impassive air with which he listened to a provocation all were alike Well the resemblance has cost him dearly I consented at last to Wahnsdorf s continual entreaty to exclude him from the Villa and charged the Count with the commission I am not sure that he expended an excess of delicacy on the task I half fear me that he did the act more rudely than was needed At all events a quarrel was the result and a challenge to a duel I only knew of this when all was over believe me I should never have permitted it However the result was as safe in the hands of Fate The youth fled from Massa and though Wahnsdorf followed him they never met There was no duel you say cried the Princess eagerly How could there be This Greppi never went to the rendezvous He quitted Massa during the night and has never since been heard of In this I own to you he was not like him And as she said the words the tears swam in her eyes and rolled down her cheeks May I ask you how you learned all this From Wahnsdorf on his return in a week or two he told me all Ida at first would not believe it but how could she discredit what was plain and palpable Greppi was gone All the inquiries of the police were in vain as to his route none could guess how he had escaped And this account was given you you yourself by Wahnsdorf repeated the Princess Yes to myself Why should he have concealed it And now he is to marry Ida said the Princess half musingly to herself We hope with your aid that it may be so The family difficulties are great Wahnsdorf s rank is not ours but he persists in saying that to your management nothing is impossible His opinion is too flattering said the Princess with a cold gravity of manner But you surely will not refuse us your assistance You may count upon me even for more than you ask said the Princess rising How late it is day is breaking already And so with a tender embrace they parted CHAPTER XLIII MADAME DE SABBLOUKOFF IN THE MORNING Madame de Sabloukoff inhabited the grand apartment of the Hotel d Italie which is the handsomest quarter of the great hotel of Florence The same suite which had once the distinguished honor of receiving a Czar and a King of Prussia and Heaven knows how many lesser potentates was now devoted to one who though not of the small number of the elect in purple was yet in her way what politicians calls a puissance As in the drama a vast number of agencies are required for the due performance of a piece so on the greater stage of life many of the chief motive powers rarely are known to the public eye The Princess was of this number She was behind the scenes in more than one sense and had her share in the great events of her time While her beauty lasted she had traded on the great capital of attractions which were unsurpassed in Europe As the perishable flower faded she with prudential foresight laid up a treasure in secret knowledge of people and their acts which made her dreaded and feared where she was once admired and flattered Perhaps it is by no means improbable she preferred this latter tribute to the former Although the strong sunlight was tempered by the closed jalousies and the drawn muslin curtains she sat with her back to the window so that her features were but dimly visible in the darkened atmosphere of the room There was something of coquetry in this but there was more there was a dash of semi secrecy in the air of gloom and stillness around which gave to each visitor who presented himself and she received but one at a time an impression of being admitted to an audience of confidence and trust The mute like servant who waited in the corridor without and who drew back a massive curtain on your entrance also aided the delusion imparting to the interview a character of mysterious solemnity Through that solemn portal there had passed in and out during the morning various dignitaries of the land ministers and envoys and grand charges of the Court The embroidered key of the Chamberlain and the purple stockings of a Nuncio had come and gone and now there was a Brief pause for the groom in waiting had informed the crowd in the antechamber that the Princess could receive no more Then there was a hurried scrawling of great names in a large book a shower of visiting cards and all was over the fine equipages of fine people dashed off and the courtyard of the hotel was empty The large clock on the mantelpiece struck three and Madame de Sabloukoff compared the time with her watch and by a movement of impatience showed a feeling of displeasure She was not accustomed to have her appointments lightly treated and he for whom she had fixed an hour was now thirty minutes behind his time She had been known to resent such unpunctuality and she looked as though she might do so again I remember the day when his grand uncle descended from his carriage to speak to me muttered she and that same grand uncle was an emperor Perhaps the chance reflection of her image in the large glass before her somewhat embittered the recollection for her features flushed and as suddenly grew pale again It may have been that her mind went rapidly back to a period when her fascination was a despotism that even the highest and the haughtiest obeyed Too true said she speaking to herself time has dealt heavily with us all But they are no more what they once were than am I Their old compact of mutual assistance is crumbling away under the pressure of new rivalries and new pretensions Kings and Kaisers will soon be like bygone beauties I wonder will they bear their altered fortune as heroically It is but just to say that her tremulous accents and quivering lip bore little evidence of the heroism she spoke of She rang the bell violently and as the servant entered she said but in a voice of perfect unconcern When the Count von Wahnsdorf calls you will tell him that I am engaged but will receive him to morrow And why not to day charming Princess said a young man entering hastily and whose graceful but somewhat haughty air set off to every advantage his splendid Hungarian costume Why not now said he stooping to kiss her hand with respectful gallantry She motioned to the servant to withdraw and they were alone You are not over exact in keeping an appointment monsieur said she stiffly It is somewhat cruel to remind me that my claims in this respect have grown antiquated I fancied myself the soul of punctuality my dear Princess said he adjusting the embroidered pelisse he wore over his shoulder You mentioned four as the hour I said three o clock replied she coldly Three or four or even five what does it signify said he carelessly We have not either of us I suspect much occupation to engage us and if I have interfered with your other plans if you have plans A thousand pardons cried he suddenly as the deep color of her face and her flashing eye warned him that he had gone too far but the fact is I was detained at the riding school They have sent me some young horses from the Banat and I went over to look at them The Count de Wahnsdorf knows that he need make no apologies to Madame de Sabloukoff said she calmly but it were just as graceful perhaps to affect them My dear Count continued she but in a tone perfectly free from all touch of irritation I have asked to see and speak with you on matters purely your own You want to dissuade me from this marriage said he interrupting but I fancy that I have already listened to everything that can be urged on that affair If you have any argument other than the old one about misalliance and the rest of it I ll hear it patiently though I tell you beforehand that I should like to learn that a connection with an imperial house had some advantage besides that of a continual barrier to one s wishes I understand said she quietly that you named the terms on which you would abandon this project is it not so Who told you that cried he angrily Is this another specimen of the delicacy with which ministers treat a person of my station To discuss that point Count would lead us wide of our mark Am I to conclude that my informant was correct How can I tell what may have been reported to you said he almost rudely You shall hear and judge for yourself was the calm answer Count Kollorath informed me that you offered to abandon this marriage on condition that you were appointed to the command of the Pahlen Hussars The young man s face became scarlet with shame and he tried twice to speak but unavailingly With a merciless slowness of utterance and a manner of the most unmoved sternness she went on I did not deem the proposal at all exorbitant It was a price that they could well afford to pay Well they refused me said he bluntly Not exactly refused you said she more gently They reminded you of the necessity of conforming of at least appearing to conform to the rules of the service that you had only been a few months in command of a squadron that your debts which were considerable had been noised about the world so that a little time should elapse and a favorable opportunity present itself before this promotion could be effected How correctly they have instructed you in all the details of this affair said he with a scornful smile It is a rare event when I am misinformed sir was her cold reply nor could it redound to the advantage of those who ask my advice to afford me incorrect information Then I am quite unable to perceive what you want with me cried he It is plain enough you are in possession of all that I could tell you Or is all this only the prelude to some menace or other She made no other answer to this rude question than by a smile so dubious in its meaning it might imply scorn or pity or even sorrow You must not wonder if I be angry continued he in an accent that betokened shame at his own violence They have treated me so long as a fool that they have made me something worse than one I am not offended by your warmth Count said she softly It is at least the guarantee of your sincerity I tell you therefore I have no threat to hold over you It will be enough that I can show you the impolicy of this marriage I don t want to use a stronger word what estrangement it will lead to as regards your own family how inadequately it will respond to the sacrifices it must cost That consideration is for me to think of madam said he proudly And for your friends also interposed she softly If by my friends you mean those who have watched every occasion of my life to oppose my plans and thwart my wishes I conclude that they will prove themselves as vigilant now as heretofore but I am getting somewhat weary of this friendship My dear Count give me a patient if possible an indulgent hearing for five minutes or even half that time and I hope it will save us both a world of misconception If this marriage that you are so eager to contract were an affair of love of that ardent passionate love which recognizes no obstacle nor acknowledges any barrier to its wishes I could regard the question as one of those everyday events in life whose uniformity is seldom broken by a new incident for love stories have a terrible sameness in them She smiled as she said this and in such a way as to make him smile at first and then laugh heartily But if resumed she seriously if I only see in this project a mere caprice half more than half based upon the pleasure of wounding family pride or of coercing those who have hitherto dictated to you if besides this I perceive that there is no strong affection on either side none of that impetuous passion which the world accepts as the attenuating circumstance in rash marriages And who has told you that I do not love Ida or that she is not devoted with her whole heart to me cried he interrupting her You yourself have told the first You have shown by the price you have laid on the object the value at which you estimate it As for the latter part of your question She paused and arranged the folds of her shawl purposely playing with his impatience and enjoying it Well cried he as for the latter part go on It scarcely requires an answer I saw Ida Delia Torre last night in a society of which her affianced husband was not one and I will be bold enough to say hers was not the bearing that bespoke engaged affections Indeed said he but in a tone that indicated neither displeasure nor surprise It was as I have told you Count Surrounded by the youth of Florence such as you know them she laughed and talked and sang in all the careless gayety of a heart at ease or if at moments a shade of sadness crossed her features it was so brief that only one observing her closely as myself could mark it And how did that subtle intelligence of yours interpret this show of sorrow said he in a voice of mockery but yet of deep anxiety My subtle intelligence was not taxed to guess for I knew her secret said the Princess with all the strength of conscious power Her secret her secret said he eagerly What do you mean by that The Princess smiled coldly and said I have not yet found my frankness so well repaid that I should continue to extend it What is the reward to be madam Name it said he boldly The same candor on your part Count I ask for no more But what have I to reveal what mystery is there that your omniscience has not penetrated There may be some that your frankness has not avowed my dear Count If you refer to what you have called Ida s secret No broke she in I was now alluding to what might be called your secret Mine my secret exclaimed he But though the tone was meant to convey great astonishment the confusion of his manner was far more apparent Your secret Count she repeated slowly which has been just as safe in my keeping as if it had been confided to me on honor I was not aware how much I owed to your discretion madam said he scoffingly I am but too happy when any services of mine can rescue the fame of a great family from reproach sir replied she proudly for all the control she had heretofore imposed upon her temper seemed at last to have yielded to offended dignity Happily for that illustrious house happily for you too I am one of a very few who know of Count Wahnsdorf s doings To have suffered your antagonist in a duel to be tracked arrested and imprisoned in an Austrian fortress when a word from you had either warned him of his peril or averted the danger was bad enough but to have stigmatized his name with cowardice and to have defamed him because he was your rival was far worse Wahnsdorf struck the table with his clenched fist till it shook beneath the blow but never uttered a word while with increased energy she continued Every step of this bad history is known to me every detail of it from your gross and insulting provocation of this poor friendless youth to the last scene of his committal to a dungeon And of course you have related your interesting narrative to Ida cried he No sir the respect which I have never lost for those whose name you bear had been quite enough to restrain me had I not even other thoughts And what may they be asked he To take the first opportunity of finding myself alone with you to represent how nearly it concerns your honor that this affair should never be bruited abroad to insist upon your lending every aid to obtain this young man s liberation to show that the provocation came from yourself and lastly all painful though it be to remove from him the stain you have inflicted and to reinstate him in the esteem that your calumny may have robbed him of These were the other thoughts I alluded to And you fancy that I am to engage in this sea of trouble for the sake of some nameless bastard while in doing so I compromise myself and my own honor Do you prefer that it should be done by another Count Wahnsdorf asked she This is a threat madam All the speedier will the matter be settled if you understand it as such And of course the next condition will be for me to resign my pretensions to Ida in his favor said he with a savage irony I stipulate for nothing of the sort Count Wahnsdorf s pretensions will be to morrow just where they are to day You hold them cheaply madam I am indeed unfortunate in all my pursuit of your esteem You live in a sphere to command it sir was her reply given with a counterfeited humility and whether it was the tone of mingled insolence and submission she assumed or simply the sense of his own unworthiness in her sight but Wahnsdorf cowered before her like a frightened child At this moment the servant entered and presented a visiting card to the Princess Ah he comes in an opportune moment cried she This is the Minister of the Duke of Massa s household the Chevalier Stubber Yes continued she to the servant I will receive him If there was not any conspicuous gracefulness in the Chevalier s approach there was an air of quiet self possession that bespoke a sense of his own worth and importance and while he turned to pay his respects to the young Count his unpolished manner was not devoid of a certain dignity It is a fortunate chance by which I find you here Count Wahnsdorf said he for you will be glad to learn that the young fellow you had that affair with at Massa has just been liberated When and how cried the Princess hastily As to the time it must be about four days ago as my letters inform me as to the how I fancy the Count can best inform you he has interested himself greatly in the matter The Count blushed deeply and turned away to hide his face but not so quickly as to miss the expression of scornful meaning with which the Princess regarded him But I want to hear the details Chevalier said she And I can give you none madam My despatches simply mention that the act of arrest was discovered in some way to be informal Sir Horace Upton proved so much There then arose a question of giving him up to us but my master declined the honor he would have no trouble he said with England or Englishmen and some say that the youth claims an English nationality The cabinet of Vienna are perhaps like minded in the matter at all events he is free and will be here to morrow Then I shall invite him to dinner and beg both of you gentlemen to meet him said she with a voice wherein a tone of malicious drollery mingled I am your servant madam said Stubber And I am engaged said Wahnsdorf taking up his shako You are off to Vienna to night Count Wahnsdorf whispered the Princess in his ear What do you mean madam said he in a tone equally low Only that I have a letter written for the Archduchess Sophia which I desire to intrust to your hands You may as well read ere I seal it The Count took the letter from her hand and retired towards the window to read it While she conversed eagerly with Stubber she did not fail from time to time to glance towards the other and mark the expression of his features as he folded and replaced the letter in its envelope and slowly approaching her said You are most discreet madam I hope I am just sir said she modestly This was something of a difficult undertaking too said he with an equivocal smile It was certainly a pleasant and proud one sir as it always must be to write to a mother in commendation of her son By the way Chevalier you have forgotten to make your compliments to the Count on his promotion I have not heard of it madam what may it be asked Stubber To the command of the Pahlen Hussars sir one of the proudest charges of the Empire A rush of blood to Wahnsdorf s face was as quickly followed by a deadly pallor and with a broken faint utterance he said Good bye and left the room A fine young fellow the very picture of a soldier exclaimed Stubber looking after him A chevalier of the olden time sir the very soul of honor said the Princess enthusiastically And now for a little gossip with yourself It is not in our brief to record what passed in that chatty interview plenty of state secrets and state gossip there was abundance of that dangerous trifling which mixes up the passions of society with the great game of politics and makes statecraft feel the impress of men s whims and caprices We were just beginning that era the policy of resentments which has since pervaded Europe and the Chevalier and the Princess were sufficiently behind the scenes to have many things to communicate and here we must leave them while we hasten on to other scenes and other actors CHAPTER XLIII DOINGS IN DOWNING STREET The dull old precincts of Downing Street were more than usually astir Hackney coaches and cabs at an early hour private chariots somewhat later went to and fro along the dreary pavement and two cabinet messengers with splashed caleches arrived in hot haste from Dover Frequent too were the messages from the House a leading Oppositionist was then thundering away against the Government inveighing against the treacherous character of their foreign policy and indignantly calling on them for certain despatches to their late envoy at Naples At every cheer which greeted him from his party a fresh missive would be despatched from the Treasury benches and the whisper at first cautiously muttered grew louder and louder Why does not Upton come down So intricate has been the web of our petty entanglements so complex the threads of those small intrigues by which we have earned our sobriquet of the perfide Albion that it is difficult at this time of day to recall the exact question whose solution in the words of the orator of the debate placed us either at the head of Europe or consigned to us the fatal mediocrity of a third rate power The prophecy whichever way read gives us unhappily no clew to the matter in hand and we are only left to conjecture that it was an intervention in Spain or something about the Poles As is usual in such cases the matter insignificant enough in itself was converted into a serious attack on the Government and all the strength of the Opposition was arrayed to give power and consistency to the assault As is equally usual the cabinet was totally unprepared for defence either they had altogether undervalued the subject or they trusted to the secrecy with which they had conducted it whichever of these be the right explanation each minister could only say to his colleague It never came before me Upton knows all about it And where is Upton why does he not come down were again and again reiterated while a shower of messages and even mandates invoked his presence The last of these was a peremptory note from no less a person than the Premier himself written in three very significant words thus Come or go and given to a trusty whip the honorable Gerald Neville to deliver Armed with this not very conciliatory document the well practised tactician drew up to the door of the Foreign Office and demanded to see the Secretary of State Give him this card and this note sir said he to the well dressed and very placid young gentleman who acted as his private secretary Sir Horace is very poorly sir he is at this moment in a mineral bath but as the matter you say is pressing he will see you Will you pass this way mister Neville followed his guide through an infinity of passages and at length reached a large folding door opening one side of which he was ushered into a spacious apartment but so thoroughly impregnated with a thick and offensive vapor that he could barely perceive through the mist the bath in which Upton lay reclined and the figure of a man whose look and attitude bespoke the doctor beside him Ah my dear fellow sighed Upton extending two dripping fingers in salutation you have come in at the death This is the last of it No no don t say that cried the other encouragingly Have you had any sudden seizure What is the nature of it He said he looking round to the doctor calls it arachnoidal trismus a thing he says that they have all of them ignored for many a day though Charlemagne died of it Ah Doctor and he addressed a question to him in German A growled volley of gutturals ensued and Upton went on Yes Charlemagne Melancthon had it but lingered for years It is the peculiar affection of great intellectual natures over taxed and over worked Whether there was that in the manner of the sick man that inspired hope or something in the aspect of the doctor that suggested distrust or a mixture of the two together but certainly Neville rapidly rallied from the fears which had beset him on entering and in a voice of a more cheery tone said Come come Sir Horace you ll throw off this as you have done other such attacks You have never been wanting either to your friends or yourself when the hour of emergency called We are in a moment of such difficulty now and you alone can rescue us How cruel of the Duke to write me that sighed Upton as he held up the piece of paper from which the water had obliterated all trace of the words It was so inconsiderate eh Neville I m not aware of the terms he employed said the other This was the very admission that Upton sought to obtain and in a far more cheery voice he said If I was capable of the effort if Doctor Geimirstad thought it safe for me to venture I could set all this to right These people are all talking without book Neville the ever recurring blunder of an Opposition when they address themselves to a foreign question they go upon a newspaper paragraph or the equally incorrect private communication from a friend Men in office alone can attain to truth exact truth about questions of foreign policy The debate is taking a serious turn however interposed Neville They reiterate very bold assertions which none of our people are in a position to contradict Their confidence is evidently increasing with the show of confusion in our ranks Something must be done to meet them and that quickly Well I suppose I must go sighed Upton and as he held out his wrist to have his pulse felt he addressed a few words to the doctor He calls it a life period Neville He says that he won t answer for the consequences The doctor muttered on He adds that the trismus may be thus converted into Bi trismus Just imagine Bi trismus This was a stretch of fancy clear and away beyond Neville s apprehension and he began to feel certain misgivings about pushing a request so full of danger but from this he was in a measure relieved by the tone in which Upton now addressed his valet with directions as to the dress he intended to wear The loose pelisse with the astrakhan Giuseppe and that vest of cramoisie velvet and if you will just glance at the newspaper Neville in the next room I ll come to you immediately The newspapers of the morning after this interview afford us the speediest mode of completing the incidents and the concluding sentences of a leading article will be enough to place before our readers what ensued It was at this moment and amidst the most enthusiastic cheers of the Treasury bench that Sir Horace Upton entered the House Leaning on the arm of mister Neville he slowly passed up and took his accustomed place The traces of severe illness in his features and the great debility which his gestures displayed gave an unusual interest to a scene already almost dramatic in its character For a moment the great chief of Opposition was obliged to pause in his assault to let this flood tide of sympathy pass on and when at length he did resume it was plain to see how much the tone of his invective had been tempered by a respect for the actual feeling of the House The necessity for this act of deference added to the consciousness that he was in presence of the man whose acts he so strenuously denounced were too much for the nerves of the orator and he came to an abrupt conclusion whose confused and uncertain sentences scarcely warranted the cheers with which his friends rallied him Sir Horace rose at once to reply His voice was at first so inarticulate that we could but catch the burden of what he said a request that the House would accord him all the indulgence which his state of debility and suffering called for If the first few sentences he uttered imparted a painful significance to the entreaty it very soon became apparent that he had no occasion to bespeak such indulgence In a voice that gained strength and fulness as he proceeded he entered upon what might be called a narrative of the foreign policy of the administration clearly showing that their course was guided by certain great principles which dictated a line of action firm and undeviating that the measures of the Government however modified by passing events in Europe had been uniformly consistent based upon the faith of treaties but ever mindful of the growing requirements of the age Through a narrative of singular complexity he guided himself with consummate skill and though detailing events which occupied every region of the globe neither confusion nor inconsistency ever marred the recital and names and places and dates were quoted by him without any artificial aid to memory There was in the polished air and calm dispassionate delivery of the speaker something which seemed to charm the ears of those who for four hours before had been so mercilessly assailed by all the vituperation and insolence of party animosity It was so to say a period of relief and repose to which even antagonists were not insensible No man ever understood the advantage of his gifts in this way better than Upton nor ever was there one who could convert the powers which fascinated society into the means of controlling a popular assembly with greater assurance of success He was a man of a strictly logical mind a close and acute thinker he was of a highly imaginative temperament rich in all the resources of a poetic fancy he was thoroughly well read and gifted with a ready memory but above all these transcendently above them all he was a man of the world and no one either in Parliament or out of it knew so well when it was wrong to say the right thing But let us resume our quotation For more than three hours did the House listen with breathless attention to a narrative which in no parliamentary experience has been surpassed for the lucid clearness of its details the unbroken flow of its relation The orator up to this time had strictly devoted himself to explanation he now proceeded to what might be called reply If the House was charmed and instructed before it was now positively astonished and electrified by the overwhelming force of the speaker s raillery and invective Not satisfied with showing the evil consequences that must ensue from any adoption of the measures recommended by the Opposition he proceeded to exhibit the insufficiency of views always based upon false information We have been taunted said he with the charge of fomenting discords in foreign lands we have been arraigned as disturbers of the world s peace and called the firebrands of Europe we are exhibited as parading the Continent with a more than Quixotic ardor since we seek less the redress of wrong than the opportunity to display our own powers of interference that quality which the learned gentleman has significantly stigmatized as a spirit of meddling impertinence offensive to the whole world of civilization Let me tell him sir that the very debate of this night has elicited and from himself too the very outrages he has had the temerity to ascribe to us His has been this indiscriminate ardor his this unjudging rashness his this meddling impertinence I am but quoting not inventing a phrase by which without accurate without indeed any information he has ventured to charge the Government with what no administration would be guilty of a cool and deliberate violation of the national law of Europe He has told you sir that in our eagerness to distinguish ourselves as universal redressers of injury we have ferreted out I take his own polished expression the case of an obscure boy in an obscure corner of Italy converted a commonplace and very vulgar incident into a tale of interest and by a series of artful devices and insinuations based upon this narrative a grave and insulting charge upon one of the oldest of our allies He has alleged that throughout the whole of those proceedings we had not the shadow of pretence for our interference that the acts imputed occurred in a land over which we had no control and in the person of an individual in whom we had no interest that this Sebastiano Greppi this image boy for so with a courteous pleasantry he has called him was a Neapolitan subject the affiliated envoy of I know not what number of secret societies that his sculptural pretensions were but pretexts to conceal his real avocations the agency of a bloodthirsty faction that his crime was no less than an act of high treason and that Austrian gentleness and mercy were never more conspicuously illustrated than in the commutation of a death sentence to one of perpetual imprisonment What a rude task is mine when I must say that for even one of these assertions there is not the slightest foundation in fact Greppi s offence was not a crime against the state as little was it committed within the limits of the Austrian territory He is not the envoy or even a member of any revolutionary club he never I am speaking with knowledge sir he never mingled in the schemes of plotting politicians as far removed is he from sympathy with such men as in the genius of a great artist he is elevated above the humble path to which the learned gentleman s raillery would sentence him For the character of an image vendor the learned gentleman must look nearer home and lastly this youth is an Englishman and born of a race and a blood that need feel no shame in comparison with any I see around me To the loud cry of Name name which now arose Sir Horace replied If I do not announce the name at this moment it is because there are circumstances in the history of the youth to which publicity would give irreparable pain These are details which I have no right to bring under discussion and which must inevitably thus become matters of town talk To any gentleman of the opposite side who may desire to verify the assertions I have made to the House I would under pledge of secrecy reveal the name I would do more I would permit him to confide it to a select number of friends equally pledged with himself This is surely enough We have no occasion to continue our quotation farther and we take up our history as Sir Horace overwhelmed by the warmest praises and congratulations drove off from the House to his home Amid all the excitement and enthusiasm which this brilliant success produced among the ministerialists there was a kind of dread lest the overtaxed powers of the orator should pay the heavy penalty of such an effort They had all heard how he came from a sick chamber they had all seen him trembling faint and almost voiceless as he stole up to his place and they began to fear lest they had in the hot zeal of party imperilled the ablest chief in their ranks What a relief to these agonies had it been could they have seen Upton as he once more gained the solitude of his chamber where divested of all the restraints of an audience he walked leisurely up and down smoking a cigar and occasionally smiling pleasantly as some conceit crossed his mind Had there been any one to mark him there it is more than likely that he would have regarded him as a man revelling in the after thought of a great success one who having come gloriously through the combat was triumphantly recalling to his memory every incident of the fight How little had they understood Sir Horace Upton who would have read him in this wise That daring and soaring nature rarely dallied in the past even the present was scarcely full enough for the craving of a spirit that cried ever Forward What might be made of that night s success how best it should be turned to account these were the thoughts which beset him and many were the devices which his subtlety hit on to this end There was not a goal his ambition could point to but which became associated with some deteriorating ingredient He was tired of the Continent he hated England he shuddered at the Colonies India perhaps said he hesitatingly India perhaps might do To continue as he was to remain in office as having reached the topmost round of the ladder would have been insupportable indeed and yet how without longer service at his post could any man claim a higher reward CHAPTER XLIV THE SUBTLETIES OF STATECRAFT It was not till Sir Horace had smoked his third cigar that he seated himself at his writing table He then wrote rapidly a brief note of which he proceeded to make a careful copy This he folded and placed in an envelope addressing it to his Grace the Duke of Cloudeslie A few minutes afterwards he began to prepare for bed The day was already breaking and yet that sick man was unwearied and unwasted not a trace of fatigue on features that under the infliction of a tiresome dinner party would have seemed bereft of hope The tied up knocker the straw strewn street the closely drawn curtains announced to London the next morning that the distinguished minister was seriously ill and from an early hour the tide of inquirers in carriages and on foot passed silently along that dreary way High and mighty were the names inscribed in the porter s book royal dukes had called in person and never was public solicitude more widely manifested There is something very flattering in the thought of a great intelligence being damaged and endangered in our service With all its melancholy influences there is a feeling of importance suggested by the idea that for us and our interests a man of commanding powers should have jeoparded his life There is a very general prejudice not alone in obtaining the best article for our money but the most of it also and this sentiment extends to the individuals employed in the public service and it is doubtless a very consolatory reflection to the tax paying classes that the great functionaries of state are not indolent recipients of princely incomes but hard worked men of office up late and early at their duties prematurely old and worn out before their time Something of this same feeling inspires much of the sympathy displayed for a sick statesman a sentiment not altogether void of a certain misgiving that we have probably over taxed the energies employed in our behalf Scarcely one in a hundred of those who now called and left their names had ever seen Sir Horace Upton in their lives Few are more removed from public knowledge than the men who fill even the highest places in our diplomacy He was therefore to the mass a mere name Since his accession to office little or nothing had been heard of him and of that little the greater part was made up of sneering allusions to his habits of indolence impertinent hints about his caprices and his tastes Yet now by a grand effort in the House and a well got up report of a dangerous illness the day after was he the most marked man in all the state the theme of solicitude throughout two millions of people There was a dash of mystery too in the whole incident which heightened its flavor for public taste a vague indistinct impression it did not even amount to rumor was abroad that Sir Horace had not been fairly treated by his colleagues either that they could if they wished it have defended the cause themselves or that they had needlessly called him from a sick bed to come to the rescue or that some subtle trap had been laid to ensnare him These were vulgar beliefs which if they obtained little credence in the higher region of club life were extensively circulated and not discredited in less distinguished circles How they ever got abroad at all how they found their ways into newspaper paragraphs terrifying timid supporters of the ministry by the dread prospect of a smash exciting the hopes of Opposition with the notion of a great secession throwing broadcast before the world of readers every species of speculation all kinds of combination who knows how all this happened Who indeed ever knew how things a thousand times more secret ever got wind and became club talk ere the actors in the events had finished an afternoon s canter in the Park If then the world of London learned on the morning in question that Sir Horace Upton was very ill it also surmised why and wherefore it knows best that the same Sir Horace was an ill used man Now of all the objects of public sympathy and interest next after a foreign emperor on a visit at Buckingham Palace or a newly arrived hippopotamus at the Zoological Gardens there is nothing your British public is so fond of as an ill used man It is essential however to his great success that he be ill used in high places that his enemies and calumniators should have been if not princes at least dukes and marquises and great dignitaries of the state Let him only be supposed to be martyred by these and there is no saying where his popularity may be carried A very general impression is current that the mass of the nation is more or less ill used denied its natural claims and just rewards To hit upon therefore a good representation of this hard usage to find a tangible embodiment of this great injustice is a discovery that is never unappreciated To read his speech of the night before and to peruse the ill scrawled bulletin of his health at the hall door in the morning made up the measure of his popularity and the world exclaimed Think of the man they have treated in this fashion Every one framed the indictment to his own taste nor was the wrong the less grievous that none could give it a name Even cautious men fell into the trap and were heard to say If all we hear be true Upton has not been fairly treated What an air of confirmation to all these rumors did it give when the evening papers announced in the most striking type Resignation of Sir Horace Upton If the terms in which he communicated that step to the Premier were not before the world the date the very night of the debate showed that the resolution had been come to suddenly Some of the journals affected to be in the whole secret of the transaction and only waiting the opportune moment to announce it to the world The dark mysterious paragraphs in which journalists show their no meanings abounded and menacing hints were thrown out that the country would no longer submit to Heaven knows what There was besides all this a very considerable amount of that catechetical inquiry which by suggesting a number of improbabilities hopes to arrive at the likely and thus by asking questions where they had a perfect confidence they would never be answered they seemed to overwhelm their adversaries with shame and discomfiture The great fact however was indisputable Upton had resigned To the many who looked up at the shuttered windows of his sad looking London house this reflection occurred naturally enough How little the poor sufferer on his sick bed cared for the contest that raged around him how far away were in all probability his thoughts from that world of striving and ambition whose waves came to his door sills Let us in that privilege which belongs to us take a peep within the curtained room where a bright fire is blazing and where seated behind a screen Sir Horace is now penning a note a bland half smile rippling his features as some pleasant conceit has flashed across his mind We have rarely seen him looking so well The stimulating events of the last few days have done for him more than all the counsels of his doctors and his eyes are brighter and his cheeks fuller than usual A small miniature hangs suspended by a narrow ribbon round his neck and a massive gold bracelet adorns one wrist two souvenirs which he stops to contemplate as he writes nor is there a touch of sorrowful meaning in the glance he bestows upon them the look rather seems the self complacent regard that a successful general might bestow on the decorations he had won by his valor It is essentially vainglorious More than once has he paused to read over the sentence he has written and one may see by the motion of his lips as he reads how completely he has achieved the sentiment he would express Yes charming Princess said he perusing the lines before him I ve once more to throw myself at your feet and reiterate the assurances of a devotion which has formed the happiness of my existence That does not sound quite French after all muttered he better perhaps has formed the religion of my heart I know you will reproach my precipitancy I feel how your judgment unerring as it ever is will condemn what may seem a sudden ebullition of temper but I ask is this amongst the catalogue of my weaknesses Am I of that clay which is always fissured when heated No You know me better you alone of all the world have the clew to a heart whose affections are all your own The few explanations of all that has happened must be reserved for our meeting Of course neither the newspapers nor the reviews have any conception of the truth Four words will set your heart at ease and these you must have I have done wisely with that assurance you have no more to fear I mean to leave this in all secrecy by the end of the week I shall go over to Brussels where you can address me under the name of Richard Bingham I shall only remain there to watch events for a day or two and thence on to Geneva I am quite charmed with your account of poor Lady G though as I read I can detect how all the fascinations you tell of were but reflected glories Your view of her situation is admirable and by your skilful tactique it is she herself that ostracizes the society that would only have accepted her on sufferance How true is your remark as to the great question at issue not her guilt or innocence but what danger might accrue to others from infractions that invite publicity The cabinet were discussing t other day a measure by which sales of estated property could be legalized without those tiresome and costly researches into title which in a country where confiscations were frequent became at last endless labor Don t you think that some such measure might be beneficially adopted as regards female character Could there not be invented a species of social guarantee which rejecting all investigation into bygones after a certain limit would confer a valid title that none might dispute Lawyers tell us that no man s property would stand the test of a search for title Are we quite certain how far the other sex are our betters in this respect and might it not be wise to interpose a limit beyond which research need not proceed I concur in all you say about G himself He was always looking for better security than he needed a great mistake whether the investment consist of our affections or our money Physicians say that if any man could only see the delicate anatomy on which his life depends and watch the play of those organs that sustain him he would not have courage to move a step or utter a loud word Might we not carry the analogy into morals and ask is it safe or prudent in us to investigate too deeply are we wise in dissecting motives or would it not be better to enjoy our moral as we do our material health without seeking to assure ourselves further Besides all this the untravelled Englishman and such was Glencore when he married never can be brought to understand the harmless levities of foreign life Like a fresh water sailor he always fancies the boat is going to upset and he throws himself out at the first jobble I own to you frankly I never knew the case in question how far she went is a secret to me I might have heard the whole story It required some address in me to escape it but I do detest these narrations where truth is marred by passion and all just inferences confused and confounded with vague and absurd suspicions Glencore s conduct throughout was little short of insanity like a man who hearing his banker is insecure takes refuge in insolvency he ruins himself to escape embarrassment They tell me here that the shock has completely deranged his intellect and that he lives a life of melancholy isolation in that old castle in Ireland How few men in this world can count the cost of their actions and make up that simple calculation How much shall I have to pay for it Take any view one pleases of the case would it not have been better for him to have remained in the world and of it Would not its pleasures even its cares have proved better distractions than his own brooding thoughts If a man have a secret ailment does he parade it in public Why then this exposure of a pain for which there is no sympathy Life after all is only a system of compensations Wish it to be whatever you please but accept it as it really is and make the best of it For my own part I have ever felt like one who having got a most disastrous account of a road he was about to travel is delightfully surprised to find the way better and the inns more comfortable than he looked for In the main men and women are very good our mistake is expecting to find people always in our own humor Now if one is very rich this is practical enough but the mass must be content to encounter disparity of mood and difference of taste at every step There is therefore some tact required in conforming to these irregularities and unhappily everybody has not got tact You charming Princess have tact but you have beauty wit fascination rank all that can grace high station and all that high station can reflect upon great natural gifts that you should see the world through a rose tinted medium is a very condition of your identity and there is truth as well as good philosophy in this view You have often told me that if people were not exactly all that strict moralists might wish yet that they made up a society very pleasant and livable withal and that there was also a floating capital of kindness and good feeling quite sufficient to trade upon and even grow richer by negotiating People who live out of the world or what comes to the same thing in a little world of their own are ever craving after perfectibility just as in time of peace nations only accept in their armies six foot grenadiers and gigantic dragoons Let the pressure of war or emergency arise however or in other words let there be the real business of life to be done then the standard is lowered at once and the battle is sought and won by very inferior agency Now show troops and show qualities are very much alike they are a measure of what would be very charming to arrive at were it only practicable Oh that poor Glencore had only learned this lesson instead of writing nonsense verses at Eton The murky domesticities of England have no correlatives in the sunny enjoyments of Italian life and John Bull has got a fancy that virtue is only cultivated where there are coal fires stuff curtains and a window tax Why then in the name of Doctors Commons does he marry a foreigner Just as Upton had written these words his servant presented him with a visiting card Lord Glencore exclaimed he aloud When was he here His Lordship is below stairs now sir He said he was sure you d see him Of course show him up at once Wait a moment give me that cane place those cushions for my feet draw the curtain and leave the aconite and ether drops near me that will do thank you Some minutes elapsed ere the door was opened the slow footfall of one ascending the stairs step by step was heard accompanied by the labored respiration of a man breathing heavily and then Lord Glencore entered his form worn and emaciated and his face pale and colorless With a feeble uncertain voice he said I knew you d see me Upton and I would n t go away And with this he sank into a chair and sighed deeply Of course my dear Glencore you knew it said the other feelingly for he was shocked by the wretched spectacle before him even were I more seriously indisposed than And were you really ill Upton asked Glencore with a weakly smile Can you ask the question Have you not seen the evening papers read the announcement on my door seen the troops of inquirers in the streets Yes sighed he wearily I have heard and seen all you say and yet I bethought me of a remark I once heard from the Duke of Orleans Monsieur Upton is a most active minister when his health permits and when it does not he is the most mischievous intriguant in Europe He was always straining at an antithesis he fancied he could talk like saint Simon and it really spoiled a very pleasant converser And so you have been very ill said Glencore slowly and as though he had not heeded the last remark so have I also You seem to me too feeble to be about Glencore said Upton kindly I am so if it were of any consequence I mean if my life could interest or benefit any one My head however will bear solitude no longer I must have some one to talk to I mean to travel I will leave this in a day or so Come along with me then my plan is to make for Brussels but it must not be spoken of as I want to watch events there before I remove farther from England So it is all true then you have resigned said Glencore Perfectly true What a strange step to take I remember more than twenty years ago your telling me that you d rather be Foreign Secretary of England than the monarch of any third rate Continental kingdom I thought so then and what is more singular I think so still And you throw it up at the very moment people are proclaiming your success You shall hear all my reasons Glencore for this resolution and will I feel assured approve of them but they d only weary you now Let me know them now Upton it is such a relief to me when even by a momentary interest in anything I am able to withdraw this poor tired brain from its own distressing thoughts He spoke these words not only with strong feeling but even imparted to them a tone of entreaty so that Upton could not but comply When I wished for the Secretaryship my dear Glencore said he I fancied the office as it used to be in olden times when one played the great game of diplomacy with kings and ministers for antagonists and the world at large for spectators when consummate skill and perfect secrecy were objects of moment and when grand combinations rewarded one s labor with all the certainty of a mathematical problem Every move on the board could be calculated beforehand no disturbing influences could derange plans that never were divulged till they were accomplished All that is past and gone our Constitution grown every day more and more democratic rules by the House of Commons Questions whose treatment demands all the skill of a statesman and all the address of a man of the world come to be discussed in open Parliament correspondence is called for despatches and even private notes are produced and while the State you are opposed to revels in the security of secrecy your whole game is revealed to the world in the shape of a blue book Nor is this all the debaters on these nice and intricate questions involving the most far reaching speculation of statesmanship are men of trade and enterprise who view every international difficulty only in its relation to their peculiar interests National greatness honor and security are nothing the maintenance of that equipoise which preserves peace is nothing the nice management which by the exhibition of courtesy here or of force there is nothing compared to alliances that secure us ample supplies of raw material and abundant markets for manufactures Diplomacy has come to this But you must have known all this before you accepted office you had seen where the course of events led to and were aware that the House ruled the country Perhaps I did not recognize the fact to its full extent Perhaps I fancied I could succeed in modifying the system said Upton cautiously A hopeless undertaking said Glencore I m not quite so certain of that said Upton pausing for a while as he seemed to reflect When he resumed it was in a lighter and more flippant tone To make short of it I saw that I could not keep office on these conditions but I did not choose to go out as a beaten man For my pride s sake I desired that my reasons should be reserved for myself alone for my actual benefit it was necessary that I should have a hold over my colleagues in office These two conditions were rather difficult to combine but I accomplished them I had interested the King so much in my views as to what the Foreign Office ought to be that an interchange of letters took place and his Majesty imparted to me his fullest confidence in disparagement of the present system This correspondence was a perfect secret to the whole Cabinet but when it had arrived at a most confidential crisis I suggested to the King that Cloudeslie should be consulted I knew well that this would set the match to the train No sooner did Cloudeslie learn that such a correspondence had been carried on for months without his knowledge views stated plans promulgated and the King s pleasure taken on questions not one of which should have been broached without his approval and concurrence than he declared he would not hold the seals of office another hour The King well knowing his temper and aware what a terrific exposure might come of it sent for me and asked what was to be done I immediately suggested my own resignation as a sacrifice to the difficulty and to the wounded feelings of the Duke Thus did I achieve what I sought for I imposed a heavy obligation on the King and the Premier and I have secured secrecy as to my motives which none will ever betray I only remained for the debate of the other night for I wanted a little public enthusiasm to mark the fall of the curtain So that you still hold them as your debtors asked Glencore Without doubt I do my claim is a heavy one And what would satisfy it If my health would stand England said Upton leisurely I d take a peerage but as this murky atmosphere would suffocate me and as I don t care for the latter without the political privileges I have determined to have the Garter The Garter a blue ribbon exclaimed Glencore as though the insufferable coolness with which the pretension was announced might justify any show of astonishment Yes I had some thoughts of India but the journey deters me in fact as I have enough to live on I d rather devote the remainder of my days to rest and the care of this shattered constitution It is impossible to convey to the reader the tender and affectionate compassion with which Sir Horace seemed to address these last words to himself Do you ever look upon yourself as the luckiest fellow in Europe Upton asked Glencore No sighed he I occasionally fancy I have been hardly dealt with by fortune I have only to throw my eyes around me and see a score of men richer and more elevated than myself not one of whom has capacity for even a third rate task so that really the self congratulation you speak of has not occurred to me But after all you have had a most successful career Look at the matter this way Glencore there are about six say six men in all Europe who have a little more common sense than all the rest of the world I could tell you the names of five of them If there was a supreme boastfulness in the speech the modest delivery of it completely mystified the hearer and he sat gazing with wonderment at the man before him CHAPTER XLV SOME SAD REVERIES Have you any plans Glencore asked Upton as they posted along towards Dover None was the brief reply Nor any destination you desire to reach Just as little Such a state as yours then I take it is about the best thing going in life Every move one makes is attended with so many adverse considerations every goal so separated from us by unforeseen difficulties that an existence even without what is called an object has certain great advantages I am curious to hear them said the other half cynically For myself said Upton not accepting the challenge the brief intervals of comparative happiness I have enjoyed have been in periods when complete repose almost torpor has surrounded me and when the mere existence of the day has engaged my thoughts What became of memory all this while Memory said Upton laughing I hold my memory in proper subjection It no more dares obtrude upon me uncalled for than would my valet come into my room till I ring for him Of the slavery men endure from their own faculties I have no experience And of course no sympathy for them I will not say that I cannot compassionate sufferings though I have not felt them Are you quite sure of that asked Glencore almost sternly is not your very pity a kind of contemptuous sentiment towards those who sorrow without reason the strong man s estimate of the weak man s sufferings Believe me there is no true condolence where there is not the same experience of woe I should be sorry to lay down so narrow a limit to fellow feeling said Upton You told me a few moments back said Glencore that your memory was your slave How then can you feel for one like me whose memory is his master How understand a path that never wanders out of the shadow of the past There was such an accent of sorrow impressed upon these words that Upton did not desire to prolong a discussion so painful and thus for the remainder of the way little was interchanged between them They crossed the strait by night and as Upton stole upon deck after dusk he found Glencore seated near the wheel gazing intently at the lights on shore from which they were fast receding I am taking my last look at England Upton said he affecting a tone of easy indifference You surely mean to go back again one of these days said Upton Never never said he solemnly I have made all my arrangements for the future every disposition regarding my property I have neglected nothing so far as I know of those claims which in the shape of relationship the world has such reverence for and now I bethink me of myself I shall have to consult you however about this boy said he faltering in the words The objection I once entertained to his bearing my name exists no longer he may call himself Massy if he will The chances are added he in a lower and more feeling voice that he rejects a name that will only remind him of a wrong My dear Glencore said Upton with real tenderness do I apprehend you aright Are you at last convinced that you have been unjust Has the moment come in which your better judgment rises above the evil counsels of prejudice and passion Do you mean am I assured of her innocence broke in Glencore wildly Do you imagine if I were so that I could withhold my hand from taking a life so infamous and dishonored as mine The world would have no parallel for such a wretch Mark me Upton cried he fiercely there is no torture I have yet endured would equal the bare possibility of what you hint at Good Heavens Glencore do not let me suppose that selfishness has so marred and disfigured your nature that this is true Bethink you of what you say Would it not be the crowning glory of your life to repair a dreadful wrong and acknowledge before the world that the fame you had aspersed was without stain or spot And with what grace should I ask the world to believe me Is it when expiating the shame of a falsehood that I should call upon men to accept me as truthful Have I not proclaimed her from one end of Europe to the other dishonored If she be absolved what becomes of me This is unworthy of you Glencore said Upton severely nor if illness and long suffering had not impaired your judgment had you ever spoken such words I say once more that if the day came that you could declare to the world that her fame had no other reproach than the injustice of your own unfounded jealousy that day would be the best and the proudest of your life The proud day that published me a calumniator of all that I was most pledged to defend the deliberate liar against the obligation of the holiest of all contracts You forget Upton but I do not forget that it was by this very argument you once tried to dissuade me from my act of vengeance You told me ay in words that still ring in my ears to remember that if by any accident or chance her innocence might be proven I could never avail myself of the indication without first declaring my own unworthiness to profit by it that if the Wife stood forth in all the pride of purity the Husband would be a scoff and a shame throughout the world When I said so said Upton it was to turn you from a path that could not but lead to ruin I endeavored to deter you by an appeal that interested even your selfishness Your subtlety has outwitted itself Upton said Glencore with a bitter irony it is not the first instance on record where blank cartridge has proved fatal One thing is perfectly clear said Upton boldly the man who shrinks from the repair of a wrong he has done on the consideration of how it would affect himself and his own interests shows that he cares more for the outward show of honor than its real and sustaining power And will you tell me Upton that the world s estimate of a man s fame is not essential to his self esteem or that there yet lived one who would brave obloquy without by the force of something within him This I will tell you replied Upton that he who balances between the two is scarcely an honest man and that he who accepts the show for the substance is not a wise one These are marvellous sentiments to hear from one whose craft has risen to a proverb and whose address in life is believed to be not his meanest gift I accept the irony in all good humor I go farther Glencore I stoop to explain When any one in the great and eventful journey of life seeks to guide himself safely he has to weigh all the considerations and calculate all the combinations adverse to him The straight road is rarely or never possible even if events were which they are not easy to read they must be taken in combination with others and with their consequences The path of action becomes necessarily devious and winding and compromises are called for at every step It is not in the moment of shipwreck that a man stops to inquire into petty details of the articles he throws into a long boat he is bent on saving himself as best he can He seizes what is next to him if it suit his purpose Now were he to act in this manner in all the quiet security of his life on shore his conduct would be highly blamable No emergency would warrant his taking what belonged to another no critical moment would drive him to the instinct of self preservation Just the same is the interval between action and reflection Give me time and forethought and I will employ something better and higher than craft My subtlety as you like to call it is not my best weapon I only use it in emergency I read the matter differently said Glencore sulkily I could perhaps offer another explanation of your practice Pray let me hear it we are all in confidence here and I promise you I will not take badly whatever you say to me Glencore sat silent and motionless Come shall I say it for you Glencore for I think I know what is passing in your mind The other nodded and he went on You would tell me in plain words that I keep my craft for myself my high principle for my friends Glencore only smiled but Upton continued So then I have guessed aright and the very worst you can allege against this course is that what I bestow is better than what I retain One of Solomon s proverbs may be better than a shilling but which would a hungry man rather have I want no word fencing Upton still less do I seek what might sow distrust between us This much however has life taught me the great trials of this world are like its great maladies Providence has meant them to be fatal We call in the doctor in the one case or the counsellor in the other out of habit rather than out of hope Our own consciousness has already whispered that nothing can be of use but we like to do as our neighbors and so we take remedies and follow injunctions to the last The wise man quickly detects by the character of the means how emergent is the case believed to be and rightly judges that recourse to violent measures implies the presence of great peril If he be really wise then he desists at once from what can only torture his few remaining hours They can be given to better things than the agonies of such agency To this exact point has my case come and by the counsels you have given me do I read my danger Your only remedy is as bad as the malady it is meant to cure I cannot take it Accepting your own imagery I would say said Upton that you are one who will not submit to an operation of some pain that he might be cured Glencore sat moodily for some moments without speaking at last he said I feel as though continual change of place and scene would be a relief to me Let us rendezvous therefore somewhere for the autumn and meanwhile I ll wander about alone What direction do you purpose to take The Schwarzwald and the Hohlenthal first I want to revisit a place I knew in happier days Memory must surely have something besides sorrows to render us I owned a little cottage there once near Steig I fished and read Uhland for a summer long I wonder if I could resume the same life I knew the whole village the blacksmith the schoolmaster the Dorfrichter all of them Good kind souls they were how they wept when we parted Nothing consoled them but my having purchased the cottage and promised to come back again Upton was glad to accept even this much of interest in the events of life and drew Glencore on to talk of the days he had passed in this solitary region As in the dreariest landscape a ray of sunlight will reveal some beautiful effects making the eddies of the dark pool to glitter lighting up the russet moss and giving to the half dried lichen a tinge of bright color so will occasionally memory throw over a life of sorrow a gleam of happier meaning Faces and events forms and accents that once found the way to our hearts come back again faintly and imperfectly it may be but with a touch that revives in us what we once were It is the one sole feature in which self love becomes amiable when looking back on our past we cherish the thought of a time before the world had made us sceptical and hard hearted Glencore warmed as he told of that tranquil period when poetry gave a color to his life and the wild conceptions of genius ran like a thread of gold through the whole web of existence He quoted passages that had struck him for their beauty or their truthfulness he told how he had tried to allure his own mind to the tone that vibrated in the magic music of verse and how the very attempt had inspired him with gentler thoughts a softer charity and a more tender benevolence towards his fellows Tieck is right Upton when he says there are two natures in us distinct and apart one the imaginative and ideal the other the actual and the sensual Many shake them together and confound them making of the incongruous mixture that vile compound of inconsistency where the beautiful and the true are ever warring with the deformed and the false their lives a long struggle with themselves a perpetual contest between high hope and base enjoyment A few keep them apart retaining through their worldliness some hallowed spot in the heart where ignoble desires and mean aspirations have never dared to come A fewer still have made the active work of life subordinate to the guiding spirit of purity adventuring on no road unsanctioned by high and holy thoughts caring for no ambitions but such as make us nobler and better I once had a thought of such a life and even the memory of it like the prayers we have learned in our childhood has a hallowing influence over after years If that poor boy Upton and his lips trembled on the words if that poor boy could have been brought up thus humbly If he had been taught to know no more than an existence of such simplicity called for what a load of care might it have spared his heart and mine You have read over those letters I gave you about him asked Upton who eagerly availed himself of the opportunity to approach an almost forbidden theme I have read them over and over said Glencore sadly in all the mention of him I read the faults of my own nature a stubborn spirit of pride that hardens as much as elevates a resentful temper too prone to give way to its own impulses an over confidence in himself too always ready to revenge its defeats on the world about him These are his defects and they are mine Poor fellow that he should inherit all that I have of bad and yet not be heir to the accidents of fortune which make others so lenient to faults If Upton heard these words with much interest no less was he struck by the fact that Glencore made no inquiry whatever as to the youth s fate The last letter of the packet revealed the story of an eventful duel and the boy s escape from Massa by night with his subsequent arrest by the police and yet in the face of incidents like these he continued to speculate on traits of mind and character nor even adverted to the more closely touching events of his fate By many an artful hint and ingenious device did Sir Horace try to tempt him to some show of curiosity but all were fruitless Glencore would talk freely and willingly of the boy s disposition and his capacity he would even speculate on the successes and failures such a temperament might meet with in life but still he spoke as men might speak of a character in a fiction ingeniously weighing casualties and discussing chances never even by accident approaching the actual story of his life or seeming to attach any interest to his destiny Upton s shrewd intelligence quickly told him that this reserve was not accidental and he deliberated within himself how far it was safe to invade it At length he resumed the attempt by adroitly alluding to the spirited resistance the boy had made to his capture and the consequences one might naturally enough ascribe to a proud and high hearted youth thus tyrannically punished I have heard something said Upton of the severities practised at Kuffstein and they recall the horrible tales of the Inquisition the terrible contrivances to extort confessions expedients that often break down the intellect whose secrets they would discover so that one actually shudders at the name of a spot so associated with evil Glencore placed his hands over his face but did not utter a word and again Upton went on urging by every device he could think of some indication that might mean interest if not anxiety when suddenly he felt Glencore s hand grasp his arm with violence No more of this Upton cried he sternly you do not know the torture you are giving me There was a long and painful pause between them at the end of which Glencore spoke but it was in a voice scarcely above a whisper and every accent of which trembled with emotion You remember one sad and memorable night Upton in that old castle in Ireland the night when I came to the resolution of this vengeance I sent for the boy to my room we were alone there together face to face It was such a scene as could brook no witness nor dare I now recall its details as they occurred He came in frankly and boldly as he felt he had a right to do How he left that room cowed abashed and degraded I have yet before me Our meeting did not exceed many minutes in duration neither of us could have endured it longer Brief as it was we ratified a compact between us it was this neither was ever to question or inquire after the other as no tie should unite no interest should bind us Had you seen him then Upton cried Glencore wildly the proud disdain with which he listened to my attempts at excuse the haughty distance with which he seemed to reject every thought of complaint the stern coldness with which he heard me plan out his future you would have said that some curse had fallen upon my heart or it could never have been dead to traits which proclaimed him to be my own In that moment it was my lot to be like him who held out his own right hand to be first burned ere he gave his body to the flames We parted without an embrace not even a farewell was spoken between us While I gloried in his pride had he but yielded ever so little had one syllable of weakness one tear escaped him I had given up my project reversed all my planned vengeance and taken him to my heart as my own But no He was resolved on proving by his nature that he was of that stern race from which by a falsehood I was about to exclude him It was as though my own blood hurled a proud defiance to me As he walked slowly to the door his glove fell from his hand I stealthily caught it up I wanted to keep it as a memorial of that bitter hour but he turned hastily around and plucked it from my hand The action was even a rude one and with a mocking smile as though he read my meaning and despised it he departed You now have heard the last secret of my heart in this sad history Let us speak of it no more And with this Glencore arose and left the deck CHAPTER XLVI THE FLOOD IN THE MAGRA When it rains in Italy it does so with a passionate ardor that bespeaks an unusual pleasure It is no soft dissolving in tears but a perfect outburst of woe wailing in accents the very wildest and deluging the land in torrents Mountain streams that were rivulets in the morning before noon arrives are great rivers swollen and turbid carrying away massive rocks from their foundations and tearing up large trees by the roots The dried up stony bed you have crossed a couple of hours back with unwetted feet is now the course of a stream that would defy the boldest These sudden changes are remarkably frequent along that beautiful tract between Nice and Massa and which is known as the Riviera di Levante The rivers fed from innumerable streams that pour down from the Apennines are almost instantaneously swollen and as their bed continually slopes towards the sea the course of the waters is one of headlong velocity Of these the most dangerous by far is the Magra The river which even in dry seasons is a considerable stream becomes when fed by its tributaries a very formidable body of water stretching full a mile in width and occasionally spreading a vast sheet of foam close to the very outskirts of Sarzana The passage of the river is all the more dangerous at these periods as it approaches the sea and more than one instance is recorded where the stout raft devoted to the use of travellers has been carried away to the ocean Where the great post road from Genoa to the South passes a miserable shealing stands half hidden in tall osiers and surrounded with a sedgy swampy soil the foot sinks in at every step This is the shelter of the boatmen who navigate the raft and who in relays by day and night are in waiting for the service of travellers In the dreary days of winter or in the drearier nights it is scarcely possible to imagine a more hopeless spot deep in the midst of a low marshy tract the especial home of tertian fever with the wild stream roaring at the very door sill and the thunder of the angry ocean near it is indeed all that one can picture of desolation and wretchedness Nor do the living features of the scene relieve its gloomy influence Though strong men and many of them in the prime of life premature age and decay seem to have settled down upon them Their lustreless eyes and leaden lips tell of ague and their sad thoughtful faces bespeak those who are often called upon to meet peril and who are destined to lives of emergency and hazard It was in the low and miserable hut we speak of just as night set in of a raw November that four of these raftsmen sat at their smoky fire in company with two travellers on foot whose humble means compelled them to await the arrival of some one rich enough to hire the raft Meanly clad and wayworn were the strangers who now sat endeavoring to dry their dripping clothes at the blaze and conversing in a low tone together If the elder dressed in a russet colored blouse and a broad leafed hat his face almost hid in beard and moustaches seemed by his short and almost grotesque figure a travelling showman the appearance of the younger despite all the poverty of his dress implied a very different class He was tall and well knit with a loose activity in all his gestures which almost invariably characterizes the Englishman and though his dark hair and his bronzed cheek gave him something of a foreign look there was a calm cold self possession in his air that denoted the Anglo Saxon He sat smoking his cigar his head resting on one hand and evidently listening with attention to the words of his companion The conversation that passed will save us the trouble of introducing them to our reader if he have not already guessed them If we don t wait said the elder till somebody richer and better off than ourselves comes we ll have to pay seven francs for passin in such a night as this It is a downright robbery to ask so much cried the other angrily What so great danger is there or what so great hardship after all There is both one and the other I believe replied he in a tone evidently meant to moderate his passion and just look at the poor craytures that has to do it They re as weak as a bit of wet paper they haven t strength to make themselves heard when they talk out there beside the river The fellow yonder said the youth has got good brawny arms and sinewy legs of his own Ay and he is starved after all A cut of rye bread and an onion won t keep the heart up nor a jug of red vinegar though ye call it grape juice On my conscience I m thinkin that the only people that preserves their strength upon nothin is the Irish I used to carry the bags over Slieb na boregan mountain and the Turk s Causeway on wet potatoes and buttermilk and never a day late for eleven years What a life cried the youth in an accent of utter pity Faix it was an elegant life that is when the weather was anyways good With a bright sun shinin and a fine fresh breeze blowin the white clouds away over the Atlantic my road was a right cheery one and I went along inventin stories sometimes fairy tales sometimes makin rhymes to myself but always happy and contented There wasn t a bit of the way I had n t a name for in my own mind either some place I read about or some scene in a story of my own but better than all there was a dog a poor starved lurcher he was with a bit of the tail cut off he used to meet me as regular as the clock on the side of Currah na geelah and come beside me down to the ford every day in the year No temptation nor flattery would bring him a step farther I spent three quarters of an hour once trying it but to no good he took leave of me on the bank of the river and went away back with his head down as if he was grievin over something Was n t that mighty curious Perhaps like ourselves Billy he wasn t quite sure of his passport said the other dryly Faix may be so replied he with perfect seriousness My notion was that he was a kind of an outlaw a chap that maybe bit a child of the family or ate a lamb of a flock given him to guard But indeed his general appearance and behavior was n t like that he had good manners and starved as he was he never snapped the bread out of my fingers but took it gently though his eyes was dartin out of his head with eagerness all the while A great test of good breeding truly said the youth sadly It must be more than a mere varnish when it stands the hard rubs of life in this wise Tis the very notion occurred to myself It was the dhrop of good blood in him made him what he was Stealthy and fleeting as was the look that accompanied these words the youth saw it and blushed to the very top of his forehead The night grows milder said he to relieve the awkwardness of the moment by any remark It s a mighty grand sight out there now replied the other there s three miles if there s an inch of white foam dashing down to the sea that breaks over the bar with a crash like thunder big trees are sweepin past and pieces of vine trellises and a bit of a mill wheel all carried off just like twigs on a stream Would money tempt those fellows I wonder to venture out on such a night as this To be sure and why not The daily fight poverty maintains with existence dulls the sense of every danger but what comes of want Don t I know it myself The poor man has no inimy but hunger for ye see the other vexations and troubles of life there s always a way of gettin round them You can chate even grief and you can slip away from danger but there s no circumventin an empty stomach What a tyrant is then your rich man sighed the youth heavily That he is Dives honoratus Pulcher rex denique regum You may do as you please if ye r rich as a Begum A free translation rather Billy said the other laughing Or ye might render it this way said Billy If ye ve money enough and to spare in the bank The world will give ye both beauty and rank And I ve nothing to say agin it continued he The raal stimulus to industhry in life is to make wealth powerful Gettin and heapin up money for money s sake is a debasin kind of thing but makin a fortune in order that you may extind your influence and mowld the distinies of others that s grand And see what comes of it cried the youth bitterly Mark the base and unworthy subserviency it leads to see the race of sycophants it begets I have you there too cried Billy with all the exultation of a ready debater Them dirty varmint ye speak of is the very test of the truth I m tellin ye T is because they won t labor because they won t work that they are driven to acts of sycophancy and meanness The spirit of industhry saves a man even the excuse of doin anything low And how often from your own lips have I listened to praises at your poor humble condition rejoicings that your lot in life secured you against the cares of wealth and grandeur And you will again plaze God if I live and you pre sarve your hearin What would I be if I was rich but an ould an ould voluptuary said Billy with great emphasis on a word he had some trouble in discovering Atin myself sick with delicacies and drinkin cordials all day long How would I know the uses of wealth Like all other vulgar creatures I d be buyin with my money the respect that I ought to be buyin with my qualities It s the very same thing you see in a fair or a market the country girls goin about hobbled and crippled with shoes on that if they had bare feet could walk as straight as a rush Poverty is not ungraceful itself It s tryin to be what isn t natural spoils people entirely I think I hear voices without Listen cried the youth It s only the river it s risin every minute No that was a shout I heard it distinctly Ay the boatmen hear it now It is a travelling carriage I see the lamps cried one of the men as he stood at the door and looked landward They may as well keep the road there s no crossing the Magra to night By this time the postilions whips commenced that chorus of cracking by which they are accustomed to announce all arrivals of importance Tell them to go back Beppo said the chief of the raftsmen to one of his party If we might try to cross with the mail bags in a boat there s not one of us would attempt the passage on the raft To judge from the increased noise and uproar the travellers impatience had now reached its highest point but to this a slight lull succeeded probably occasioned by the parley with the boatman They ll give us five Napoleons for the job said Beppo entering and addressing his Chief Per Dio that won t support our families if we leave them fatherless muttered the other Who and what are they that can t wait till morning Who knows said Beppo with a genuine shrug of native indifference Princes belike Princes or beggars we all have lives to save mumbled out an old man as he reseated himself by the fire Meanwhile the courier had entered the hut and was in earnest negotiation with the chief who however showed no disposition to run the hazard of the attempt Are you all cowards alike said the courier in all the insolence of his privileged order or is it a young fellow of your stamp that shrinks from the risk of a wet jacket This speech was addressed to the youth whom he had mistaken for one of the raftsmen Keep your coarse speeches for those who will bear them my good fellow said the other boldly or mayhap the first wet jacket here will be one with gold lace on the collar He s not one of us he s a traveller quickly interposed the chief who saw that an angry scene was brewing He s only waiting to cross the river muttered he in a whisper when some one comes rich enough to hire the raft Sacre bleu Then he shan t come with us that I ll promise him said the courier whose offended dignity roused all his ire Now once for all my men will you earn a dozen Napoleons or not Here they are for you if you land us safely at the other side and never were you so well paid in your lives for an hour s labor The sight of the gold as it glistened temptingly in his outstretched hand appealed to their hearts far more eloquently than all his words and they gathered in a group together to hold counsel And you are you also a distinguished stranger said the courier addressing Billy who sat warming his hands by the embers of the fire Look you my man cried the youth all the gold in your master s leathern bag there can give you no claim to insult those who have offered you no offence It is enough that you know that we do not belong to the raft to suffer us to escape your notice Sacristi exclaimed the courier in a tone of insolent mockery I have travelled the road long enough to learn that one does not need an introduction before addressing a vagabond Illustration four hundred two Vagabond cried the youth furiously and he sprang at the other with the bound of a tiger The courier quickly parried the blow aimed at him and closely grappled they both now reeled out of the hut in terrible conflict With that terror of the knife that figures in all Italian quarrels the boatmen did not dare to interfere but looked on as wrestling with all their might the combatants struggled each endeavoring to push the other towards the stream Billy too restrained by force could not come to the rescue and could only by words screamed out in all the wildness of his agony encourage his companion Drop on your knee catch him by the legs throw him back back into the stream That s it that s it Good luck to ye shouted he madly as he fought like a lion with those about him Slipping in the slimy soil they had both now come to their knees and after a struggle of some minutes duration rolled clasped in each other s fierce embrace down the slope into the river A plash and a cry half smothered were heard and all was over While some threw themselves on the frantic creature whose agony now overtopped his reason and who fought to get free with the furious rage of despair others seizing lanterns and torches hurried along the bank of the torrent to try and rescue the combatants A sudden winding of the river at the place gave little hope to the search and it was all but certain that the current must already have swept them down far beyond any chance of succor Assisted by the servants of the traveller who speedily were apprised of the disaster the search was continued for hours and morning at length began to break over the dreary scene without one ray of hope By the gray cold dawn the yellow flood could be seen for a considerable distance and the banks too over which a gauzy mist was hanging but not a living thing was there The wild torrent swept along his murky course with a deep monotonous roar Trunks of trees and leafy branches rose and sank in the wavy flood but nothing suggested the vaguest hope that either had escaped The traveller s carriage returned to Spezia and Billy now bereft of reason was conveyed to the same place fast tied with cords to restrain him from a violence that threatened his own life and that of any near him In the evening of that day a peasant s car arrived at Spezia conveying the almost lifeless courier who had been found on the river s bank near the mouth of the Magra How he had reached the spot or what had become of his antagonist he knew not Indeed the fever which soon set in placed him beyond the limit of all questioning and his incoherent cries and ravings only betrayed the terrible agonies his mind must have passed through If this tragic incident heightened by the actual presence of two of the actors one all but dead the other dying engaged the entire interest and sympathy of the little town the authorities were actively employed in investigating the event and ascertaining so far as they could to which side the chief blame inclined The raftsmen had all been arrested and were examined carefully one by one and now it only remained to obtain from the traveller himself whatever information he could contribute to throw light on the affair His passport showing that he was an English peer obtained for him all the deference and respect foreign officials are accustomed to render to that title and the Prefect announced that if it suited his convenience he would wait on his Lordship at his hotel to receive his deposition I have nothing to depose no information to give was the dry and not over courteous response but as the visit it was intimated was indispensable he named his hour to admit him The bland and polite tone of the Prefect was met by a manner of cold but well bred ease which seemed to imply that the traveller only regarded the incident in the light of an unpleasant interruption to his journey but in which he took no other interest Even the hints thrown out that he ought to consider himself aggrieved and his dignity insulted produced no effect upon him It was my intention to have halted a few days at Massa and I could have obtained another courier in the interval was the cool commentary he bestowed on the incident But your Lordship would surely desire investigation A man is missing a great crime may have been committed Excuse my interrupting but as I am not nor can be supposed to be the criminal nor do I feel myself the victim while I have not a claim to the character of witness you would only harass me with interrogatories I could not answer and excite me to take interest or at least bestow attention on what cannot concern me Yet there are circumstances in this case which give it the character of a preconcerted plan said the Prefect thoughtfully Perhaps so said the other in a tone of utter indifference Certainly the companion of the man who is missing and of whom no clew can be discovered is reported to have uttered your name repeatedly in his ravings My name how so cried the stranger hurriedly Yes my Lord the name of your passport Lord Glen core Two of those I have placed to watch beside his bed have repeated the same story and told how he has never ceased to mutter the name to himself in his wanderings Is this a mere fancy said the stranger over whose sickly features a flush now mantled Can I see him Of course He is in the hospital and too ill to be removed but if you will visit him there I will accompany you It was only when a call was made upon Lord Glencore for some bodily exertion that his extreme debility became apparent Seated at ease in a chair his manner seemed merely that of natural coolness and apathy he spoke as one who would not suffer his nature to be ruffled by any avoidable annoyance but now as he arose from his seat and endeavored to walk one side betrayed unmistakable signs of palsy and his general frame exhibited the last stage of weakness You see sir that the exertion costs its price said he with a sad sickly smile I am the wreck of what once was a man noted for his strength The other muttered some words of comfort and compassion and they descended the stairs together I do not know this man said Lord Glencore as he gazed on the flushed and fevered face of the sick man whose ill trimmed and shaggy beard gave additional wild ness to his look I have never to my knowledge seen him before The accents of the speaker appeared to have suddenly struck some chord in the sufferer s intelligence for he struggled for an instant and then raising himself on his elbow stared fixedly at him Not know me cried he in English t is because sorrow and sickness has changed me then Who are you Tell me your name said Glencore eagerly I m Billy Traynor my Lord the one you remember the doctor And my boy screamed Glencore wildly The sick man threw up both his arms in the air and fell backward with a cry of despair while Glencore tottering for an instant sank with a low groan and fell senseless on the ground CHAPTER XLVII A FRAGMENT OF A LETTER Long before Lord Glencore had begun to rally from an attack which had revived all the symptoms of his former illness Billy Traynor had perfectly recovered and was assiduously occupied in attending him Almost the first tidings which Glencore could comprehend assured him that the boy was safe and living at Massa under the protection of the Chevalier Stubber and waiting eagerly for Billy to join him A brief extract from one of the youth s letters to his warm hearted follower will suffice to show how he himself regarded the incident which befell and the fortune that lay before him It was a long swim of a dark night too Master Billy and whenever the arm of a tree would jostle me as it floated past I felt as though that blessed courier was again upon me and turned to give fight at once If it were not that the river took a sudden bend as it nears the sea I must infallibly have been carried out but I found myself quite suddenly in slack water and very soon after it shallowed so much that I could walk ashore The thought of what became of my adversary weighed more heavily on me when I touched land indeed while my own chances of escape were few I took his fate easily enough With all its dangers it was a glorious time as hurrying downward in the torrent through the dark night the thunder growling overhead the breakers battering away on the bar I was the only living thing there to confront that peril What an emblem of my own fate in everything A headlong course an unknown ending darkness utter and day less darkness around me and not one single soul to say Courage There is something splendidly exciting in the notion of having felt thoughts that others have never felt of having set footsteps in that un tracked sand where no traveller has ever ventured This impression never left me as I buffeted the murky waves and struck out boldly through the surfy stream Nay more it will never leave me while I live I have now proved myself to my own heart I have been and for a considerable time too face to face with death I have regarded my fate as certain and yet have I not quailed in spirit or flinched in coolness No Billy I reviewed every step of my strange and wayward life I bethought me of my childhood with all its ambitious longings and my boyish days as sorrow first broke upon me and I felt that there was a fitness in this darksome and mysterious ending to a life that touched on no other existence For am I not as much alone in the great world as when I swam there in the yellow flood of the Magra As the booming breakers of the sea met my ear and I saw that I was nearing the wide ocean I felt as might a soldier when charging an enemy s battery at speed I was wildly mad with impatience to get forward and shouted till my voice rang out above the din around me How the mad cheer echoed in my own heart It was the trumpet call of victory Was it reaction from all this excitement the depression that follows past danger that made me feel low and miserable afterwards I know I walked along towards Lavenza in listlessness and when a gendarme stopped to question me and asked for my passport I had not even energy to tell him how I came there Even the intense desire to see that spot once more to walk that garden and sit upon that terrace all had left me it was as though the waves had drowned the spirit and left the limbs to move unguided He led me beside the walls of the villa by the little wicket itself and still I felt no touch of feeling no memory came back on me I was indifferent to all and yet you know how many a weary mile I have come just to see them once more to revisit a spot where the only day dream of my life lingered and where I gave way to the promptings of a hope that have not often warmed this sad heart What a sluggish swamp has this nature of mine become when it needs a hurricane of passion to stir it Here I am living breathing walking and sleeping but without one sentiment that attaches me to existence and yet do I feel as though whatever endangered life or jeoparded fame would call me up to an effort and make me of some value to myself I went yesterday to see my old studio sorry things were those strivings of mine false endeavors to realize conceptions that must have some other interpreter than marble Forms are but weak appeals words are coarse ones music alone my dear friend is the true voice of the heart s meanings How a little melody that a peasant girl was singing last night touched me It was one that she used to warble humming as we walked like some stray waif thrown up by memory on the waste of life So then at last I feel I am not a sculptor still as little with all your teaching am I a scholar The world of active life offers to me none of its seductions I only recognize what there is in it of vulgar contention and low rivalry I cannot be any of the hundred things by which men eke out subsistence and yet I long for the independence of being the arbiter of my own daily life What is to become of me Say dearest best of friends say but the word and let me try to obey you What of our old plans of savagery The fascinations of civilized habits have made no stronger hold upon me since we relinquished that grand idea Neither you nor I assuredly have any places assigned us at the feast of this old world life none have bidden us to it nor have we even the fitting garments to grace it There are moments however one of them is on me while I write wherein I should like to storm that strong citadel of social exclusion and test its strength Who are they who garrison it Are they better and wiser and purer than their fellows Are they lifted by the accidents of fortune above the casualties and infirmities of nature and are they more gentle minded more kindly hearted and more forgiving than others This I should wish to know and learn for myself Would they admit us for the nonce to see and judge them let the Bastard and the Beggar sit down at their board and make brotherhood with them I trow not Billy They would hand us over to the police And my friend the courier was not so far astray when he called us vagabonds If I were free I should of course be with you but I am under a kind of mild bondage here of which I don t clearly comprehend the meaning The chief minister has taken me in some fashion under his protection and I am given to understand that no ill is intended me and indeed so far as treatment and moderate liberty are concerned I have every reason to be satisfied Still is there something deeply wounding in all this mysterious consideration It whispers to me of an interest in me on the part of those who are ashamed to avow it of kind feelings held in check by self esteem Good Heavens what have I done that this humiliation should be my portion There is no need of any subtlety to teach me what I am and what the world insists I must remain There is no ambition I dare to strive for no affection my heart may cherish no honorable contest I may engage in but that the utterance of one fatal word may not bar the gate against my entrance and send me back in shame and confusion Had I of myself incurred this penalty there would be in me that stubborn sense of resistance that occurs to every one who counts the gain and loss of all his actions but I have not done so In the work of my own degradation I am blameless I have just been told that a certain Princess de Sabloukoff is to arrive here this evening and that I am to wait upon her immediately Good Heavens can she be The thought has just struck me and my head is already wandering at the bare notion of it How I pray that this may not be so my own shame is enough and more than I can bear but to witness that of I Can you tell me nothing of this But even if you can the tidings will come too late I shall have already seen her I am unable to write more now my brain is burning and my hand trembles so that I cannot trace the letters Adieu till this evening Midnight I was all in error dear friend I have seen her for the last two hours we have conversed together and my suspicion had no foundation She evidently knows all my history and almost gives me to believe that one day or other I may stand free of this terrible shame that oppresses me If this were possible what vengeance would be enough to wreak on those who have thus practised on me Can you imagine any vendetta that would pay off the heart corroding misery that has made my youth like a sorrowful old age dried up hope within me made my ambition to be a snare and my love a mere mockery I could spend a life in the search after this revenge and think it all too short to exhaust it I have much to tell you of this Princess but I doubt if I can remember it Her manner meant so much and yet so little there was such elegance of expression with such perfect ease so much of the finest knowledge of life united to a kind of hopeful trust in mankind that I kept eternally balancing in my mind whether her intelligence or her kindliness had the supremacy She spoke to me much of the Harleys Ida was well and at Florence She had refused Wahnsdorf s offer of marriage and though ardently solicited to let time test her decision persisted in her rejection Whether she knew of my affection or not I cannot say but I opine not for she talked of Ida as one whose haughty nature would decline alliance with even an imperial house if they deemed it a condescension so that the refusal of Wahnsdorf may have been on this ground But how can it matter to me I am to remain here a week I think they said Sir Horace Upton is coming on his way south and wishes to see me but you will be with me ere that time and then we can plan our future together As this web of intrigue for so I cannot but feel it draws more closely around me I grow more and more impatient to break bounds and be away It is evident enough that my destiny is to be the sport of some accident lucky or unlucky in the fate of others Shall I await this And they have given me money and fine clothes and a servant to wait upon me and treated me like one of condition Is this but another act of the drama the first scene of which was an old ruined castle in Ireland They will fail signally if they think so a heart can be broken only once They may even feel sorry for what they have done but I can never forgive them for what they have made me Come to me dear kind friend as soon as you can you little know how far your presence reconciles me to the world and to yourself Ever yours C M This letter Billy Traynor read over and over as he sat by Glencore s bedside It was his companion in the long dreary hours of the night and he pondered over it as he sat in the darkened room at noonday What is that you are crumpling up there From whom is the letter said Lord Glencore as Billy hurriedly endeavored to conceal the oft perused epistle Nay cried he suddenly correcting himself you need not tell me I asked without forethought He paused a few seconds and then went on I am now as much recovered as I ever hope to be and you may leave me to morrow I know that both your wish and your duty call you elsewhere Whatever future fortune may betide any of us you at least have been a true and faithful friend and shall never want As I count upon your honesty to keep a pledge I reckon on your delicacy not asking the reasons for it You will therefore not speak of having been with me here To mention me would be but to bring up bitter memories In the pause which now ensued Billy Traynor s feelings underwent a sore trial for while he bethought him that now or never had come the moment to reconcile the father and the son thus mysteriously separated his fears also whispered the danger of any ill advised step on his part and the injury he might by possibility inflict on one he loved best on earth You make me this pledge therefore before we part said Lord Glencore who continued to ruminate on what he had spoken It is less for my sake than that of another Billy took the hand Glencore tendered towards him respectfully in his own and kissed it twice There are men who have no need of oaths to ratify their faith and trustfulness You are one of them Tray nor said Glencore affectionately Billy tried to speak but his heart was too full and he could not utter a word A dying man s words have ever their solemn weight said Glencore and mine beseech you not to desert one who has no prize in life equal to your friendship Promise me nothing but do not forget my prayer to you And with this Lord Glencore turned away and buried his face between his hands And in the name of Heaven muttered Billy to himself as he stole away what is it that keeps them apart and won t let them love one another Sure it wasn t in nature that a boy of his years could ever do what would separate them this way What could he possibly say or do that his father might n t forget and forgive by this time And then if it was n t the child s fault at all where s the justice in makin him pay for another s crime Sure enough great people must be unlike poor craytures like me in their hearts and feelin s as well as in their grandeur and there must be things that we never mind nor think of that are thought to be mortial injuries by them Ay and that is raysonable too We see the same in the matayrial world There s fevers that some never takes and there s climates some can live in and no others can bear I suppose now said he with a wise shake of the head pride pride is at the root of it all some way or other and if it is I may give up the investigation at onst for divil a one o me knows what pride is barrin it s the delight one feels in consthruin a hard bit in a Greek chorus or hittin the manin of a doubtful passage in ould AEschylus But what s the good o me puzzlin myself If I was to speculate for fifty years I d never be able to think like a lord after all And with this conclusion he began to prepare for his journey CHAPTER XLVIII HOW A SOVEREIGN TREATS WITH HIS MINISTER What can have brought them here Stubber said the Duke of Massa as he walked to and fro in his dressing room with an air of considerable perturbation Be assured of one thing they have come for mischief I know that Sabloukoff well She it was separated Prince Max from my sister and that Montenegro affair was all her doing also I don t suspect Don t you Well then I do sir and that s enough said he interrupting And as to Upton he s well known throughout Europe a mauvais coucheur Stubber that s what the Emperor Franz called him a mauvais coucheur one of those fellows England employs to get up the embarrassments she so deeply deplores Eh Stubber that s the phrase While we deeply deplore the condition of the kingdom that s always the exordium to sending out a fleet or an impertinent despatch But I ll not endure it here I have my sovereign rights my independence my allies By the way haven t my allies taken possession of the Opera House for a barrack That they have sir and they threaten an encampment in the Court gardens An open insult an outrage And have you endured and submitted to this I have refused the permission but they may very possibly take no heed of my protest And you ll tell me that I am the ruler of this state No but I ll say you might if you liked to be so How so Stubber Come my worthy fellow what s your plan You have a plan I m certain but I guess it turn Protestant hunt out the Jesuits close the churches demolish the monasteries and send for an English frigate down to the Marina where there s not water to float a fishing boat But no sir I ll have no such alliances I ll throw myself upon the loyalty and attachment of my people and I ll raise the taxes Eh Stubber We ll tax the colza and the quarries If they demur we ll abdicate that s my last word abdicate I wonder who this sick man can be that accompanies Upton said Stubber who never suffered himself to be moved by his master s violence Another firebrand another emissary of English disturbance Hardenberg was perfectly right when he said the English nation pays off the meanest subserviency to their own aristocracy by hunting down all that is noble in every state of Europe There sir he hit the mark in the very centre Slaves at home rebels abroad that s your code We contrive to mix up a fair share of liberty with our bondage sir In your talk only in your talk and in the newspapers Stubber I have studied you closely and attentively You submit to more social indignities than any nation ancient or modern I was in London in fifteen and I remember at a race course Ascot they called it the Prince had a certain horse called Rufus I rode him said Stubber dryly You rode him Yes sir I was his jock for the King s Plate There was a matter of twenty eight started the largest field ever known for the Cup and Rufus reared and falling back killed his rider and the Duke of Dunrobin sent for me and told me to mount That s the way I came to be there Per Bacco it was a splendid race and I m sure I never suspected when I cheered you coming in that I was welcoming my future minister Eh Stubber only fancy what a change Stubber only shrugged his shoulders as though the alteration in fortune was no such great prize after all I won two thousand guineas on that day Stubber Lord Heddleworth paid me in gold I remember for they picked my pocket of three rouleaux on the course The Prince laughed so at dinner about it and said it was pure patriotism not to suffer exportation of bullion A great people the English that I must say The display of wealth was the grandest spectacle I ever beheld and such beauty too By the way Stubber our ballet here is detestable Where did they gather together that gang of horrors What signifies it sir if the Austrian Jagers are bivouacked in the theatre Very true by Jove said the Duke pondering Can t we hit upon something have you no happy suggestion I have it Stubber an admirable thought We ll have Upton to dinner We ll make it appear that he has come here specially to treat with us There is a great coldness just now between saint James s and Vienna Upton will be charmed with the thought of an intrigue so will be La Sabloukoff We ll not invite the Field Marshal Rosen krantz that will itself offend Austria Eh Stubber is n t it good Say to morrow at six and go yourself with the invitation And overjoyed with the notion of his own subtlety the Prince walked up and down laughing heartily and rubbing his hands in glee Stubber however was too well versed in the changeability of his master s nature to exhibit any rash promptitude in obeying him You must manage to let the English papers speak of this Stubber The Augsburg Gazette will be sure to copy the paragraph and what a sensation it will create at Vienna I am inclined to think Upton has come here about that young fellow we gave up to the Austrians last autumn and for whom he desires to claim some compensation and an ample apology Apology of course Stubber humiliation to any extent I ll send the Minister Landelli into exile to the galleys if they insist but I ll not pay a scudo my royal word on it But who says that such is the reason of his presence here I had a hint of it last night and I received a polite note from Upton this morning asking when he might have a few moments conversation with me Go to him Stubber with our invitation Ask him if he likes shooting Say I am going to Serravezza on Saturday sound him if he desires to have the Red Cross of Massa hint that I am an ardent admirer of his public career and be sure to tell me something he has said or done if he come to dinner There is to be a dinner then sir asked Stubber with the air of one partly struggling with a conviction I have said so Chevalier replied the Prince haughtily and in the tone of a man whose decisions were irrevocable I mean to dine in the state apartments and to have a reception in the evening just to show Rosenkrantz how cheaply we hold him Eh Stubber It will half kill him to come with the general company Stubber gave a faint sigh as though fresh complications and more troubles would be the sole results of this brilliant tactique If I were well served and faithfully obeyed there is not a sovereign in Europe who would boast a more independent position protected by my bold people environed by my native Apennines and sustained by the proud consciousness the proud consciousness that I cannot injure a state which has not sixpence in the treasury Eh Stubber cried he with a burst of merry laughter That s the grand feature of composure and dignity to know you can t be worse and this we Italian princes can all indulge in Look at the Pope himself he is collecting the imposts a year in advance I hope that this country is more equitably administered said Stubber So do I sir Were I not impressed with the full conviction that the subjects of this realm were in the very fullest enjoyment of every liberty consistent with public tranquillity protected in the maintenance of every privilege By the way talking of privileges they must n t play Trottolo on the high roads they sent one of those cursed wheels flying between the legs of my horse yesterday so that if I had n t been an old cavalry soldier I must have been thrown I ordered the whole village to be fined three hundred scudi one half of which to be sent to the shrine of our Lady of Loretta who really I believe kept me in my saddle If the people had sufficient occupation they d not play Trottolo said Stubber sternly And whose the fault if they have not sir How many months have I been entreating to have those terraced gardens finished towards the sea I want that olive wood too all stubbed up and the ground laid out in handsome parterres How repeatedly have I asked for a bridge over that ornamental lake and as to the island there s not a magnolia planted in it yet Public works indeed find me the money Stubber and I ll suggest the works Then there s that villa the residence of those English people have we not made a purchase of it No your Highness we could not agree about the terms and I have just heard that the stranger who is travelling with Upton is going to buy it Stepping in between me and an object I have in view And in my own Duchy too And you have the hardihood to tell me that you knew of and permitted this negotiation to go on There is nothing in the law to prevent it sir The law What impertinence to tell me of the law I Why sir it is I am the law I am the head and fountain of all law here without my sanction what can presume to be legal I opine that the Act which admits foreigners to possess property in the state was passed in the life of your Highness s father I repeal it then It saps the nationality of a people it is a blow aimed at the very heart of independent sovereignty I may stand alone in all Europe on this point but I will maintain it And as to this stranger let his passport be sent to him on the spot He may possibly be an Englishman your Highness and remember that we have already a troublesome affair on our hands with that other youth who in some way claims Upton s protection Had we not better go more cautiously to work I can see and speak with him What a tyranny is this English interference There is not a land from Sweden to Sicily where on some assumed ground of humanity your Government have not dared to impose their opinions You presume to assert that all men must feel precisely like your dogged and hard headed countrymen and that what are deemed grievances in your land should be thought so elsewhere You write up a code for the whole world built out of the materials of all your national prejudices your insular conceit ay and out of the very exigencies of your bad climate and then you say to us blessed in the enjoyment of light hearts and God s sunshine that we must think and feel as you do I am not astonished that my nobles are discontented with the share you possess of my confidence they must long have seen how little suited the maxims of your national policy are to the habits of a happier population The people are far better than their nobles that I m sure of said Stubber stoutly You want to preach socialism to me and hope to convert me to that splendid doctrine of communism we hear so much of You are a dangerous fellow a very dangerous fellow It was precisely men of your stamp sapped the monarchy in France and with it all monarchy in Europe If your Highness intends Proserpine to run at Bologna she ought to be put in training at once said Stubber gravely and we might send up some of the weeds at the same time and sell them off Well thought of Stubber and there was something else in my head what was it The suppression of the San Lorenzo convent perhaps it is all completed and only waits your Highness to sign the deed What sum does it give us Stubber eh About one hundred and eighty thousand scudi sir of which some twenty thousand go to the National Mortgage Fund Not one crown of it not a single bajocco as I am a Christian knight and a true gentleman I need it all if it were twice as much If we incur the anger of the Pope and the Sacred College if we risk the thunders of the Vatican let us have the worldly consolation of a full purse I advised the measure on wiser grounds sir It was not fair and just that a set of lazy friars should be leading lives of indolence and abundance in the midst of a hard worked and ill fed peasantry Quite true and on these wise grounds as you call them we have rooted them out We only wish that the game were more plenty for the sport amuses us vastly And he clapped Stubber familiarly on the shoulder and laughed heartily at his jest It was in this happy frame of mind that Stubber always liked to leave his master and so promising to attend to the different subjects discussed between them he bowed and withdrew CHAPTER XLIX SOCIAL DIPLOMACIES What an insufferable bore dear Princess sighed Sir Horace as he opened the square shaped envelope that contained his Royal Highnesses invitation to dinner I mean to be seriously indisposed said Madame de Sabloukoff one gets nothing but chagrin in intercourse with petty Courts Like provincial journals they only reproduce what has appeared in the metropolitan papers and give you old gossip for fresh intelligence Or worse again ask you to take an interest in their miserable localisms the microscopic contentions of insect life They have given us a sentry at the door I perceive said Sir Horace with assumed indifference A very proper attention remarked the lady in a tone that more than half implied the compliment was one intended for herself Have you seen the Chevalier Stubber yet asked Upton No he has been twice here but I was dressing or writing notes And you I told him to come about two o clock sighed Sir Horace I rather like Stubber This was said in a tone of such condescension that it sounded as though the utterer was confessing to an amicable weakness in his nature I rather like Stubber Though there was something meant to invite agreement in the tone the Princess only accepted the speech with a slight motion of her eyebrows and a look of half unwilling assent I know he s not of your world dear Princess but he belongs to that Anglo Saxon stock we are so prone to associate with all the ideas of rugged unadorned virtue Rugged and unadorned indeed echoed the lady And yet never vulgar rejoined Upton never affecting to be other than he is and stranger still not self opinionated and conceited I own to you said she haughtily that the whole Court here puts me in mind of Hayti with its Marquis of Orgeat and its Count Marmalade These people elevated from menial station to a mock nobility only serve to throw ridicule upon themselves and the order that they counterfeit No socialist in Europe has done such service to the cause of democracy as the Prince of Massa Honesty is such a very rare quality in this world that I am not surprised at his Highness prizing it under any garb Now Stubber is honest He says so himself I am told Yes he says so and I believe him He has been employed in situations of considerable trust and always acquitted himself well Such a man cannot have escaped temptations and yet even his enemies do not accuse him of venality Good Heavens what more would he have than his legitimate spoils He is a Minister of the Household with an ample salary a Master of the Horse an inspector of Woods and Forests a something over Church lands and a Red Cross of Massa besides I am quite made up in his dignities for they are all set forth on his visiting card with what purports to be a coat of arms at top And as she spoke she held out the card in derision That s silly I must say said Upton smiling and yet I suppose that here in Massa it was requisite he should assert all his pretensions thus openly Perhaps so said she dryly And after all said Upton who seemed rather bent on a system of mild tormenting after all there is something amiable in the weakness of this display it smacks of gratitude It is like saying to the world See what the munificence of my master has made me What a delicate compliment too to his nobles which proclaims that for a station of trust and probity the Prince must recruit from the kitchen and the stables To my thinking there is no such impertinent delusion as that popular one which asserts that we must seek for everything in its least likely place take ministers out of counting houses and military commanders from shop boards For the treatment of weighty questions in peace or war the gentleman element is the first essential Just as long as the world thinks so dear Princess not an hour longer The Princess arose and walked the room in evident displeasure She half suspected that his objections were only devices to irritate and she determined not to prolong the discussion The temptation to reply proved however too strong for her resolution and she said The world has thought so for some centuries and when a passing shade of doubt has shaken the conviction have not the people rushed from revolution into actual bondage as though any despotism were better than the tyranny of their own passions I opine said Upton calmly that the prestige of the gentleman consists in his belonging to an order Now that is a privilege that cannot be enjoyed by a mere popular leader It is like the contrast between a club and a public meeting It is something that you confess these people have no prestige said she triumphantly Indeed their presence in the world of politics to my thinking is a mere symbol of change an evidence that we are in some stage of transition So we are madame there is nothing more true Every people of Europe have outgrown their governments like young heirs risen to manhood ordering household affairs to their will The popular voice now swells above the whisper of cabinets So long as each country limits itself to home questions this spirit will attract but slight notice Let the issue however become a great international one and you will see the popular will declaring wars cementing alliances and signing peaces in a fashion to make statecraft tremble And you approve of this change and welcome it asked she derisively I have never said so madame I foresee the hurricane that s all Men like Stubber are to be seen almost everywhere throughout Europe They are a kind of declaration that for the government and guidance of mankind the possession of a good head and an honest heart is amply sufficient that rulers neither need fourteen quarterings nor names coeval with the Roman Empire You have given me but another reason to detest him said the Princess angrily I don t think I shall receive him to day But you want to speak with him about that villa there is some formality to be gone through before a foreigner can own property here I think you promised Glencore you would arrange the matter She made no reply and he continued Poor fellow a very short lease would suffice for his time he is sinking rapidly The conflict his mind wages between hope and doubt has hastened all the symptoms of his malady In such a struggle a woman has more courage than a man Say more boldness Princess said Upton slyly I repeat courage sir It is fear and nothing but fear that agitates him He is afraid of the world s sneer afraid of what society will think and say and write about him afraid of the petty gossip of the millions he will never see or hear of This cowardice it is that checks him in every aspiration to vindicate his wife s honor and his boy s birth Si cela se peut said Upton with a very equivocal smile A look of haughty anger with a flush of crimson on her cheek was the only answer she made him I mean that he is really not in a position to prove or disprove anything He assumed certain levities I suppose the word will do to mean more than levities he construed indiscretions into grave faults and faults into crimes But that he did all this without sufficient reason or that he now has abundant evidence that he was mistaken I am unable to say nor is it with broken faculties and a wandering intellect that he can be expected to review the past and deliver judgment on it The whole moral of which is what a luckless fate is that of a foreign wife United to an English husband There is much force in the remark said Upton calmly To have her thoughts and words and actions submitted to the standard of a nation whose moral subtleties she could never comprehend to be taught that a certain amount of gloom must be mixed up with life just as bitters are taken for tonics that ennui is the sure type of virtue and low spirits the healthiest condition of the mind these are her first lessons no wonder if she find them hard ones To be told that all the harmless familiarities she has seen from her childhood are dangerous freedoms all the innocent gayeties of the world about her are snares and pitfalls is to make existence little better than a penal servitude this is lesson the second While to complete her education she is instructed how to assume a censorial rigidity of manner that would shame a duenna and a condemnatory tone that assumes to arraign all the criminals of society and pass sentence on them How amiable she may become in disposition and how suitable as a companion by this training you sir and your countrymen are best able to pronounce You rather exaggerate our demerits my dear Princess said Upton smiling We really do not like to be so very odious as you would make us You are excellent people with whom no one can live that s the whole of it said she with a saucy laugh If your friend Lord Glencore had been satisfied to stay at home and marry one of his own nation he might have escaped a deal of unhappiness and saved a most amiable creature much more sorrow than falls to the lot of the least fortunate of her own country I conclude you have some influence over him As much perhaps as any one but even that says little Can you not use it therefore to make him repair a great wrong You had some plan I think said he hesitatingly Yes I have written to her to come down here I have pretended that her presence is necessary to certain formalities about the sale of the villa I mean that they should meet without apprising either of them I have sent the boy out of the way to Pontremoli to make me a copy of some frescoes there till the success of my scheme be decided I did not wish to make him a party to it You don t know Glencore at least as I know him There is no reason that I should broke she in What I would try is an experiment every detail of which I would leave to chance Were this a case where all the wrong were on one side and all the forgiveness to come from the other friendly aid and interposition might well be needed but here is a complication which neither you nor I nor any one else can pretend to unravel Let them meet therefore and let Fate if that be the name for it decide what all the prevention and planning in the world could never provide for The very fact that their meeting has been plotted beforehand will suggest distrust Their manner in meeting will be the best answer to that said she resolutely There will be no acting between them depend upon t He told me that he had destroyed the registry of their marriage nor does he know where a single witness of the ceremony could be found I don t want to know how he could make the amende till I know that he is ready to do it said she in the same calm tone To have arranged a meeting with the boy had perhaps been better than this Glencore has not avowed it but I think I can detect misgivings for his treatment of the youth This was my first thought and I spoke to young Massy the evening before Lord Glencore arrived I led him to tell me of his boyish days in Ireland and his home there a stern resolution to master all emotion seemed to pervade whatever he said and though perhaps the effort may have cost him much his manner did not betray it He told me that he was illegitimate that the secret was divulged to him by his own father that he had never heard who his mother was nor what rank in life she occupied When I said that she was one in high station that she was alive and well and one of my own dearest friends a sudden crimson covered his face as quickly followed by a sickly pallor and though he trembled in every limb he never spoke a word I endeavored to excite in him some desire to learn more of her if not to see her but in vain The hard lesson he had taught himself enabled him to repress every semblance of feeling It was only when at last driven to the very limits of my patience I abruptly asked him Have you no wish to see your mother that his coldness gave way and in a voice tremulous and thick he said My shame is enough for myself I was burning to say more to put before him a contingency the mere shadow of a possibility that his claim to birth and station might one day or other be vindicated I did not actually do so but I must have let drop some chance word that betrayed my meaning for he caught me up quickly and said It would come too late if it came even to day I am that which I am by many a hard struggle you ll never see me risk a disappointment in life by any encouragement I may give to hope I then adverted to his father but he checked me at once saying When the ties that should be closest in life are stained with shame and dishonor they are bonds of slavery not of affection My debt to Lord Glencore is the degradation I live in none other His heritage to me is the undying conflict in my heart between what I once thought I was and what I now know I am If we met it would be to tell him so In a word every feature of the father s proud unforgivingness is reproduced in the boy and I dreaded the very possibility of their meeting If ever Lord Glencore avow his marriage and vindicate his wife s honor his hardest task will be reconciliation with this boy All and more than all the evils I anticipated have followed this insane vengeance said Upton I begin to think that one ought to leave a golden bridge even to our revenge Princess Assuredly wherever a woman is the victim said she smiling for you are so certain to have reasons for distrusting yourself Upton sat meditating for some time on the plan of the Princess had it only originated with himself it was exactly the kind of project he would have liked He knew enough of life to be aware that one can do very little more than launch events upon the great ocean of destiny that the pretension to guide and direct them is oftener a snare than anything else that the contingencies and accidents the complications too which beset every move in life disconcert all one s pre arrangements so that it is rare indeed when we are able to pursue the same path towards any object by which we have set out As the scheme was however that of another he now scrutinized it and weighed every objection to its accomplishment constantly returning to the same difficulty as he said You do not know Glencore The man who has but one passion one impulse in life is rarely a difficult study was the measured reply Lord Glencore s vengeance has worn itself out exactly as all similar outbreaks of temper do for want of opposition There was nothing to feed nothing to minister to it He sees I have taken care that he should see that his bolt has not struck the mark that her position is not the precarious thing he meant to make it but a station as much protected and fenced round by its own conventionalities as that of any the proudest lady in society For one that dares to impugn her there are full fifty ready to condemn him and all this has been done without reprisal or recrimination no partisanship to arraign his moroseness and his cruelty none of that coterie defence which divides society into two sections This of course has wounded his pride but it has not stimulated his anger but above all it has imparted to her the advantage of a dignity of which his vengeance was intended to deprive her You must be a sanguine and a hopeful spirit Princess if you deem that such elements will unite happily hereafter said Upton smiling I really never carried my speculations so far replied she It is in actual life as in that of the stage quite sufficient to accompany the actors to the fall of the curtain The Chevalier Stubber madame said a servant entering wishes to know if you will receive him Yes no yes Tell him to come in said she rapidly as she resumed her seat beside the fire CHAPTER L ANTE DINNER REFLECTIONS Notwithstanding the strongly expressed sentiments of the Princess with regard to the Chevalier Stubber she received him with marked favor and gave him her hand to kiss with evident cordiality As for Upton it was the triumph of his manner to deal with men separated widely from himself in station and abilities He could throw such an air of good fellowship into the smallest attentions impart such a glow of kindliness to the veriest commonplaces that the very craftiest and shrewdest could never detect As he leaned his arm therefore on Stubber s shoulder and smiled benignly on him you would have said it was the affectionate meeting with a long absent brother But there was something besides this there was the expansive confidence accorded to a trusty colleague and as he asked him about the Duchy its taxation its debt its alliances and difficulties you might mark in the attention he bestowed all the signs of one receiving very valuable information You perceive Princess said he at last Stubber quite agrees with the Duke of Cloudeslie these small states enjoy no real independence Then why are they not absorbed into the larger nations about them They have their uses they are like substances interposed between conflicting bodies which receive and diminish the shock of collisions So that Prussia when wanting to wound Austria only pinches Baden and Austria desirous of insulting Saxony takes it out on Sigmaringen It s a pleasant destiny you assign them said she laughing Stubber will tell you I m not far wrong in my appreciation I m not for what they call mediatizing them neither my Lady said Stubber who generally used the designation to imply his highest degree of respect That may all be very well for the interests of the great states and the balance of power and all that sort of thing but we ought also to bestow a thought upon the people of these small countries especially on the inhabitants of their cities What s to become of them when you withdraw their courts and throw their little capitals into the position of provincial towns and even villages They will eke out a livelihood somehow my dear Stubber Be assured that they ll not starve Masters of the Horse may have to keep livery stables chamberlains turn valets ladies of the bedchamber descend to the arts of millinery but after all the change will be but in name and there will not be a whit more slavery in the new condition than in the old one Well I m not so sure they ll take the same comfortable view of it that you do Sir Horace said Stubber nor can I see who can possibly want livery stables or smart bonnets or even a fine butler when the resources of the Court are withdrawn and the city left to its own devices Stubber suspects said Upton that the policy which prevails amongst our great landed proprietors against small holdings is that which at present influences the larger states of Europe against small kingdoms and so far he is right It is unquestionably the notion of our day that the influences of government require space for their exercise If the happiness of the people was to be thought of which of course it is not said Stubber I d say leave them as they are Ah my dear Stubber you are now drawing the question into the realm of the imaginary What do any of us know about our happiness Enough to eat and drink a comfortable roof over you good clothes nothing oppressive or unequal in the laws these go for a good way in the kind of thing I mean and let me observe sir it is a great privilege little states like little people enjoy that they need have no ambitions They don t want to conquer anybody they neither ask for the mouth of a river here or an island there and if only let alone they ll never disturb the peace of the world at large My dear Stubber you are quite a proficient at state craft said Upton with the very least superciliousness in the accent Well I don t know Sir Horace said the other modestly but as my master s means are about the double of what they were when I entered his service and as the people pay about one sixth less in taxes than they used to do mayhap I might say that I have put the saddle on the right part of the back Your foreign policy does not seem quite as unobjectionable as your home management That was an ugly business about that boy you gave up to the Austrians Well there were mistakes on all sides You yourself Sir Horace gave him a false passport his real name turns out to be Massy it made an impression on me from a circumstance that happened when I was a young fellow living as pad groom with Prince Tottskoy I went over on a lark one day to Capri and was witness to a wedding there of a young Englishman called Massy Were you then present at the ceremony Yes sir and what s stranger still I have a voucher for it A voucher for it What do you mean It was this way sir There was a great supper for the country people and the servants and I was there and I suppose I took too much of that Capri wine it was new and hot at the time and I got into a row of some sort and I beat the Deputato from some place or t other and got locked up for three days and the priest a very jolly fellow gave me under his handwriting a voucher that I had been a witness of the marriage and all the festivities afterwards just to show my master how everything happened But the Prince never asked me for any explanations and only said he hoped I had amused myself well and so I kept my voucher to myself and I have it at this very hour Will you let me see it Stubber To be sure sir you shall have it if I can lay my hand on t in the course of the day Let me beg you will go at once and search for it it may be of more importance than you know of Go my dear Stubber and look it up I ll not lose a moment since you wish to have it said Stubber and I am sure your ladyship will excuse my abrupt departure The Princess assured him that her own interest in the document was not inferior to that of Sir Horace and he hastened off to prosecute his search Here then are all my plans altered at once exclaimed she as the door closed after him If this paper mean only as much as he asserts it will be ample proof of marriage and lead us to the knowledge of all those who were present at it Yet must we well reflect on the use we make of it said Upton Glencore is now evidently balancing what course to take As his chances of recovery grow less each day he seems to incline more and more to repair the wrong he has done Should we show on our side the merest semblance of compulsion I would not answer for him So that we have the power as a last resource I am content to diplomatize said the Princess but you must see him this evening and press for a decision He has already asked me to come to him after we return from Court It will be late but it is the hour at which he likes best to talk If I see occasion for it I can allude to what Stubber has told us but it will be only if driven by necessity to it I would act more boldly and more promptly said she And rouse an opposition perhaps that already is becoming dormant No I know Glencore well and will deal with him more patiently From the Chevalier Stubber your Excellency said a servant presenting a sealed packet and Sir Horace opened it at once The envelope contained a small and shabby slip of paper of which the writing appeared faint and indistinct It was dated eighteen Church of saint Lorenzo Capri and went to certify that Guglielmo Stubber had been present on the morning of the eighteenth August at the marriage of the Most Noble Signor Massy with the Princess de la Torre having in quality as witness signed the registry thereof and then went on to state the circumstance of his attendance at the supper and the event which ensued It bore the name of the writer at foot Basilio Nardoni priest of the aforesaid church and village Little is Glencore aware that such an evidence as this is in existence said Upton The conviction that he had his vengeance in his power led him into this insane project He fancied there was not a flaw in that terrible indictment and see here is enough to open the door to truth and undo every detail of all his plotting How strange is it that the events of life should so often concur to expose the dark schemes of men s hearts proofs starting up in un thought of places as though to show how vain was mere subtlety in conflict with the inevitable law of Fate This Basilio Nardoni is an acquaintance of mine said the Princess bent on pursuing another train of thought he was chaplain to the Cardinal Caraffa and frequently brought me communications from his Eminence He can be found if wanted It is unlikely most unlikely that we shall require him If you mean that Lord Glencore will himself make all the amends he can for a gross injury and a fraud no more is necessary said she folding the paper and placing it in her pocket book but if anything short of this be intended then there is no exposure too open no publicity too wide to be given to the most cruel wrong the world has ever heard of Leave me to deal with Glencore I think I am about the only one who can treat with him And now for this dinner at Court for I have changed my mind and mean to go said the Princess It is full time to dress I believe It is almost six o clock said Upton starting up We have quite forgotten ourselves CHAPTER LI CONFLICTING THOUGHTS The Princess Sabloukoff found not by any means an unfrequent experience in life that the dinner whose dulness she had dreaded turned out a very pleasant affair The Prince was unusually gracious He was in good spirits and put forth powers of agreeability which had been successful in one of less distinction than himself He possessed eminently what a great orator once panegyrized as a high conversational element great variety and could without abruptness pass from subject to subject with always what showed he had bestowed thought upon the theme before him Great people have few more enviable privileges than that they choose their own topics for conversation Nothing disagreeable nothing wearisome nothing inopportune can be intruded upon them When they have no longer anything worth saying they can change the subject or the company His Highness talked with Madame de Sabloukoff on questions of state as he might have talked with a Metternich he even invited from her expressions of opinion that were almost counsels sentiments that might pass for warnings He ranged over the news of the day relating occasionally some little anecdote every actor in which was a celebrity or now and then communicating some piece of valueless secrecy told with all the mystery of a great fact and then he discussed with Upton the condition of England and deplored as all Continental rulers do the impending downfall of that kingdom from the growing force of our restless and daring democracy He regretted much that Sir Horace was not still in office but consoled himself by reflecting that the pleasure he enjoyed in his society had been in that case denied him In fact what with insinuated flatteries little signs of confidence and a most marked tone of cordiality purposely meant to strike beholders the Prince conducted the conversation right royally and played Highness to perfection And these two crafty keen sighted people did they not smile at the performance and did they not as they drove home at night amuse themselves as they recounted the little traits of the great man s dupery Not a bit of it They were charmed with his gracious manner and actually enchanted with his agreeability Strong in their self esteem they could not be brought to suspect that any artifice could be practised on them or that the mere trickery and tinsel of high station could be imposed on them as true value Nay they even went further and discovered that his Highness was really a very remarkable man and one who received far less than the estimation due to him His flightiness became versatility his eccentricity was all originalty and ere they reached the hotel they had endowed him with almost every moral and mental quality that can dignify manhood It is really a magnificent turquoise said the Princess gazing with admiration at a ring the Prince had taken from his own finger to present to her How absurd is that English jealousy about foreign decorations I was obliged to decline the Red Cross of Massa which his Highness proposed to confer on me A monarchy that wants to emulate a republic is simply ridiculous You English are obliged to pay dear for your hypocrisies and you ought for you really love them And with this taunt the carriage stopped at the door of the inn As Upton passed up the stairs the waiter handed him a note which he hastily opened it was from Glencore and in these words Dear Upton I can bear this suspense no longer to remain here canvassing with myself all the doubts that beset me is a torture I cannot endure I leave therefore at once for Florence Once there where I mean to see and hear for myself I can decide what is to be the fate of the few days or weeks that yet remain to Yours Glencore He is gone then his Lordship has started Yes your Excellency he is by this time near Lucca for he gave orders to have horses ready at all the stations Read that madame said Upton as he once more found himself alone with the Princess you will see that all your plans are disconcerted He is off to Florence Madame de Sabloukoff read the note and threw it carelessly on the table He wants to forgive himself and only hesitates how to do so gracefully said she sneeringly I think you are less than just to him said Upton mildly his is a noble nature disfigured by one grand defect Your national character like your language is so full of incongruities and contradictions that I am not ashamed to own myself unequal to master it but it strikes me that both one and the other usurp freedoms that are not permitted to others At all events I am rejoiced that he has gone It is the most wearisome thing in life to negotiate with one too near you Diplomacy of even the humblest kind requires distance You agree with the duellist I perceive said he laughing that twelve paces is a more fatal distance than across a handkerchief proximity begets tremor You have guessed my meaning correctly said she meanwhile I must write to her not to come here Shall I say that we will be in Florence in a day or two I was just thinking of those Serravezza springs said Upton they contain a bi chloride of potash which Staub in his treatise says is the element wanting in all nervous organizations But remember the season we are in mid winter the hotels are closed The springs are running Princess the earth as Mos chus says is a mother that never ceases to nourish I do suspect I need a little nursing The Princess understood him thoroughly She well knew that whenever the affairs of Europe followed an unbroken track without anything eventful or interesting Sir Horace fell back upon his maladies for matter of occupation She had however now occasion for his advice and counsel and by no means concurred in his plan of spending some days if not weeks in the dreary mountain solitudes of Serravezza You must certainly consult Zanetti before you venture on these waters said she they are highly dangerous if taken without the greatest circumspection and she gave a catalogue of imaginary calamities which had befallen various illustrious and gifted individuals to which Upton listened with profound attention Very well sighed he as she finished it must be as you say I ll see Zanetti for I cannot afford to die just yet That Greek question will have no solution without me no one has the key of it but myself That Panslavic scheme too in the Principalities attracts no notice but mine and as to Spain the policy I have devised for that country requires all the watchfulness I can bestow on it No Princess here he gave a melancholy sigh we must not die at this moment There are just four men in Europe I doubt if she could get on with three What proportion do you admit as to the other sex said she laughing I only know of one madame and he kissed her hand with gallantry And now for Florence if you will It is by no means improbable that our readers have a right to an apology at our hands for the habit we have indulged of lingering along with the two individuals whose sayings and doings are not directly essential to our tale but is not the story of every day life our guarantee that incidents and people cross and re cross the path we are going attracting our attention engaging our sympathy enlisting our energies even in our most anxious periods Such is the world and we cannot venture out of reality Besides this we are disposed to think that the moral of a tale is often more effectively conveyed by the characters than by the catastrophe of a story The strange discordant tones of the human heart blending with melody the purest sounds of passionate meaning are in themselves more powerful lessons than all the records of rewarded virtue and all the calendars of punished vice The nature of a single man can be far more instructive than the history of every accident that befalls him It is then with regret that we leave the Princess and Sir Horace to pursue their journey alone We confess a liking for their society and would often as soon loiter in the by paths that they follow as journey in the more recognized high road of our true story Not having the conviction that our sympathy is shared by our readers we again return to the fortunes of Glencore When Lord Glencore s carriage underwent the usual scrutiny exercised towards travellers at the gate of Florence and prying officials poked their lanterns in every quarter in all the security of their caste two foot travellers were rudely pushed aside to await the time till the pretentious equipage passed on They were foreigners and their effects which they carried in knapsacks required examination We have come a long way on foot to day said the younger in a tone that indicated nothing of one asking a favor Can t we have this search made at once Whisht whisht whispered his companion in English wait till the Prince moves on and be polite with them all I am seeking for nothing in the shape of compliment said the other there is no reason why because I am on foot I must be detained for this man Again the other remonstrated and suggested patience What are you grumbling about young fellow cried one of the officers Do you fancy yourself of the same consequence as Milordo And see he must wait his time here We came a good way on foot to day sir interposed the elder eagerly taking the reply on himself and we re tired and weary and would be deeply obliged if you d examine us as soon as you could Stand aside and wait your turn was the stern response You almost deserve the fellow s insolence Billy said the youth a crown piece in his hand had been far more intelligible than your appeal to his pity And he threw himself wearily down on a stone bench Aroused by the accent of his own language Lord Glencore sat up in his carriage and leaned out to catch sight of the speaker but the shadow of the overhanging roof concealed him from view Can t you suffer those two poor fellows to move on whispered his Lordship as he placed a piece of money in the officer s hand they look tired and jaded There thank his Excellency for his kindness to you and go your way muttered the officer to Billy who without well understanding the words drew nigh the window but the glass was already drawn up the postilions were once more in their saddles and away dashed the cumbrous carriage in all the noise and uproar that is deemed the proper tribute to rank The youth heard that they were free to proceed with a half dogged indifference and throwing his knapsack on his shoulders moved away I asked them if they knew one of her name in the city and they said No said the elder But they so easily mistake names how did you call her I said Harley la Signora Harley rejoined the other and they were positive she was not here They never heard of her Well we shall know soon sighed the youth heavily Is not this an inn Billy Ay is it but not one for our purpose it s like a palace They told me of the Leone d Oro as a quiet place and cheap I don t care where or what it be one day and night here will do all I want And then for Genoa Billy and the sea and the world beyond the sea said the youth with increasing animation You shall see what a different fellow I ll be when I throw behind me forever the traditions of this dreary life here I know well the good stuff that s in ye said the other affectionately Ay but you don t know that I have energy as well as pride said the other There s nothing beyond your reach if you will only strive to get it said he again in the same voice You re an arrant flatterer old boy cried the youth throwing his arm around him but I would not have you otherwise for the world There is a happiness even in the self deception of your praise that I could not deny myself Thus chatting they arrived at the humble door of the Leone d Oro where they installed themselves for the night It was a house frequented by couriers and vetturini and at the common table for this company they now took their places for supper The Carnival was just drawing to its close and all the gayeties of that merry season were going forward Nothing was talked of but the brilliant festivities of the city the splendid balls of the Court and the magnificent receptions in the houses of the nobility The Palazzo della Torre takes the lead of all said one There were upwards of three thousand masks there this evening I m told and the gardens were just as full as the salons She is rich enough to afford it well cried another I counted twenty servants in white and gold liveries on the stairs alone Were you there then asked the youth whom we may at once call by his name of Massy Yes sir a mask and a domino such as you see yonder are passports everywhere for the next twenty four hours and though I m only a courier I have been chatting with duchesses and exchanging smart sayings with countesses in almost every great house in Florence this evening The Pergola Theatre too is open and all the boxes crowded with visitors You are a stranger as I detect by your accent said another and you ought to have a look at a scene such as you ll never witness in your own land What would come of such freedoms with us Billy whispered Massy Would our great lords tolerate even for a few hours the association with honest fellows of this stamp There would be danger in the attempt anyhow said Billy What calumnies would be circulated what slanderous tales would be sent abroad under cover of this secrecy How many a coward stab would be given in the shadow of that immunity For one who would use the privilege for mere amusement how many would turn it to account for private vengeance Are you quite certain such accidents do not occur here That society tolerates the custom is the best answer to this There may be for aught we know many a cruel vengeance executed under favor of this secrecy Many may cover their faces to unmask their hearts but after all they continue to observe a habit which centuries back their forefathers followed and the inference fairly is that it is not baneful For my own part I am glad to have an opportunity of witnessing these Saturnalia and to morrow I ll buy a mask and a domino Billy and so shall you too Why should we not have a day s fooling like the rest Billy shook his head and laughed and they soon afterwards parted for the night While young Massy slept soundly not a dream disturbing the calmness of his rest Lord Glencore passed the night in a state of feverish excitement Led on by some strange mysterious influence which he could as little account for as resist he had come back to the city where the fatal incident of his life had occurred With what purpose he could not tell It was not indeed that he had no object in view It was rather that he had so many and conflicting ones that they marred and destroyed each other No longer under the guidance of calm reason his head wandered from the past to the present and the future disturbed by passion and excited by injured self love At one moment sentiments of sorrow and shame would take the ascendant and at the next a vindictive desire to follow out his vengeance and witness the ruin that he had accomplished The unbroken unrelieved pressure of one thought for years and years of time had at last undermined his reasoning powers and every attempt at calm judgment or reflection was sure to be attended with some violent paroxysm of irrepressible rage There are men in whom the combative element is so strong that it usurps all their guidance and when once they are enlisted in a contest they cannot desist till the struggle be decided for or against them Such was Glencore To discover that the terrible injury he had inflicted on his wife had not crushed her nor driven her with shame from the world aroused once more all the vindictive passions of his nature It was a defiance he could not withstand Guilty or innocent it mattered not she had braved him at least so he was told and as such he had come to see her with his own eyes If this was the thought which predominated in his mind others there were that had their passing power over him moments of tenderness moments in which the long past came back again full of softening memories and then he would burst into tears and cry bitterly If he ventured to project any plan for reconciliation with her he had so cruelly wronged he as suddenly bethought him that her spirit was not less high and haughty than his own She had so far as he could learn never quailed before his vengeance how then might he suppose would she act in the presence of his avowed injustice Was it not besides too late to repair the wrong Even for his boy s sake would it not be better if he inherited sufficient means to support an honorable life unknown and unnoticed than bequeath to him a name so associated with shame and sorrow Who can tell he would cry aloud what my harsh treatment may not have made him what resentment may have taken root in his young heart what distrust may have eaten into his nature If I could but see him and talk with him as a stranger if I could be able to judge him apart from the influences that my own feelings would create even then what would it avail me I have so sullied and tarnished a proud name that he could never bear it without reproach Who is this Lord Glencore people would say What is the strange story of his birth Has any one yet got at the truth Was the father the cruel tyrant or the mother the worthless creature we hear tell of Is he even legitimate and if so why does he walk apart from his equals and live without recognition by his order This is the noble heritage I am to leave him this the proud position to which he is to succeed And yet Upton says that the boy s rights are inalienable that think how I may do what I will the day on which I die he is the rightful Lord Glencore His claim may lie dormant the proofs may be buried but that in truth and fact he will be what all my subterfuge and all my falsehood cannot deny him And then if the day should come that he asserts his right if by some of those wonderful accidents that reveal the mysteries of the world he should succeed to prove his claim what a memory will he cherish of me Will not every sorrow of his youth every indignity of his manhood be associated with my name Will he or can he ever forgive him who defamed the mother and despoiled the son In the terrible conflict of such thoughts as these he passed the night intervals of violent grief or passion alone breaking the sad connection of such reflections till at length the worn out faculties incapable of further exercise wandered away into incoherency and he raved in all the wildness of insanity It was thus that Upton found him on his arrival CHAPTER LII MAJOR SCARESBY S VISIT Down the crowded thoroughfare of the Borgo d Ognisanti the tide of Carnival mummers poured unceasingly Hideous masks and gay dominos ludicrous impersonations and absurd satires on costume abounded and the entire population seemed to have given themselves up to merriment and were fooling it to the top o their bent Bands of music and chorus singers from the theatre filled the air with their loud strains and carriages crowded with fantastic figures moved past pelting the bystanders with mock sweetmeats and covering them with showers of flour It was a season of universal license and short of actual outrage all was permitted for the time Nor did the enjoyment of the scene seem to be confined to the poorer classes of the people who thus for the nonce assumed equality with their richer neighbors but all even to the very highest mixed in the wild excitement of the pageant and took the rough treatment they met with in perfect good humor Dukes and princes white from head to foot with the snowy shower went laughingly along and grave dignitaries were fain to walk arm inarm with the most ludicrous monstrosities whose gestures turned on them the laughter of all around Occasionally but it must be owned rarely some philosopher of a sterner school might be seen passing hurriedly along his severe features and contemptuous glances owning to little sympathy with the mummery about him but even he had to compromise his proud disdain and escape as best he might from the indiscriminate justice of the crowd To detect one of this stamp to follow and turn upon him the full tide of popular fury seemed to be the greatest triumph of the scene When such a victim presented himself all joined in the pursuit nuns embraced devils environed him angels perched on his shoulders mock wild boars rushed between his legs his hat was decorated with feathers his clothes inundated with showers of meal or flour hackney coachmen dressed as ladies fainted in his arms and semi naked bacchanals pressed drink to his lips In a word each contributed what he might of attention to the luckless individual whose resistance if he were so impolitic as to make any only increased the zest of the persecution An instance of this kind had now attracted general attention nor was the amusement diminished by the discovery that he was a foreigner and an Englishman Impertinent allusions to his nation absurd attempts at his language ludicrous travesties of what were supposed to be his native customs were showered on him in company with a hailstorm of mock bonbons and lime pellets till covered with powder and outraged beyond all endurance he fought his way into the entrance of the Hotel d Italie followed by the cries and laughter of the populace Cursed tomfoolery Confounded asses cried he as he found himself in a harbor of refuge What the devil fun can they discover in making each other dirtier than their daily habits bespeak them I say cried he addressing a waiter is Sir Horace Upton staying here Well will you say Major Scaresby be correct in the name Major Scaresby requests to pay his respects His Excellency will see you sir said the man returning quickly with the reply From the end of a room so darkened by closed shutters and curtains as to make all approach difficult a weak voice called out Ah Scaresby how d ye do I was just thinking to myself that I could n t be in Florence since I had not seen you You are too good too kind Sir Horace to say so said the other with a voice whose tones by no means corresponded with the words Yes Scaresby everything in this good city is in a manner associated with your name Its intrigues its quarrels its loves and jealousies its mysteries in fine have had no such interpreter as yourself within the memory of man What a pity there were no Scaresbys in the Cinque Cento How sad there were none of your family here in the Medician period What a picture might we then have had of a society fuller even than the present of moral delinquencies There was a degree of pomposity in the manner he uttered this that served to conceal in a great measure its sarcasm I am much flattered to learn that I have ever enlightened your Excellency on any subject said the Major dryly That you have Scaresby I was a mere dabbler in moral toxicology when I heard your first lecture and I assure you I was struck by your knowledge And how is the dear city doing It is masquerading to day said Scaresby and consequently far more natural than at any other period of the whole year Smeared faces and dirty finery exactly its suitable wear Who are here Major Any one that one knows Old Millington is here The Marquis Yes he s here fresh painted and lacquered his eyes twinkling with a mock lustre that makes him look like an old po chaise with a pair of new lamps Ha ha ha laughed Sir Horace encouragingly And then there s Mabworth Sir Paul Mabworth Ay the same old bore as ever He has got off one of Burke s speeches on the India Bill by heart and says that he spoke it on the question of the grant for Maynooth Oh if poor Burke could only look up Look down you ought to say Scaresby depend upon t he s not on the Opposition benches still I hate the fellow said Scaresby whose ill temper was always augmented by any attempted smartness of those he conversed with He has taken Walmsley s cook away from him and never gives any one a dinner That is shameful a perfect dog in the manger Worse he s a dog without any manger For he keeps his house on board wages and there s literally nothing to eat That poor thing Strejowsky Oh Olga Strejowsky do you mean What of her Why there s another husband just turned up They thought he was killed in the Caucasus but he was only passing a few years in Siberia and so he has come back and claims all the emeralds You remember of course that famous necklace and the great drops They belonged once to the Empress Catherine but Mabworth says that he took the concern with all its dependencies he ll give up his bargain but make no compromise She s growing old I fancy She s younger than the Sabloukoff by five good years and they tell me she plays Beauty to this hour Ah Scaresby had you known what words were these you have just uttered or had you only seen the face of him who heard them you had rather bitten your tongue off than suffered it to fashion them Brignolles danced with her at that celebrated fete given by the Prince of Orleans something like eight and thirty years ago And how is the dear Duke asked Upton sharply Just as you saw him at the Court of Louis XVIII he swaggers a little more as he gets more feeble about the legs and he shows his teeth when he laughs more decidedly since his last journey to Paris Devilish clever fellows these modern dentists are He wants to marry I suppose you ve heard it Not a word of it Who is the happy fair The Nina as they call her now She was one of the Delia Torres who married or didn t marry Glencore Don t you remember him He was Colonel of the Eleventh and a devil of a martinet he was I remember him said Upton dryly Well he ran off with one of those girls and some say they were married at Capri as if it signified what happened at Capri She was a deuced good looking girl at the time a coquette you know and Glencore was one of those stiff English fellows that think every man is making up to his wife he drank besides No pardon me there you are mistaken I knew him intimately Glencore was as temperate as myself I have it from Lowther who used to take him home at night he said Glencore never went to bed sober At all events she hated him and detested his miserly habits Another mistake my dear Major Glencore was never what is called a rich man but he was always a generous one I suppose you ll not deny that he used to thrash her Ay and with a horsewhip too Come come Scaresby this is really too coarse for mere jesting Jest By Jove it was very bitter earnest She told Brignolles all about it I m not sure she didn t show him the marks Take my word for it Scaresby said Upton dropping his voice to a low but measured tone this is a base calumny and the Duke of Brignolles no more circulated such a story than I did He is a man of honor and utterly incapable of it I can only repeat that I believe it to be perfectly true said Scaresby calmly Nobody here ever doubted the story I cannot say what measure of charity accompanies your zeal for truth in this amiable society Scaresby but I can repeat my assertion that this must be a falsehood You will find it very hard nevertheless to bring any one over to your opinion retorted the unappeasable Major He was a fellow everybody hated proud and supercilious to all and treated his wife s relations who were of far better blood than himself as though they were canaille A loud crash as if of something heavy having fallen here interrupted their colloquy and Upton sprang from his seat and hastened into the adjoining room Close beside the door so close that he almost fell over it in entering lay the figure of Lord Glencore In his efforts to reach the door he had fainted and there he lay a cold clammy sweat covering his livid features and his bloodless lips slightly parted It was almost an hour ere his consciousness returned but when it did and he saw Upton alone at his bedside he pressed his hand within his own and said I heard it all Upton every word I tried to reach the room I got out of bed and was already at the door when my brain reeled and my heart grew faint It may have been malady it might be passion I know not but I saw no more He is gone is he not cried he in a faint whisper Yes yes an hour ago but you will think nothing of what he said when I tell you his name It was Scaresby Major Scaresby one whose bad tongue is the one solitary claim by which he subsists in a society of slanderers And he is gone repeated the other in a tone of deep despondency Of course he is I never saw him since but be assured of what I have just told you that his libels carry no reproach He is a calumniator by temperament I d have shot him if I could have opened the door muttered Glencore between his teeth but Upton heard the words distinctly What am I to this man cried he aloud or he to me that I am to be arraigned by him on charges of any kind true or false What accident of fortune makes him my judge Tell me that sir Who has appealed to him for protection Who has demanded to be righted at his hand Will you not hear me Glencore when I say that his slanders have no sting In the circles wherein he mixes it is the mere scandal that amuses for its veracity there is not one that cares You or I or some one else supply the name of an actor in a disreputable drama the plot of which alone interests not the performer And am I to sit tamely down under this degradation exclaimed Glencore passionately I have never subscribed to this dictation There is little indeed of life left to me but there is enough perhaps to vindicate myself against men of this stamp You shall take him a message from me you shall tell him by what accident I overheard his discoveries My dear Glencore there are graver interests far worthier cares than any this man s name can enter into which should now engage you I say he shall have my provocation and that within an hour cried Glencore wildly You would give this man and his words a consequence that neither have ever possessed said Upton in a mild and subdued tone Remember Glencore when I left with you this morning that paper of Stubber s it was with a distinct understanding that other and wiser thoughts than those of vengeance were to occupy your attention I never scrupled to place it in your hands I never hesitated about confiding to you what in a lawyer s phrase would be a proof against you When an act of justice was to be done I would not stain it by the faintest shadow of coercion I left you free I leave you still free from everything but the dictates of your own honor Glencore made no reply but the conflict of his thoughts seemed to agitate him greatly The man who has pursued a false path in life said Upton calmly has need of much courage to retrace his steps but courage is not the quality you fail in Glencore so that I appeal to you with confidence I have need of courage muttered Glencore you say truly What was it the doctor said this morning aneurism Upton moved his head with an inclination barely perceptible What a Nemesis there is in nature said Glencore with a sickly attempt to smile that passion should beget malady I never knew physically speaking that I had a heart till it was broken So that resumed he in a more agreeable tone death may ensue at any moment on the least excitement He warned you gravely on that point said Upton cautiously How strange that I should have come through that trial of an hour ago It was not that the struggle did not move me I could have torn that fellow limb from limb Upton if I had but the strength But see cried he feebly what a poor wretch I am I cannot close these fingers and he held out a worn and clammy hand as he spoke Do with me as you will said he after a pause I ought to have followed your counsels long ago Upton was too subtle an anatomist of human motives to venture by even the slightest word to disturb a train of thought which any interference could only damage As the other still continued to meditate and by his manner and look in a calmer and more reflective spirit the wily diplomatist moved noiselessly away and left him alone CHAPTER LIII A MASK IN CARNIVAL TIME From the gorgeous halls of the Pitti Palace down to the humblest chamber in Camaldole Florence was a scene of rejoicing As night closed in the crowds seemed only to increase and the din and clamor to grow louder It seemed as though festivity and joy had overflowed from the houses filling the streets with merry makers In the clear cold air groups feasted and sang and danced all mingling and intermixing with a freedom that showed how thoroughly the spirit of pleasure seeking can annihilate the distinctions of class The soiled and tattered mummer leaned over the carriage door and exchanged compliments with the masked duchess within The titled noble of a dozen quarterings stopped to pledge a merry company who pressed him to drain a glass of Monte Pulciano with them There was a perfect fellowship between those whom fortune had so widely separated and the polished accents of high society were heard to blend with the quaint and racy expressions of the people Theatres and palaces lay open all lighted a giorno The whole population of the city surged and swayed to and fro like a mighty sea in motion making the air resound the while with a wild mixture of sounds wherein music and laughter were blended Amid the orgie however not an act not a word of rudeness disturbed the general content It was a season of universal joy and none dared to destroy the spell of pleasure that presided Our task is not to follow the princely equipages as they rolled in unceasing tides within the marble courts nor yet to track the strong flood that poured through the wide thoroughfares in all the wildest exuberance of their joy Our business is with two travellers who well weary of being for hours a foot and partly sated with pleasure sat down to rest themselves on a bench beside the Arno It is glorious fooling that must be owned Billy said Charles Massy and the spirit is most contagious How little have you or I in common with these people We scarce can catch the accents of the droll allusions we cannot follow the strains of their rude songs and yet we are carried away like the rest to feel a wild enjoyment in all this din and glitter and movement How well they do it too That s all by rayson of concentration said Billy gravely They are highly charged with fun The ould adage says Non semper sunt Saturnalia It is not every day Morris kills a cow Yet it is by this very habit of enjoyment that they know how to be happy To be sure it is cried Billy they have a ritual for it which we have n t as Cicero tells us In jucundis nullum periculum But ye see we have no notion of any amusement without a dash of danger through it if not even cruelty The French know how to reconcile the two natures they are brave and light hearted too And the Irish Mister Charles the Irish especially said Billy proudly for I was alludin to the English in what I said last The versatile ingenium is all our own He goes into a tent and he spends half a crown Comes out meets a friend and for love knocks him down There s an elegant philosophy in that now that a Saxon would never see For it is out of the very fulness of the heart ye may remark that Pat does this just as much as to say I don t care for the expense He smashes a skull just as he would a whole dresser of crockery ware There s something very grand in that recklessness The tone of the remark and a certain wild energy of his manner showed that poor Billy s faculties were slightly under the influences of the Tuscan grape and the youth smiled at sight of an excess so rare How hard it must be said Massy to go back to the workaday routine of life after one of these outbursts to resume not alone the drudgery but all the slavish observances that humble men yield to great ones Tis what Bacon says There s nothing so hard as unlearnin anything and the proof is how few of us ever do it We always go on mucin old thoughts with new puttin different kinds of wine into the same glass and then wonderin we are not invigorated You re in a mood for moralizing to night I see Billy said the other smiling The levities of life always puts me on that thrack just as too bright a day reminds me to take out an umbrella with me Yet I do not see that all your observation of the world has indisposed you to enjoy it or that you take harsher views of life the closer you look at it Quite the reverse the more I see of mankind the more I m struck with the fact that the very wickedest and worst can t get rid of remorse Tis something out of a man s nature entirely something that dwells outside of him sets him on to commit a crime and then he begins to rayson and dispute with the temptation just like one keepin bad company and listenin to impure notions and evil suggestions day after day as he does this he gets to have a taste for that kind of low society I mane with his own bad thoughts till at last every other ceases to amuse him Look what s that there where are they goin with all the torches there cried he suddenly springing up and pointing to a dense crowd that passed along the street It was a band of music dressed in a quaint mediaeval costume on its way to serenade some palace Let us follow and listen to them Billy said the youth and they arose and joined the throng Following in the wake of the dense mass they at last reached the gates of a great palace and after some waiting gained access to the spacious courtyard The grim old statues and armorial bearings shone in the glare of a hundred torches and the deep echoes rang with the brazen voices of the band as pent up within the quadrangle the din of a large orchestra arose On a great terrace overhead numerous figures were grouped indistinctly seen from the light of the salons within but whose mysterious movements completed the charm of a very interesting picture Some wrapped in shawls to shroud them from the night air some less cautiously emerging from the rooms within leaned over the marble balustrade and showed their jewelled arms in the dim hazy light while around and about them gay uniforms and costumes abounded As Billy gave himself up to the excitement of the music young Massy more interested by the aspect of the scene gazed unceasingly at the balcony There was just that shadowy indistinctness in the whole that invested it with a kind of romantic interest and he could weave stories and incidents from those whose figures passed and repassed before him He fancied that in their gestures he could trace many meanings and as the bent down heads approached and their hands touched he fashioned many a tale in his own mind of moving fortunes And see she comes again to that same dark angle of the terrace muttered he to himself as shrouded in a large mantle and with a half mask on her features a tall and graceful figure passed into the place he spoke of She looks like one among but not of them How much of heart weariness is there in that attitude how full is it of sad and tender melancholy Would that I could see her face My life on t that it is beautiful There she is tearing up her bouquet leaf by leaf the rose leaves are falling as though one by one hopes are decaying in her heart He pushed his way through the dense throng till he gained a corner of the court where a few leaves and flower stems yet strewed the ground carefully gathering up these he crushed them in his hand and seemed to feel as though a nearer tie bound him to the fair unknown How little ministers to the hope how infinitely less again will feed the imagination of a young heart Between them now there was to his appreciation some mysterious link Yes he said to himself true I stand unknown unnoticed yet it is to me of all the thousands here she could reveal what is passing in that heart I know it I feel it She has a sorrow whose burden I might help to bear There is cruelty or treachery or falsehood arrayed against her and through all the splendor of the scene all the wild gayety of the orgie some spectral image never leaves her side I would stake existence on it that I have read her aright Of all the intoxications that can entrance the human faculties there is none so maddening as that produced by giving full sway to an exuberant imagination The bewilderment resists every effort of reason and in its onward course carries away its victims with all the force of a mountain torrent A winding stair long unused and partly dilapidated led to the end of the terrace where she stood and Massy yielding to some strange impulse slowly and noiselessly crept up this till he gained a spot only a few yards removed from her The dark shadow of the building almost completely concealed his figure and left him free to contemplate her unnoticed Some event of interest within had withdrawn all from the terrace save herself the whole balcony was suddenly deserted and she alone remained to all seeming lost to the scene around her It was then that she removed her mask and suffering it to fall back on her neck rested her head pensively on her hand Massy bent over eagerly to try and catch sight of her face the effort he made startled her she looked round and he cried out Ida Ida My heart could not deceive me In another instant he had climbed the balcony and was beside her I thought we had parted forever Sebastian said she you told me so on the last night at Massa And so I meant when I said it cried he nor is our meeting now of my planning I came to Florence it is true to see but not to speak with you ere I left Europe forever For three entire days I have searched the city to discover where you lived and chance I have no better name for it chance has led me hither It is an unkind fortune that has made us meet again said she in a voice of deep melancholy I have never known fortune in any other mood said he fiercely When clouds show me the edge of their silver linings I only prepare myself for storm and hurricane I know you have endured much said she in a voice of deeper sadness You know but little of what I have endured rejoined he sternly You saw me taunted indeed with my humble calling insulted for my low birth expelled ignominiously from a house where my presence had been sought for and yet all these grievous enough are little to other evils I have had to bear By what unhappy accident what mischance have you made her your enemy Sebastian She would not even suffer me to speak to you She went so far as to tell me that there was a reason for the dislike one which if she could reveal I would never question How can I tell cried he angrily I was born I suppose under an evil star for nothing prospers with me But can you even guess her reasons said she eagerly No except it be the presumption of one in my condition daring to aspire to one in yours and that as the world goes would be reason enough It is probable too that I did not state these pretensions of mine over delicately I told her with a frankness that was not quite acceptable I was one who could not speak of birth or blood She did not like the coarse word I applied to myself and I will not repeat it and she ventured to suggest that had there not appeared some ambiguity in her own position I could never have so far forgotten mine as to advance such pretensions Well and then cried the girl eagerly Well and then said he deliberately I told her I had heard rumors of the kind she alluded to but to me they carried no significance that it was for you I cared The accidents of life around you had no influence on my choice you might be all that the greatest wealth and highest blood could make you or as poor and ignoble as myself without any change in my affections These said she are the insulting promptings of that English breeding which you say has mixed with your blood and if for no other cause would make me distrust you Stained as it may be said I that same English blood is the best pride I possess She grew pale with passion as I said this but never spoke a word and there we stood staring haughtily at each other till she pointed to the door and so I left her And now Ida who is she that treats me thus disdainfully I ask you not in anger for I know too well how the world regards such as me to presume to question its harsh injustice But tell me I beseech you that she is one to whose station these prejudices are the fitting accompaniments and let me feel that it is less myself as the individual that she wrongs than the class I belong to is that which she despises I can better bear this contumely when I know that it is an instinct If birth and blood can justify a prejudice a Princess of the house of Delia Torre might claim the privilege said the girl haughtily No family of the North at least will dispute with our own in lineage but there are other causes which may warrant all that she feels towards you even more strongly Sebastian This boast of your English origin this it is which has doubtless injured you in her esteem Too much reason has she had to cherish the antipathy Betrayed into a secret marriage by an Englishman who represented himself as of a race noble as her own she was deserted and abandoned by him afterwards This is the terrible mystery which I never dared to tell you and which led us to a life of seclusion at Massa This is the source of that hatred towards all of a nation which she must ever associate with the greatest misfortunes of her life And from this unhappy event was she led to make me take that solemn oath that I spoke of never to link my fortunes with one of that hated land But you told me that you had not made the pledge said he wildly Nor had I then Sebastian but since we last met worked on by solicitation I could not resist tortured by a narrative of such sorrows as I never listened to before I yielded and gave my promise It matters little to me said he gloomily a barrier the more or the less can be of slight moment when there rolls a wide sea between us Had you ever loved me such a pledge had been impossible It was you yourself Sebastian told me we were never to meet again rejoined she Better that we had never done so muttered he Nay perhaps I am wrong added he fiercely this meeting may serve to mark how little there ever was between us Is this cruelty affected Sebastian or is it real It cannot be cruel to echo your own words Besides said he with an air of mockery in the words she who lives in this gorgeous palace surrounded with all the splendors of life can have little complaint to make against the cruelty of fortune How unlike yourself is all this cried she You of all I have ever seen or known understood how to rise above the accidents of fate placing your happiness and your ambitions in a sphere where mere questions of wealth never entered What can have so changed you Before he could reply a sudden movement in the crowd beneath attracted the attention of both and a number of persons who had filled the terrace now passed hurriedly into the salons where to judge from the commotion an event of some importance had occurred Ida lost not a moment in entering when she was met by the words It is she Nina herself is ill some mask a stranger it would seem has said something or threatened something In fact she had been carried to her room in strong convulsions and while some were in search of medical aid for her others not less eagerly were endeavoring to detect the delinquent From the gay and brilliant picture of festivity which was presented but a few minutes back what a change now came over the scene Many hurried away at once shocked at even a momentary shadow on the sunny road of their existence others as anxiously pressed on to recount the incident elsewhere some again moved by curiosity or some better prompting exerted themselves to investigate what amounted to a gross violation of the etiquette of a carnival and thus in the salons on the stairs and in the court itself the greatest bustle and confusion prevailed At length some suggested that the gate of the palace should be closed and none suffered to depart without unmasking The motion was at once adopted and a small knot of persons the friends of the Countess assumed the task of the scrutiny Despite complaints and remonstrances as to the inconvenience and delay thus occasioned they examined every carriage as it passed out None however but faces familiar to the Florentine world were to be met with the well known of every ball and fete were there and if a stranger presented himself he was sure to be one for whom some acquaintance could bear testimony At a fire in one of the smaller salons stood a small group of which the Duc de Brignolles and Major Scaresby formed a part Sentiments of a very different order had detained these two individuals and while the former was deeply moved by the insult offered to the Countess the latter felt an intense desire to probe the circumstance to the bottom Devilish odd it is cried Scaresby here we have been this last hour and a half turning a whole house out of the windows and yet there s no one to tell us what it s all for what it s all about Pardon monsieur said the Duke severely We know that a lady whose hospitality we have been accepting has retired from her company insulted It is very clearly our duty that this should not pass unpunished Oughtn t we to have some clearer insight into what constituted the insult It may have been a practical joke a mauvaise plaisanterie Duke We have no claim to any confidence not extended to us sir said the Frenchman To me it is quite sufficient that the Countess feels aggrieved Not but we shall cut an absurd figure to morrow when we own that we don t know what we were so indignant about Only so many of us as have characters for the latest intelligence To this sally there succeeded a somewhat awkward pause Scaresby occupying himself with thoughts of some perfectly safe vengeance I shouldn t wonder if it was that Count Marsano that fellow who used to be about the Nina long ago come back again He was at Como this summer and made many inquiries after his old love A most insulting stare of defiance was the only reply the old Duke could make to what he would have been delighted to resent as a personal affront Marsano is a mauvais drole said a Russian and if a woman slighted him or he suspected that she did he s the very man to execute a vengeance of the kind I should apply a harsher epithet to a man capable of such conduct said the Duke He d not take it patiently Duke said the other It is precisely in that hope sir that I should employ it said the Duke Again was the conversation assuming a critical turn and again an interval of ominous silence succeeded There is but one carriage now in the court your Excellency said the servant addressing the Duke in a low voice and the gentleman inside appears to be seriously ill It might be better perhaps not to detain him Of course not said the Duke but stay I will go down myself There were still a considerable number of persons on foot in the court when the Duke descended but only one equipage remained a hired carriage at the open door of which a servant was standing holding a glass of water for his master Can I be of any use to your master said the Duke approaching Is he ill I fear he has burst a blood vessel sir said the man He is too weak to answer me Who is it what s his name I am not able to tell you sir I only accompanied him from the hotel Let us have a doctor at once he appears to be dying said the Duke as he placed his fingers on the sick man s wrist Let some one go for a physician There is one here cried a voice I m a doctor and Billy Traynor pushed his way to the spot Come Master Charles get into the coach and help me to lift him out Young Massy obeyed and not without difficulty they succeeded at last in disengaging the almost lifeless form of a man whose dark domino was perfectly saturated with fresh blood his half mask still covered his face and to screen his features from the vulgar gaze of the crowd they suffered it to remain there Up the wide stairs and into a spacious salon they now carried the figure whose drooping head and hanging limbs gave little signs of life They placed him on a sofa and Traynor with a ready hand untied the mask and removed it Merciful Heavens cried he it s my Lord himself The youth bent down gazed for a few seconds at the corpse like face and fell fainting to the floor My Lord Glencore himself said the Duke who was himself an old and attached friend Hush not a word whispered Traynor he s rallyin he s comin to don t utter a syllable Slowly and languidly the dying man raised his eyelids and gazed at each of those around him From their faces he turned his gaze to the chamber viewing the walls and the ceiling all in turn and then in an accent barely audible he said Where am I Amongst friends who love and will cherish you dear Glencore said the Duke affectionately Ah Brignolles I remember you And this who is this Traynor my Lord Billy Traynor that will never leave you while he can serve you Whose tears are those upon my hand I feel them hot and burning said the sick man and Billy stepped back that the light should fall upon the figure that knelt beside him Don t cry poor fellow said Glencore it must be a hard world or you have many better and dearer friends than I could have ever been to you Who is this Billy tried but could not answer Tell him if you know who it is see how wild and excited it has made him cried the Duke for stretching out both hands Glencore had caught the boy s face on either side and continued to gaze on it in wild eagerness It is it is cried he pressing it to his bosom and kissing the forehead over and over again Whom does he fancy it Whom does he suspect This is look Brignolles cried the dying man in a voice already thick with a death rattle this is the seventh Lord Viscount Glencore I declare it And now He fell back and never spoke more A single shudder shook his feeble frame and he was dead We have had occasion once before in this veracious history to speak of the polite oblivion Florentine society so well understands to throw over the course of events which might cloud even for a moment the sunny surface of its enjoyment No people so far as we know have greater gifts in this way to shroud the disagreeables of life in decent shadow to ignore or forget them is their grand prerogative Scarcely therefore had three weeks elapsed than the terrible catastrophe at the Palazzo della Torre was totally consigned to the bygones it ceased to be thought or spoken of and was as much matter of remote history as an incident in the times of one of the Medici Too much interested in the future to waste time on the past they launched into speculations as to whether the Countess would be likely to marry again what change the late event might effect in the amount of her fortune and how far her position in the world might be altered by the incident He who in the ordinary esteem of society would have felt less acutely than his neighbors for Glencore s sad fate Upton was in reality deeply and sincerely affected The traits which make a consummate man of the world one whose prerogative it is to appreciate others and be able to guide and influence their actions are in truth very high and rare gifts and imply resources of fine sentiment as fully as stores of intellectual wealth Upton sorrowed over Glencore as for one whose noble nature had been poisoned by an impetuous temper and over whose best instincts an ungovernable self esteem had ever held the mastery They had been friends almost from boyhood and the very worldliest of men can feel the bitterness of that isolation in which the turn of life too frequently commences Such friendships are never made in later life We lend our affections when young on very small security and though it is true we are occasionally unfortunate we do now and then make a safe investment No men are more prone to attach an exaggerated value to early friendships than those who stirred by strong ambitions and animated by high resolves have played for the great stakes in the world s lottery Too much immersed in the cares and contests of life to find time to contract close personal attachments they fall back upon the memory of school or college days to supply the want of their hearts There is a sophistry too that seduces them to believe that then at least they were loved for what they were for qualities of their nature not for accidents of station or the proud rewards of success There is also another and a very strange element in the pleasure such memories afford Our early attachments serve as points of departure by which we measure the distance we have travelled in life Ay say we we were schoolfellows I remember how he took the lead of me in this or that science how far behind he left me in such a thing and yet look at us now Upton had very often to fall back upon similar recollections neither his school nor his college life had been remarkable for distinction but it was always perceived that every attainment he achieved was such as would be available in after life Nor did he ever burden himself with the toils of scholarship while there lay within his reach stores of knowledge that might serve to contest the higher and greater prizes that he had already set before his ambition But let us return to himself as alone and sorrow struck he sat in his room of the Hotel d Italie Various cares and duties consequent on Glencore s death had devolved entirely upon him Young Massy had suddenly disappeared from Florence on the morning after the funeral and was seen no more and Upton was the only one who could discharge any of the necessary duties of such a moment The very nature of the task thus imposed upon him had its own depressing influence on his mind the gloomy pomp of death the terrible companionship between affliction and worldliness the tear of the mourner the heart broken sigh drowned in the sharp knock of the coffin maker He had gone through it all and sat moodily pondering over the future when Madame de Sabloukoff entered She s much better this morning and I think we can go over and dine with her to day said she removing her shawl and taking a seat He gave a little easy smile that seemed assent but did not speak I perceive you have not opened your letters this morning said she turning towards the table littered over with letters and despatches of every size and shape This seems to be from the King is that his mode of writing G R in the corner So it is said Upton faintly Will you be kind enough to read it for me Pavilion Brighton Dear Upton Let me be the first to congratulate you on an appointment which it affords me the greatest pleasure to confirm What does he allude to cried she stopping suddenly while a slight tinge of color showed surprise and a little displeasure perhaps mingled in her emotions I have not the very remotest conception said Upton calmly Let us see what that large despatch contains it comes from the Duke of Agecombe Oh said he with a great effort to appear as calm and unmoved as possible I see what it is they have given me India India exclaimed she in amazement I mean my dear Princess they have given me the Governor Generalship Which of course you would not accept Why not pray India It is banishment barbarism isolation from all that really interests or embellishes existence a despotism that is wanting in the only element which gives a despot dignity that he founds or strengthens a dynasty No no charming Princess said he smiling it is a very glorious sovereignty with unlimited resources and a very handsome stipend Which therefore you do not decline said she with a very peculiar smile With your companionship I should call it a paradise said he And without such Such a sacrifice as one must never shrink from at the call of duty said he bowing profoundly The Princess dined that day with the Countess of Glencore and Sir Horace Upton journeyed towards England CHAPTER LIV THE END Tears have gone over and once more it is for the last time we come back to the old castle in the West beside the estuary of the Killeries Neglect and ruin have made heavy inroads on it The battlements of the great tower have fallen Of the windows the stormy winds of the Atlantic have left only the stone mullions The terrace is cumbered with loose stones and fallen masonry Not a trace of the garden remains save in the chance presence of some flowering plant or shrub half choked by weeds and wearing out a sad existence in uncared for solitude The entrance gate is closely barred and fastened but a low portal in a side wing lies open entering by which we can view the dreary desolation within The apartments once inhabited by Lord Glencore are all dismantled and empty The wind and the rain sweep at will along the vaulted corridors and through the deep arched chambers Of the damp discolored walls and ceilings large patches litter the floors with fragments of stucco and carved architraves One small chamber on the ground floor maintains a habitable aspect Here a bed and a few articles of furniture some kitchen utensils and a little bookshelf all neatly and orderly arranged show that some one calls this a home Sad and lonely enough is it Not a sound to break the weary stillness save the deep roar of the heavy sea not a living voice save the wild shrill cry of the osprey as he soars above the barren cliffs It is winter and what desolation can be deeper or gloomier The sea sent mists wrap the mountains and even the lough itself in their vapory shroud The cold thin rain falls unceasingly a cheerless damp and heavy atmosphere dwells even within doors and the gray half light gives a shadowy indistinctness even to objects at hand disposing the mind to sad and dreary imaginings In a deep straw chair beside the turf fire sits a very old man with a large square volume upon his knee Dwarfed by nature and shrunk by years there is something of almost goblin semblance in the bright lustre of his dark eyes and the rapid motion of his lips as he reads to himself half aloud The almost wild energy of his features has survived the wear and tear of time and old as he is there is about him a dash of vigor that seems to defy age Poor Billy Traynor is now upwards of eighty but his faculties are clear his memory unclouded and like Moses his eye not dimmed The Three Chronicles of Loughdooner in which he is reading is the history of the Glencores and contains amongst its family records many curious predictions and prophecies The heirs of that ancient house were from time immemorial the sport of fortune enduring vicissitudes without end No reverses seemed ever too heavy to rally from no depth of evil fate too deep for them to extricate themselves Involved in difficulties innumerable engaged in plots conspiracies luckless undertakings abortive enterprises still they contrived to survive all around them and come out with indeed ruined fortunes and beggared estate but still with life and with what is the next to life itself an unconquerable energy of character It was in the encouragement of these gifts that Billy now sought for what cheered the last declining days of his solitary life His lord as he ever called him had been for years and years away in a distant colony living under another name Dwelling amongst the rough settlers of a wild remote tract a few brief lines at long intervals were the only tidings that assured Billy he was yet living yet were they enough to convince him coupled with the hereditary traits of his house that some one day or other he would come back again to resume his proud place and the noble name of his ancestors More than once had it been the fate of the Glencores to see the hearth cold and the roof tree blackened and Billy now muttered the lines of an old chronicle where such a destiny was bewailed Where are the voices whispering low Of lovers side by side And where the haughty dames who swept Thy terraces in pride Where is the wild and joyous mirth That drown d th Atlantic s roar Making the rafters ring again With welcome to Glencore And where s the step of belted knight That strode the massive floor And where s the laugh of lady bright We used to hear of yore The hound that bayed the prancing steed Impatient at the door May bide the time for many a year They ll never see Glencore And he came back after all Lord Hugo and was taken prisoner at Ormond by Cromwell and sentenced to death said Billy Sentenced to death but never shot Nobody knew why or ever will know After years and years of exile he came back and was at the Court of Charles but never liked they say dangerous That s exactly the word dangerous He started up from his revery and taking his stick issued from the room The mist was beginning to rise and he took his way towards the shore of the lough through the wet and tangled grass It was a long and toilsome walk for one so old as he was but he went manfully onward and at last reached the little jetty where the boats from the mainland were wont to put in All was cheerless and leaden hued over the wide waste of water a surging swell swept heavily along but not a sail was to be seen Far across the lough he could descry the harbor of Leenane where the boats were at anchor and see the lazy smoke as it slowly rose in the thick atmosphere Seated on a stone at the water s edge Billy watched long and patiently his eyes turning at times towards the bleak mountain road which for miles was visible At last with a weary sigh he arose and muttering He won t come to day turned back again to his lonely home To this hour he lives and waits the coming of
