I was only three And Teddy would run to the rainbow s foot Because he was five and a man And that s how it all began my dears And that s how it all began Big Barn Stories WHAT do you think she d do if she caught us We oughtn t to have it you know said Maisie Beat me and lock you up in your bedroom Dick answered without hesitation Have you got the cartridges Yes they re in my pocket but they are joggling horribly Do pin fire cartridges go off of their own accord Don t know Take the revolver if you are afraid and let me carry them I m not afraid Maisie strode forward swiftly a hand in her pocket and her chin in the air Dick followed with a small pin fire revolver The children had discovered that their lives would be unendurable without pistol practice After much forethought and self denial Dick had saved seven shillings and sixpence the price of a badly constructed Belgian revolver Maisie could only contribute half a crown to the syndicate for the purchase of a hundred cartridges You can save better than I can Dick she explained I like nice things to eat and it doesn t matter to you Besides boys ought to do these things Dick grumbled a little at the arrangement but went out and made the purchase which the children were then on their way to test Revolvers did not lie in the scheme of their daily life as decreed for them by the guardian who was incorrectly supposed to stand in the place of a mother to these two orphans Dick had been under her care for six years during which time she had made her profit of the allowances supposed to be expended on his clothes and partly through thoughtlessness partly through a natural desire to pain she was a widow of some years anxious to marry again had made his days burdensome on his young shoulders Where he had looked for love she gave him first aversion and then hate Where he growing older had sought a little sympathy she gave him ridicule The many hours that she could spare from the ordering of her small house she devoted to what she called the home training of Dick Heldar Her religion manufactured in the main by her own intelligence and a keen study of the Scriptures was an aid to her in this matter At such times as she herself was not personally displeased with Dick she left him to understand that he had a heavy account to settle with his Creator wherefore Dick learned to loathe his God as intensely as he loathed missus Jennett and this is not a wholesome frame of mind for the young Since she chose to regard him as a hopeless liar but an economical and self contained one never throwing away the least unnecessary fib and never hesitating at the blackest were it only plausible that might make his life a little easier The treatment taught him at least the power of living alone a power that was of service to him when he went to a public school and the boys laughed at his clothes which were poor in quality and much mended In the holidays he returned to the teachings of missus Jennett and that the chain of discipline might not be weakened by association with the world was generally beaten on one account or another before he had been twelve hours under her roof The autumn of one year brought him a companion in bondage a long haired gray eyed little atom as self contained as himself who moved about the house silently and for the first few weeks spoke only to the goat that was her chiefest friend on earth and lived in the back garden missus Jennett objected to the goat on the grounds that he was un Christian which he certainly was Then said the atom choosing her words very deliberately I shall write to my lawyer peoples and tell them that you are a very bad woman Amomma is mine mine mine missus Jennett made a movement to the hall where certain umbrellas and canes stood in a rack The atom understood as clearly as Dick what this meant I have been beaten before she said still in the same passionless voice I have been beaten worse than you can ever beat me If you beat me I shall write to my lawyer peoples and tell them that you do not give me enough to eat I am not afraid of you missus Jennett did not go into the hall and the atom after a pause to assure herself that all danger of war was past went out to weep bitterly on Amomma s neck Dick learned to know her as Maisie and at first mistrusted her profoundly for he feared that she might interfere with the small liberty of action left to him She did not however and she volunteered no friendliness until Dick had taken the first steps Long before the holidays were over the stress of punishment shared in common drove the children together if it were only to play into each other s hands as they prepared lies for missus Jennett s use When Dick returned to school Maisie whispered Now I shall be all alone to take care of myself but and she nodded her head bravely I can do it You promised to send Amomma a grass collar Send it soon A week later she asked for that collar by return of post and was not pleased when she learned that it took time to make When at last Dick forwarded the gift she forgot to thank him for it Many holidays had come and gone since that day and Dick had grown into a lanky hobbledehoy more than ever conscious of his bad clothes Not for a moment had missus Jennett relaxed her tender care of him but the average canings of a public school Dick fell under punishment about three times a month filled him with contempt for her powers She doesn t hurt he explained to Maisie who urged him to rebellion and she is kinder to you after she has whacked me Dick shambled through the days unkempt in body and savage in soul as the smaller boys of the school learned to know for when the spirit moved him he would hit them cunningly and with science The same spirit made him more than once try to tease Maisie but the girl refused to be made unhappy We are both miserable as it is said she What is the use of trying to make things worse Let s find things to do and forget things The pistol was the outcome of that search It could only be used on the muddiest foreshore of the beach far away from the bathing machines and pierheads below the grassy slopes of Fort Keeling The tide ran out nearly two miles on that coast and the many coloured mud banks touched by the sun sent up a lamentable smell of dead weed It was late in the afternoon when Dick and Maisie arrived on their ground Amomma trotting patiently behind them Mf said Maisie sniffing the air I wonder what makes the sea so smelly I don t like it You never like anything that isn t made just for you said Dick bluntly Give me the cartridges and I ll try first shot How far does one of these little revolvers carry Oh half a mile said Maisie promptly At least it makes an awful noise Be careful with the cartridges I don t like those jagged stick up things on the rim Dick do be careful All right I know how to load I ll fire at the breakwater out there He fired and Amomma ran away bleating The bullet threw up a spurt of mud to the right of the wood wreathed piles Throws high and to the right You try Maisie Mind it s loaded all round Maisie took the pistol and stepped delicately to the verge of the mud her hand firmly closed on the butt her mouth and left eye screwed up Dick sat down on a tuft of bank and laughed Amomma returned very cautiously He was accustomed to strange experiences in his afternoon walks and finding the cartridge box unguarded made investigations with his nose Maisie fired but could not see where the bullet went I think it hit the post she said shading her eyes and looking out across the sailless sea I know it has gone out to the Marazion Bell buoy said Dick with a chuckle Fire low and to the left then perhaps you ll get it Oh look at Amomma he s eating the cartridges Maisie turned the revolver in her hand just in time to see Amomma scampering away from the pebbles Dick threw after him Nothing is sacred to a billy goat Being well fed and the adored of his mistress Amomma had naturally swallowed two loaded pin fire cartridges Maisie hurried up to assure herself that Dick had not miscounted the tale Yes he s eaten two Horrid little beast Then they ll joggle about inside him and blow up and serve him right Oh Dick have I killed you Revolvers are tricky things for young hands to deal with Maisie could not explain how it had happened but a veil of reeking smoke separated her from Dick and she was quite certain that the pistol had gone off in his face Then she heard him sputter and dropped on her knees beside him crying Dick you aren t hurt are you I didn t

none	none	it Of course you didn t said Dick coming out of the smoke and wiping his cheek But you nearly blinded me That powder stuff stings awfully A neat little splash of gray led on a stone showed where the bullet had gone Maisie began to whimper Don t said Dick jumping to his feet and shaking himself I m not a bit hurt No but I might have killed you protested Maisie the corners of her mouth drooping What should I have done then Gone home and told missus Jennett Dick grinned at the thought then softening Please don t worry about it Besides we are wasting time We ve got to get back to tea I ll take the revolver for a bit Maisie would have wept on the least encouragement but Dick s indifference albeit his hand was shaking as he picked up the pistol restrained her She lay panting on the beach while Dick methodically bombarded the breakwater Got it at last he exclaimed as a lock of weed flew from the wood Let me try said Maisie imperiously I m all right now They fired in turns till the rickety little revolver nearly shook itself to pieces and Amomma the outcast because he might blow up at any moment browsed in the background and wondered why stones were thrown at him Then they found a balk of timber floating in a pool which was commanded by the seaward slope of Fort Keeling and they sat down together before this new target Next holidays said Dick as the now thoroughly fouled revolver kicked wildly in his hand we ll get another pistol central fire that will carry farther There won t be any next holidays for me said Maisie I m going away Where to I don t know My lawyers have written to missus Jennett and I ve got to be educated somewhere in France perhaps I don t know where but I shall be glad to go away I shan t like it a bit I suppose I shall be left Look here Maisie is it really true you re going Then these holidays will be the last I shall see anything of you and I go back to school next week I wish The young blood turned his cheeks scarlet Maisie was picking grass tufts and throwing them down the slope at a yellow sea poppy nodding all by itself to the illimitable levels of the mud flats and the milk white sea beyond I wish she said after a pause that I could see you again sometime You wish that too Yes but it would have been better if if you had shot straight over there down by the breakwater Maisie looked with large eyes for a moment And this was the boy who only ten days before had decorated Amomma s horns with cut paper ham frills and turned him out a bearded derision among the public ways Then she dropped her eyes this was not the boy Don t be stupid she said reprovingly and with swift instinct attacked the side issue How selfish you are Just think what I should have felt if that horrid thing had killed you I m quite miserable enough already Why Because you re going away from missus Jennett No From me then No answer for a long time Dick dared not look at her He felt though he did not know all that the past four years had been to him and this the more acutely since he had no knowledge to put his feelings in words I don t know she said I suppose it is Maisie you must know I m not supposing

none	none	said Maisie weakly But Dick was not minded to retreat I can t say things he pleaded and I m awfully sorry for teasing you about Amomma the other day It s all different now Maisie can t you see And you might have told me that you were going instead of leaving me to find out You didn t I did tell Oh Dick what s the use of worrying There isn t any but we ve been together years and years and I didn t know how much I cared I don t believe you ever did care No I didn t but I do I care awfully now Maisie he gulped Maisie darling say you care too please I do indeed I do but it won t be any use Why Because I am going away Yes but if you promise before you go Only say will you A second darling came to his lips more easily than the first There were few endearments in Dick s home or school life he had to find them by instinct Dick caught the little hand blackened with the escaped gas of the revolver I promise she said solemnly but if I care there is no need for promising And do you care For the first time in the past few minutes their eyes met and spoke for them who had no skill in speech Oh Dick don t Please don t It was all right when we said good morning but now it s all different Amomma looked on from afar He had seen his property quarrel frequently but he had never seen kisses exchanged before The yellow sea poppy was wiser and nodded its head approvingly Considered as a kiss that was a failure but since it was the first other than those demanded by duty in all the world that either had ever given or taken it opened to them new worlds and every one of them glorious so that they were lifted above the consideration of any worlds at all especially those in which tea is necessary and sat still holding each other s hands and saying not a word You can t forget now said Dick at last There was that on his cheek that stung more than gunpowder I shouldn t have forgotten anyhow said Maisie and they looked at each other and saw that each was changed from the companion of an hour ago to a wonder and a mystery they could not understand The sun began to set and a night wind thrashed along the bents of the foreshore We shall be awfully late for tea said Maisie Let s go home Let s use the rest of the cartridges first said Dick and he helped Maisie down the slope of the fort to the sea a descent that she was quite capable of covering at full speed Equally gravely Maisie took the grimy hand Dick bent forward clumsily Maisie drew the hand away and Dick blushed It s very pretty he said Pooh said Maisie with a little laugh of gratified vanity She stood close to Dick as he loaded the revolver for the last time and fired over the sea with a vague notion at the back of his head that he was protecting Maisie from all the evils in the world A puddle far across the mud caught the last rays of the sun and turned into a wrathful red disc The light held Dick s attention for a moment and as he raised his revolver there fell upon him a renewed sense of the miraculous in that he was standing by Maisie who had promised to care for him for an indefinite length of time till such date as A gust of the growing wind drove the girl s long black hair across his face as she stood with her hand on his shoulder calling Amomma a little beast and for a moment he was in the dark a darkness that stung The bullet went singing out to the empty sea Spoilt my aim said he shaking his head There aren t any more cartridges we shall have to run home But they did not run They walked very slowly arm in arm And it was a matter of indifference to them whether the neglected Amomma with two pin fire cartridges in his inside blew up or trotted beside them for they had come into a golden heritage and were disposing of it with all the wisdom of all their years And I shall be quoth Dick valiantly Then he checked himself I don t know what I shall be I don t seem to be able to pass any exams but I can make awful caricatures of the masters Ho Ho Be an artist then said Maisie You re always laughing at my trying to draw and it will do you good I ll never laugh at anything you do he answered I ll be an artist and I ll do things Artists always want money don t they I ve got a hundred and twenty pounds a year of my own My guardians tell me I m to have it when I come of age That will be enough to begin with Ah I m rich said Maisie I ve got three hundred a year all my own when I m twenty one That s why missus Jennett is kinder

none	none	than she is to you I wish though that I had somebody that belonged to me just a father or a mother You belong to me said Dick for ever and ever Yes we belong for ever It s very nice She squeezed his arm The kindly darkness hid them both and emboldened because he could only just see the profile of Maisie s cheek with the long lashes veiling the gray eyes Dick at the front door delivered himself of the words he had been boggling over for the last two hours And I love you Maisie he said in a whisper that seemed to him to ring across the world the world that he would to morrow or the next day set out to conquer There was a scene not for the sake of discipline to be reported when missus Jennett would have fallen upon him first for disgraceful unpunctuality and secondly for nearly killing himself with a forbidden weapon I was playing with it and it went off by itself said Dick when the powder pocked cheek could no longer be hidden but if you think you re going to lick me you re wrong You are never going to touch me again

none	none	and give me my tea You can t cheat us out of that anyhow missus Jennett gasped and became livid Maisie said nothing but encouraged Dick with her eyes and he behaved abominably all that evening missus Jennett prophesied an immediate judgment of Providence and a descent into Tophet later but Dick walked in Paradise and would not hear Only when he was going to bed missus Jennett recovered and asserted herself He had bidden Maisie good night with down dropped eyes and from a distance If you aren t a gentleman you might try to behave like one said missus Jennett spitefully You ve been quarrelling with Maisie again This meant that the usual good night kiss had been omitted Maisie white to the lips thrust her cheek forward with a fine air of indifference and was duly pecked by Dick who tramped out of the room red as fire That night he dreamed a wild dream He had won all the world and brought it to Maisie in a cartridge box but she turned it over with her foot and instead of saying Thank you cried Where is the grass collar you promised for Amomma Oh how selfish you are CHAPTER II Then we brought the lances down then the bugles blew When we went to Kandahar ridin two an two Ridin ridin ridin two an two Ta ra ra ra ra ra ra All the way to Kandahar ridin two an two Barrack Room Ballad I M NOT angry with the British public but I wish we had a few thousand of them scattered among these rooks They wouldn t be in such a hurry to get at their morning papers then Can t you imagine the regulation householder Lover of Justice Constant Reader Paterfamilias and all that lot frizzling on hot gravel With a blue veil over his head and his clothes in strips Has any man here a needle I ve got a piece of sugar sack I ll lend you a packing needle for six square inches of it then Both my knees are worn through Why not six square acres while you re about it But lend me the needle and I ll see what I can do with the selvage I don t think there s enough to protect my royal body from the cold blast as it is What are you doing with that everlasting sketch book of yours Dick Study of our Special Correspondent repairing his wardrobe said Dick gravely as the other man kicked off a pair of sorely worn riding breeches and began to fit a square of coarse canvas over the most obvious open space He grunted disconsolately as the vastness of the void developed itself Sugar bags indeed Hi you pilot man there lend me all the sails for that whale boat A fez crowned head bobbed up in the stern sheets divided itself into exact halves with one flashing grin and bobbed down again The man of the tattered breeches clad only in a Norfolk jacket and a gray flannel shirt went on with his clumsy sewing while Dick chuckled over the sketch Some twenty whale boats were nuzzling a sand bank which was dotted with English soldiery of half a dozen corps bathing or washing their clothes A heap of boat rollers commissariat boxes sugar bags and flour and small arm ammunition cases showed where one of the whale boats had been compelled to unload hastily and a regimental carpenter was swearing aloud as he tried on a wholly insufficient allowance of white lead to plaster up the sun parched gaping seams of the boat herself First the bloomin rudder snaps said he to the world in general then the mast goes an then s help me when she can t do nothin else she opens erself out like a cock eyes Chinese lotus Exactly the case with my breeches whoever you are said the tailor without looking up Dick I wonder when I shall see a decent shop again

none	none	save the incessant angry murmur of the Nile as it raced round a basalt walled bend and foamed across a rock ridge half a mile upstream It was as though the brown weight of the river would drive the white men back to their own country The indescribable scent of Nile mud in the air told that the stream was falling and the next few miles would be no light thing for the whale boats to overpass The desert ran down almost to the banks where among gray red and black hillocks a camel corps was encamped No man dared even for a day lose touch of the slow moving boats there had been no fighting for weeks past and throughout all that time the Nile had never spared them Rapid had followed rapid rock rock and island group island group till the rank and file had long since lost all count of direction and very nearly of time They were moving somewhere they did not know why to do something they did not know what Before them lay the Nile and at the other end of it was one Gordon fighting for the dear life in a town called Khartoum There were columns of British troops in the desert or in one of the many deserts there were yet more columns waiting to embark on the river there were fresh drafts waiting at Assioot and Assuan there were lies and rumours running over the face of the hopeless land from Suakin to the Sixth Cataract and men supposed generally that there must be some one in authority to direct the general scheme of the many movements The duty of that particular river column was to keep the whale boats afloat in the water to avoid trampling on the villagers crops when the gangs tracked the boats with lines thrown from midstream to get as much sleep and food as was possible and above all to press on without delay in the teeth of the churning Nile With the soldiers sweated and toiled the correspondents of the newspapers and they were almost as ignorant as their companions But it was above all things necessary that England at breakfast should be amused and thrilled and interested whether Gordon lived or died or half the British army went to pieces in the sands The Soudan campaign was a picturesque one and lent itself to vivid word painting Now and again a Special managed to get slain which was not altogether a disadvantage to the paper that employed him and more often the hand to hand nature of the fighting allowed of miraculous escapes which were worth telegraphing home at eighteenpence the word There were many correspondents with many corps and columns from the veterans who had followed on the heels of the cavalry that occupied Cairo in eighty two what time Arabi Pasha called himself king who had seen the first miserable work round Suakin when the sentries were cut up nightly and the scrub swarmed with spears to youngsters jerked into the business at the end of a telegraph wire to take the places of their betters killed or invalided Among the seniors those who knew every shift and change in the perplexing postal arrangements the value of the seediest weediest Egyptian garron offered for sale in Cairo or Alexandria who could talk a telegraph clerk into amiability and soothe the ruffled vanity of a newly appointed staff officer when press regulations became burdensome was the man in the flannel shirt the black browed Torpenhow He represented the Central Southern Syndicate in the campaign as he had represented it in the Egyptian war and elsewhere The syndicate did not concern itself greatly with criticisms of attack and the like It supplied the masses and all it demanded was picturesqueness and abundance of detail for there is more joy in England over a soldier who insubordinately steps out of square to rescue a comrade than over twenty generals slaving even to baldness at the gross details of transport and commissariat He had met at Suakin a young man sitting on the edge of a recently abandoned redoubt about the size of a hat box sketching a clump of shell torn bodies on the gravel plain What are you for said Torpenhow The greeting of the correspondent is that of the commercial traveller on the road My own hand said the young man without looking up Have you any tobacco Torpenhow waited till the sketch was finished and when he had looked at it said What s your business here Nothing there was a row so I came I m supposed to be doing something down at the painting slips among the boats or else I m in charge of the condenser on one of the water ships I ve forgotten which You ve cheek enough to build a redoubt with said Torpenhow and took stock of the new acquaintance Do you always draw like that The young man produced more sketches Row on a Chinese pig boat said he sententiously showing them one after another Chief mate dirked by a comprador Junk ashore off Hakodate Somali muleteer being flogged Star shelled bursting over camp at Berbera Slave dhow being chased round Tajurrah Bah Soldier lying dead in the moonlight outside Suakin throat cut by Fuzzies H m said Torpenhow can t say I care for Verestchagin and water myself but there s no accounting for tastes Doing anything now are you No I m amusing myself here Torpenhow looked at the sketches again and nodded Yes you re right to take your first chance when you can get it He rode away swiftly through the Gate of the Two War Ships rattled across the causeway into the town and wired to his syndicate Got man here picture work Good and cheap Shall I arrange Will do letterpress with sketches The man on the redoubt sat swinging his legs and murmuring I knew the chance would come sooner or later By Gad they ll have to sweat for it if I come through this business alive In the evening Torpenhow was able to announce to his friend that the Central Southern Agency was willing to take him on trial paying expenses for three months And by the way what s your name said Torpenhow Heldar Do they give me a free hand They ve taken you on chance You must justify the choice You d better stick to me I m going up country with a column and I ll do what I can for you Give me some of your sketches taken here and I ll send em along To himself he said That s the best bargain the Central southern has ever made and they got me cheaply enough So it came to pass that after some purchase of horse flesh and arrangements financial and political Dick was made free of the New and Honourable Fraternity of war correspondents who all possess the inalienable right of doing as much work as they can and getting as much for it as Providence and their owners shall please To these things are added in time if the brother be worthy the power of glib speech that neither man nor woman can resist when a meal or a bed is in question the eye of a horse cope the skill of a cook the constitution of a bullock the digestion of an ostrich and an infinite adaptability to all circumstances But many die before they attain to this degree and the past masters in the craft appear for the most part in dress clothes when they are in England and thus their glory is hidden from the multitude Dick followed Torpenhow wherever the latter s fancy chose to lead him and between the two they managed to accomplish some work that almost satisfied themselves It was not an easy life in any way and under its influence the two were drawn very closely together for they ate from the same dish they shared the same water bottle and most binding tie of all their mails went off together It was Dick who managed to make gloriously drunk a telegraph clerk in a palm hut far beyond the Second Cataract and while the man lay in bliss on the floor possessed himself of some laboriously acquired exclusive information forwarded by a confiding correspondent of an opposition syndicate made a careful duplicate of the matter and brought the result to Torpenhow who said that all was fair in love or war correspondence and built an excellent descriptive article from his rival s riotous waste of words It was Torpenhow who but the tale of their adventures together and apart from Philae to the waste wilderness of Herawi and Muella would fill many books They had been penned into a square side by side in deadly fear of being shot by over excited soldiers they had fought with baggage camels in the chill dawn they had jogged along in silence under blinding sun on indefatigable little Egyptian horses and they had floundered on the shallows of the Nile when the whale boat in which they had found a berth chose to hit a hidden rock and rip out half her bottom planks Now they were sitting on the sand bank and the whale boats were bringing up the remainder of the column Yes said Torpenhow as he put the last rude stitches into his over long neglected gear it has been a beautiful business The patch or the campaign said Dick Don t think much of either myself You want the Euryalus brought up above the Third Cataract don t you and eighty one ton guns at Jakdul Now I m quite satisfied with my breeches He turned round gravely to exhibit himself after the manner of a clown It s very pretty Specially the lettering on the sack G B T Government Bullock Train That s a sack from India It s my initials Gilbert Belling Torpenhow I stole the cloth on purpose What the mischief are the camel corps doing yonder Torpenhow shaded his eyes and looked across the scrub strewn gravel A bugle blew furiously and the men on the bank hurried to their arms and accoutrements Pisan soldiery surprised while bathing remarked Dick calmly D you remember the picture It s by Michael Angelo all beginners copy it That scrub s alive with enemy The camel corps on the bank yelled to the infantry to come to them and a hoarse shouting down the river showed that the remainder of the column had wind of the trouble and was hastening to take share in it As swiftly as a reach of still water is crisped by the wind the rock strewn ridges and scrub topped hills were troubled and alive with armed men Mercifully it occurred to these to stand far off for a time to shout and gesticulate joyously One man even delivered himself of a long story The camel corps did not fire They were only too glad of a little breathing space until some sort of square could be formed The men on the sand bank ran to their side and the whale boats as they toiled up within shouting distance were thrust into the nearest bank and emptied of all save the sick and a few men to guard them The Arab orator ceased his outcries and his friends howled They look like the Mahdi s men said Torpenhow elbowing himself into the crush of the square but what thousands of em there are The tribes hereabout aren t against us I know Then the Mahdi s taken another town said Dick and set all these yelping devils free to show us up Lend us your glass Our scouts should have told us of this We ve been trapped said a subaltern Aren t the camel guns ever going to begin Hurry up you men There was no need of any order The men flung themselves panting against the sides of the square for they had good reason to know that whoso was left outside when the fighting began would very probably die in an extremely unpleasant fashion The little hundred and fifty pound camel guns posted at one corner of the square opened the ball as the square moved forward by its right to get possession of a knoll of rising ground All had fought in this manner many times before and there was no novelty in the entertainment always the same hot and stifling formation the smell of dust and leather the same boltlike rush of the enemy the same pressure on the weakest side the few minutes of hand to hand scuffle and then the silence of the desert broken only by the yells of those whom their handful of cavalry attempted to purse They had become careless The camel guns spoke at intervals and the square slouched forward amid the protesting of the camels Then came the attack of three thousand men who had not learned from books that it is impossible for troops in close order to attack against breech loading fire A few dropping shots heralded their approach and a few horsemen led but the bulk of the force was naked humanity mad with rage and armed with the spear and the sword The instinct of the desert where there is always much war told them that the right flank of the square was the weakest for they swung clear of the front The camel guns shelled them as they passed and opened for an instant lanes through their midst most like those quick closing vistas in a Kentish hop garden seen when the train races by at full speed and the infantry fire held till the opportune moment dropped them in close packing hundreds No civilised troops in the world could have endured the hell through which they came the living leaping high to avoid the dying who clutched at their heels the wounded cursing and staggering forward till they fell a torrent black as the sliding water above a mill dam full on the right flank of the square Then the line of the dusty troops and the faint blue desert sky overhead went out in rolling smoke and the little stones on the heated ground and the tinder dry clumps of scrub became matters of surpassing interest for men measured their agonised retreat and recovery by these things counting mechanically and hewing their way back to chosen pebble and branch There was no semblance of any concerted fighting For aught the men knew the enemy might be attempting all four sides of the square at once Their business was to destroy what lay in front of them to bayonet in the back those who passed over them and dying to drag down the slayer till he could be knocked on the head by some avenging gun butt Dick waited with Torpenhow and a young doctor till the stress grew unendurable It was hopeless to attend to the wounded till the attack was repulsed so the three moved forward gingerly towards the weakest side of the square There was a rush from without the short hough hough of the stabbing spears and a man on a horse followed by thirty or forty others dashed through yelling and hacking The right flank of the square sucked in after them and the other sides sent help The wounded who knew that they had but a few hours more to live caught at the enemy s feet and brought them down or staggering into a discarded rifle fired blindly into the scuffle that raged in the centre of the square Dick was conscious that somebody had cut him violently across his helmet that he had fired his revolver into a black foam flecked face which forthwith ceased to bear any resemblance to a face and that Torpenhow had gone down under an Arab whom he had tried to collar low and was turning over and over with his captive feeling for the man s eyes The doctor jabbed at a venture with a bayonet and a helmetless soldier fired over Dick s shoulder the flying grains of powder stung his cheek It was to Torpenhow that Dick turned by instinct The representative of the Central Southern Syndicate had shaken himself clear of his enemy and rose wiping his thumb on his trousers The Arab both hands to his forehead screamed aloud then snatched up his spear and rushed at Torpenhow who was panting under shelter of Dick s revolver Dick fired twice and the man dropped limply His upturned face lacked one eye The musketry fire redoubled but cheers mingled with it The rush had failed and the enemy were flying If the heart of the square were shambles the ground beyond was a butcher s shop Dick thrust his way forward between the maddened men The remnant of the enemy were retiring as the few the very few English cavalry rode down the laggards Beyond the lines of the dead a broad blood stained Arab spear cast aside in the retreat lay across a stump of scrub and beyond this again the illimitable dark levels of the desert The sun caught the steel and turned it into a red disc Some one behind him was saying Ah get away you brute Dick raised his revolver and pointed towards the desert His eye was held by the red splash in the distance and the clamour about him seemed to die down to a very far away whisper like the whisper of a level sea There was the revolver and the red light and the voice of some one scaring something away exactly as had fallen somewhere before a darkness that stung He fired at random and the bullet went out across the desert as he muttered Spoilt my aim There aren t any more cartridges We shall have to run home He put his hand to his head and brought it away covered with blood Old man you re cut rather badly said Torpenhow I owe you something for this business Thanks Stand up I say you can t be ill here Throughout the night when the troops were encamped by the whale boats a black figure danced in the strong moonlight on the sand bar and shouted that Khartoum the accursed one was dead was dead was dead that two steamers were rock staked on the Nile outside the city and that of all their crews there remained not one and Khartoum was dead was dead was dead But Torpenhow took no heed He was watching Dick who called aloud to the restless Nile for Maisie and again Maisie Behold a phenomenon said Torpenhow rearranging the blanket Here is a man presumably human who mentions the name of one woman only And I ve seen a good deal of delirium too Dick here s some fizzy drink Thank you Maisie said Dick CHAPTER III So he thinks he shall take to the sea again For one more cruise with his buccaneers To singe the beard of the King of Spain And capture another Dean of Jaen And sell him in Algiers A Dutch Picture Longfellow THE SOUDAN campaign and Dick s broken head had been some months ended and mended and the Central Southern Syndicate had paid Dick a certain sum on account for work done which work they were careful to assure him was not altogether up to their standard Dick heaved the letter into the Nile at Cairo cashed the draft in the same town and bade a warm farewell to Torpenhow at the station I am going to lie up for a while and rest said Torpenhow I don t know where I shall live in London but if God brings us to meet we shall meet Are you starying here on the off chance of another row There will be none till the Southern Soudan is reoccupied by our troops Mark that Good bye bless you come back when your money s spent and give me your address Dick loitered in Cairo Alexandria Ismailia and Port Said especially Port Said There is iniquity in many parts of the world and vice in all but the concentrated essence of all the iniquities and all the vices in all the continents finds itself at Port Said And through the heart of that sand bordered hell where the mirage flickers day long above the Bitter Lake move if you will only wait most of the men and women you have known in this life Dick established himself in quarters more riotous than respectable He spent his evenings on the quay and boarded many ships and saw very many friends gracious Englishwomen with whom he had talked not too wisely in the veranda of Shepherd s Hotel hurrying war correspondents skippers of the contract troop ships employed in the campaign army officers by the score and others of less reputable trades He had choice of all the races of the East and West for studies and the advantage of seeing his subjects under the influence of strong excitement at the gaming tables saloons dancing hells and elsewhere For recreation there was the straight vista of the Canal the blazing sands the procession of shipping and the white hospitals where the English soldiers lay He strove to set down in black and white and colour all that Providence sent him and when that supply was ended sought about for fresh material It was a fascinating employment but it ran away with his money and he had drawn in advance the hundred and twenty pounds to which he was entitled yearly Now I shall have to work and starve thought he and was addressing himself to this new fate when a mysterious telegram arrived from Torpenhow in England which said Come back quick you have caught on Come A large smile overspread his face So soon that s a good hearing said he to himself There will be an orgy to night I ll stand or fall by my luck Faith it s time it came He deposited half of his funds in the hands of his well known friends Monsieur and Madame Binat and ordered himself a Zanzibar dance of the finest Monsieur Binat was shaking with drink but Madame smiles sympathetically Monsieur needs a chair of course and of course Monsieur will sketch Monsieur amuses himself strangely Binat raised a blue white face from a cot in the inner room I understand he quavered We all know Monsieur Monsieur is an artist as I have been Dick nodded In the end said Binat with gravity Monsieur will descend alive into hell as I have descended And he laughed You must come to the dance too said Dick I shall want you For my face I knew it would be so For my face My God and for my degradation so tremendous I will not Take him away He is a devil Or at least do thou Celeste demand of him more The excellent Binat began to kick and scream All things are for sale in Port Said said Madame If my husband comes it will be so much more Eh how you call alf a sovereign The money was paid and the mad dance was held at night in a walled courtyard at the back of Madame Binat s house The lady herself in faded mauve silk always about to slide from her yellow shoulders played the piano and to the tin pot music of a Western waltz the naked Zanzibari girls danced furiously by the light of kerosene lamps Binat sat upon a chair and stared with eyes that saw nothing till the whirl of the dance and the clang of the rattling piano stole into the drink that took the place of blood in his veins and his face glistened Dick took him by the chin brutally and turned that face to the light Madame Binat looked over her shoulder and smiled with many teeth Dick leaned against the wall and sketched for an hour till the kerosene lamps began to smell and the girls threw themselves panting on the hard beaten ground Then he shut his book with a snap and moved away Binat plucking feebly at his elbow Show me he whimpered I too was once an artist even I Dick showed him the rough sketch Am I that he screamed Will you take that away with you and show all the world that it is I Binat He moaned and wept Monsieur has paid for all said Madame To the pleasure of seeing Monsieur again The courtyard gate shut and Dick hurried up the sandy street to the nearest gambling hell where he was well known If the luck holds it s an omen if I lose I must stay here He placed his money picturesquely about the board hardly daring to look at what he did The luck held Three turns of the wheel left him richer by twenty pounds and he went down to the shipping to make friends with the captain of a decayed cargo steamer who landed him in London with fewer pounds in his pocket than he cared to think about A thin gray fog hung over the city and the streets were very cold for summer was in England It s a cheerful wilderness and it hasn t the knack of altering much Dick thought as he tramped from the Docks westward Now what must I do The packed houses gave no answer Dick looked down the long lightless streets and at the appalling rush of traffic Oh you rabbit hutches said he addressing a row of highly respectable semi detached residences Do you know what you ve got to do later on You have to supply me with men servants and maid servants here he smacked his lips and the peculiar treasure of kings Meantime I ll find clothes and boots and presently I will return and trample on you He stepped forward energetically he saw that one of his shoes was burst at the side As he stooped to make investigations a man jostled him into the gutter All right he said That s another nick in the score I ll jostle you later on Good clothes and boots are not cheap and Dick left his last shop with the certainty that he would be respectably arrayed for a time but with only fifty shillings in his pocket He returned to streets by the Docks and lodged himself in one room where the sheets on the bed were almost audibly marked in case of theft and where nobody seemed to go to bed at all When his clothes arrived he sought the Central Southern Syndicate for Torpenhow s address and got it with the intimation that there was still some money waiting for him How much said Dick as one who habitually dealt in millions Between thirty and forty pounds If it would be any convenience to you of course we could let you have it at once but we usually settle accounts monthly If I show that I want anything now I m lost he said to himself All I need I ll take later on Then aloud It s hardly worth while and I m going to the country for a month too Wait till I come back and I ll see about it But we trust mister Heldar that you do not intend to sever your connection with us Dick s business in life was the study of faces and he watched the speaker keenly That man means something he said I ll do no business till I ve seen Torpenhow There s a big deal coming So he departed making no promises to his one little room by the Docks And that day was the seventh of the month and that month he reckoned with awful distinctness had thirty one days in it It is not easy for a man of catholic tastes and healthy appetites to exist for twenty four days on fifty shillings Nor is it cheering to begin the experiment alone in all the loneliness of London Dick paid seven shillings a week for his lodging which left him rather less than a shilling a day for food and drink Naturally his first purchase was of the materials of his craft he had been without them too long Half a day s investigations and comparison brought him to the conclusion that sausages and mashed potatoes twopence a plate were the best food Now sausages once or twice a week for breakfast are not unpleasant As lunch even with mashed potatoes they become monotonous At dinner they are impertinent At the end of three days Dick loathed sausages and going forth pawned his watch to revel on sheep s head which is not as cheap as it looks owing to the bones and the gravy Then he returned to sausages and mashed potatoes Then he confined himself entirely to mashed potatoes for a day and was unhappy because of pain in his inside Then he pawned his waistcoat and his tie and thought regretfully of money thrown away in times past There are few things more edifying unto Art than the actual belly pinch of hunger and Dick in his few walks abroad he did not care for exercise it raised desires that could not be satisfied found himself dividing mankind into two classes those who looked as if they might give him something to eat and those who looked otherwise I never knew what I had to learn about the human face before he thought and as a reward for his humility Providence caused a cab driver at a sausage shop where Dick fed that night to leave half eaten a great chunk of bread Dick took it would have fought all the world for its possession and it cheered him The month dragged through at last and nearly prancing with impatience he went to draw his money Then he hastened to Torpenhow s address and smelt the smell of cooking meats all along the corridors of the chambers Torpenhow was on the top floor and Dick burst into his room to be received with a hug which nearly cracked his ribs as Torpenhow dragged him tot he light and spoke of twenty different things in the same breath But you re looking tucked up he concluded Got anything to eat said Dick his eye roaming round the room I shall be having breakfast in a minute What do you say to sausages No anything but sausages

none	none	 ve been starving on that accursed horse flesh for thirty days and thirty nights Now what lunacy has been your latest Dick spoke of the last few weeks with unbridled speech Then he opened his coat there was no waistcoat below I ran it fine awfully fine but I ve just scraped through You haven t much sense but you ve got a backbone anyhow Eat and talk afterwards Dick fell upon eggs and bacon and gorged till he could gorge no more Torpenhow handed him a filled pipe and he smoked as men smoke who for three weeks have been deprived of good tobacco Ouf said he That s heavenly Well Why in the world didn t you come to me Couldn t I owe you too much already old man Besides I had a sort of superstition that this temporary starvation that s what it was and it hurt would bring me luck later It s over and done with now and none of the syndicate know how hard up I was Fire away What s the exact state of affairs as regards myself You had my wire You ve caught on here People like your work immensely I don t know why but they do They say you have a fresh touch and a new way of drawing things And because they re chiefly home bred English they say you have insight You re wanted by half a dozen papers you re wanted to illustrate books Dick grunted scornfully You re wanted to work up your smaller sketches and sell them to the dealers They seem to think the money sunk in you is a good investment Good Lord who can account for the fathomless folly of the public They re a remarkably sensible people They are subject to fits if that s what you mean and you happen to be the object of the latest fit among those who are interested in what they call Art Just now you re a fashion a phenomenon or whatever you please I appeared to be the only person who knew anything about you here and I have been showing the most useful men a few of the sketches you gave me from time to time Those coming after your work on the Central Southern Syndicate appear to have done your business You re in luck Huh call it luck Do call it luck when a man has been kicking about the world like a dog waiting for it to come I ll luck em later on I want a place to work first 
4425_14497_000050_000005	train-clean-360	Come here 
none	none	said Torpenhow crossing the landing This place is a big box room really but it will do for you There s your skylight or your north light or whatever window you call it and plenty of room to thrash about in and a bedroom beyond What more do you need Good enough said Dick looking round the large room that took up a third of a top story in the rickety chambers overlooking the Thames A pale yellow sun shone through the skylight and showed the much dirt of the place Three steps led from the door to the landing and three more to Torpenhow s room The well of the staircase disappeared into darkness pricked by tiny gas jets and there were sounds of men talking and doors slamming seven flights below in the warm gloom Do they give you a free hand here said Dick cautiously He was Ishmael enough to know the value of liberty Anything you like latch keys and license unlimited We are permanent tenants for the most part here Tisn t a place I would recommend for a Young Men s Christian Association but it will serve I took these rooms for you when I wired You re a great deal too kind old man You didn t suppose you were going away from me did you Torpenhow put his hand on Dick s shoulder and the two walked up and down the room henceforward to be called the studio in sweet and silent communion They heard rapping at Torpenhow s door That s some ruffian come up for a drink said Torpenhow and he raised his voice cheerily There entered no one more ruffianly than a portly middle aged gentleman in a satin faced frockcoat His lips were parted and pale and there were deep pouches under the eyes Weak heart said Dick to himself and as he shook hands very weak heart His pulse is shaking his fingers The man introduced himself as the head of the Central Southern Syndicate and one of the most ardent admirers of your work mister Heldar I assure you in the name of the syndicate that we are immensely indebted to you and I trust mister Heldar you won t forget that we were largely instrumental in bringing you before the public He panted because of the seven flights of stairs Dick glanced at Torpenhow whose left eyelid lay for a moment dead on his cheek I shan t forget said Dick every instinct of defence roused in him You ve paid me so well that I couldn t you know By the way when I am settled in this place I should like to send and get my sketches There must be nearly a hundred and fifty of them with you That is er is what I came to speak about I fear we can t allow it exactly mister Heldar In the absence of any specified agreement the sketches are our property of course Do you mean to say that you are going to keep them Yes and we hope to have your help on your own terms mister Heldar to assist us in arranging a little exhibition which backed by our name and the influence we naturally command among the press should be of material service to you Sketches such as yours Belong to me You engaged me by wire you paid me the lowest rates you dared You can t mean to keep them Good God alive man they re all I ve got in the world Torpenhow watched Dick s face and whistled Dick walked up and down thinking He saw the whole of his little stock in trade the first weapon of his equipment annexed at the outset of his campaign by an elderly gentleman whose name Dick had not caught aright who said that he represented a syndicate which was a thing for which Dick had not the least reverence The injustice of the proceedings did not much move him he had seen the strong hand prevail too often in other places to be squeamish over the moral aspects of right and wrong But he ardently desired the blood of the gentleman in the frockcoat and when he spoke again it was with a strained sweetness that Torpenhow knew well for the beginning of strife Forgive me sir but you have no no younger man who can arrange this business with me I speak for the syndicate I see no reason for a third party to You will in a minute Be good enough to give back my sketches The man stared blankly at Dick and then at Torpenhow who was leaning against the wall He was not used to ex employees who ordered him to be good enough to do things Yes it is rather a cold blooded steal said Torpenhow critically but I m afraid I am very much afraid you ve struck the wrong man Be careful Dick remember this isn t the Soudan Considering what services the syndicate have done you in putting your name before the world This was not a fortunate remark it reminded Dick of certain vagrant years lived out in loneliness and strife and unsatisfied desires The memory did not contrast well with the prosperous gentleman who proposed to enjoy the fruit of those years I don t know quite what to do with you began Dick meditatively Of course you re a thief and you ought to be half killed but in your case you d probably die I don t want you dead on this floor and besides it s unlucky just as one s moving in Don t hit sir you ll only excite yourself He put one hand on the man s forearm and ran the other down the plump body beneath the coat My goodness said he to Torpenhow and this gray oaf dares to be a thief I have seen an Esneh camel driver have the black hide taken off his body in strips for stealing half a pound of wet dates and he was as tough as whipcord This things soft all over like a woman There are few things more poignantly humiliating than being handled by a man who does not intend to strike The head of the syndicate began to breathe heavily Dick walked round him pawing him as a cat paws a soft hearth rug Then he traced with his forefinger the leaden pouches underneath the eyes and shook his head You were going to steal my things mine mine mine you who don t know when you may die Write a note to your office you say you re the head of it and order them to give Torpenhow my sketches every one of them Wait a minute your hand s shaking Now He thrust a pocket book before him The note was written Torpenhow took it and departed without a word while Dick walked round and round the spellbound captive giving him such advice as he conceived best for the welfare of his soul When Torpenhow returned with a gigantic portfolio he heard Dick say almost soothingly Now I hope this will be a lesson to you and if you worry me when I have settled down to work with any nonsense about actions for assault believe me I ll catch you and manhandle you and you ll die You haven t very long to live anyhow Go Imshi Vootsak get out The man departed staggering and dazed Dick drew a long breath Phew what a lawless lot these people are The first thing a poor orphan meets is gang robbery organised burglary Think of the hideous blackness of that man s mind Are my sketches all right Torp Yes one hundred and forty seven of them Well I must say Dick you ve begun well He was interfering with me It only meant a few pounds to him but it was everything to me I don t think he ll bring an action I gave him some medical advice gratis about the state of his body It was cheap at the little flurry it cost him Now let s look at my things Two minutes later Dick had thrown himself down on the floor and was deep in the portfolio chuckling lovingly as he turned the drawings over and thought of the price at which they had been bought The afternoon was well advanced when Torpenhow came to the door and saw Dick dancing a wild saraband under the skylight I builded better than I knew Torp he said without stopping the dance They re good They re damned good They ll go like flame I shall have an exhibition of them on my own brazen hook And that man would have cheated me out of it Do you know that I m sorry now that I didn t actually hit him Go out said Torpenhow go out and pray to be delivered from the sin of arrogance which you never will be Bring your things up from whatever place you re staying in and we ll try to make this barn a little more shipshape And then oh then said Dick still capering we will spoil the Egyptians CHAPTER IV The wolf cub at even lay hid in the corn When the smoke of the cooking hung gray 
4262-14486-0000	train-other-500	He knew where the doe made a couch for her fawn And he looked to his strength for his prey But the moon swept the smoke wreaths away
4262-14486-0001	train-other-500	And he turned from his meal in the villager s close And he bayed to the moon as she rose In Seonee WELL and how does success taste
4262-14486-0002	train-other-500	said Torpenhow some three months later He had just returned to chambers after a holiday in the country Good said Dick as he sat licking his lips before the easel in the studio I want more heaps more
4262-14486-0003	train-other-500	The lean years have passed and I approve of these fat ones Be careful old man That way lies bad work
4262-14486-0004	train-other-500	Torpenhow was sprawling in a long chair with a small fox terrier asleep on his chest while Dick was preparing a canvas A dais a background and a lay figure were the only fixed objects in the place
4262-14486-0005	train-other-500	They rose from a wreck of oddments that began with felt covered water bottles belts and regimental badges and ended with a small bale of second hand uniforms and a stand of mixed arms
4262-14486-0006	train-other-500	The mark of muddy feet on the dais showed that a military model had just gone away The watery autumn sunlight was falling and shadows sat in the corners of the studio Yes
4262-14486-0007	train-other-500	said Dick deliberately I like the power I like the fun I like the fuss and above all I like the money I almost like the people who make the fuss and pay the money Almost But they re a queer gang an amazingly queer gang
none	none	 They have been good enough to you at any rate That tin pot exhibition of your sketches must have paid 
4262-14486-0008	train-other-500	Did you see that the papers called it the Wild Work Show Never mind I sold every shred of canvas I wanted to and on my word I believe it was because they believed I was a self taught flagstone artist
none	none	 I should have got better prices if I worked my things on wool or scratched them on camel bone instead of using mere black and white and colour Verily they are a queer gang these people 
4262-14486-0009	train-other-500	Limited isn t the word to describe em I met a fellow the other day who told me that it was impossible that shadows on white sand should be blue ultramarine as they are I found out later that the man had been as far as Brighton beach
4262-14486-0010	train-other-500	but he knew all about Art confound him He gave me a lecture on it and recommended me to go to school to learn technique I wonder what old Kami would have said to that
4262-14486-0011	train-other-500	When were you under Kami man of extraordinary beginnings I studied with him for two years in Paris He taught by personal magnetism
none	none	 All he ever said was Continuez mes enfants 
4262-14486-0012	train-other-500	and you had to make the best you could of that He had a divine touch and he knew something about colour
none	none	 Kami used to dream colour I swear he could never have seen the genuine article but he evolved it and it was good Recollect some of those views in the Soudan 
4262-14486-0013	train-other-500	said Torpenhow with a provoking drawl Dick squirmed in his place Don t It makes me want to get out there again What colour that was Opal and umber and amber and claret and brick red and sulphur
4262-14486-0014	train-other-500	cockatoo crest sulphur against brown with a nigger black rock sticking up in the middle of it all and a decorative frieze of camels festooning in front of a pure pale turquoise sky He began to walk up and down And yet you know
none	none	 if you try to give these people the thing as God gave it keyed down to their comprehension and according to the powers He has given you 
4262-14486-0015	train-other-500	Modest man Go on
none	none	 Half a dozen epicene young pagans who haven t even been to Algiers will tell you first that your notion is borrowed and secondly that it isn t Art This comes of my leaving town for a month 
4262-14486-0016	train-other-500	Dickie you ve been promenading among the toy shops and hearing people talk
none	none	 I couldn t help it said Dick penitently You weren t here 
4262-14486-0017	train-other-500	and it was lonely these long evenings A man can t work for ever A man might have gone to a pub and got decently drunk I wish I had but I forgathered with some men of sorts
4262-14486-0018	train-other-500	They said they were artists and I knew some of them could draw but they wouldn t draw They gave me tea tea at five in the afternoon and talked about Art and the state of their souls
4262-14486-0019	train-other-500	As if their souls mattered I ve heard more about Art and seen less of her in the last six months than in the whole of my life Do you remember Cassavetti who worked for some continental syndicate out with the desert column
4262-14486-0020	train-other-500	He was a regular Christmas tree of contraptions when he took the field in full fig with his water bottle lanyard revolver writing case housewife gig lamps and the Lord knows what all He used to fiddle about with em and show us how they worked
4262-14486-0021	train-other-500	but he never seemed to do much except fudge his reports from the Nilghai See Dear old Nilghai He s in town fatter than ever He ought to be up here this evening I see the comparison perfectly
4262-14486-0022	train-other-500	You should have kept clear of all that man millinery Serves you right and I hope it will unsettle your mind It won t It has taught me what Art holy sacred Art means
4262-14486-0023	train-other-500	You ve learnt something while I ve been away What is Art Give em what they know and when you ve done it once do it again Dick dragged forward a canvas laid face to the wall
4262-14486-0024	train-other-500	Here s a sample of real Art It s going to be a facsimile reproduction for a weekly I called it His Last Shot It s worked up from the little water colour I made outside El Maghrib
4262-14486-0025	train-other-500	Well I lured my model a beautiful rifleman up here with drink I drored him and I redrored him and I redrored him and I made him a flushed dishevelled bedevilled scallawag
4262-14486-0026	train-other-500	with his helmet at the back of his head and the living fear of death in his eye and the blood oozing out of a cut over his ankle bone He wasn t pretty but he was all soldier and very much man
4262-14486-0027	train-other-500	Once more modest child Dick laughed Well it s only to you I m talking I did him just as well as I knew how making allowance for the slickness of oils
4262-14486-0028	train-other-500	Then the art manager of that abandoned paper said that his subscribers wouldn t like it It was brutal and coarse and violent man being naturally gentle when he s fighting for his life They wanted something more restful
none	none	 with a little more colour 
4262-14486-0029	train-other-500	I could have said a good deal
none	none	 but you might as well talk to a sheep as an art manager 
4262-14486-0030	train-other-500	I took my Last Shot back Behold the result
none	none	 I put him into a lovely red coat without a speck on it 
4262-14486-0031	train-other-500	That is Art I polished his boots observe the high light on the toe That is Art I cleaned his rifle rifles are always clean on service because that is Art I pipeclayed his helmet
4262-14486-0032	train-other-500	pipeclay is always used on active service and is indispensable to Art I shaved his chin I washed his hands and gave him an air of fatted peace Result military tailor s pattern plate Price thank Heaven
none	none	 twice as much as for the first sketch which was moderately decent 
4262-14486-0033	train-other-500	And do you suppose you re going to give that thing out as your work Why not I did it Alone I did it in the interests of sacred home bred Art and Dickenson s Weekly
4262-14486-0034	train-other-500	Torpenhow smoked in silence for a while Then came the verdict delivered from rolling clouds If you were only a mass of blathering vanity Dick I wouldn t mind
4262-14486-0035	train-other-500	I d let you go to the deuce on your own mahl stick but when I consider what you are to me and when I find that to vanity
none	none	 you add the twopenny halfpenny pique of a twelve year old girl then I bestir myself in your behalf 
4262-14486-0036	train-other-500	Thus The canvas ripped as Torpenhow s booted foot shot through it and the terrier jumped down thinking rats were about If you have any bad language to use use it You have not I continue
4262-14486-0037	train-other-500	You are an idiot because no man born of woman is strong enough to take liberties with his public even though they be which they ain t all you say they are But they don t know any better
none	none	 What can you expect from creatures born and bred in this light 
4262-14486-0038	train-other-500	Dick pointed to the yellow fog If they want furniture polish let them have furniture polish so long as they pay for it They are only men and women You talk as if they were gods
4262-14486-0039	train-other-500	That sounds very fine but it has nothing to do with the case They are the people you have to do work for whether you like it or not They are your masters Don t be deceived Dickie you aren t strong enough to trifle with them
4262-14486-0040	train-other-500	or with yourself which is more important Moreover Come back Binkie that red daub isn t going anywhere unless you take precious good care you will fall under the damnation of the check book and that s worse than death

4262-14486-0041	train-other-500	on easily acquired money For that money and your own infernal vanity you are willing to deliberately turn out bad work You ll do quite enough bad work without knowing it And Dickie as I love you and as I know you love me
4262-14486-0042	train-other-500	I am not going to let you cut off your nose to spite your face for all the gold in England That s settled Now swear Don t know said Dick I ve been trying to make myself angry but I can t
4262-14486-0043	train-other-500	you re so abominably reasonable There will be a row on Dickenson s Weekly I fancy Why the Dickenson do you want to work on a weekly paper It s slow bleeding of power
4262-14486-0044	train-other-500	It brings in the very desirable dollars said Dick his hands in his pockets Torpenhow watched him with large contempt Why I thought it was a man said he It s a child
4262-14486-0045	train-other-500	No it isn t said Dick wheeling quickly
none	none	 You ve no notion what the certainty of cash means to a man who has always wanted it badly Nothing will pay me for some of my life s joys on that Chinese pig boat for instance when we ate bread and jam for every meal because Ho Wang wouldn t allow us anything better and it all tasted of

4262-14486-0048	train-other-500	because you said it might fall lame and whenever you cross the street you take a hansom Even you are not foolish enough to suppose that theatres and all the live things you can buy thereabouts mean Life What earthly need have you for money
4262-14486-0049	train-other-500	It s there bless its golden heart said Dick It s there all the time Providence has sent me nuts while I have teeth to crack em with I haven t yet found the nut I wish to crack but I m keeping my teeth filed
4262-14486-0050	train-other-500	Perhaps some day you and I will go for a walk round the wide earth With no work to do nobody to worry us and nobody to compete with You would be unfit to speak to in a week Besides
4262-14486-0051	train-other-500	I shouldn t go I don t care to profit by the price of a man s soul for that s what it would mean Dick it s no use arguing You re a fool Don t see it When I was on that Chinese pig boat
4262-14486-0052	train-other-500	our captain got credit for saving about twenty five thousand very seasick little pigs when our old tramp of a steamer fell foul of a timber junk Now taking those pigs as a parallel
4262-14486-0053	train-other-500	Oh confound your parallels Whenever I try to improve your soul you always drag in some anecdote from your very shady past Pigs aren t the British public and self respect is self respect the world over
4262-14486-0054	train-other-500	Go out for a walk and try to catch some self respect And I say if the Nilghai comes up this evening can I show him your diggings
none	none	 Surely And Dick departed to take counsel with himself in the rapidly gathering London fog Half an hour after he had left the Nilghai laboured up the staircase 
4262-14487-0000	train-other-500	He was the chiefest as he was the youngest of the war correspondents and his experiences dated from the birth of the needle gun Saving only his ally Keneu the Great War Eagle there was no man higher in the craft than he
none	none	 and he always opened his conversation with the news that there would be trouble in the Balkans in the spring 
4262-14487-0001	train-other-500	Torpenhow laughed as he entered
none	none	 Never mind the trouble in the Balkans 
4262-14487-0002	train-other-500	Those little states are always screeching You ve heard about Dick s luck Yes he has been called up to notoriety hasn t he I hope you keep him properly humble He wants suppressing from time to time He does
4262-14487-0003	train-other-500	He s beginning to take liberties with what he thinks is his reputation Already By Jove he has cheek I don t know about his reputation but he ll come a cropper if he tries that sort of thing
4262-14487-0004	train-other-500	So I told him I don t think he believes it They never do when they first start off What s that wreck on the ground there Specimen of his latest impertinence
none	none	 Torpenhow thrust the torn edges of the canvas together and showed the well groomed picture to the Nilghai who looked at it for a moment and whistled It s a chromo said he a chromo litholeomargarine fake 
4262-14487-0006	train-other-500	What possessed him to do it And yet how thoroughly he has caught the note that catches a public who think with their boots and read with their elbows The cold blooded insolence of the work almost saves it
4262-14487-0007	train-other-500	but he mustn t go on with this Hasn t he been praised and cockered up too much You know these people here have no sense of proportion They ll call him a second Detaille
none	none	 and a third hand Meissonier while his fashion lasts 
4262-14487-0008	train-other-500	It s windy diet for a colt I don t think it affects Dick much You might as well call a young wolf a lion and expect him to take the compliment in exchange for a shin bone Dick s soul is in the bank
4262-14487-0009	train-other-500	He s working for cash Now he has thrown up war work I suppose he doesn t see that the obligations of the service are just the same only the proprietors are changed How should he know
4262-14487-0010	train-other-500	He thinks he is his own master Does he I could undeceive him for his good if there s any virtue in print He wants the whiplash Lay it on with science then
4262-14487-0011	train-other-500	I d flay him myself but I like him too much I ve no scruples He had the audacity to try to cut me out with a woman at Cairo once I forgot that but I remember now
4262-14487-0012	train-other-500	Did he cut you out You ll see when I have dealt with him But after all what s the good Leave him alone and he ll come home if he has any stuff in him dragging or wagging his tail behind him
4262-14487-0013	train-other-500	There s more in a week of life than in a lively weekly None the less I ll slate him I ll slate him ponderously in the Cataclysm Good luck to you but I fancy nothing short of a crowbar would make Dick wince
none	none	 His soul seems to have been fired before we came across him 
4262-14487-0014	train-other-500	He s intensely suspicious and utterly lawless Matter of temper said the Nilghai It s the same with horses Some you wallop and they work
4262-14487-0015	train-other-500	some you wallop and they jib and some you wallop and they go out for a walk with their hands in their pockets That s exactly what Dick has done said Torpenhow Wait till he comes back In the meantime you can begin your slating here
none	none	 I ll show you some of his last and worst work in his studio 
4262-14487-0016	train-other-500	Dick had instinctively sought running water for a comfort to his mood of mind He was leaning over the Embankment wall watching the rush of the Thames through the arches of Westminster Bridge
4262-14487-0017	train-other-500	He began by thinking of Torpenhow s advice but as of custom lost himself in the study of the faces flocking past Some had death written on their features and Dick marvelled that they could laugh
4262-14487-0018	train-other-500	Others clumsy and coarse built for the most part were alight with love others were merely drawn and lined with work
none	none	 but there was something Dick knew to be made out of them all 
4262-14487-0019	train-other-500	The poor at least should suffer that he might learn and the rich should pay for the output of his learning Thus his credit in the world and his cash balance at the bank would be increased So much the better for him
4262-14487-0020	train-other-500	He had suffered Now he would take toll of the ills of others The fog was driven apart for a moment and the sun shone a blood red wafer on the water
4262-14487-0021	train-other-500	Dick watched the spot till he heard the voice of the tide between the piers die down like the wash of the sea at low tide
none	none	 A girl hard pressed by her lover shouted shamelessly Ah get away you beast 
4262-14487-0022	train-other-500	and a shift of the same wind that had opened the fog drove across Dick s face the black smoke of a river steamer at her berth below the wall He was blinded for the moment then spun round and found himself face to face with
4262-14487-0023	train-other-500	Maisie There was no mistaking The years had turned the child to a woman but they had not altered the dark gray eyes the thin scarlet lips or the firmly modelled mouth and chin
4262-14487-0024	train-other-500	and that all should be as it was of old she wore a closely fitting gray dress Since the human soul is finite and not in the least under its own command Dick advancing said
none	none	 Halloo 
4262-14487-0025	train-other-500	after the manner of schoolboys
none	none	 and Maisie answered Oh Dick is that you Then against his will and before the brain newly released from considerations of the cash balance had time to dictate to the nerves 
4262-14487-0026	train-other-500	every pulse of Dick s body throbbed furiously and his palate dried in his mouth The fog shut down again and Maisie s face was pearl white through it No word was spoken
4262-14487-0027	train-other-500	but Dick fell into step at her side and the two paced the Embankment together keeping the step
none	none	 as perfectly as in their afternoon excursions to the mud flats 
4262-14487-0028	train-other-500	Then Dick a little hoarsely
none	none	 What has happened to Amomma 
4262-14487-0029	train-other-500	He died Dick Not cartridges over eating He was always greedy
none	none	 Isn t it funny 
4262-14487-0030	train-other-500	Yes No Do you mean Amomma Ye es No This
none	none	 Where have you come from 
4262-14487-0031	train-other-500	Over there He pointed eastward through the fog And you Oh I m in the north the black north across all the Park I am very busy What do you do
4262-14487-0032	train-other-500	I paint a great deal That s all I have to do
none	none	 Why what s happened 
4262-14487-0033	train-other-500	You had three hundred a year I have that still I am painting that s all Are you alone then There s a girl living with me Don t walk so fast Dick
4262-14487-0034	train-other-500	you re out of step Then you noticed it too Of course I did You re always out of step So I am I m sorry You went on with the painting
4262-14487-0035	train-other-500	Of course I said I should I was at the Slade then at Merton s in saint John s Wood the big studio then I pepper potted I mean I went to the National and now I m working under Kami
4262-14487-0036	train-other-500	But Kami is in Paris surely No he has his teaching studio in Vitry sur Marne I work with him in the summer and I live in London in the winter I m a householder
4262-14487-0037	train-other-500	Do you sell much Now and again but not often There is my bus I must take it or lose half an hour Good bye Dick Good bye Maisie Won t you tell me where you live
4262-14487-0038	train-other-500	I must see you again and perhaps I could help you I I paint a little myself I may be in the Park to morrow if there is no working light
none	none	 I walk from the Marble Arch down and back again that is my little excursion 
4262-14487-0039	train-other-500	But of course I shall see you again She stepped into the omnibus and was swallowed up by the fog Well I am damned exclaimed Dick and returned to the chambers
none	none	 Torpenhow and the Nilghai found him sitting on the steps to the studio door 
4262-14487-0040	train-other-500	repeating the phrase with an awful gravity You ll be more damned when I m done with you said the Nilghai upheaving his bulk from behind Torpenhow s shoulder and waving a sheaf of half dry manuscript Dick
4262-14487-0041	train-other-500	it is of common report that you are suffering from swelled head Halloo Nilghai Back again How are the Balkans and all the little Balkans One side of your face is out of drawing as usual
4262-14487-0042	train-other-500	Never mind that I am commissioned to smite you in print Torpenhow refuses from false delicacy I ve been overhauling the pot boilers in your studio They are simply disgraceful
4262-14487-0043	train-other-500	Oho that s it is it If you think you can slate me you re wrong You can only describe
none	none	 and you need as much room to turn in on paper 
4262-14487-0044	train-other-500	as a P and O cargo boat But continue and be swift I m going to bed
none	none	 H m h m h m The first part only deals with your pictures 
4262-14487-0045	train-other-500	Here s the peroration For work done without conviction for power wasted on trivialities for labour expended with levity for the deliberate purpose of winning the easy applause of a fashion driven public
4262-14487-0046	train-other-500	That s His Last Shot second edition Go on public
none	none	 there remains but one end 
4262-14487-0047	train-other-500	the oblivion that is preceded by toleration and cenotaphed with contempt From that fate mister Heldar has yet to prove himself out of danger Wow wow wow wow wow said Dick profanely
4262-14487-0048	train-other-500	It s a clumsy ending and vile journalese but it s quite true And yet he sprang to his feet and snatched at the manuscript
none	none	 you scarred deboshed battered old gladiator you re sent out when a war begins to minister to the blind brutal British public s bestial thirst for blood 
4262-14487-0049	train-other-500	They have no arenas now but they must have special correspondents You re a fat gladiator who comes up through a trap door and talks of what he s seen You stand on precisely the same level as an energetic bishop
4262-14487-0050	train-other-500	an affable actress a devastating cyclone or mine own sweet self And you presume to lecture me about my work Nilghai if it were worth while I d caricature you in four papers
4262-14487-0051	train-other-500	The Nilghai winced He had not thought of this As it is I shall take this stuff and tear it small so The manuscript fluttered in slips down the dark well of the staircase
4262-14487-0052	train-other-500	Go home Nilghai said Dick go home to your lonely little bed and leave me in peace
none	none	 I am about to turn in till to morrow 
4262-14487-0053	train-other-500	Why it isn t seven yet said Torpenhow with amazement It shall be two in the morning if I choose said Dick backing to the studio door I go to grapple with a serious crisis
4262-14487-0054	train-other-500	and I shan t want any dinner The door shut and was locked What can you do with a man like that said the Nilghai Leave him alone He s as mad as a hatter
4262-14487-0055	train-other-500	At eleven there was a kicking on the studio door Is the Nilghai with you still said a voice from within Then tell him he might have condensed the whole of his lumbering nonsense into an epigram
4262-14487-0056	train-other-500	Only the free are bond and only the bond are free Tell him he s an idiot Torp and tell him I m another
none	none	 All right Come out and have supper 
4262-14487-0057	train-other-500	You re smoking on an empty stomach
none	none	 There was no answer CHAPTER V I have a thousand men said he To wait upon my will And towers nine upon the Tyne And three upon the Till And what care I for you men said she Or towers from Tyne to Till Sith you must go with me she said To wait upon my will Sir Hoggie and the Fairies NEXT morning Torpenhow found Dick sunk in deepest repose of tobacco Well madman how d you feel I don t know I m trying to find out You had much better do some work Maybe but I m in no hurry I ve made a discovery Torp there s too much Ego in my Cosmos Not really Is this revelation due to my lectures or the Nilghai s It came to me suddenly all on my own account Much too much Ego and now I m going to work He turned over a few half finished sketches drummed on a new canvas cleaned three brushes set Binkie to bite the toes of the lay figure rattled through his collection of arms and accoutrements and then went out abruptly declaring that he had done enough for the day This is positively indecent said Torpenhow and the first time that Dick has ever broken up a light morning Perhaps he has found out that he has a soul or an artistic temperament or something equally valuable That comes of leaving him alone for a month Perhaps he has been going out of evenings I must look to this He rang for the bald headed old housekeeper whom nothing could astonish or annoy Beeton did mister Heldar dine out at all while I was out of town Never laid is dress clothes out once sir all the time Mostly e dined in but e brought some most remarkable young gentlemen up ere after theatres once or twice Remarkable fancy they was You gentlemen on the top floor does very much as you likes but it do seem to me sir droppin a walkin stick down five flights o stairs an then goin down four abreast to pick it up again at half past two in the mornin singin Bring back the whiskey Willie darlin not once or twice but scores o times isn t charity to the other tenants What I say is Do as you would be done by That s my motto Of course of course I m afraid the top floor isn t the quietest in the house I make no complaints sir I have spoke to mister Heldar friendly an he laughed an did me a picture of the missis that is as good as a coloured print It asn t the high shine of a photograph but what I say is Never look a gift horse in the mouth mister Heldar s dress clothes aven t been on him for weeks Then it s all right said Torpenhow to himself Orgies are healthy and Dick has a head of his own but when it comes to women making eyes I m not so certain Binkie never you be a man little dorglums They re contrary brutes and they do things without any reason Dick had turned northward across the Park but he was walking in the spirit on the mud flats with Maisie He laughed aloud as he remembered the day when he had decked Amomma s horns with the ham frills and Maisie white with rage had cuffed him How long those four years seemed in review and how closely Maisie was connected with every hour of them Storm across the sea and Maisie in a gray dress on the beach sweeping her drenched hair out of her eyes and laughing at the homeward race of the fishing smacks hot sunshine on the mud flats and Maisie sniffing scornfully with her chin in the air Maisie flying before the wind that threshed the foreshore and drove the sand like small shot about her ears Maisie very composed and independent telling lies to missus Jennett while Dick supported her with coarser perjuries Maisie picking her way delicately from stone to stone a pistol in her hand and her teeth firm set and Maisie in a gray dress sitting on the grass between the mouth of a cannon and a nodding yellow sea poppy The pictures passed before him one by one and the last stayed the longest Dick was perfectly happy with a quiet peace that was as new to his mind as it was foreign to his experiences It never occurred to him that there might be other calls upon his time than loafing across the Park in the forenoon There s a good working light now he said watching his shadow placidly Some poor devil ought to be grateful for this And there s Maisie She was walking towards him from the Marble Arch and he saw that no mannerism of her gait had been changed It was good to find her still Maisie and so to speak his next door neighbour No greeting passed between them because there had been none in the old days What are you doing out of your studio at this hour said Dick as one who was entitled to ask Idling Just idling I got angry with a chin and scraped it out Then I left it in a little heap of paint chips and came away I know what palette knifing means What was the piccy A fancy head that wouldn t come right horrid thing I don t like working over scraped paint when I m doing flesh The grain comes up woolly as the paint dries Not if you scrape properly Maisie waved her hand to illustrate her methods There was a dab of paint on the white cuff Dick laughed You re as untidy as ever That comes well from you Look at your own cuff By Jove yes It s worse than yours I don t think we ve much altered in anything Let s see though He looked at Maisie critically The pale blue haze of an autumn day crept between the tree trunks of the Park and made a background for the gray dress the black velvet toque above the black hair and the resolute profile No there s nothing changed How good it is D you remember when I fastened your hair into the snap of a hand bag Maisie nodded with a twinkle in her eyes and turned her full face to Dick Wait a minute said he That mouth is down at the corners a little Who s been worrying you Maisie No one but myself I never seem to get on with my work and yet I try hard enough and Kami says Continuez mesdemoiselles Continuez toujours mes enfants Kami is depressing I beg your pardon Yes that s what he says He told me last summer that I was doing better and he d let me exhibit this year Not in this place surely Of course not The Salon You fly high I ve been beating my wings long enough Where do you exhibit Dick I don t exhibit I sell What is your line then Haven t you heard Dick s eyes opened Was this thing possible He cast about for some means of conviction They were not far from the Marble Arch Come up Oxford Street a little and I ll show you A small knot of people stood round a print shop that Dick knew well Some reproduction of my work inside he said with suppressed triumph Never before had success tasted so sweet upon the tongue You see the sort of things I paint D you like it Maisie looked at the wild whirling rush of a field battery going into action under fire Two artillery men stood behind her in the crowd They ve chucked the off lead orse said one to the other E s tore up awful but they re makin good time with the others That lead driver drives better nor you Tom See ow cunnin e s nursin is orse Number Three ll be off the limber next jolt was the answer No e won t See ow is foot s braced against the iron E s all right Dick watched Maisie s face and swelled with joy fine rank vulgar triumph She was more interested in the little crowd than in the picture That was something that she could understand And I wanted it so Oh I did want it so she said at last under her breath Me all me said Dick placidly Look at their faces It hits em They don t know what makes their eyes and mouths open but I know And I know my work s right Yes I see Oh what a thing to have come to one Come to one indeed I had to go out and look for it What do you think I call it success Tell me how you got it They returned to the Park and Dick delivered himself of the saga of his own doings with all the arrogance of a young man speaking to a woman From the beginning he told the tale the I I I s flashing through the records as telegraph poles fly past the traveller Maisie listened and nodded her head The histories of strife and privation did not move her a hair s breadth At the end of each canto he would conclude And that gave me some notion of handling colour or light or whatever it might be that he had set out to pursue and understand He led her breathless across half the world speaking as he had never spoken in his life before And in the flood tide of his exaltation there came upon him a great desire to pick up this maiden who nodded her head and said I understand Go on to pick her up and carry her away with him because she was Maisie and because she understood and because she was his right and a woman to be desired above all women Then he checked himself abruptly And so I took all I wanted he said and I had to fight for it Now you tell Maisie s tale was almost as gray as her dress It covered years of patient toil backed by savage pride that would not be broken though dealers laughed and fogs delayed work and Kami was unkind and even sarcastic and girls in other studios were painfully polite It had a few bright spots in pictures accepted at provincial exhibitions but it wound up with the oft repeated wail And so you see Dick I had no success though I worked so hard Then pity filled Dick Even thus had Maisie spoken when she could not hit the breakwater half an hour before she had kissed him And that had happened yesterday Never mind he said I ll tell you something if you ll believe it The words were shaping themselves of their own accord The whole thing lock stock and barrel isn t worth one big yellow sea poppy below Fort Keeling Maisie flushed a little It s all very well for you to talk but you ve had the success and I haven t Let me talk then I know you ll understand Maisie dear it sounds a bit absurd but those ten years never existed and I ve come back again It really is just the same Can t you see You re alone now and I m alone What s the use of worrying Come to me instead darling Maisie poked the gravel with her parasol They were sitting on a bench I understand she said slowly But I ve got my work to do and I must do it Do it with me then dear I won t interrupt No I couldn t It s my work mine mine mine I ve been alone all my life in myself and I m not going to belong to anybody except myself I remember things as well as you do but that doesn t count We were babies then and we didn t know what was before us Dick don t be selfish I think I see my way to a little success next year Don t take it away from me I beg your pardon darling It s my fault for speaking stupidly I can t expect you to throw up all your life just because I m back I ll go to my own place and wait a little But Dick I don t want you to go out of my life now you ve just come back I m at your orders forgive me Dick devoured the troubled little face with his eyes There was triumph in them because he could not conceive that Maisie should refuse sooner or later to love him since he loved her It s wrong of me said Maisie more slowly than before it s wrong and selfish but oh I ve been so lonely No you misunderstand Now I ve seen you again it s absurd but I want to keep you in my life Naturally We belong We don t but you always understood me and there is so much in my work that you could help me in You know things and the ways of doing things You must I do I fancy or else I don t know myself Then you won t care to lose sight of me altogether and you want me to help you in your work Yes but remember Dick nothing will ever come of it That s why I feel so selfish Can t things stay as they are I do want your help You shall have it But let s consider I must see your pics first and overhaul your sketches and find out about your tendencies You should see what the papers say about my tendencies Then I ll give you good advice and you shall paint according Isn t that it Maisie Again there was triumph in Dick s eye It s too good of you much too good Because you are consoling yourself with what will never happen and I know that and yet I want to keep you Don t blame me later please I m going into the matter with my eyes open Moreover the Queen can do no wrong It isn t your selfishness that impresses me It s your audacity in proposing to make use of me Pooh You re only Dick and a print shop Very good that s all I am But Maisie you believe don t you that I love you I don t want you to have any false notions about brothers and sisters Maisie looked up for a moment and dropped her eyes It s absurd but I believe I wish I could send you away before you get angry with me But but the girl that lives with me is red haired and an impressionist and all our notions clash So do ours I think Never mind Three months from to day we shall be laughing at this together Maisie shook her head mournfully I knew you wouldn t understand and it will only hurt you more when you find out Look at my face Dick and tell me what you see They stood up and faced each other for a moment The fog was gathering and it stifled the roar of the traffic of London beyond the railings Dick brought all his painfully acquired knowledge of faces to bear on the eyes mouth and chin underneath the black velvet toque It s the same Maisie and it s the same me he said We ve both nice little wills of our own and one or other of us has to be broken Now about the future I must come and see your pictures some day I suppose when the red haired girl is on the premises Sundays are my best times You must come on Sundays There are such heaps of things I want to talk about and ask your advice about Now I must get back to work Try to find out before next Sunday what I am said Dick Don t take my word for anything I ve told you Good bye darling and bless you Maisie stole away like a little gray mouse Dick watched her till she was out of sight but he did not hear her say to herself very soberly I m a wretch a horrid selfish wretch But it s Dick and Dick will understand No one has yet explained what actually happens when an irresistible force meets the immovable post though many have thought deeply even as Dick thought He tried to assure himself that Maisie would be led in a few weeks by his mere presence and discourse to a better way of thinking Then he remembered much too distinctly her face and all that was written on it If I know anything of heads he said there s everything in that face but love I shall have to put that in myself and that chin and mouth won t be won for nothing But she s right She knows what she wants and she s going to get it What insolence Me Of all the people in the wide world to use me But then she s Maisie There s no getting over that fact and it s good to see her again This business must have been simmering at the back of my head for years She ll use me as I used Binat at Port Said She s quite right It will hurt a little I shall have to see her every Sunday like a young man courting a housemaid She s sure to come around and yet that mouth isn t a yielding mouth I shall be wanting to kiss her all the time and I shall have to look at her pictures I don t even know what sort of work she does yet and I shall have to talk about Art Woman s Art Therefore particularly and perpetually damn all varieties of Art It did me a good turn once and now it s in my way I ll go home and do some Art Half way to the studio Dick was smitten with a terrible thought The figure of a solitary woman in the fog suggested it She s all alone in London with a red haired impressionist girl who probably has the digestion of an ostrich Most red haired people have Maisie s a bilious little body They ll eat like lone women meals at all hours and tea with all meals I remember how the students in Paris used to pig along She may fall ill at any minute and I shan t be able to help Whew this is ten times worse than owning a wife Torpenhow entered the studio at dusk and looked at Dick with eyes full of the austere love that springs up between men who have tugged at the same oar together and are yoked by custom and use and the intimacies of toil This is a good love and since it allows and even encourages strife recrimination and brutal sincerity does not die but grows and is proof against any absence and evil conduct Dick was silent after he handed Torpenhow the filled pipe of council He thought of Maisie and her possible needs It was a new thing to think of anybody but Torpenhow who could think for himself Here at last was an outlet for that cash balance He could adorn Maisie barbarically with jewelry a thick gold necklace round that little neck bracelets upon the rounded arms and rings of price upon her hands the cool temperate ringless hands that he had taken between his own It was an absurd thought for Maisie would not even allow him to put one ring on one finger and she would laugh at golden trappings It would be better to sit with her quietly in the dusk his arm around her neck and her face on his shoulder as befitted husband and wife Torpenhow s boots creaked that night and his strong voice jarred Dick s brows contracted and he murmured an evil word because he had taken all his success as a right and part payment for past discomfort and now he was checked in his stride by a woman who admitted all the success and did not instantly care for him I say old man said Torpenhow who had made one or two vain attempts at conversation I haven t put your back up by anything I ve said lately have I You No How could you Liver out of order The truly healthy man doesn t know he has a liver I m only a bit worried about things in general I suppose it s my soul The truly healthy man doesn t know he has a soul What business have you with luxuries of that kind It came of itself Who s the man that says that we re all islands shouting lies to each other across seas of misunderstanding He s right whoever he is except about the misunderstanding I don t think we could misunderstand each other The blue smoke curled back from the ceiling in clouds Then Torpenhow insinuatingly Dick is it a woman Be hanged if it s anything remotely resembling a woman and if you begin to talk like that I ll hire a red brick studio with white paint trimmings and begonias and petunias and blue Hungarias to play among three and sixpenny pot palms and I ll mount all my pics in aniline dye plush plasters and I ll invite every woman who maunders over what her guide books tell her is Art and you shall receive em Torp in a snuff brown velvet coat with yellow trousers and an orange tie You ll like that Too thin Dick A better man than you once denied with cursing and swearing You ve overdone it just as he did It s no business of mine of course but it s comforting to think that somewhere under the stars there s saving up for you a tremendous thrashing Whether it ll come from heaven or earth I don t know but it s bound to come and break you up a little You want hammering Dick shivered All right said he When this island is disintegrated it will call for you I shall come round the corner and help to disintegrate it some more We re talking nonsense Come along to a theatre CHAPTER VI And you may lead a thousand men Nor ever draw the rein But ere ye lead the Faery Queen Twill burst your heart in twain He has slipped his foot from the stirrup bar The bridle from his hand And he is bound by hand and foot To the Queen o Faery land Sir Hoggie and the Fairies SOME weeks later on a very foggy Sunday Dick was returning across the Park to his studio This he said is evidently the thrashing that Torp meant It hurts more than I expected but the Queen can do no wrong and she certainly has some notion of drawing He had just finished a Sunday visit to Maisie always under the green eyes of the red haired impressionist girl whom he learned to hate at sight and was tingling with a keen sense of shame Sunday after Sunday putting on his best clothes he had walked over to the untidy house north of the Park first to see Maisie s pictures and then to criticise and advise upon them as he realised that they were productions on which advice would not be wasted Sunday after Sunday and his love grew with each visit he had been compelled to cram his heart back from between his lips when it prompted him to kiss Maisie several times and very much indeed Sunday after Sunday the head above the heart had warned him that Maisie was not yet attainable and that it would be better to talk as connectedly as possible upon the mysteries of the craft that was all in all to her Therefore it was his fate to endure weekly torture in the studio built out over the clammy back garden of a frail stuffy little villa where nothing was ever in its right place and nobody ever called to endure and to watch Maisie moving to and fro with the teacups He abhorred tea but since it gave him a little longer time in her presence he drank it devoutly and the red haired girl sat in an untidy heap and eyed him without speaking She was always watching him Once and only once when she had left the studio Maisie showed him an album that held a few poor cuttings from provincial papers the briefest of hurried notes on some of her pictures sent to outlying exhibitions Dick stooped and kissed the paint smudged thumb on the open page Oh my love my love he muttered do you value these things Chuck em into the waste paper basket Not till I get something better said Maisie shutting the book Then Dick moved by no respect for his public and a very deep regard for the maiden did deliberately propose in order to secure more of these coveted cuttings that he should paint a picture which Maisie should sign That s childish said Maisie and I didn t think it of you It must be my work Mine mine mine Go and design decorative medallions for rich brewers houses You are thoroughly good at that Dick was sick and savage Better things than medallions Dick was the answer in tones that recalled a gray eyed atom s fearless speech to missus Jennett Dick would have abased himself utterly but that other girl trailed in Next Sunday he laid at Maisie s feet small gifts of pencils that could almost draw of themselves and colours in whose permanence he believed and he was ostentatiously attentive to the work in hand It demanded among other things an exposition of the faith that was in him Torpenhow s hair would have stood on end had he heard the fluency with which Dick preached his own gospel of Art A month before Dick would have been equally astonished but it was Maisie s will and pleasure and he dragged his words together to make plain to her comprehension all that had been hidden to himself of the whys and wherefores of work There is not the least difficulty in doing a thing if you only know how to do it the trouble is to explain your method I could put this right if I had a brush in my hand said Dick despairingly over the modelling of a chin that Maisie complained would not look flesh it was the same chin that she had scraped out with the palette knife but I find it almost impossible to teach you There s a queer grin Dutch touch about your painting that I like but I ve a notion that you re weak in drawing You foreshorten as though you never used the model and you ve caught Kami s pasty way of dealing with flesh in shadow Then again though you don t know it yourself you shirk hard work Suppose you spend some of your time on line alone Line doesn t allow of shirking Oils do and three square inches of flashy tricky stuff in the corner of a pic sometimes carry a bad thing off as I know That s immoral Do line work for a little while and then I can tell more about your powers as old Kami used to say Maisie protested she did not care for the pure line I know said Dick You want to do your fancy heads with a bunch of flowers at the base of the neck to hide bad modelling The red haired girl laughed a little You want to do landscapes with cattle knee deep in grass to hide bad drawing You want to do a great deal more than you can do You have sense of colour but you want form Colour s a gift put it aside and think no more about it but form you can be drilled into Now all your fancy heads and some of them are very good will keep you exactly where you are With line you must go forward or backward and it will show up all your weaknesses But other people began Maisie You mustn t mind what other people do If their souls were your soul it would be different You stand and fall by your own work remember and it s waste of time to think of any one else in this battle Dick paused and the longing that had been so resolutely put away came back into his eyes He looked at Maisie and the look asked as plainly as words Was it not time to leave all this barren wilderness of canvas and counsel and join hands with Life and Love Maisie assented to the new programme of schooling so adorably that Dick could hardly restrain himself from picking her up then and there and carrying her off to the nearest registrar s office It was the implicit obedience to the spoken word and the blank indifference to the unspoken desire that baffled and buffeted his soul He held authority in that house authority limited indeed to one half of one afternoon in seven but very real while it lasted Maisie had learned to appeal to him on many subjects from the proper packing of pictures to the condition of a smoky chimney The red haired girl never consulted him about anything On the other hand she accepted his appearances without protest and watched him always He discovered that the meals of the establishment were irregular and fragmentary They depended chiefly on tea pickles and biscuit as he had suspected from the beginning The girls were supposed to market week and week about but they lived with the help of a charwoman as casually as the young ravens Maisie spent most of her income on models and the other girl revelled in apparatus as refined as her work was rough Armed with knowledge dear bought from the Docks Dick warned Maisie that the end of semi starvation meant the crippling of power to work which was considerably worse than death Maisie took the warning and gave more thought to what she ate and drank When his trouble returned upon him as it generally did in the long winter twilights the remembrance of that little act of domestic authority and his coercion with a hearth brush of the smoky drawing room chimney stung Dick like a whip lash He conceived that this memory would be the extreme of his sufferings till one Sunday the red haired girl announced that she would make a study of Dick s head and that he would be good enough to sit still and quite as an afterthought look at Maisie He sat because he could not well refuse and for the space of half an hour he reflected on all the people in the past whom he had laid open for the purposes of his own craft He remembered Binat most distinctly that Binat who had once been an artist and talked about degradation It was the merest monochrome roughing in of a head but it presented the dumb waiting the longing and above all the hopeless enslavement of the man in a spirit of bitter mockery I ll buy it said Dick promptly at your own price My price is too high but I dare say you ll be as grateful if The wet sketch fluttered from the girl s hand and fell into the ashes of the studio stove When she picked it up it was hopelessly smudged Oh it s all spoiled said Maisie And I never saw it Was it like Thank you said Dick under his breath to the red haired girl and he removed himself swiftly How that man hates me said the girl And how he loves you Maisie What nonsense I knew Dick s very fond of me but he had his work to do and I have mine Yes he is fond of you and I think he knows there is something in impressionism after all Maisie can t you see See See what Nothing only I know that if I could get any man to look at me as that man looks at you I d I don t know what I d do But he hates me Oh how he hates me She was not altogether correct Dick s hatred was tempered with gratitude for a few moments and then he forgot the girl entirely Only the sense of shame remained and he was nursing it across the Park in the fog There ll be an explosion one of these days he said wrathfully But it isn t Maisie s fault she s right quite right as far as she knows and I can t blame her This business has been going on for three months nearly Three months and it cost me ten years knocking about to get at the notion the merest raw notion of my work That s true but then I didn t have pins drawing pins and palette knives stuck into me every Sunday Oh my little darling if ever I break you somebody will have a very bad time of it No she won t I d be as big a fool about her as I am now I ll poison that red haired girl on my wedding day she s unwholesome and now I ll pass on these present bad times to Torp Torpenhow had been moved to lecture Dick more than once lately on the sin of levity and Dick listened and replied not a word In the weeks between the first few Sundays of his discipline he had flung himself savagely into his work resolved that Maisie should at least know the full stretch of his powers Then he had taught Maisie that she must not pay the least attention to any work outside her own and Maisie had obeyed him all too well She took his counsels but was not interested in his pictures Your things smell of tobacco and blood she said once Can t you do anything except soldiers I could do a head of you that would startle you thought Dick this was before the red haired girl had brought him under the guillotine but he only said I am very sorry and harrowed Torpenhow s soul that evening with blasphemies against Art Later insensibly and to a large extent against his own will he ceased to interest himself in his own work For Maisie s sake and to soothe the self respect that it seemed to him he lost each Sunday he would not consciously turn out bad stuff but since Maisie did not care even for his best it were better not to do anything at all save wait and mark time between Sunday and Sunday Torpenhow was disgusted as the weeks went by fruitless and then attacked him one Sunday evening when Dick felt utterly exhausted after three hours biting self restraint in Maisie s presence There was Language and Torpenhow withdrew to consult the Nilghai who had come in to talk continental politics Bone idle is he Careless and touched in the temper said the Nilghai It isn t worth worrying over Dick is probably playing the fool with a woman Isn t that bad enough No She may throw him out of gear and knock his work to pieces for a while She may even turn up here some day and make a scene on the staircase one never knows But until Dick speaks of his own accord you had better not touch him He is no easy tempered man to handle No I wish he were He is such an aggressive cocksure you be damned fellow He ll get that knocked out of him in time He must learn that he can t storm up and down the world with a box of moist tubes and a slick brush You re fond of him I d take any punishment that s in store for him if I could but the worst of it is no man can save his brother No and the worser of it is there is no discharge in this war Dick must learn his lesson like the rest of us Talking of war there ll be trouble in the Balkans in the spring That trouble is long coming I wonder if we could drag Dick out there when it comes off Dick entered the room soon afterwards and the question was put to him Not good enough he said shortly I m too comf y where I am Surely you aren t taking all the stuff in the papers seriously said the Nilghai Your vogue will be ended in less than six months the public will know your touch and go on to something new and where will you be then Here in England When you might be doing decent work among us out there Nonsense I shall go the Keneu will be there Torp will be there Cassavetti will be there and the whole lot of us will be there and we shall have as much as ever we can do with unlimited fighting and the chance for you of seeing things that would make the reputation of three Verestchagins Um said Dick pulling at his pipe You prefer to stay here and imagine that all the world is gaping at your pictures Just think how full an average man s life is of his own pursuits and pleasures When twenty thousand of him find time to look up between mouthfuls and grunt something about something they aren t the least interested in the net result is called fame reputation or notoriety according to the taste and fancy of the speller my lord I know that as well as you do Give me credit for a little gumption Be hanged if I do Be hanged then you probably will be for a spy by excited Turks Heigh ho I m weary dead weary and virtue has gone out of me Dick dropped into a chair and was fast asleep in a minute That s a bad sign said the Nilghai in an undertone Torpenhow picked the pipe from the waistcoat where it was beginning to burn and put a pillow behind the head We can t help we can t help he said It s a good ugly sort of old cocoanut and I m fond of it There s the scar of the wipe he got when he was cut over in the square Shouldn t wonder if that has made him a trifle mad I should He s a most businesslike madman Then Dick began to snore furiously Oh here no affection can stand this sort of thing Wake up Dick and go and sleep somewhere else if you intend to make a noise about it When a cat has been out on the tiles all night said the Nilghai in his beard I notice that she usually sleeps all day This is natural history Dick staggered away rubbing his eyes and yawning In the night watches he was overtaken with an idea so simple and so luminous that he wondered he had never conceived it before It was full of craft He would seek Maisie on a week day would suggest an excursion and would take her by train to Fort Keeling over the very ground that they two had trodden together ten years ago As a general rule he explained to his chin lathered reflection in the morning it isn t safe to cross an old trail twice Things remind one of things and a cold wind gets up and you feel sad but this is an exception to every rule that ever was I ll go to Maisie at once Fortunately the red haired girl was out shopping when he arrived and Maisie in a paint spattered blouse was warring with her canvas She was not pleased to see him for week day visits were a stretch of the bond and it needed all his courage to explain his errand I know you ve been working too hard he concluded with an air of authority If you do that you ll break down You had much better come Where said Maisie wearily She had been standing before her easel too long and was very tired Anywhere you please We ll take a train to morrow and see where it stops We ll have lunch somewhere and I ll bring you back in the evening If there s a good working light to morrow I lose a day Maisie balanced the heavy white chestnut palette irresolutely Dick bit back an oath that was hurrying to his lips He had not yet learned patience with the maiden to whom her work was all in all You ll lose ever so many more dear if you use every hour of working light Overwork s only murderous idleness Don t be unreasonable I ll call for you to morrow after breakfast early But surely you are going to ask No I am not I want you and nobody else Besides she hates me as much as I hate her She won t care to come To morrow then and pray that we get sunshine Dick went away delighted and by consequence did no work whatever He strangled a wild desire to order a special train but bought a great gray kangaroo cloak lined with glossy black marten and then retired into himself to consider things I m going out for the day to morrow with Dick said Maisie to the red haired girl when the latter returned tired from marketing in the Edgware road He deserves it I shall have the studio floor thoroughly scrubbed while you re away It s very dirty Maisie had enjoyed no sort of holiday for months and looked forward to the little excitement but not without misgivings There s nobody nicer than Dick when he talks sensibly she though but I m sure he ll be silly and worry me and I m sure I can t tell him anything he d like to hear If he d only be sensible I should like him so much better Dick s eyes were full of joy when he made his appearance next morning and saw Maisie gray ulstered and black velvet hatted standing in the hallway Palaces of marble and not sordid imitation of grained wood were surely the fittest background for such a divinity The red haired girl drew her into the studio for a moment and kissed her hurriedly Maisie s eyebrows climbed to the top of her forehead she was altogether unused to these demonstrations Mind my hat she said hurrying away and ran down the steps to Dick waiting by the hansom Are you quite warm enough Are you sure you wouldn t like some more breakfast Put the cloak over your knees I m quite comf y thanks Where are we going Dick Oh do stop singing like that People will think we re mad Let em think if the exertion doesn t kill them They don t know who we are and I m sure I don t care who they are My faith Maisie you re looking lovely Maisie stared directly in front of her and did not reply The wind of a keen clear winter morning had put colour into her cheeks Overhead the creamy yellow smoke clouds were thinning away one by one against a pale blue sky and the improvident sparrows broke off from water spout committees and cab rank cabals to clamour of the coming of spring It will be lovely weather in the country said Dick But where are we going Wait and see The stopped at Victoria and Dick sought tickets For less than half the fraction of an instant it occurred to Maisie comfortably settled by the waiting room fire that it was much more pleasant to send a man to the booking office than to elbow one s own way through the crowd Dick put her into a Pullman solely on account of the warmth there and she regarded the extravagance with grave scandalised eyes as the train moved out into the country I wish I knew where we are going she repeated for the twentieth time The name of a well remembered station flashed by towards the end of the run and Maisie was delighted Oh Dick you villain Well I thought you might like to see the place again You haven t been here since the old times have you No I never cared to see missus Jennett again and she was all that was ever there Not quite Look out a minute There s the windmill above the potato fields they haven t built villas there yet d you remember when I shut you up in it Yes How she beat you for it I never told it was you She guessed I jammed a stick under the door and told you that I was burying Amomma alive in the potatoes and you believed me You had a trusting nature in those days They laughed and leaned to look out identifying ancient landmarks with many reminiscences Dick fixed his weather eye on the curve of Maisie s cheek very near his own and watched the blood rise under the clear skin He congratulated himself upon his cunning and looked that the evening would bring him a great reward When the train stopped they went out to look at an old town with new eyes First but from a distance they regarded the house of missus Jennett Suppose she should come out now what would you do said Dick with mock terror I should make a face Show then said Dick dropping into the speech of childhood Maisie made that face in the direction of the mean little villa and Dick laughed This is disgraceful said Maisie mimicking missus Jennett s tone Maisie you run in at once and learn the collect gospel and epistle for the next three Sundays After all I ve taught you too and three helps every Sunday at dinner Dick s always leading you into mischief If you aren t a gentleman Dick you might at least The sentence ended abruptly Maisie remembered when it had last been used Try to behave like one said Dick promptly Quite right Now we ll get some lunch and go on to Fort Keeling unless you d rather drive there We must walk out of respect to the place How little changed it all is They turned in the direction of the sea through unaltered streets and the influence of old things lay upon them Presently they passed a confectioner s shop much considered in the days when their joint pocket money amounted to a shilling a week Dick have you any pennies said Maisie half to herself Only three and if you think you re going to have two of em to buy peppermints with you re wrong She says peppermints aren t ladylike Again they laughed and again the colour came into Maisie s cheeks as the blood boiled through Dick s heart After a large lunch they went down to the beach and to Fort Keeling across the waste wind bitten land that no builder had thought it worth his while to defile The winter breeze came in from the sea and sang about their ears Maisie said Dick your nose is getting a crude Prussian blue at the tip I ll race you as far as you please for as much as you please She looked round cautiously and with a laugh set off swiftly as the ulster allowed till she was out of breath We used to run miles she panted It s absurd that we can t run now Old age dear This it is to get fat and sleek in town When I wished to pull your hair you generally ran for three miles shrieking at the top of your voice I ought to know because those shrieks of yours were meant to call up missus Jennett with a cane and Dick I never got you a beating on purpose in my life No of course you never did Good heavens look at the sea Why it s the same as ever said Maisie Torpenhow had gathered from mister Beeton that Dick properly dressed and shaved had left the house at half past eight in the morning with a travelling rug over his arm The Nilghai rolled in at mid day for chess and polite conversation It s worse than anything I imagined said Torpenhow Oh the everlasting Dick I suppose You fuss over him like a hen with one chick Let him run riot if he thinks it ll amuse him You can whip a young pup off feather but you can t whip a young man It isn t a woman It s one woman and it s a girl Where s your proof He got up and went out at eight this morning got up in the middle of the night by Jove a thing he never does except when he s on service Even then remember we had to kick him out of his blankets before the fight began at El Maghrib It s disgusting It looks odd but maybe he s decided to buy a horse at last He might get up for that mightn t he Buy a blazing wheelbarrow He d have told us if there was a horse in the wind It s a girl Don t be certain Perhaps it s only a married woman Dick has some sense of humour if you haven t Who gets up in the gray dawn to call on another man s wife It s a girl Let it be a girl then She may teach him that there s somebody else in the world besides himself She ll spoil his hand She ll waste his time and she ll marry him and ruin his work for ever He ll be a respectable married man before we can stop him and he ll ever go on the long trail again All quite possible but the earth won t spin the other way when that happens No ho I d give something to see Dick go wooing with the boys Don t worry about it These things be with Allah and we can only look on Get the chessmen The red haired girl was lying down in her own room staring at the ceiling The footsteps of people on the pavement sounded as they grew indistinct in the distance like a many times repeated kiss that was all one long kiss Her hands were by her side and they opened and shut savagely from time to time The charwoman in charge of the scrubbing of the studio knocked at her door Beg y pardon miss but in cleanin of a floor there s two not to say three kind of soap which is yaller an mottled an disinfectink Now jist before I took my pail into the passage I thought it would be pre aps jest as well if I was to come up ere an ask you what sort of soap you was wishful that I should use on them boards The yaller soap miss There was nothing in the speech to have caused the paroxysm of fury that drove the red haired girl into the middle of the room almost shouting Do you suppose I care what you use Any kind will do any kind The woman fled and the red haired girl looked at her own reflection in the glass for an instant and covered her face with her hands It was as though she had shouted some shameless secret aloud CHAPTER VII Roses red and roses white Plucked I for my love s delight She would none of all my posies Bade me gather her blue roses Half the world I wandered through Seeking where such flowers grew Half the world unto my quest Answered but with laugh and jest It may be beyond the grave She shall find what she would have Mine was but an idle quest Roses white and red are best Blue Roses THE SEA had not changed Its waters were low on the mud banks and the Marazion Bell buoy clanked and swung in the tide way On the white beach sand dried stumps of sea poppy shivered and chattered I don t see the old breakwater said Maisie under her breath Let s be thankful that we have as much as we have I don t believe they ve mounted a single new gun on the fort since we were here Come and look They came to the glacis of Fort Keeling and sat down in a nook sheltered from the wind under the tarred throat of a forty pounder cannon Now if Ammoma were only here said Maisie For a long time both were silent Then Dick took Maisie s hand and called her by her name She shook her head and looked out to sea Maisie darling doesn t it make any difference No between clenched teeth I d I d tell you if it did but it doesn t Oh Dick please be sensible Don t you think that it ever will No I m sure it won t Why Maisie rested her chin on her hand and still regarding the sea spoke hurriedly I know what you want perfectly well but I can t give it to you Dick It isn t my fault indeed it isn t If I felt that I could care for any one But I don t feel that I care I simply don t understand what the feeling means Is that true dear You ve been very good to me Dickie and the only way I can pay you back is by speaking the truth I daren t tell a fib I despise myself quite enough as it is What in the world for Because because I take everything that you give me and I give you nothing in return It s mean and selfish of me and whenever I think of it it worries me Understand once for all then that I can manage my own affairs and if I choose to do anything you aren t to blame You haven t a single thing to reproach yourself with darling Yes I have and talking only makes it worse Then don t talk about it How can I help myself If you find me alone for a minute you are always talking about it and when you aren t you look it You don t know how I despise myself sometimes Great goodness said Dick nearly jumping to his feet Speak the truth now Maisie if you never speak it again Do I does this worrying bore you No It does not You d tell me if it did I should let you know I think Thank you The other thing is fatal But you must learn to forgive a man when he s in love He s always a nuisance You must have known that Maisie did not consider the last question worth answering and Dick was forced to repeat it There were other men of course They always worried just when I was in the middle of my work and wanted me to listen to them Did you listen At first and they couldn t understand why I didn t care And they used to praise my pictures and I thought they meant it I used to be proud of the praise and tell Kami and I shall never forget once Kami laughed at me You don t like being laughed at Maisie do you I hate it I never laugh at other people unless unless they do bad work Dick tell me honestly what you think of my pictures generally of everything of mine that you ve seen Honest honest and honest over quoted Dick from a catchword of long ago Tell me what Kami always says Maisie hesitated He he says that there is feeling in them How dare you tell me a fib like that Remember I was under Kami for two years I know exactly what he says It isn t a fib It s worse it s a half truth Kami says when he puts his head on one side so Il y a du sentiment mais il n y a pas de parti pris He rolled the r threateningly as Kami used to do Yes that is what he says and I m beginning to think that he is right Certainly he is Dick admitted that two people in the world could do and say no wrong Kami was the man And now you say the same thing It s so disheartening I m sorry but you asked me to speak the truth Besides I love you too much to pretend about your work It s strong it s patient sometimes not always and sometimes there s power in it but there s no special reason why it should be done at all At least that s how it strikes me There s no special reason why anything in the world should ever be done You know that as well as I do I only want success You re going the wrong way to get it then Hasn t Kami ever told you so Don t quote Kami to me I want to know what you think My work s bad to begin with I didn t say that and I don t think it It s amateurish then That it most certainly is not You re a work woman darling to your boot heels and I respect you for that You don t laugh at me behind my back No dear You see you are more to me than any one else Put this cloak thing round you or you ll get chilled Maisie wrapped herself in the soft marten skins turning the gray kangaroo fur to the outside This is delicious she said rubbing her chin thoughtfully along the fur Well Why am I wrong in trying to get a little success Just because you try Don t you understand darling Good work has nothing to do with doesn t belong to the person who does it It s put into him or her from outside But how does that affect Wait a minute All we can do is to learn how to do our work to be masters of our materials instead of servants and never to be afraid of anything I understand that Everything else comes from outside ourselves Very good If we sit down quietly to work out notions that are sent to us we may or we may not do something that isn t bad A great deal depends on being master of the bricks and mortar of the trade But the instant we begin to think about success and the effect of our work to play with one eye on the gallery we lose power and touch and everything else At least that s how I have found it Instead of being quiet and giving every power you possess to your work you re fretting over something which you can neither help nor hinder by a minute See It s so easy for you to talk in that way People like what you do Don t you ever think about the gallery Much too often but I m always punished for it by loss of power It s as simple as the Rule of Three If we make light of our work by using it for our own ends our work will make light of us and as we re the weaker we shall suffer I don t treat my work lightly You know that it s everything to me Of course but whether you realise it or not you give two strokes for yourself to one for your work It isn t your fault darling I do exactly the same thing and know that I m doing it Most of the French schools and all the schools here drive the students to work for their own credit and for the sake of their pride I was told that all the world was interested in my work and everybody at Kami s talked turpentine and I honestly believed that the world needed elevating and influencing and all manner of impertinences by my brushes By Jove I actually believed that When my little head was bursting with a notion that I couldn t handle because I hadn t sufficient knowledge of my craft I used to run about wondering at my own magnificence and getting ready to astonish the world But surely one can do that sometimes Very seldom with malice aforethought darling And when it s done it s such a tiny thing and the world s so big and all but a millionth part of it doesn t care Maisie come with me and I ll show you something of the size of the world One can no more avoid working than eating that goes on by itself but try to see what you are working for I know such little heavens that I could take you to islands tucked away under the Line You sight them after weeks of crashing through water as black as black marble because it s so deep and you sit in the fore chains day after day and see the sun rise almost afraid because the sea s so lonely Who is afraid you or the sun The sun of course And there are noises under the sea and sounds overhead in a clear sky Then you find your island alive with hot moist orchids that make mouths at you and can do everything except talk There s a waterfall in it three hundred feet high just like a sliver of green jade laced with silver and millions of wild bees live up in the rocks and you can hear the fat cocoanuts falling from the palms and you order an ivory white servant to sling you a long yellow hammock with tassels on it like ripe maize and you put up your feet and hear the bees hum and the water fall till you go to sleep Can one work there Certainly One must do something always You hang your canvas up in a palm tree and let the parrots criticise When they scuffle you heave a ripe custard apple at them and it bursts in a lather of cream There are hundreds of places Come and see them I don t quite like that place It sounds lazy Tell me another What do you think of a big red dead city built of red sandstone with raw green aloes growing between the stones lying out neglected on honey coloured sands There are forty dead kings there Maisie each in a gorgeous tomb finer than all the others You look at the palaces and streets and shops and tanks and think that men must live there till you find a wee gray squirrel rubbing its nose all alone in the market place and a jewelled peacock struts out of a carved doorway and spreads its tail against a marble screen as fine pierced as point lace Then a monkey a little black monkey walks through the main square to get a drink from a tank forty feet deep He slides down the creepers to the water s edge and a friend holds him by the tail in case he should fall in Is that all true I have been there and seen Then evening comes and the lights change till it s just as though you stood in the heart of a king opal A little before sundown as punctually as clockwork a big bristly wild boar with all his family following trots through the city gate churning the foam on his tusks You climb on the shoulder of a blind black stone god and watch that pig choose himself a palace for the night and stump in wagging his tail Then the night wind gets up and the sands move and you hear the desert outside the city singing Now I lay me down to sleep and everything is dark till the moon rises Maisie darling come with me and see what the world is really like It s very lovely and it s very horrible but I won t let you see anything horrid and it doesn t care for your life or mine for pictures or anything else except doing its own work and making love Come and I ll show you how to brew sangaree and sling a hammock and oh thousands of things and you ll see for yourself what colour means and we ll find out together what love means and then maybe we shall be allowed to do some good work Come away Why said Maisie How can you do anything until you have seen everything or as much as you can And besides darling I love you Come along with me You have no business here you don t belong to this place you re half a gipsy your face tells that and I even the smell of open water makes me restless Come across the sea and be happy He had risen to his feet and stood in the shadow of the gun looking down at the girl The very short winter afternoon had worn away and before they knew the winter moon was walking the untroubled sea Long ruled lines of silver showed where a ripple of the rising tide was turning over the mud banks The wind had dropped and in the intense stillness they could hear a donkey cropping the frosty grass many yards away A faint beating like that of a muffled drum came out of the moon haze What s that said Maisie quickly It sounds like a heart beating Where is it Dick was so angry at this sudden wrench to his pleadings that he could not trust himself to speak and in this silence caught the sound Maisie from her seat under the gun watched him with a certain amount of fear She wished so much that he would be sensible and cease to worry her with over sea emotion that she both could and could not understand She was not prepared however for the change in his face as he listened It s a steamer he said a twin screw steamer by the beat I can t make her out but she must be standing very close in shore Ah as the red of a rocket streaked the haze she s standing in to signal before she clears the Channel Is it a wreck said Maisie to whom these words were as Greek Dick s eyes were turned to the sea Wreck What nonsense She s only reporting herself Red rocket forward there s a green light aft now and two red rockets from the bridge What does that mean It s the signal of the Cross Keys Line running to Australia I wonder which steamer it is The note of his voice had changed he seemed to be talking to himself and Maisie did not approve of it The moonlight broke the haze for a moment touching the black sides of a long steamer working down Channel Four masts and three funnels she s in deep draught too That must be the Barralong or the Bhutia No the Bhutia has a clopper bow It s the Barralong to Australia She ll lift the Southern Cross in a week lucky old tub oh lucky old tub He stared intently and moved up the slope of the fort to get a better view but the mist on the sea thickened again and the beating of the screws grew fainter Maisie called to him a little angrily and he returned still keeping his eyes to seaward Have you ever seen the Southern Cross blazing right over your head he asked It s superb No she said shortly and I don t want to If you think it s so lovely why don t you go and see it yourself She raised her face from the soft blackness of the marten skins about her throat and her eyes shone like diamonds The moonlight on the gray kangaroo fur turned it to frosted silver of the coldest By Jove Maisie you look like a little heathen idol tucked up there The eyes showed that they did not appreciate the compliment I m sorry he continued The Southern Cross isn t worth looking at unless someone helps you to see That steamer s out of hearing Dick she said quietly suppose I were to come to you now be quiet a minute just as I am and caring for you just as much as I do Not as a brother though You said you didn t in the Park I never had a brother Suppose I said Take me to those places and in time perhaps I might really care for you what would you do Send you straight back to where you came from in a cab No I wouldn t I d let you walk But you couldn t do it dear And I wouldn t run the risk You re worth waiting for till you can come without reservation Do you honestly believe that I have a hazy sort of idea that I do Has it never struck you in that light Ye es I feel so wicked about it Wickeder than usual You don t know all I think It s almost too awful to tell Never mind You promised to tell me the truth at least It s so ungrateful of me but but though I know you care for me and I like to have you with me I d I d even sacrifice you if that would bring me what I want My poor little darling I know that state of mind It doesn t lead to good work You aren t angry Remember I do despise myself I m not exactly flattered I had guessed as much before but I m not angry I m sorry for you Surely you ought to have left a littleness like that behind you years ago You ve no right to patronise me I only want what I have worked for so long It came to you without any trouble and and I don t think it s fair

4425_14497_000043_000003	train-clean-360	What can I do 
none	none	I d give ten years of my life to get you what you want But I can t help you even I can t help A murmur of dissent from Maisie He went on And I know by what you have just said that you re on the wrong road to success It isn t got at by sacrificing other people I ve had that much knocked into me you must sacrifice yourself and live under orders and never think for yourself and never have real satisfaction in your work except just at the beginning when you re reaching out after a notion How can you believe all that There s no question of belief or disbelief That s the law and you take it or refuse it as you please I try to obey but I can t and then my work turns bad on my hands Under any circumstances remember four fifths of everybody s work must be bad But the remnant is worth the trouble for its own sake Isn t it nice to get credit even for bad work It s much too nice But May I tell you something It isn t a pretty tale but you re so like a man that I forget when I m talking to you Tell me Once when I was out in the Soudan I went over some ground that we had been fighting on for three days There were twelve hundred dead and we hadn t time to bury them How ghastly I had been at work on a big double sheet sketch and I was wondering what people would think of it at home The sight of that field taught me a good deal It looked just like a bed of horrible toadstools in all colours and I d never seen men in bulk go back to their beginnings before So I began to understand that men and women were only material to work with and that what they said or did was of no consequence See Strictly speaking you might just as well put your ear down to the palette to catch what your colours are saying Dick that s disgraceful Wait a minute I said strictly speaking Unfortunately everybody must be either a man or a woman I m glad you allow that much In your case I don t You aren t a woman But ordinary people Maisie must behave and work as such That s what makes me so savage He hurled a pebble towards the sea as he spoke I know that it is outside my business to care what people say I can see that it spoils my output if I listen to em and yet confound it all another pebble flew seaward I can t help purring when I m rubbed the right way Even when I can see on a man s forehead that he is lying his way through a clump of pretty speeches those lies make me happy and play the mischief with my hand And when he doesn t say pretty things Then belovedest Dick grinned I forget that I am the steward of these gifts and I want to make that man love and appreciate my work with a thick stick It s too humiliating altogether but I suppose even if one were an angel and painted humans altogether from outside one would lose in touch what one gained in grip Maisie laughed at the idea of Dick as an angel But you seem to think she said that everything nice spoils your hand I don t think It s the law just the same as it was at missus Jennett s Everything that is nice does spoil your hand I m glad you see so clearly I don t like the view Nor I But have got orders what can do Are you strong enough to face it alone I suppose I must Let me help darling We can hold each other very tight and try to walk straight We shall blunder horribly but it will be better than stumbling apart Maisie can t you see reason I don t think we should get on together We should be two of a trade so we should never agree How I should like to meet the man who made that proverb He lived in a cave and ate raw bear I fancy I d make him chew his own arrow heads Well I should be only half married to you I should worry and fuss about my work as I do now Four days out of the seven I m not fit to speak to You talk as if no one else in the world had ever used a brush D you suppose that I don t know the feeling of worry and bother and can t get at ness You re lucky if you only have it four days out of the seven What difference would that make A great deal if you had it too Yes but I could respect it Another man might not He might laugh at you But there s no use talking about it If you can think in that way you can t care for me yet The tide had nearly covered the mud banks and twenty little ripples broke on the beach before Maisie chose to speak Dick she said slowly I believe very much that you are better than I am This doesn t seem to bear on the argument but in what way I don t quite know but in what you said about work and things and then you re so patient Yes you re better than I am Dick considered rapidly the murkiness of an average man s life There was nothing in the review to fill him with a sense of virtue He lifted the hem of the cloak to his lips Why said Maisie making as though she had not noticed can you see things that I can t I don t believe what you believe but you re right I believe If I ve seen anything God knows I couldn t have seen it but for you and I know that I couldn t have said it except to you You seemed to make everything clear for a minute but I don t practice what I preach You would help me There are only us two in the world for all purposes and and you like to have me with you Of course I do I wonder if you can realise how utterly lonely I am Darling I think I can Two years ago when I first took the little house I used to walk up and down the back garden trying to cry I never can cry Can you It s some time since I tried What was the trouble Overwork I don t know but I used to dream that I had broken down and had no money and was starving in London I thought about it all day and it frightened me oh how it frightened me I know that fear It s the most terrible of all It wakes me up in the night sometimes You oughtn t to know anything about it How do you know Never mind Is your three hundred a year safe It s in Consols Very well If any one comes to you and recommends a better investment even if I should come to you don t you listen Never shift the money for a minute and never lend a penny of it even to the red haired girl Don t scold me so I m not likely to be foolish The earth is full of men who d sell their souls for three hundred a year and women come and talk and borrow a five pound note here and a ten pound note there and a woman has no conscience in a money debt Stick to your money Maisie for there s nothing more ghastly in the world than poverty in London It s scared me By Jove it put the fear into me And one oughtn t to be afraid of anything To each man is appointed his particular dread the terror that if he does not fight against it must cow him even to the loss of his manhood Dick s experience of the sordid misery of want had entered into the deeps of him and lest he might find virtue too easy that memory stood behind him tempting to shame when dealers came to buy his wares As the Nilghai quaked against his will at the still green water of a lake or a mill dam as Torpenhow flinched before any white arm that could cut or stab and loathed himself for flinching Dick feared the poverty he had once tasted half in jest His burden was heavier than the burdens of his companions Maisie watched the face working in the moonlight You ve plenty of pennies now she said soothingly I shall never have enough he began with vicious emphasis Then laughing I shall always be three pence short in my accounts Why threepence I carried a man s bag once from Liverpool Street Station to Blackfriar s Bridge It was a sixpenny job you needn t laugh indeed it was and I wanted the money desperately He only gave me threepence and he hadn t even the decency to pay in silver Whatever money I make I shall never get that odd threepence out of the world This was not language befitting the man who had preached of the sanctity of work It jarred on Maisie who preferred her payment in applause which since all men desire it must be of her right She hunted for her little purse and gravely took out a threepenny bit There it is she said I ll pay you Dickie and don t worry any more it isn t worth while Are you paid I am said the very human apostle of fair craft taking the coin I m paid a thousand times and we ll close that account It shall live on my watch chain and you re an angel Maisie I m very cramped and I m feeling a little cold Good gracious the cloak is all white and so is your moustache I never knew it was so chilly A light frost lay white on the shoulder of Dick s ulster He too had forgotten the state of the weather They laughed together and with that laugh ended all serious discourse They ran inland across the waste to warm themselves then turned to look at the glory of the full tide under the moonlight and the intense black shadows of the furze bushes It was an additional joy to Dick that Maisie could see colour even as he saw it could see the blue in the white of the mist the violet that is in gray palings and all things else as they are not of one hue but a thousand And the moonlight came into Maisie s soul so that she usually reserved chattered of herself and of the things she took interest in of Kami wisest of teachers and of the girls in the studio of the Poles who will kill themselves with overwork if they are not checked of the French who talk at great length of much more than they will ever accomplish of the slovenly English who toil hopelessly and cannot understand that inclination does not imply power of the Americans whose rasping voices in the hush of a hot afternoon strain tense drawn nerves to breaking point and whose suppers lead to indigestion of tempestuous Russians neither to hold nor to bind who tell the girls ghost stories till the girls shriek of stolid Germans who come to learn one thing and having mastered that much stolidly go away and copy pictures for evermore Dick listened enraptured because it was Maisie who spoke He knew the old life It hasn t changed much he said Do they still steal colours at lunch time Not steal Attract is the word Of course they do I m good I only attract ultramarine but there are students who d attract flake white I ve done it myself You can t help it when the palettes are hung up Every colour is common property once it runs down even though you do start it with a drop of oil It teaches people not to waste their tubes I should like to attract some of your colours Dick Perhaps I might catch your success with them I mustn t say a bad word but I should like to What in the world which you ve just missed a lovely chance of seeing does success or want of success or a three storied success matter compared with No I won t open that question again It s time to go back to town I m sorry Dick but You re much more interested in that than you are in me I don t know I don t think I am What will you give me if I tell you a sure short cut to everything you want the trouble and the fuss and the tangle and all the rest Will you promise to obey me Of course In the first place you must never forget a meal because you happen to be at work You forgot your lunch twice last week said Dick at a venture for he knew with whom he was dealing No no only once really That s bad enough And you mustn t take a cup of tea and a biscuit in place of a regular dinner because dinner happens to be a trouble You re making fun of me I never was more in earnest in my life Oh my love my love hasn t it dawned on you yet what you are to me Here s the whole earth in a conspiracy to give you a chill or run over you or drench you to the skin or cheat you out of your money or let you die of overwork and underfeeding and I haven t the mere right to look after you Why I don t even know if you have sense enough to put on warm things when the weather s cold Dick you re the most awful boy to talk to really How do you suppose I managed when you were away I wasn t here and I didn t know But now I m back I d give everything I have for the right of telling you to come in out of the rain Your success too This time it cost Dick a severe struggle to refrain from bad words As missus Jennett used to say you re a trial Maisie You ve been cooped up in the schools too long and you think every one is looking at you There aren t twelve hundred people in the world who understand pictures The others pretend and don t care Remember I ve seen twelve hundred men dead in toadstool beds It s only the voice of the tiniest little fraction of people that makes success The real world doesn t care a tinker s doesn t care a bit For aught you or I know every man in the world may be arguing with a Maisie of his own Poor Maisie Poor Dick I think Do you believe while he s fighting for what s dearer than his life he wants to look at a picture And even if he did and if all the world did and a thousand million people rose up and shouted hymns to my honour and glory would that make up to me for the knowledge that you were out shopping in the Edgware Road on a rainy day without an umbrella Now we ll go to the station But you said on the beach persisted Maisie with a certain fear Dick groaned aloud Yes I know what I said My work is everything I have or am or hope to be to me and I believe I ve learnt the law that governs it but I ve some lingering sense of fun left though you ve nearly knocked it out of me I can just see that it isn t everything to all the world Do what I say and not what I do Maisie was careful not to reopen debatable matters and they returned to London joyously The terminus stopped Dick in the midst of an eloquent harangue on the beauties of exercise He would buy Maisie a horse such a horse as never yet bowed head to bit would stable it with a companion some twenty miles from London and Maisie solely for her health s sake should ride with him twice or thrice a week That s absurd said she It wouldn t be proper Now who in all London to night would have sufficient interest or audacity to call us two to account for anything we chose to do Maisie looked at the lamps the fog and the hideous turmoil Dick was right but horseflesh did not make for Art as she understood it You re very nice sometimes but you re very foolish more times I m not going to let you give me horses or take you out of your way to night I ll go home by myself Only I want you to promise me something You won t think any more about that extra threepence will you Remember you ve been paid and I won t allow you to be spiteful and do bad work for a little thing like that You can be so big that you mustn t be tiny This was turning the tables with a vengeance There remained only to put Maisie into her hansom Good bye she said simply You ll come on Sunday It has been a beautiful day Dick Why can t it be like this always Because love s like line work you must go forward or backward you can t stand still By the way go on with your line work Good night and for my for my sake take care of yourself He turned to walk home meditating The day had brought him nothing that he hoped for but surely this was worth many days it had brought him nearer to Maisie The end was only a question of time now and the prize well worth the waiting By instinct once more he turned to the river And she understood at once he said looking at the water She found out my pet besetting sin on the spot and paid it off My God how she understood And she said I was better than she was Better than she was He laughed at the absurdity of the notion I wonder if girls guess at one half a man s life They can t or they wouldn t marry us He took her gift out of his pocket and considered it in the light of a miracle and a pledge of the comprehension that one day would lead to perfect happiness Meantime Maisie was alone in London with none to save her from danger And the packed wilderness was very full of danger Dick made his prayer to Fate disjointedly after the manner of the heathen as he threw the piece of silver into the river If any evil were to befall let him bear the burden and let Maisie go unscathed since the threepenny piece was dearest to him of all his possessions It was a small coin in itself but Maisie had given it and the Thames held it and surely the Fates would be bribed for this once The drowning of the coin seemed to cut him free from thought of Maisie for the moment He took himself off the bridge and went whistling to his chambers with a strong yearning for some man talk and tobacco after his first experience of an entire day spent in the society of a woman There was a stronger desire at his heart when there rose before him an unsolicited vision of the Barralong dipping deep and sailing free for the Southern Cross CHAPTER VIII And these two as I have told you Were the friends of Hiawatha Chibiabos the musician And the very strong man Kwasind Hiawatha TORPENHOW was paging the last sheets of some manuscript while the Nilghai who had come for chess and remained to talk tactics was reading through the first part commenting scornfully the while It s picturesque enough and it s sketchy said he but as a serious consideration of affairs in Eastern Europe it s not worth much It s off my hands at any rate Thirty seven thirty eight thirty nine slips altogether aren t there That should make between eleven and twelve pages of valuable misinformation Heigho Torpenhow shuffled the writing together and hummed Young lambs to sell young lambs to sell If I d as much money as I could tell I never would cry Young lambs to sell Dick entered self conscious and a little defiant but in the best of tempers with all the world Back at last said Torpenhow More or less What have you been doing Work Dickie you behave as though the Bank of England were behind you Here s Sunday Monday and Tuesday gone and you haven t done a line It s scandalous The notions come and go my children they come and go like our baccy he answered filling his pipe Moreover he stooped to thrust a spill into the grate Apollo does not always stretch his Oh confound your clumsy jests Nilghai This is not the place to preach the theory of direct inspiration said the Nilghai returning Torpenhow s large and workmanlike bellows to their nail on the wall We believe in cobblers wax La where you sit down If you weren t so big and fat said Dick looking round for a weapon I d No skylarking in my rooms You two smashed half my furniture last time you threw the cushions about You might have the decency to say How d you do to Binkie Look at him Binkie had jumped down from the sofa and was fawning round Dick s knee and scratching at his boots Dear man said Dick snatching him up and kissing him on the black patch above his right eye Did ums was Binks Did that ugly Nilghai turn you off the sofa Bite him mister Binkie He pitched him on the Nilghai s stomach as the big man lay at ease and Binkie pretended to destroy the Nilghai inch by inch till a sofa cushion extinguished him and panting he stuck out his tongue at the company The Binkie boy went for a walk this morning before you were up Torp I saw him making love to the butcher at the corner when the shutters were being taken down just as if he hadn t enough to eat in his own proper house said Dick Binks is that a true bill said Torpenhow severely The little dog retreated under the sofa cushion and showed by the fat white back of him that he really had no further interest in the discussion Strikes me that another disreputable dog went for a walk too said the Nilghai What made you get up so early Torp said you might be buying a horse He knows it would need three of us for a serious business like that No I felt lonesome and unhappy so I went out to look at the sea and watch the pretty ships go by Where did you go Somewhere on the Channel Progly or Snigly or some watering place was its name I ve forgotten but it was only two hours run from London and the ships went by Did you see anything you knew Only the Barralong outwards to Australia and an Odessa grain boat loaded down by the head It was a thick day but the sea smelt good Wherefore put on one s best trousers to see the Barralong said Torpenhow pointing Because I ve nothing except these things and my painting duds Besides I wanted to do honour to the sea Did She make you feel restless asked the Nilghai keenly Crazy Don t speak of it I m sorry I went Torpenhow and the Nilghai exchanged a look as Dick stooping busied himself among the former s boots and trees These will do he said at last I can t say I think much of your taste in slippers but the fit s the thing He slipped his feet into a pair of sock like sambhur skin foot coverings found a long chair and lay at length They re my own pet pair Torpenhow said I was just going to put them on myself All your reprehensible selfishness Just because you see me happy for a minute you want to worry me and stir me up Find another pair Good for you that Dick can t wear your clothes Torp You two live communistically said the Nilghai Dick never has anything that I can wear He s only useful to sponge upon Confound you have you been rummaging round among my clothes then said Dick I put a sovereign in the tobacco jar yesterday How do you expect a man to keep his accounts properly if you Here the Nilghai began to laugh and Torpenhow joined him Hid a sovereign yesterday You re no sort of financier You lent me a fiver about a month back Do you remember Torpenhow said Yes of course Do you remember that I paid it you ten days later and you put it at the bottom of the tobacco By Jove did I I thought it was in one of my colour boxes You thought About a week ago I went into your studio to get some baccy and found it What did you do with it Took the Nilghai to a theatre and fed him You couldn t feed the Nilghai under twice the money not though you gave him Army beef Well I suppose I should have found it out sooner or later What is there to laugh at You re a most amazing cuckoo in many directions said the Nilghai still chuckling over the thought of the dinner Never mind We had both been working very hard and it was your unearned increment we spent and as you re only a loafer it didn t matter That s pleasant from the man who is bursting with my meat too I ll get that dinner back one of these days Suppose we go to a theatre now Put our boots on and dress and wash The Nilghai spoke very lazily I withdraw the motion Suppose just for a change as a startling variety you know we that is to say we get our charcoal and our canvas and go on with our work Torpenhow spoke pointedly but Dick only wriggled his toes inside the soft leather moccasins What a one ideaed clucker that is If I had any unfinished figures on hand I haven t any model if I had my model I haven t any spray and I never leave charcoal unfixed overnight and if I had my spray and twenty photographs of backgrounds I couldn t do anything to night I don t feel that way Binkie dog he s a lazy hog isn t he said the Nilghai Very good I will do some work said Dick rising swiftly I ll fetch the Nungapunga Book and we ll add another picture to the Nilghai Saga Aren t you worrying him a little too much asked the Nilghai when Dick had left the room Perhaps but I know what he can turn out if he likes It makes me savage to hear him praised for past work when I know what he ought to do You and I are arranged for By Kismet and our own powers more s the pity I have dreamed of a good deal So have I but we know our limitations now I m dashed if I know what Dick s may be when he gives himself to his work That s what makes me so keen about him And when all s said and done you will be put aside quite rightly for a female girl I wonder Where do you think he has been to day To the sea Didn t you see the look in his eyes when he talked about her He s as restless as a swallow in autumn Yes but did he go alone I don t know and I don t care but he has the beginnings of the go fever upon him He wants to up stakes and move out There s no mistaking the signs Whatever he may have said before he has the call upon him now It might be his salvation Torpenhow said Perhaps if you care to take the responsibility of being a saviour Dick returned with the big clasped sketch book that the Nilghai knew well and did not love too much In it Dick had drawn all manner of moving incidents experienced by himself or related to him by the others of all the four corners of the earth But the wider range of the Nilghai s body and life attracted him most When truth failed he fell back on fiction of the wildest and represented incidents in the Nilghai s career that were unseemly his marriages with many African princesses his shameless betrayal for Arab wives of an army corps to the Mahdi his tattooment by skilled operators in Burmah his interview and his fears with the yellow headsman in the blood stained execution ground of Canton and finally the passings of his spirit into the bodies of whales elephants and toucans Torpenhow from time to time had added rhymed descriptions and the whole was a curious piece of art because Dick decided having regard to the name of the book which being interpreted means naked that it would be wrong to draw the Nilghai with any clothes on under any circumstances Consequently the last sketch representing that much enduring man calling on the War Office to press his claims to the Egyptian medal was hardly delicate He settled himself comfortably on Torpenhow s table and turned over the pages What a fortune you would have been to Blake Nilghai he said There s a succulent pinkness about some of these sketches that s more than life like The Nilghai surrounded while bathing by the Mahdieh that was founded on fact eh It was very nearly my last bath you irreverent dauber Has Binkie come into the Saga yet No the Binkie boy hasn t done anything except eat and kill cats Let s see Here you are as a stained glass saint in a church Deuced decorative lines about your anatomy you ought to be grateful for being handed down to posterity in this way Fifty years hence you ll exist in rare and curious facsimiles at ten guineas each What shall I try this time The domestic life of the Nilghai Hasn t got any The undomestic life of the Nilghai then Of course Mass meeting of his wives in Trafalgar Square That s it They came from the ends of the earth to attend Nilghai s wedding to an English bride This shall be an epic It s a sweet material to work with It s a scandalous waste of time said Torpenhow Don t worry it keeps one s hand in specially when you begin without the pencil He set to work rapidly That s Nelson s Column Presently the Nilghai will appear shinning up it Give him some clothes this time Certainly a veil and an orange wreath because he s been married Gad that s clever enough said Torpenhow over his shoulder as Dick brought out of the paper with three twirls of the brush a very fat back and labouring shoulder pressed against stone Just imagine Dick continued if we could publish a few of these dear little things every time the Nilghai subsidises a man who can write to give the public an honest opinion of my pictures Well you ll admit I always tell you when I have done anything of that kind I know I can t hammer you as you ought to be hammered so I give the job to another Young Maclagan for instance No o one half minute old man stick your hand out against the dark of the wall paper you only burble and call me names That left shoulder s out of drawing I must literally throw a veil over that Where s my pen knife Well what about Maclagan I only gave him his riding orders to to lambast you on general principles for not producing work that will last Whereupon that young fool Dick threw back his head and shut one eye as he shifted the page under his hand being left alone with an ink pot and what he conceived were his own notions went and spilt them both over me in the papers You might have engaged a grown man for the business Nilghai How do you think the bridal veil looks now Torp How the deuce do three dabs and two scratches make the stuff stand away from the body as it does said Torpenhow to whom Dick s methods were always new It just depends on where you put em If Maclagan had know that much about his business he might have done better Why don t you put the damned dabs into something that will stay then insisted the Nilghai who had really taken considerable trouble in hiring for Dick s benefit the pen of a young gentleman who devoted most of his waking hours to an anxious consideration of the aims and ends of Art which he wrote was one and indivisible Wait a minute till I see how I am going to manage my procession of wives You seem to have married extensively and I must rough em in with the pencil Medes Parthians Edomites Now setting aside the weakness and the wickedness and and the fat headedness of deliberately trying to do work that will live as they call it I m content with the knowledge that I ve done my best up to date and I shan t do anything like it again for some hours at least probably years Most probably never What any stuff you have in stock your best work said Torpenhow Anything you ve sold said the Nilghai Oh no It isn t here and it isn t sold Better than that it can t be sold and I don t think any one knows where it is I m sure I don t And yet more and more wives on the north side of the square Observe the virtuous horror of the lions You may as well explain said Torpenhow and Dick lifted his head from the paper The sea reminded me of it he said slowly I wish it hadn t It weighs some few thousand tons unless you cut it out with a cold chisel Don t be an idiot You can t pose with us here said the Nilghai There s no pose in the matter at all It s a fact I was loafing from Lima to Auckland in a big old condemned passenger ship turned into a cargo boat and owned by a second hand Italian firm She was a crazy basket We were cut down to fifteen ton of coal a day and we thought ourselves lucky when we kicked seven knots an hour out of her Then we used to stop and let the bearings cool down and wonder whether the crack in the shaft was spreading Were you a steward or a stoker in those days I was flush for the time being so I was a passenger or else I should have been a steward I think said Dick with perfect gravity returning to the procession of angry wives I was the only other passenger from Lima and the ship was half empty and full of rats and cockroaches and scorpions But what has this to do with the picture Wait a minute She had been in the China passenger trade and her lower decks had bunks for two thousand pigtails Those were all taken down and she was empty up to her nose and the lights came through the port holes most annoying lights to work in till you got used to them I hadn t anything to do for weeks The ship s charts were in pieces and our skipper daren t run south for fear of catching a storm So he did his best to knock all the Society Islands out of the water one by one and I went into the lower deck and did my picture on the port side as far forward in her as I could go There was some brown paint and some green paint that they used for the boats and some black paint for ironwork and that was all I had The passengers must have thought you mad There was only one and it was a woman but it gave me the notion of my picture What was she like said Torpenhow She was a sort of Negroid Jewess Cuban with morals to match She couldn t read or write and she didn t want to but she used to come down and watch me paint and the skipper didn t like it because he was paying her passage and had to be on the bridge occasionally I see That must have been cheerful It was the best time I ever had To begin with we didn t know whether we should go up or go down any minute when there was a sea on and when it was calm it was paradise and the woman used to mix the paints and talk broken English and the skipper used to steal down every few minutes to the lower deck because he said he was afraid of fire So you see we could never tell when we might be caught and I had a splendid notion to work out in only three keys of colour What was the notion Two lines in Poe Neither the angels in Heaven above nor the demons down under the sea Can ever dissever my soul from the soul of the beautiful Annabel Lee It came out of the sea all by itself I drew that fight fought out in green water over the naked choking soul and the woman served as the model for the devils and the angels both sea devils and sea angels and the soul half drowned between them It doesn t sound much but when there was a good light on the lower deck it looked very fine and creepy It was seven by fourteen feet all done in shifting light for shifting light Did the woman inspire you much said Torpenhow She and the sea between them immensely There was a heap of bad drawing in that picture I remember I went out of my way to foreshorten for sheer delight of doing it and I foreshortened damnably but for all that it s the best thing I ve ever done and now I suppose the ship s broken up or gone down Whew What a time that was What happened after all It all ended They were loading her with wool when I left the ship but even the stevedores kept the picture clear to the last The eyes of the demons scared them I honestly believe And the woman She was scared too when it was finished She used to cross herself before she went down to look at it Just three colours and no chance of getting any more and the sea outside and unlimited love making inside and the fear of death atop of everything else O Lord He had ceased to look at the sketch but was staring straight in front of him across the room Why don t you try something of the same kind now said the Nilghai Because those things come not by fasting and prayer When I find a cargo boat and a Jewess Cuban and another notion and the same old life I may You won t find them here said the Nilghai No I shall not Dick shut the sketch book with a bang This room s as hot as an oven Open the window some one He leaned into the darkness watching the greater darkness of London below him The chambers stood much higher than the other houses commanding a hundred chimneys crooked cowls that looked like sitting cats as they swung round and other uncouth brick and zinc mysteries supported by iron stanchions and clamped by eight pieces Northward the lights of Piccadilly Circus and Leicester Square threw a copper coloured glare above the black roofs and southward by all the orderly lights of the Thames A train rolled out across one of the railway bridges 
4411-14494-0000	train-other-500	and its thunder drowned for a minute
none	none	 the dull roar of the streets 
4411-14494-0001	train-other-500	The Nilghai looked at his watch and said shortly That s the Paris night mail You can book from here to saint Petersburg if you choose Dick crammed head and shoulders out of the window and looked across the river
none	none	 Torpenhow came to his side while the Nilghai passed over quietly to the piano and opened it 
4411-14494-0002	train-other-500	Binkie making himself as large as possible
none	none	 spread out upon the sofa with the air of one who is not to be lightly disturbed 
4411-14494-0003	train-other-500	Well said the Nilghai to the two pairs of shoulders have you never seen this place before A steam tug on the river hooted as she towed her barges to wharf Then the boom of the traffic came into the room
4411-14494-0004	train-other-500	Torpenhow nudged Dick Good place to bank in bad place to bunk in Dickie isn t it
none	none	 Dick s chin was in his hand as he answered in the words of a general not without fame 
4411-14494-0005	train-other-500	still looking out on the darkness My God what a city to loot Binkie found the night air tickling his whiskers and sneezed plaintively
none	none	 We shall give the Binkie dog a cold said Torpenhow Come in and they withdrew their heads You ll be buried in Kensal Green Dick one of these days 
4411-14494-0006	train-other-500	if it isn t closed by the time you want to go there
none	none	 buried within two feet of some one else his wife and his family 
4411-14494-0007	train-other-500	Allah forbid I shall get away before that time comes Give a man room to stretch his legs mister Binkie Dick flung himself down on the sofa and tweaked Binkie s velvet ears yawning heavily the while
4411-14494-0008	train-other-500	You ll find that wardrobe case very much out of tune Torpenhow said to the Nilghai It s never touched except by you A piece of gross extravagance Dick grunted
none	none	 The Nilghai only comes when I m out That s because you re always out Howl Nilghai and let him hear 
4411-14494-0009	train-other-500	The life of the Nilghai is fraud and slaughter His writings are watered Dickens and water But the voice of the Nilghai raised on high
none	none	 Makes even the Mahdieh glad to die 
4411-14494-0010	train-other-500	Dick quoted from Torpenhow s letterpress in the Nungapunga Book
none	none	 How do they call moose in Canada Nilghai 
4411-14494-0011	train-other-500	The man laughed Singing was his one polite accomplishment as many Press tents in far off lands had known What shall I sing said he turning in the chair Moll Roe in the Morning said Torpenhow at a venture No
4411-14494-0012	train-other-500	said Dick sharply and the Nilghai opened his eyes The old chanty whereof he among a very few possessed all the words was not a pretty one but Dick had heard it many times before without wincing
4411-14494-0013	train-other-500	Without prelude he launched into that stately tune that calls together and troubles the hearts of the gipsies of the sea Farewell and adieu to you Spanish ladies Farewell and adieu to you ladies of Spain
4411-14494-0014	train-other-500	Dick turned uneasily on the sofa for he could hear the bows of the Barralong
none	none	 crashing into the green seas on her way to the Southern Cross Then came the chorus We ll rant and we ll roar like true British sailors 
4411-14494-0015	train-other-500	We ll rant and we ll roar across the salt seas Until we take soundings in the Channel of Old England From Ushant to Scilly
none	none	 tis forty five leagues 
4411-14494-0016	train-other-500	Thirty five thirty five said Dick petulantly Don t tamper with Holy Writ Go on Nilghai The first land we made it was called the Deadman and they sang to the end very vigourously
4411-14494-0017	train-other-500	That would be a better song if her head were turned the other way to the Ushant light for instance said the Nilghai Flinging his arms about like a mad windmill said Torpenhow Give us something else Nilghai You re in fine fog horn form tonight
4411-14494-0018	train-other-500	Give us the Ganges Pilot you sang that in the square the night before El Maghrib By the way I wonder how many of the chorus are alive to night said Dick Torpenhow considered for a minute By Jove
none	none	 I believe only you and I Raynor Vicery and Deenes all dead 
4411-14494-0019	train-other-500	Vincent caught smallpox in Cairo carried it here and died of it Yes only you and I
none	none	 and the Nilghai Umph And yet the men here who ve done their work in a well warmed studio all their lives 
4411-14494-0020	train-other-500	with a policeman at each corner say that I charge too much for my pictures They are buying your work not your insurance policies dear child said the Nilghai I gambled with one to get at the other Don t preach Go on with the Pilot
4411-14494-0021	train-other-500	Where in the world did you get that song
none	none	 On a tombstone said the Nilghai On a tombstone in a distant land 
4411-14494-0022	train-other-500	I made it an accompaniment with heaps of base chords Oh Vanity Begin And the Nilghai began
none	none	 I have slipped my cable messmates 
4411-14494-0023	train-other-500	I m drifting down with the tide I have my sailing orders while yet an anchor ride And never on fair June morning have I put out to sea With clearer conscience or better hope
none	none	 or a heart more light and free 
4411-14494-0024	train-other-500	Shoulder to shoulder Joe my boy into the crowd like a wedge Strike with the hangers messmates but do not cut with the edge Cries Charnock Scatter the faggots double that Brahmin in two
4411-14494-0025	train-other-500	The tall pale widow for me Joe the little brown girl for you Young Joe you re nearing sixty why is your hide so dark Katie has soft fair blue eyes who blackened yours Why hark
4411-14494-0026	train-other-500	They were all singing now Dick with the roar of the wind of the open sea about his ears as the deep bass voice let itself go
none	none	 The morning gun Ho steady 
4411-14494-0027	train-other-500	the arquebuses to me I ha sounded the Dutch High Admiral s heart As my lead doth sound the sea
none	none	 Sounding sounding the Ganges floating down with the tide 
4411-14494-0028	train-other-500	Moore me close to Charnock next to my nut brown bride My blessing to Kate at Fairlight Holwell my thanks to you Steady We steer for heaven through sand drifts cold and blue
4411-14494-0029	train-other-500	Now what is there in that nonsense to make a man restless said Dick hauling Binkie from his feet to his chest It depends on the man said Torpenhow The man who has been down to look at the sea
none	none	 said the Nilghai 
4411-14494-0030	train-other-500	I didn t know she was going to upset me in this fashion That s what men say when they go to say good bye to a woman
none	none	 It s more easy though to get rid of three women than a piece of one s life and surroundings 
4411-14494-0031	train-other-500	But a woman can be began Dick unguardedly A piece of one s life continued Torpenhow No she can t His face darkened for a moment She says she wants to sympathise with you
none	none	 and help you in your work and everything else that clearly a man must do for himself Then she sends round five notes a day 
4411-14494-0032	train-other-500	to ask why the dickens you haven t been wasting your time with her Don t generalise said the Nilghai By the time you arrive at five notes a day you must have gone through a good deal and behaved accordingly Shouldn t begin these things my son
none	none	 I shouldn t have gone down to the sea 
4411-14494-0033	train-other-500	said Dick just a little anxious to change the conversation And you shouldn t have sung The sea isn t sending you five notes a day said the Nilghai No but I m fatally compromised
none	none	 She s an enduring old hag and I m sorry I ever met her Why wasn t I born and bred and dead in a three pair back 
4411-14494-0034	train-other-500	Hear him blaspheming his first love Why in the world shouldn t you listen to her said Torpenhow Before Dick could reply the Nilghai lifted up his voice with a shout that shook the windows in The Men of the Sea that begins as all know
4411-14494-0035	train-other-500	The sea is a wicked old woman
none	none	 and after reading through eight lines whose imagery is truthful 
4411-14494-0036	train-other-500	ends in a refrain slow as the clacking of a capstan when the boat comes unwillingly up to the bars where the men sweat and tramp in the shingle
none	none	 Ye that bore us O restore us She is kinder than ye 
4411-14494-0037	train-other-500	For the call is on our heart strings Said The Men of the Sea The Nilghai sang that verse twice with simple cunning intending that Dick should hear But Dick was waiting for the farewell of the men to their wives
4411-14494-0038	train-other-500	Ye that love us can ye move us She is dearer than ye And your sleep will be the sweeter Said The Men of the Sea The rough words beat like the blows of the waves
4411-14494-0039	train-other-500	on the bows of the rickety boat from Lima in the days when Dick was mixing paints making love drawing devils and angels in the half dark and wondering whether the next minute would put the Italian captain s knife between his shoulder blades
none	none	 And the go fever which is more real than many doctors diseases waked and raged urging him who loved Maisie beyond anything in the world to go away and taste the old hot unregenerate life again to scuffle swear gamble and love light loves with his fellows to take ship 
4411-14494-0040	train-other-500	and know the sea once more and by her beget pictures to talk to Binat among the sands of Port Said while Yellow Tina mixed the drinks to hear the crackle of musketry
4411-14494-0041	train-other-500	and see the smoke roll outward thin and thicken again till the shining black faces came through and in that hell every man was strictly responsible for his own head and his own alone and struck with an unfettered arm
4411-14494-0042	train-other-500	It was impossible utterly impossible but Oh our fathers in the churchyard She is older than ye And our graves will be the greener Said The Men of the Sea What is there to hinder
4411-14494-0043	train-other-500	said Torpenhow in the long hush that followed the song You said a little time since that you wouldn t come for a walk round the world Torp That was months ago and I only objected to your making money for travelling expenses
4411-14494-0044	train-other-500	You ve shot your bolt here and it has gone home
none	none	 Go away and do some work and see some things Get some of the fat off you you re disgracefully out of condition said the Nilghai making a plunge from the chair 
4411-14494-0045	train-other-500	and grasping a handful of Dick generally over the right ribs Soft as putty pure tallow born of over feeding Train it off Dickie
4411-14494-0046	train-other-500	We re all equally gross Nilghai Next time you have to take the field you ll sit down wink your eyes gasp and die in a fit
none	none	 Never mind You go away on a ship Go to Lima again or to Brazil 
4411-14494-0047	train-other-500	There s always trouble in South America Do you suppose I want to be told where to go Great Heavens the only difficulty is to know where I m to stop
none	none	 But I shall stay here as I told you before Then you ll be buried in Kensal Green and turn into adipocere with the others 
4411-14494-0048	train-other-500	said Torpenhow Are you thinking of commissions in hand Pay forfeit and go You ve money enough to travel as a king if you please
none	none	 You ve the grisliest notions of amusement Torp 
4411-14494-0049	train-other-500	I think I see myself shipping first class on a six thousand ton hotel and asking the third engineer what makes the engines go round and whether it isn t very warm in the stokehold
none	none	 Ho ho I should ship as a loafer if ever I shipped at all which I m not going to do 
4411-14494-0050	train-other-500	I shall compromise and go for a small trip to begin with That s something at any rate Where will you go said Torpenhow It would do you all the good in the world old man
none	none	 The Nilghai saw the twinkle in Dick s eye and refrained from speech 
4411-14494-0051	train-other-500	I shall go in the first place to Rathray s stable where I shall hire one horse and take him very carefully as far as Richmond Hill Then I shall walk him back again in case he should accidentally burst into a lather
none	none	 and make Rathray angry 
4411-14494-0052	train-other-500	I shall do that to morrow for the sake of air and exercise Bah Dick had barely time to throw up his arm and ward off the cushion that the disgusted Torpenhow heaved at his head Air and exercise indeed said the Nilghai sitting down heavily on Dick
4411-14494-0053	train-other-500	Let s give him a little of both Get the bellows Torp At this point the conference broke up in disorder because Dick would not open his mouth till the Nilghai held his nose fast and there was some trouble in forcing the nozzle of the bellows between his teeth
none	none	 and even when it was there he weakly tried to puff against the force of the blast and his cheeks blew up with a great explosion 
4411-14494-0054	train-other-500	and the enemy becoming helpless with laughter he so beat them over the head
none	none	 with a soft sofa cushion that that became unsewn and distributed its feathers and Binkie interfering in Torpenhow s interests was bundled into the half empty bag and advised to scratch his way out 
4411-14494-0055	train-other-500	which he did after a while travelling rapidly up and down the floor in the shape of an agitated green haggis and when he came out looking for satisfaction
none	none	 the three pillars of his world were picking feathers out of their hair 
4411-14494-0056	train-other-500	A prophet has no honour in his own country said Dick ruefully dusting his knees This filthy fluff will never brush off my legs It was all for your own good said the Nilghai Nothing like air and exercise
4411-14494-0057	train-other-500	All for your good said Torpenhow not in the least with reference to past clowning
none	none	 It would let you focus things at their proper worth and prevent your becoming slack in this hothouse of a town 
4411-14494-0058	train-other-500	Indeed it would old man I shouldn t have spoken if I hadn t thought so Only you make a joke of everything Before God I do no such thing said Dick quickly and earnestly You don t know me if you think that
4411-14494-0059	train-other-500	I don t think it said the Nilghai How can fellows like ourselves who know what life and death really mean dare to make a joke of anything I know we pretend it to save ourselves from breaking down or going to the other extreme
none	none	 Can t I see old man how you re always anxious about me 
4411-14494-0060	train-other-500	and try to advise me to make my work better Do you suppose I don t think about that myself But you can t help me you can t help me not even you I must play my own hand alone in my own way Hear hear from the Nilghai
4411-14494-0061	train-other-500	What s the one thing in the Nilghai Saga that I ve never drawn in the Nungapunga Book Dick continued to Torpenhow who was a little astonished at the outburst
4411-14494-0062	train-other-500	Now there was one blank page in the book given over to the sketch that Dick had not drawn of the crowning exploit in the Nilghai s life when that man being young and forgetting that his body and bones belonged to the paper that employed him
none	none	 had ridden over sunburned slippery grass in the rear of Bredow s brigade on the day that the troopers flung themselves at Caurobert s artillery 
4411-14494-0063	train-other-500	and for aught they knew twenty battalions in front to save the battered twenty fourth German Infantry to give time to decide the fate of Vionville and to learn ere their remnant came back to Flavigay
4411-14494-0064	train-other-500	that cavalry can attack and crumple and break unshaken infantry Whenever he was inclined to think over a life that might have been better an income that might have been larger and a soul that might have been considerably cleaner
none	none	 the Nilghai would comfort himself with the thought I rode with Bredow s brigade at Vionville 
4411-14494-0065	train-other-500	and take heart for any lesser battle the next day might bring I know he said very gravely I was always glad that you left it out I left it out because Nilghai taught me what the Germany army learned then
4411-14494-0066	train-other-500	and what Schmidt taught their cavalry I don t know German What is it Take care of the time and the dressing will take care of itself I must ride my own line to my own beat old man Tempe ist richtung
4411-14494-0067	train-other-500	You ve learned your lesson well said the Nilghai He must go alone He speaks truth Torp Maybe I m as wrong as I can be hideously wrong
4411-14494-0068	train-other-500	I must find that out for myself as I have to think things out for myself but I daren t turn my head to dress by the next man
none	none	 It hurts me a great deal more than you know not to be able to go but I cannot that s all I must do my own work and live my own life in my own way 
4411-14494-0069	train-other-500	because I m responsible for both Only don t think I frivol about it Torp I have my own matches and sulphur and I ll make my own hell thanks There was an uncomfortable pause Then Torpenhow said blandly
4411-14494-0070	train-other-500	What did the Governor of North Carolina say to the Governor of South Carolina
none	none	 Excellent notion It is a long time between drinks 
4411-14494-0071	train-other-500	There are the makings of a very fine prig in you Dick said the Nilghai I ve liberated my mind estimable Binkie with the feathers in his mouth Dick picked up the still indignant one and shook him tenderly
4411-14494-0072	train-other-500	You re tied up in a sack and made to run about blind Binkie wee without any reason and it has hurt your little feelings Never mind
none	none	 Sic volo sic jubeo stet pro ratione voluntas 
4411-14494-0073	train-other-500	and don t sneeze in my eye because I talk Latin Good night He went out of the room That s distinctly one for you said the Nilghai I told you it was hopeless to meddle with him He s not pleased
4411-14494-0074	train-other-500	He d swear at me if he weren t I can t make it out He has the go fever upon him and he won t go I only hope that he mayn t have to go some day when he doesn t want to said Torpenhow
none	none	 In his own room Dick was settling a question with himself and the question was whether all the world and all that was therein 
4411-14494-0075	train-other-500	and a burning desire to exploit both
none	none	 was worth one threepenny piece thrown into the Thames It came of seeing the sea and I m a cur to think about it 
4411-14494-0076	train-other-500	he decided After all the honeymoon will be that tour with reservations only
none	none	 only I didn t realise that the sea was so strong 
4411-14494-0077	train-other-500	I didn t feel it so much when I was with Maisie These damnable songs did it
none	none	 He s beginning again But it was only Herrick s Nightpiece to Julia that the Nilghai sang and before it was ended Dick reappeared on the threshold not altogether clothed indeed but in his right mind thirsty and at peace The mood had come and gone with the rising and the falling of the tide by Fort Keeling CHAPTER IX If I have taken the common clay And wrought it cunningly In the shape of a god that was digged a clod The greater honour to me If thou hast taken the common clay And thy hands be not free From the taint of the soil thou hast made thy spoil The greater shame to thee The Two Potters HE DID no work of any kind for the rest of the week Then came another Sunday He dreaded and longed for the day always but since the red haired girl had sketched him there was rather more dread than desire in his mind He found that Maisie had entirely neglected his suggestions about line work She had gone off at score filed with some absurd notion for a fancy head It cost Dick something to command his temper What s the good of suggesting anything he said pointedly Ah but this will be a picture a real picture and I know that Kami will let me send it to the Salon You don t mind do you I suppose not But you won t have time for the Salon Maisie hesitated a little She even felt uncomfortable We re going over to France a month sooner because of it I shall get the idea sketched out here and work it up at Kami s Dick s heart stood still and he came very near to being disgusted with his queen who could do no wrong Just when I thought I had made some headway she goes off chasing butterflies It s too maddening There was no possibility of arguing for the red haired girl was in the studio Dick could only look unutterable reproach I m sorry he said and I think you make a mistake But what s the idea of your new picture I took it from a book That s bad to begin with Books aren t the places for pictures And It s this said the red haired girl behind him I was reading it to Maisie the other day from The City of Dreadful Night D you know the book A little I am sorry I spoke There are pictures in it What has taken her fancy The description of the Melancolia Her folded wings as of a mighty eagle But all too impotent to lift the regal Robustness of her earth born strength and pride And here again Maisie get the tea dear The forehead charged with baleful thoughts and dreams The household bunch of keys the housewife s gown Voluminous indented and yet rigid As though a shell of burnished metal frigid Her feet thick shod to tread all weakness down There was no attempt to conceal the scorn of the lazy voice Dick winced But that has been done already by an obscure artist by the name of Durer said he How does the poem run Three centuries and threescore years ago With phantasies of his peculiar thought You might as well try to rewrite Hamlet It will be a waste of time No it won t said Maisie putting down the teacups with a clatter to reassure herself And I mean to do it Can t you see what a beautiful thing it would make How in perdition can one do work when one hasn t had the proper training Any fool can get a notion It needs training to drive the thing through training and conviction not rushing after the first fancy Dick spoke between his teeth You don t understand said Maisie I think I can do it Again the voice of the girl behind him Baffled and beaten back she works on still Weary and sick of soul she works the more Sustained by her indomitable will The hands shall fashion and the brain shall pore And all her sorrow shall be turned to labour I fancy Maisie means to embody herself in the picture Sitting on a throne of rejected pictures No I shan t dear The notion in itself has fascinated me Of course you don t care for fancy heads Dick I don t think you could do them You like blood and bones That s a direct challenge If you can do a Melancolia that isn t merely a sorrowful female head I can do a better one and I will too What d you know about Melacolias Dick firmly believed that he was even then tasting three quarters of all the sorrow in the world She was a woman said Maisie and she suffered a great deal till she could suffer no more Then she began to laugh at it all and then I painted her and sent her to the Salon The red haired girl rose up and left the room laughing Dick looked at Maisie humbly and hopelessly Never mind about the picture he said Are you really going back to Kami s for a month before your time I must if I want to get the picture done And that s all you want Of course Don t be stupid Dick You haven t the power You have only the ideas the ideas and the little cheap impulses How you could have kept at your work for ten years steadily is a mystery to me So you are really going a month before you need I must do my work Your work bah No I didn t mean that It s all right dear Of course you must do your work and I think I ll say good bye for this week Won t you even stay for tea No thank you Have I your leave to go dear There s nothing more you particularly want me to do and the line work doesn t matter I wish you could stay and then we could talk over my picture If only one single picture s a success it draws attention to all the others I know some of my work is good if only people could see And you needn t have been so rude about it I m sorry We ll talk the Melancolia over some one of the other Sundays There are four more yes one two three four before you go Good bye Maisie Maisie stood by the studio window thinking till the red haired girl returned a little white at the corners of her lips Dick s gone off said Maisie Just when I wanted to talk about the picture Isn t it selfish of him Her companion opened her lips as if to speak shut them again and went on reading The City of Dreadful Night Dick was in the Park walking round and round a tree that he had chosen as his confidante for many Sundays past He was swearing audibly and when he found that the infirmities of the English tongue hemmed in his rage he sought consolation in Arabic which is expressly designed for the use of the afflicted He was not pleased with the reward of his patient service nor was he pleased with himself and it was long before he arrived at the proposition that the queen could do no wrong It s a losing game he said I m worth nothing when a whim of hers is in question But in a losing game at Port Said we used to double the stakes and go on She do a Melancolia She hasn t the power or the insight or the training Only the desire She s cursed with the curse of Reuben She won t do line work because it means real work and yet she s stronger than I am I ll make her understand that I can beat her on her own Melancolia Even then she wouldn t care She says I can only do blood and bones I don t believe she has blood in her veins All the same I love her and I must go on loving her and if I can humble her inordinate vanity I will I ll do a Melancolia that shall be something like a Melancolia the Melancolia that transcends all wit I ll do it at once con bless her He discovered that the notion would not come to order and that he could not free his mind for an hour from the thought of Maisie s departure He took very small interest in her rough studies for the Melancolia when she showed them next week The Sundays were racing past and the time was at hand when all the church bells in London could not ring Maisie back to him Once or twice he said something to Binkie about hermaphroditic futilities but the little dog received so many confidences both from Torpenhow and Dick that he did not trouble his tulip ears to listen Dick was permitted to see the girls off They were going by the Dover night boat and they hoped to return in August It was then February and Dick felt that he was being hardly used Maisie was so busy stripping the small house across the Park and packing her canvases that she had not time for thought Dick went down to Dover and wasted a day there fretting over a wonderful possibility Would Maisie at the very last allow him one small kiss He reflected that he might capture her by the strong arm as he had seem women captured in the Southern Soudan and lead her away but Maisie would never be led She would turn her gray eyes upon him and say Dick how selfish you are Then his courage would fail him It would be better after all to beg for that kiss Maisie looked more than usually kissable as she stepped from the night mail on to the windy pier in a gray waterproof and a little gray cloth travelling cap The red haired girl was not so lovely Her green eyes were hollow and her lips were dry Dick saw the trunks aboard and went to Maisie s side in the darkness under the bridge The mail bags were thundering into the forehold and the red haired girl was watching them You ll have a rough passage to night said Dick It s blowing outside I suppose I may come over and see you if I m good You mustn t I shall be busy At least if I want you I ll send for you But I shall write from Vitry sur Marne I shall have heaps of things to consult you about Oh Dick you have been so good to me so good to me Thank you for that dear It hasn t made any difference has it I can t tell a fib It hasn t in that way But don t think I m not grateful Damn the gratitude said Dick huskily to the paddle box What s the use of worrying You know I should ruin your life and you d ruin mine as things are now You remember what you said when you were so angry that day in the Park One of us has to be broken Can t you wait till that day comes No love I want you unbroken all to myself Maisie shook her head My poor Dick what can I say Don t say anything Give me a kiss Only one kiss Maisie I ll swear I won t take any more You might as well and then I can be sure you re grateful Maisie put her cheek forward and Dick took his reward in the darkness It was only one kiss but since there was no time limit specified it was a long one Maisie wrenched herself free angrily and Dick stood abashed and tingling from head to toe Good bye darling I didn t mean to scare you I m sorry Only keep well and do good work specially the Melancolia I m going to do one too Remember me to Kami and be careful what you drink Country drinking water is bad everywhere but it s worse in France Write to me if you want anything and good bye Say good bye to the whatever you call um girl and can t I have another kiss No You re quite right Good bye I should told him that it was not seemly to charge the mail bag incline He reached the pier as the steamer began to move off and he followed her with his heart And there s nothing nothing in the wide world to keep us apart except her obstinacy These Calais night boats are much too small I ll get Torp to write to the papers about it She s beginning to pitch already Maisie stood where Dick had left her till she heard a little gasping cough at her elbow The red haired girl s eyes were alight with cold flame He kissed you she said How could you let him when he wasn t anything to you How dared you to take a kiss from him Oh Maisie let s go to the ladies cabin I m sick deadly sick We aren t into open water yet Go down dear and I ll stay here I don t like the smell of the engines Poor Dick He deserved one only one But I didn t think he d frighten me so Dick returned to town next day just in time for lunch for which he had telegraphed To his disgust there were only empty plates in the studio He lifted up his voice like the bears in the fairy tale and Torpenhow entered looking guilty H sh said he Don t make such a noise I took it Come into my rooms and I ll show you why Dick paused amazed at the threshold for on Torpenhow s sofa lay a girl asleep and breathing heavily The little cheap sailor hat the blue and white dress fitter for June than for February dabbled with mud at the skirts the jacket trimmed with imitation Astrakhan and ripped at the shoulder seams the one and elevenpenny umbrella and above all the disgraceful condition of the kid topped boots declared all things Oh I say old man this is too bad You mustn t bring this sort up here They steal things from the rooms It looks bad I admit but I was coming in after lunch and she staggered into the hall I thought she was drunk at first but it was collapse I couldn t leave her as she was so I brought her up here and gave her your lunch She was fainting from want of food She went fast asleep the minute she had finished I know something of that complaint She s been living on sausages I suppose Torp you should have handed her over to a policeman for presuming to faint in a respectable house Poor little wretch Look at the face There isn t an ounce of immorality in it Only folly slack fatuous feeble futile folly It s a typical head D you notice how the skull begins to show through the flesh padding on the face and cheek bone What a cold blooded barbarian it is Don t hit a woman when she s down Can t we do anything She was simply dropping with starvation She almost fell into my arms and when she got to the food she ate like a wild beast It was horrible I can give her money which she would probably spend in drinks Is she going to sleep for ever The girl opened her eyes and glared at the men between terror and effrontery Feeling better said Torpenhow Yes Thank you There aren t many gentlemen that are as kind as you are Thank you When did you leave service said Dick who had been watching the scarred and chapped hands How did you know I was in service I was General servant I didn t like it And how do you like being your own mistress Do I look as if I liked it I suppose not One moment Would you be good enough to turn your face to the window The girl obeyed and Dick watched her face keenly so keenly that she made as if to hide behind Torpenhow The eyes have it said Dick walking up and down They are superb eyes for my business And after all every head depends on the eyes This has been sent from heaven to make up for what was taken away Now the weekly strain s off my shoulders I can get to work in earnest Evidently sent from heaven Yes Raise your chin a little please Gently old man gently You re scaring somebody out of her wits said Torpenhow who could see the girl trembling Don t let him hit me Oh please don t let him hit me I ve been hit cruel to day because I spoke to a man Don t let him look at me like that He s reg lar wicked that one Don t let him look at me like that neither Oh I feel as if I hadn t nothing on when he looks at me like that The overstrained nerves in the frail body gave way and the girl wept like a little child and began to scream Dick threw open the window and Torpenhow flung the door back There you are said Dick soothingly My friend here can call for a policeman and you can run through that door Nobody is going to hurt you The girl sobbed convulsively for a few minutes and then tried to laugh Nothing in the world to hurt you Now listen to me for a minute I m what they call an artist by profession You know what artists do They draw the things in red and black ink on the pop shop labels I dare say I haven t risen to pop shop labels yet Those are done by the Academicians I want to draw your head What for Because it s pretty That is why you will come to the room across the landing three times a week at eleven in the morning and I ll give you three quid a week just for sitting still and being drawn And there s a quid on account For nothing Oh my The girl turned the sovereign in her hand and with more foolish tears Ain t neither o you two gentlemen afraid of my bilking you No Only ugly girls do that Try and remember this place And by the way what s your name I m Bessic Bessie It s no use giving the rest Bessie Broke Stone broke if you like What s your names But there no one ever gives the real ones Dick consulted Torpenhow with his eyes My name s Heldar and my friend s called Torpenhow and you must be sure to come here Where do you live South the water one room five and sixpence a week Aren t you making fun of me about that three quid You ll see later on And Bessie next time you come remember you needn t wear that paint It s bad for the skin and I have all the colours you ll be likely to need Bessie withdrew scrubbing her cheek with a ragged pocket handkerchief The two men looked at each other You re a man said Torpenhow I m afraid I ve been a fool It isn t our business to run about the earth reforming Bessie Brokes And a woman of any kind has no right on this landing Perhaps she won t come back She will if she thinks she can get food and warmth here I know she will worse luck But remember old man she isn t a woman she s my model and be careful The idea She s a dissolute little scarecrow a gutter snippet and nothing more So you think Wait till she has been fed a little and freed from fear That fair type recovers itself very quickly You won t know her in a week or two when that abject fear has died out of her eyes She ll be too happy and smiling for my purposes But surely you re not taking her out of charity to please me I am not in the habit of playing with hot coals to please anybody She has been sent from heaven as I may have remarked before to help me with my Melancolia Never heard a word about the lady before What s the use of having a friend if you must sling your notions at him in words You ought to know what I m thinking about You ve heard me grunt lately Even so but grunts mean anything in your language from bad baccy to wicked dealers And I don t think I ve been much in your confidence for some time It was a high and soulful grunt You ought to have understood that it meant the Melancolia Dick walked Torpenhow up and down the room keeping silence Then he smote him in the ribs Now don t you see it Bessie s abject futility and the terror in her eyes welded on to one or two details in the way of sorrow that have come under my experience lately Likewise some orange and black two keys of each But I can t explain on an empty stomach It sounds mad enough You d better stick to your soldiers Dick instead of maundering about heads and eyes and experiences Think so Dick began to dance on his heels singing They re as proud as a turkey when they hold the ready cash You ought to ear the way they laugh an joke They are tricky an they re funny when they ve got the ready money Ow but see em when they re all stone broke Then he sat down to pour out his heart to Maisie in a four sheet letter of counsel and encouragement and registered an oath that he would get to work with an undivided heart as soon as Bessie should reappear The girl kept her appointment unpainted and unadorned afraid and overbold by turns When she found that she was merely expected to sit still she grew calmer and criticised the appointments of the studio with freedom and some point She liked the warmth and the comfort and the release from fear of physical pain Dick made two or three studies of her head in monochrome but the actual notion of the Melancolia would not arrive What a mess you keep your things in said Bessie some days later when she felt herself thoroughly at home I s pose your clothes are just as bad Gentlemen never think what buttons and tape are made for I buy things to wear and wear em till they go to pieces I don t know what Torpenhow does Bessie made diligent inquiry in the latter s room and unearthed a bale of disreputable socks Some of these I ll mend now she said and some I ll take home D you know I sit all day long at home doing nothing just like a lady and no more noticing them other girls in the house than if they was so many flies I don t have any unnecessary words but I put em down quick I can tell you when they talk to me No it s quite nice these days I lock my door and they can only call me names through the keyhole and I sit inside just like a lady mending socks mister Torpenhow wears his socks out both ends at once Three quid a week from me and the delights of my society No socks mended Nothing from Torp except a nod on the landing now and again and all his socks mended Bessie is very much a woman thought Dick and he looked at her between half shut eyes Food and rest had transformed the girl as Dick knew they would What are you looking at me like that for she said quickly Don t You look reg lar bad when you look that way You don t think much o me do you That depends on how you behave Bessie behaved beautifully Only it was difficult at the end of a sitting to bid her go out into the gray streets She very much preferred the studio and a big chair by the stove with some socks in her lap as an excuse for delay Then Torpenhow would come in and Bessie would be moved to tell strange and wonderful stories of her past and still stranger ones of her present improved circumstances She would make them tea as though she had a right to make it and once or twice on these occasions Dick caught Torpenhow s eyes fixed on the trim little figure and because Bessie s flittings about the room made Dick ardently long for Maisie he realised whither Torpenhow s thoughts were tending And Bessie was exceedingly careful of the condition of Torpenhow s linen She spoke very little to him but sometimes they talked together on the landing I was a great fool Dick said to himself I know what red firelight looks like when a man s tramping through a strange town and ours is a lonely selfish sort of life at the best I wonder Maisie doesn t feel that sometimes But I can t order Bessie away That s the worst of beginning things One never knows where they stop One evening after a sitting prolonged to the last limit of the light Dick was roused from a nap by a broken voice in Torpenhow s room He jumped to his feet Now what ought I to do It looks foolish to go in Oh bless you Binkie The little terrier thrust Torpenhow s door open with his nose and came out to take possession of Dick s chair The door swung wide unheeded and Dick across the landing could see Bessie in the half light making her little supplication to Torpenhow She was kneeling by his side and her hands were clasped across his knee I know I know she said thickly Tisn t right o me to do this but I can t help it and you were so kind so kind and you never took any notice o me And I ve mended all your things so carefully I did Oh please tisn t as if I was asking you to marry me I wouldn t think of it But you couldn t you take and live with me till Miss Right comes along I m only Miss Wrong I know but I d work my hands to the bare bone for you And I m not ugly to look at Say you will Dick hardly recognised Torpenhow s voice in reply But look here It s no use I m liable to be ordered off anywhere at a minute s notice if a war breaks out At a minute s notice dear What does that matter Until you go then Until you go Tisn t much I m asking and you don t know how good I can cook She had put an arm round his neck and was drawing his head down Until I go then Torp said Dick across the landing He could hardly steady his voice Come here a minute old man I m in trouble Heaven send he ll listen to me There was something very like an oath from Bessie s lips She was afraid of Dick and disappeared down the staircase in panic but it seemed an age before Torpenhow entered the studio He went to the mantelpiece buried his head on his arms and groaned like a wounded bull What the devil right have you to interfere he said at last Who s interfering with which Your own sense told you long ago you couldn t be such a fool It was a tough rack saint Anthony but you re all right now I oughtn t to have seen her moving about these rooms as if they belonged to her That s what upset me It gives a lonely man a sort of hankering doesn t it said Torpenhow piteously Now you talk sense It does But since you aren t in a condition to discuss the disadvantages of double housekeeping do you know what you re going to do I don t I wish I did You re going away for a season on a brilliant tour to regain tone You re going to Brighton or Scarborough or Prawle Point to see the ships go by And you re going at once Isn t it odd I ll take care of Binkie but out you go immediately Never resist the devil He holds the bank Fly from him Pack your things and go I believe you re right Where shall I go And you call yourself a special correspondent Pack first and inquire afterwards An hour later Torpenhow was despatched into the night for a hansom You ll probably think of some place to go to while you re moving said Dick On to Euston to begin with and oh yes get drunk to night He returned to the studio and lighted more candles for he found the room very dark Oh you Jezebel you futile little Jezebel Won t you hate me to morrow Binkie come here Binkie turned over on his back on the hearth rug and Dick stirred him with a meditative foot I said she was not immoral I was wrong She said she could cook That showed premeditated sin Oh Binkie if you are a man you will go to perdition but if you are a woman and say that you can cook you will go to a much worse place CHAPTER X What s you that follows at my side The foe that ye must fight my lord That hirples swift as I can ride The shadow of the night my lord Then wheel my horse against the foe He s down and overpast my lord Ye war against the sunset glow The darkness gathers fast my lord
4425_14497_000004_000000	train-clean-360	 The Fight of Heriot s Ford THIS is a cheerful life said Dick some days later 
4425_14497_000004_000001	train-clean-360	 Torp s away Bessie hates me I can t get at the notion of the Melancolia Maisie s letters are scrappy and I believe I have indigestion 
4425_14497_000004_000002	train-clean-360	What give a man pains across the head and spots before his eyes Binkie 
4425_14497_000004_000003	train-clean-360	Shall us take some liver pills 
none	none	Dick had just gone through a lively scene with Bessie She had for the fiftieth time reproached him for sending Torpenhow away 
4425_14497_000005_000002	train-clean-360	She explained her enduring hatred for Dick and made it clear to him that she only sat for the sake of his money 
4425_14497_000005_000003	train-clean-360	 And mister Torpenhow s ten times a better man than you she concluded 
none	none	He is 
4425_14497_000006_000001	train-clean-360	That s why he went away 
none	none	I should have stayed and made love to you The girl sat with her chin on her hand scowling To me 
4425_14497_000007_000002	train-clean-360	I d like to catch you 
none	none	If I wasn t afraid o being hung I d kill you That s what I d do D you believe me 
4425_14497_000009_000000	train-clean-360	Dick smiled wearily 
4425_14497_000009_000001	train-clean-360	It is not pleasant to live in the company of a notion that will not work out a fox terrier that cannot talk and a woman who talks too much 
4425_14497_000009_000002	train-clean-360	He would have answered but at that moment there unrolled itself from one corner of the studio a veil as it were of the flimsiest gauze 
4425_14497_000009_000003	train-clean-360	He rubbed his eyes but the gray haze would not go 
none	none	This is disgraceful indigestion 
4425_14497_000010_000001	train-clean-360	Binkie we will go to a medicine man We can t have our eyes interfered with for by these we get our bread also mutton chop bones for little dogs 
4425_14497_000011_000000	train-clean-360	The doctor was an affable local practitioner with white hair and he said nothing till Dick began to describe the gray film in the studio 
4425_14497_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 We all want a little patching and repairing from time to time he chirped 
4425_14497_000012_000001	train-clean-360	 Like a ship my dear sir exactly like a ship 
none	none	Sometimes the hull is out of order and we consult the surgeon sometimes the rigging and then I advise sometimes the engines and we go to the brain specialist sometimes the look out on the bridge is tired and then we see an oculist I should recommend you to see an oculist 
4425_14497_000012_000004	train-clean-360	A little patching and repairing from time to time is all we want 
4425_14497_000012_000005	train-clean-360	An oculist by all means 
4425_14497_000013_000000	train-clean-360	Dick sought an oculist the best in London 
none	none	He was certain that the local practitioner did not know anything about his trade and more certain that Maisie would laugh at him if he were forced to wear spectacles
4425_14497_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 I ve neglected the warnings of my lord the stomach too long 
4425_14497_000014_000001	train-clean-360	Hence these spots before the eyes Binkie 
4425_14497_000014_000002	train-clean-360	I can see as well as I ever could 
4425_14497_000015_000000	train-clean-360	As he entered the dark hall that led to the consulting room a man cannoned against him 
4425_14497_000015_000001	train-clean-360	Dick saw the face as it hurried out into the street 
4425_14497_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 That s the writer type 
4425_14497_000016_000001	train-clean-360	He has the same modelling of the forehead as Torp 
4425_14497_000016_000002	train-clean-360	He looks very sick 
4425_14497_000016_000003	train-clean-360	Probably heard something he didn t like 
4425_14497_000017_000000	train-clean-360	Even as he thought a great fear came upon Dick a fear that made him hold his breath as he walked into the oculist s waiting room with the heavy carved furniture the dark green paper and the sober hued prints on the wall 
4425_14497_000017_000001	train-clean-360	He recognised a reproduction of one of his own sketches 
4425_14497_000018_000000	train-clean-360	Many people were waiting their turn before him 
4425_14497_000018_000001	train-clean-360	His eye was caught by a flaming red and gold Christmas carol book 
4425_14497_000018_000002	train-clean-360	Little children came to that eye doctor and they needed large type amusement 
4425_14497_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 That s idolatrous bad Art he said drawing the book towards himself 
none	none	From the anatomy of the angels it has been made in Germany He opened in mechanically and there leaped to his eyes a verse printed in red ink 
4425_14497_000021_000000	train-clean-360	The next good joy that Mary had It was the joy of three To see her good Son Jesus Christ Making the blind to see Making the blind to see good Lord And happy we may be 
4425_14497_000022_000000	train-clean-360	Praise Father Son and Holy Ghost To all eternity Dick read and re read the verse till his turn came and the doctor was bending above him seated in an arm chair 
none	none	The blaze of the gas microscope in his eyes made him wince 
4425_14497_000022_000002	train-clean-360	The doctor s hand touched the scar of the sword cut on Dick s head and Dick explained briefly how he had come by it 
4425_14497_000022_000003	train-clean-360	When the flame was removed Dick saw the doctor s face and the fear came upon him again 
4425_14497_000022_000004	train-clean-360	The doctor wrapped himself in a mist of words 
none	none	Dick caught allusions to scar frontal bone optic nerve extreme caution and the avoidance of mental anxiety
4425_14497_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 Verdict he said faintly 
none	none	My business is painting and I daren t waste time 
4425_14497_000023_000002	train-clean-360	What do you make of it 
4425_14497_000024_000000	train-clean-360	Again the whirl of words but this time they conveyed a meaning 
4425_14497_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 Can you give me anything to drink 
4425_14497_000026_000000	train-clean-360	Many sentences were pronounced in that darkened room and the prisoners often needed cheering 
4425_14497_000026_000001	train-clean-360	Dick found a glass of liqueur brandy in his hand 
4425_14497_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 As far as I can gather he said coughing above the spirit you call it decay of the optic nerve or something and therefore hopeless 
4425_14497_000027_000001	train-clean-360	What is my time limit avoiding all strain and worry 
4425_14497_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 Perhaps one year 
none	none	My God 
4425_14497_000029_000001	train-clean-360	And if I don t take care of myself 
4425_14497_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 I really could not say 
4425_14497_000030_000003	train-clean-360	I really could not say 
4425_14497_000030_000001	train-clean-360	One cannot ascertain the exact amount of injury inflicted by the sword cut 
4425_14497_000030_000002	train-clean-360	The scar is an old one and exposure to the strong light of the desert did you say with excessive application to fine work 
none	none	I really could not say
4425_14497_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 I beg your pardon but it has come without any warning 
4425_14497_000031_000001	train-clean-360	If you will let me I ll sit here for a minute and then I ll go 
none	none	You have been very good in telling me the truth Without any warning without any warning Thanks Dick went into the street and was rapturously received by Binkie
4425_14497_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 We ve got it very badly little dog 
4425_14497_000034_000001	train-clean-360	Just as badly as we can get it We ll go to the Park to think it out 
4425_14497_000035_000000	train-clean-360	They headed for a certain tree that Dick knew well and they sat down to thin because his legs were trembling under him and there was cold fear at the pit of his stomach 
4425_14497_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 How could it have come without any warning 
none	none	It s as sudden as being shot 
4425_14497_000036_000002	train-clean-360	It s the living death Binkie 
none	none	We re to be shut up in the dark in one year if we re careful and we shan t see anybody and we shall never have anything we want not though we live to be a hundred Binkie wagged his tail joyously
4425_14497_000036_000004	train-clean-360	 Binkie we must think 
4425_14497_000036_000005	train-clean-360	Let s see how it feels to be blind Dick shut his eyes and flaming commas and Catherine wheels floated inside the lids 
4425_14497_000036_000006	train-clean-360	Yet when he looked across the Park the scope of his vision was not contracted 
4425_14497_000036_000007	train-clean-360	He could see perfectly until a procession of slow wheeling fireworks defiled across his eyeballs 
4425_14497_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 Little dorglums we aren t at all well 
none	none	Let s go home 
4425_14497_000037_000002	train-clean-360	If only Torp were back now 
none	none	But Torpenhow was in the south of England inspecting dockyards in the company of the Nilghai 
4425_14497_000038_000001	train-clean-360	His letters were brief and full of mystery 
none	none	Dick had never asked anybody to help him in his joys or his sorrows 
4425_14497_000039_000001	train-clean-360	He argued in the loneliness of his studio henceforward to be decorated with a film of gray gauze in one corner that if his fate were blindness all the Torpenhows in the world could not save him 
4425_14497_000039_000002	train-clean-360	 I can t call him off his trip to sit down and sympathise with me 
4425_14497_000039_000003	train-clean-360	I must pull through this business alone he said 
4425_14497_000039_000004	train-clean-360	He was lying on the sofa eating his moustache and wondering what the darkness of the night would be like 
none	none	Then came to his mind the memory of a quaint scene in the Soudan A soldier had been nearly hacked in two by a broad bladed Arab spear For one instant the man felt no pain 
4425_14497_000039_000006	train-clean-360	Looking down he saw that his life blood was going from him 
4425_14497_000039_000007	train-clean-360	The stupid bewilderment on his face was so intensely comic that both Dick and Torpenhow still panting and unstrung from a fight for life had roared with laughter in which the man seemed as if he would join but as his lips parted in a sheepish grin the agony of death came upon him and he pitched grunting at their feet 
4425_14497_000039_000008	train-clean-360	Dick laughed again remembering the horror 
4425_14497_000039_000009	train-clean-360	It seemed so exactly like his own case 
4425_14497_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 But I have a little more time allowed me he said 
4425_14497_000040_000001	train-clean-360	He paced up and down the room quietly at first but afterwards with the hurried feet of fear 
4425_14497_000040_000002	train-clean-360	It was as though a black shadow stood at his elbow and urged him to go forward and there were only weaving circles and floating pin dots before his eyes 
4425_14497_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 We need to be calm Binkie we must be calm He talked aloud for the sake of distraction 
none	none	This isn t nice at all What shall we do 
4425_14497_000041_000003	train-clean-360	We must do something 
4425_14497_000041_000004	train-clean-360	Our time is short 
4425_14497_000041_000005	train-clean-360	I shouldn t have believed that this morning but now things are different 
none	none	Binkie where was Moses when the light went out 
4425_14497_000042_000000	train-clean-360	Binkie smiled from ear to ear as a well bred terrier should but made no suggestion 
none	none	Were there but world enough and time This coyness Binkie were not crime But at my back I always hear He wiped his forehead which was unpleasantly damp What can I do What can I do I haven t any notions left and I can t think connectedly but I must do something or I shall go off my head The hurried walk recommenced Dick stopping every now and again to drag forth long neglected canvases and old note books for he turned to his work by instinct as a thing that could not fail
4425_14497_000044_000001	train-clean-360	 You won t do and you won t do he said at each inspection 
none	none	No more soldiers I couldn t paint em 
4425_14497_000044_000004	train-clean-360	Sudden death comes home too nearly and this is battle and murder for me 
none	none	The day was failing and Dick thought for a moment that the twilight of the blind had come upon him unaware
4425_14497_000045_000001	train-clean-360	 Allah Almighty he cried despairingly help me through the time of waiting and I won t whine when my punishment comes 
4425_14497_000045_000002	train-clean-360	What can I do now before the light goes 
none	none	There was no answer 
4425_14497_000046_000001	train-clean-360	Dick waited till he could regain some sort of control over himself 
4425_14497_000046_000002	train-clean-360	His hands were shaking and he prided himself on their steadiness he could feel that his lips were quivering and the sweat was running down his face 
4425_14497_000046_000003	train-clean-360	He was lashed by fear driven forward by the desire to get to work at once and accomplish something and maddened by the refusal of his brain to do more than repeat the news that he was about to go blind 
4425_14497_000046_000004	train-clean-360	 It s a humiliating exhibition he thought and I m glad Torp isn t here to see 
4425_14497_000046_000005	train-clean-360	The doctor said I was to avoid mental worry 
4425_14497_000047_000000	train-clean-360	Come here and let me pet you Binkie 
none	none	The little dog yelped because Dick nearly squeezed the bark out of him Then he heard the man speaking in the twilight and doglike understood that his trouble stood off from him Allah is good Binkie 
4425_14497_000049_000001	train-clean-360	Not quite so gentle as we could wish but we ll discuss that later 
4425_14497_000049_000002	train-clean-360	I think I see my way to it now 
4425_14497_000049_000003	train-clean-360	All those studies of Bessie s head were nonsense and they nearly brought your master into a scrape 
none	none	I hold the notion now as clear as crystal the Melancolia that transcends all wit There shall be Maisie in that head because I shall never get Maisie and Bess of course because she knows all about Melancolia though she doesn t know she knows and there shall be some drawing in it and it shall all end up with a laugh 
4425_14497_000049_000005	train-clean-360	That s for myself 
none	none	Shall she giggle or grin No she shall laugh right out of the canvas and every man and woman that ever had a sorrow of their own shall what is it the poem says
4425_14497_000050_000000	train-clean-360	 Understand the speech and feel a stir Of fellowship in all disastrous fight In all disastrous fight 
4425_14497_000050_000001	train-clean-360	That s better than painting the thing merely to pique Maisie 
4425_14497_000050_000002	train-clean-360	I can do it now because I have it inside me 
none	none	Binkie I m going to hold you up by your tail You re an omen Come here 
4425_14497_000051_000000	train-clean-360	Binkie swung head downward for a moment without speaking 
4425_14497_000052_000000	train-clean-360	 Rather like holding a guinea pig but you re a brave little dog and you don t yelp when you re hung up 
none	none	It is an omen 
4425_14497_000053_000000	train-clean-360	Binkie went to his own chair and as often as he looked saw Dick walking up and down rubbing his hands and chuckling 
4425_14497_000053_000001	train-clean-360	That night Dick wrote a letter to Maisie full of the tenderest regard for her health but saying very little about his own and dreamed of the Melancolia to be born 
4425_14497_000053_000002	train-clean-360	Not till morning did he remember that something might happen to him in the future 
4425_14497_000054_000000	train-clean-360	He fell to work whistling softly and was swallowed up in the clean clear joy of creation which does not come to man too often lest he should consider himself the equal of his God and so refuse to die at the appointed time 
4425_14497_000054_000001	train-clean-360	He forgot Maisie Torpenhow and Binkie at his feet but remembered to stir Bessie who needed very little stirring into a tremendous rage that he might watch the smouldering lights in her eyes 
4425_14497_000055_000000	train-clean-360	He threw himself without reservation into his work and did not think of the doom that was to overtake him for he was possessed with his notion and the things of this world had no power upon him 
4425_14497_000056_000000	train-clean-360	 You re pleased to day said Bessie 
4425_14497_000057_000000	train-clean-360	Dick waved his mahl stick in mystic circles and went to the sideboard for a drink 
none	none	In the evening when the exaltation of the day had died down he went to the sideboard again and after some visits became convinced that the eye doctor was a liar since he could still see everything very clearly He was of opinion that he would even make a home for Maisie and that whether she liked it or not she should be his wife The mood passed next morning but the sideboard and all upon it remained for his comfort Again he set to work and his eyes troubled him with spots and dashes and blurs till he had taken counsel with the sideboard and the Melancolia both on the canvas and in his own mind appeared lovelier than ever 
4425_14497_000059_000001	train-clean-360	There was a delightful sense of irresponsibility upon him such as they feel who walking among their fellow men know that the death sentence of disease is upon them and seeing that fear is but waste of the little time left are riotously happy 
4425_14497_000059_000002	train-clean-360	The days passed without event 
none	none	Bessie arrived punctually always and though her voice seemed to Dick to come from a distance her face was always very near 
4425_14497_000060_000001	train-clean-360	The Melancolia began to flame on the canvas in the likeness of a woman who had known all the sorrow in the world and was laughing at it 
4425_14497_000060_000002	train-clean-360	It was true that the corners of the studio draped themselves in gray film and retired into the darkness that the spots in his eyes and the pains across his head were very troublesome and that Maisie s letters were hard to read and harder still to answer 
4425_14497_000060_000003	train-clean-360	He could not tell her of his trouble and he could not laugh at her accounts of her own Melancolia which was always going to be finished 
4425_14497_000060_000004	train-clean-360	But the furious days of toil and the nights of wild dreams made amends for all and the sideboard was his best friend on earth 
none	none	Bessie was singularly dull 
4425_14497_000061_000001	train-clean-360	She used to shriek with rage when Dick stared at her between half closed eyes 
none	none	Now she sulked or watched him with disgust saying very little 
4425_14497_000062_000000	train-clean-360	Torpenhow had been absent for six weeks 
4425_14497_000062_000001	train-clean-360	An incoherent note heralded his return 
4425_14497_000062_000002	train-clean-360	 News great news he wrote 
4425_14497_000062_000003	train-clean-360	 The Nilghai knows and so does the Keneu 
4425_14497_000062_000004	train-clean-360	We re all back on Thursday 
4425_14497_000062_000005	train-clean-360	Get lunch and clean your accoutrements 
4425_14497_000063_000000	train-clean-360	Dick showed Bessie the letter and she abused him for that he had ever sent Torpenhow away and ruined her life 
4425_14497_000064_000000	train-clean-360	 Well said Dick brutally you re better as you are instead of making love to some drunken beast in the street He felt that he had rescued Torpenhow from great temptation 
4425_14497_000065_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t know if that s any worse than sitting to a drunken beast in a studio 
4425_14497_000065_000001	train-clean-360	You haven t been sober for three weeks 
none	none	You ve been soaking the whole time and yet you pretend you re better than me
4425_14497_000066_000000	train-clean-360	 What d you mean said Dick 
none	none	Mean 
4425_14497_000067_000001	train-clean-360	You ll see when mister Torpenhow comes back 
4425_14497_000068_000000	train-clean-360	It was not long to wait 
4425_14497_000068_000001	train-clean-360	Torpenhow met Bessie on the staircase without a sign of feeling 
none	none	He had news that was more to him than many Bessies and the Keneu and the Nilghai were trampling behind him calling for Dick
4425_14497_000069_000000	train-clean-360	 Drinking like a fish Bessie whispered 
4425_14497_000069_000001	train-clean-360	 He s been at it for nearly a month She followed the men stealthily to hear judgment done 
4425_14497_000070_000000	train-clean-360	They came into the studio rejoicing to be welcomed over effusively by a drawn lined shrunken haggard wreck unshaven blue white about the nostrils stooping in the shoulders and peering under his eyebrows nervously 
4425_14497_000070_000001	train-clean-360	The drink had been at work as steadily as Dick 
4425_14497_000071_000000	train-clean-360	 Is this you said Torpenhow 
4425_14497_000072_000000	train-clean-360	 All that s left of me 
none	none	Sit down 
4425_14497_000072_000002	train-clean-360	Binkie s quite well and I ve been doing some good work He reeled where he stood 
none	none	You ve done some of the worst work you ve ever done in your life Man alive you re 
4425_14497_000074_000000	train-clean-360	Torpenhow turned to his companions appealingly and they left the room to find lunch elsewhere 
none	none	Then he spoke but since the reproof of a friend is much too sacred and intimate a thing to be printed and since Torpenhow used figures and metaphors which were unseemly and contempt untranslatable it will never be known what was actually said to Dick who blinked and winked and picked at his hands 
4425_14497_000074_000002	train-clean-360	After a time the culprit began to feel the need of a little self respect 
4425_14497_000074_000003	train-clean-360	He was quite sure that he had not in any way departed from virtue and there were reasons too of which Torpenhow knew nothing 
4425_14497_000074_000004	train-clean-360	He would explain 
4425_14497_000075_000000	train-clean-360	He rose tried to straighten his shoulders and spoke to the face he could hardly see 
none	none	You are right he said
4425_14497_000076_000001	train-clean-360	 But I am right too 
4425_14497_000076_000002	train-clean-360	After you went away I had some trouble with my eyes 
4425_14497_000076_000003	train-clean-360	So I went to an oculist and he turned a gasogene I mean a gas engine into my eye 
none	none	That was very long ago 
4425_14497_000076_000005	train-clean-360	He said Scar on the head sword cut and optic nerve Make a note of that 
4425_14497_000076_000006	train-clean-360	So I am going blind 
4425_14497_000076_000007	train-clean-360	I have some work to do before I go blind and I suppose that I must do it 
4425_14497_000076_000008	train-clean-360	I cannot see much now but I can see best when I am drunk 
4425_14497_000076_000009	train-clean-360	I did not know I was drunk till I was told but I must go on with my work 
none	none	If you want to see it there it is He pointed to the all but finished Melancolia and looked for applause 
4425_14497_000077_000000	train-clean-360	Torpenhow said nothing and Dick began to whimper feebly for joy at seeing Torpenhow again for grief at misdeeds if indeed they were misdeeds that made Torpenhow remote and unsympathetic and for childish vanity hurt since Torpenhow had not given a word of praise to his wonderful picture 
4425_14497_000078_000000	train-clean-360	Bessie looked through the keyhole after a long pause and saw the two walking up and down as usual Torpenhow s hand on Dick s shoulder 
none	none	Hereat she said something so improper that it shocked even Binkie who was dribbling patiently on the landing with the hope of seeing his master again CHAPTER XI The lark will make her hymn to God The partridge call her brood While I forget the heath I trod The fields wherein I stood Tis dule to know not night from morn But deeper dule to know I can but hear the hunter s horn That once I used to blow The Only Son IT WAS the third day after Torpenhow s return and his heart was heavy Do you mean to tell me that you can t see to work without whiskey It s generally the other way about Can a drunkard swear on his honour said Dick Yes if he has been as good a man as you Then I give you my word of honour said Dick speaking hurriedly through parched lips Old man I can hardly see your face now You ve kept me sober for two days if I ever was drunk and I ve done no work Don t keep me back any more I don t know when my eyes may give out The spots and dots and the pains and things are crowding worse than ever I swear I can see all right when I m when I m moderately screwed as you say Give me three more sittings from Bessie and all the stuff I want and the picture will be done I can t kill myself in three days It only means a touch of D T at the worst If I give you three days more will you promise me to stop work and the other thing whether the picture s finished or not I can t You don t know what that picture means to me But surely you could get the Nilghai to help you and knock me down and tie me up I shouldn t fight for the whiskey but I should for the work Go on then I give you three days but you re nearly breaking my heart Dick returned to his work toiling as one possessed and the yellow devil of whiskey stood by him and chased away the spots in his eyes The Melancolia was nearly finished and was all or nearly all that he had hoped she would be Dick jested with Bessie who reminded him that he was a drunken beast but the reproof did not move him You can t understand Bess We are in sight of land now and soon we shall lie back and think about what we ve done I ll give you three months pay when the picture s finished and next time I have any more work in hand but that doesn t matter Won t three months pay make you hate me less No it won t I hate you and I ll go on hating you mister Torpenhow won t speak to me any more He s always looking at maps Bessie did not say that she had again laid siege to Torpenhow or that at the end of our passionate pleading he had picked her up given her a kiss and put her outside the door with the recommendation not to be a little fool He spent most of his time in the company of the Nilghai and their talk was of war in the near future the hiring of transports and secret preparations among the dockyards He did not wish to see Dick till the picture was finished He s doing first class work he said to the Nilghai and it s quite out of his regular line But for the matter of that so s his infernal soaking Never mind Leave him alone When he has come to his senses again we ll carry him off from this place and let him breathe clean air Poor Dick I don t envy you Torp when his eyes fail Yes it will be a case of God help the man who s chained to our Davie The worst is that we don t know when it will happen and I believe the uncertainty and the waiting have sent Dick to the whiskey more than anything else How the Arab who cut his head open would grin if he knew He s at perfect liberty to grin if he can He s dead That s poor consolation now In the afternoon of the third day Torpenhow heard Dick calling for him All finished he shouted I ve done it Come in Isn t she a beauty Isn t she a darling I ve been down to hell to get her but isn t she worth it Torpenhow looked at the head of a woman who laughed a full lipped hollow eyed woman who laughed from out of the canvas as Dick had intended she would Who taught you how to do it said Torpenhow The touch and notion have nothing to do with your regular work What a face it is What eyes and what insolence Unconsciously he threw back his head and laughed with her She s seen the game played out I don t think she had a good time of it and now she doesn t care Isn t that the idea Exactly Where did you get the mouth and chin from They don t belong to Bess They re some one else s But isn t it good Isn t it thundering good Wasn t it worth the whiskey I did it Alone I did it and it s the best I can do He drew his breath sharply and whispered Just God what could I not do ten years hence if I can do this now By the way what do you think of it Bess The girl was biting her lips She loathed Torpenhow because he had taken no notice of her I think it s just the horridest beastliest thing I ever saw she answered and turned away More than you will be of that way of thinking young woman Dick there s a sort of murderous viperine suggestion in the poise of the head that I don t understand said Torpenhow That s trick work said Dick chuckling with delight at being completely understood I couldn t resist one little bit of sheer swagger It s a French trick and you wouldn t understand but it s got at by slewing round the head a trifle and a tiny tiny foreshortening of one side of the face from the angle of the chin to the top of the left ear That and deepening the shadow under the lobe of the ear It was flagrant trick work but having the notion fixed I felt entitled to play with it Oh you beauty Amen She is a beauty I can feel it So will every man who has any sorrow of his own said Dick slapping his thigh He shall see his trouble there and by the Lord Harry just when he s feeling properly sorry for himself he shall throw back his head and laugh as she is laughing I ve put the life of my heart and the light of my eyes into her and I don t care what comes I m tired awfully tired I think I ll get to sleep Take away the whiskey it has served its turn and give Bessie thirty six quid and three over for luck Cover the picture He dropped asleep in the long chair hid face white and haggard almost before he had finished the sentence Bessie tried to take Torpenhow s hand Aren t you never going to speak to me any more she said but Torpenhow was looking at Dick What a stock of vanity the man has I ll take him in hand to morrow and make much of him He deserves it Eh what was that Bess Nothing I ll put things tidy here a little and then I ll go You couldn t give me that three months pay now could you He said you were to Torpenhow gave her a check and went to his own rooms Bessie faithfully tidied up the studio set the door ajar for flight emptied half a bottle of turpentine on a duster and began to scrub the face of the Melancolia viciously The paint did not smudge quickly enough She took a palette knife and scraped following each stroke with the wet duster In five minutes the picture was a formless scarred muddle of colours She threw the paint stained duster into the studio stove stuck out her tongue at the sleeper and whispered Bilked as she turned to run down the staircase She would never see Torpenhow any more but she had at least done harm to the man who had come between her and her desire and who used to make fun of her Cashing the check was the very cream of the jest to Bessie Then the little privateer sailed across the Thames to be swallowed up in the gray wilderness of South the Water Dick slept till late in the evening when Torpenhow dragged him off to bed His eyes were as bright as his voice was hoarse Let s have another look at the picture he said insistently as a child You go to bed said Torpenhow You aren t at all well though you mayn t know it You re as jumpy as a cat I reform to morrow Good night As he repassed through the studio Torpenhow lifted the cloth above the picture and almost betrayed himself by outcries Wiped out scraped out and turped out He s on the verge of jumps as it is That s Bess the little fiend Only a woman could have done that with the ink not dry on the check too Dick will be raving mad to morrow It was all my fault for trying to help gutter devils Oh my poor Dick the Lord is hitting you very hard Dick could not sleep that night partly for pure joy and partly because the well known Catherine wheels inside his eyes had given place to crackling volcanoes of many coloured fire Spout away he said aloud I ve done my work and now you can do what you please He lay still staring at the ceiling the long pent up delirium of drink in his veins his brain on fire with racing thoughts that would not stay to be considered and his hands crisped and dry He had just discovered that he was painting the face of the Melancolia on a revolving dome ribbed with millions of lights and that all his wondrous thoughts stood embodied hundreds of feet below his tiny swinging plank shouting together in his honour when something cracked inside his temples like an overstrained bowstring the glittering dome broke inward and he was alone in the thick night I ll go to sleep The room s very dark Let s light a lamp and see how the Melancolia looks There ought to have been a moon It was then that Torpenhow heard his name called by a voice that he did not know in the rattling accents of deadly fear He s looked at the picture was his first thought as he hurried into the bedroom and found Dick sitting up and beating the air with his hands Torp Torp where are you For pity s sake come to me What s the matter Dick clutched at his shoulder Matter I ve been lying here for hours in the dark and you never heard me Torp old man don t go away I m all in the dark In the dark I tell you Torpenhow held the candle within a foot of Dick s eyes but there was no light in those eyes He lit the gas and Dick heard the flame catch The grip of his fingers on Torpenhow s shoulder made Torpenhow wince Don t leave me You wouldn t leave me alone now would you I can t see D you understand It s black quite black and I feel as if I was falling through it all Steady does it Torpenhow put his arm round Dick and began to rock him gently to and fro That s good Now don t talk If I keep very quiet for a while this darkness will lift It seems just on the point of breaking H sh Dick knit his brows and stared desperately in front of him The night air was chilling Torpenhow s toes Can you stay like that a minute he said I ll get my dressing gown and some slippers Dick clutched the bed head with both hands and waited for the darkness to clear away What a time you ve been he cried when Torpenhow returned It s as black as ever What are you banging about in the door way Long chair horse blanket pillow Going to sleep by you Lie down now you ll be better in the morning I shan t The voice rose to a wail My God I m blind I m blind and the darkness will never go away He made as if to leap from the bed but Torpenhow s arms were round him and Torpenhow s chin was on his shoulder and his breath was squeezed out of him He could only gasp Blind and wriggle feebly Steady Dickie steady said the deep voice in his ear and the grip tightened Bite on the bullet old man and don t let them think you re afraid The grip could draw no closer Both men were breathing heavily Dick threw his head from side to side and groaned Let me go he panted You re cracking my ribs We we mustn t let them think we re afraid must we all the powers of darkness and that lot Lie down It s all over now Yes said Dick obediently But would you mind letting me hold your hand I feel as if I wanted something to hold on to One drops through the dark so Torpenhow thrust out a large and hairy paw from the long chair Dick clutched it tightly and in half an hour had fallen asleep Torpenhow withdrew his hand and stooping over Dick kissed him lightly on the forehead as men do sometimes kiss a wounded comrade in the hour of death to ease his departure In the gray dawn Torpenhow heard Dick talking to himself He was adrift on the shoreless tides of delirium speaking very quickly It s a pity a great pity but it s helped and it must be eaten Master George Sufficient unto the day is the blindness thereof and further putting aside all Melancolias and false humours it is of obvious notoriety such as mine was that the queen can do no wrong Torp doesn t know that I ll tell him when we re a little farther into the desert What a bungle those boatmen are making of the steamer ropes They ll have that four inch hawser chafed through in a minute I told you so there she goes White foam on green water and the steamer slewing round How good that looks I ll sketch it No I can t I m afflicted with ophthalmia That was one of the ten plagues of Egypt and it extends up the Nile in the shape of cataract Ha that s a joke Torp Laugh you graven image and stand clear of the hawser It ll knock you into the water and make your dress all dirty Maisie dear Oh said Torpenhow This happened before That night on the river She ll be sure to say it s my fault if you get muddy and you re quite near enough to the breakwater Maisie that s not fair Ah I knew you d miss Low and to the left dear But you ve no conviction Don t be angry darling I d cut my hand off if it would give you anything more than obstinacy My right hand if it would serve Now we mustn t listen Here s an island shouting across seas of misunderstanding with a vengeance But it s shouting truth I fancy said Torpenhow The babble continued It all bore upon Maisie Sometimes Dick lectured at length on his craft then he cursed himself for his folly in being enslaved He pleaded to Maisie for a kiss only one kiss before she went away and called to her to come back from Vitry sur Marne if she would but through all his ravings he bade heaven and earth witness that the queen could do no wrong Torpenhow listened attentively and learned every detail of Dick s life that had been hidden from him For three days Dick raved through the past and then a natural sleep What a strain he has been running under poor chap said Torpenhow Dick of all men handing himself over like a dog And I was lecturing him on arrogance I ought to have known that it was no use to judge a man But I did it What a demon that girl must be Dick s given her his life confound him and she s given him one kiss apparently Torp said Dick from the bed go out for a walk You ve been here too long I ll get up Hi This is annoying I can t dress myself Oh it s too absurd Torpenhow helped him into his clothes and led him to the big chair in the studio He sat quietly waiting under strained nerves for the darkness to lift It did not lift that day nor the next Dick adventured on a voyage round the walls He hit his shins against the stove and this suggested to him that it would be better to crawl on all fours one hand in front of him Torpenhow found him on the floor I m trying to get the geography of my new possessions said he D you remember that nigger you gouged in the square Pity you didn t keep the odd eye It would have been useful Any letters for me Give me all the ones in fat gray envelopes with a sort of crown thing outside They re of no importance Torpenhow gave him a letter with a black M on the envelope flap Dick put it into his pocket There was nothing in it that Torpenhow might not have read but it belonged to himself and to Maisie who would never belong to him When she finds that I don t write she ll stop writing It s better so I couldn t be any use to her now Dick argued and the tempter suggested that he should make known his condition Every nerve in him revolted I have fallen low enough already I m not going to beg for pity Besides it would be cruel to her He strove to put Maisie out of his thoughts but the blind have many opportunities for thinking and as the tides of his strength came back to him in the long employless days of dead darkness Dick s soul was troubled to the core Another letter and another came from Maisie Then there was silence and Dick sat by the window the pulse of summer in the air and pictured her being won by another man stronger than himself His imagination the keener for the dark background it worked against spared him no single detail that might send him raging up and down the studio to stumble over the stove that seemed to be in four places at once Worst of all tobacco would not taste in the darkness The arrogance of the man had disappeared and in its place were settled despair that Torpenhow knew and blind passion that Dick confided to his pillow at night The intervals between the paroxysms were filled with intolerable waiting and the weight of intolerable darkness Come out into the Park said Torpenhow You haven t stirred out since the beginning of things What s the use There s no movement in the dark and besides he paused irresolutely at the head of the stairs something will run over me Not if I m with you Proceed gingerly The roar of the streets filled Dick with nervous terror and he clung to Torpenhow s arm Fancy having to feel for a gutter with your foot he said petulantly as he turned into the Park Let s curse God and die Sentries are forbidden to pay unauthorised compliments By Jove there are the Guards Dick s figure straightened Let s get near em Let s go in and look Let s get on the grass and run I can smell the trees Mind the low railing That s all right Torpenhow kicked out a tuft of grass with his heel Smell that he said Isn t it good Dick sniffed luxuriously Now pick up your feet and run They approached as near to the regiment as was possible The clank of bayonets being unfixed made Dick s nostrils quiver Let s get nearer They re in column aren t they Yes How did you know Felt it Oh my men my beautiful men He edged forward as though he could see I could draw those chaps once Who ll draw em now They ll move off in a minute Don t jump when the band begins Huh I m not a new charger It s the silences that hurt Nearer Torp nearer Oh my God what wouldn t I give to see em for a minute one half minute He could hear the armed life almost within reach of him could hear the slings tighten across the bandsman s chest as he heaved the big drum from the ground Sticks crossed above his head whispered Torpenhow I know I know Who should know if I don t H sh The drum sticks fell with a boom and the men swung forward to the crash of the band Dick felt the wind of the massed movement in his face heard the maddening tramp of feet and the friction of the pouches on the belts The big drum pounded out the tune It was a music hall refrain that made a perfect quickstep He must be a man of decent height He must be a man of weight He must come home on a Saturday night In a thoroughly sober state He must know how to love me And he must know how to kiss And if he s enough to keep us both I can t refuse him bliss What s the matter said Torpenhow as he saw Dick s head fall when the last of the regiment had departed Nothing I feel a little bit out of the running that s all Torp take me back Why did you bring me out CHAPTER XII There were three friends that buried the fourth The mould in his mouth and the dust in his eyes And they went south and east and north The strong man fights but the sick man dies There were three friends that spoke of the dead The strong man fights but the sick man dies And would he were with us now they said The sun in our face and the wind in our eyes Ballad THE NILGHAI was angry with Torpenhow Dick had been sent to bed blind men are ever under the orders of those who can see and since he had returned from the Park had fluently sworn at Torpenhow because he was alive and all the world because it was alive and could see while he Dick was dead in the death of the blind who at the best are only burdens upon their associates Torpenhow had said something about a missus Gummidge and Dick had retired in a black fury to handle and re handle three unopened letters from Maisie The Nilghai fat burly and aggressive was in Torpenhow s rooms Behind him sat the Keneu the Great War Eagle and between them lay a large map embellished with black and white headed pins I was wrong about the Balkans said the Nilghai But I m not wrong about this business The whole of our work in the Southern Soudan must be done over again The public doesn t care of course but the government does and they are making their arrangements quietly You know that as well as I do I remember how the people cursed us when our troops withdrew from Omdurman It was bound to crop up sooner or later But I can t go said Torpenhow He pointed through the open door it was a hot night Can you blame me The Keneu purred above his pipe like a large and very happy cat Don t blame you in the least It s uncommonly good of you and all the rest of it but every man even you Torp must consider his work I know it sounds brutal but Dick s out of the race down gastados expended finished done for He has a little money of his own He won t starve and you can t pull out of your slide for his sake Think of your own reputation Dick s was five times bigger than mine and yours put together That was because he signed his name to everything he did It s all ended now You must hold yourself in readiness to move out You can command your own prices and you do better work than any three of us Don t tell me how tempting it is I ll stay here to look after Dick for a while He s as cheerful as a bear with a sore head but I think he likes to have me near him The Nilghai said something uncomplimentary about soft headed fools who throw away their careers for other fools Torpenhow flushed angrily The constant strain of attendance on Dick had worn his nerves thin There remains a third fate said the Keneu thoughtfully Consider this and be not larger fools than necessary Dick is or rather was an able bodied man of moderate attractions and a certain amount of audacity Oho said the Nilghai who remembered an affair at Cairo I begin to see Torp I m sorry Torpenhow nodded forgiveness You were more sorry when he cut you out though Go on Keneu I ve often thought when I ve seen men die out in the desert that if the news could be sent through the world and the means of transport were quick enough there would be one woman at least at each man s bedside There would be some mighty quaint revelations Let us be grateful things are as they are said the Nilghai Let us rather reverently consider whether Torp s three cornered ministrations are exactly what Dick needs just now What do you think yourself Torp I know they aren t But what can I do Lay the matter before the board We are all Dick s friends here You ve been most in his life But I picked it up when he was off his head The greater chance of its being true I thought we should arrive Who is she Then Torpenhow told a tale in plain words as a special correspondent who knows how to make a verbal precis should tell it The men listened without interruption Is it possible that a man can come back across the years to his calf love said the Keneu Is it possible I give the facts He says nothing about it now but he sits fumbling three letters from her when he thinks I m not looking What am I to do Speak to him said the Nilghai Oh yes Write to her I don t know her full name remember and ask her to accept him out of pity I believe you once told Dick you were sorry for him Nilghai You remember what happened eh Go into the bedroom and suggest full confession and an appeal to this Maisie girl whoever she is I honestly believe he d try to kill you and the blindness has made him rather muscular Torpenhow s course is perfectly clear said the Keneu He will go to Vitry sur Marne which is on the Bezieres Landes Railway single track from Tourgas The Prussians shelled it out in seventy because there was a poplar on the top of a hill eighteen hundred yards from the church spire There s a squadron of cavalry quartered there or ought to be Where this studio Torp spoke about may be I cannot tell That is Torp s business I have given him his route He will dispassionately explain the situation to the girl and she will come back to Dick the more especially because to use Dick s words there is nothing but her damned obstinacy to keep them apart And they have four hundred and twenty pounds a year between em Dick never lost his head for figures even in his delirium You haven t the shadow of an excuse for not going said the Nilghai Torpenhow looked very uncomfortable But it s absurd and impossible I can t drag her back by the hair Our business the business for which we draw our money is to do absurd and impossible things generally with no reason whatever except to amuse the public Here we have a reason The rest doesn t matter I shall share these rooms with the Nilghai till Torpenhow returns There will be a batch of unbridled specials coming to town in a little while and these will serve as their headquarters Another reason for sending Torpenhow away Thus Providence helps those who help others and here the Keneu dropped his measured speech we can t have you tied by the leg to Dick when the trouble begins It s your only chance of getting away and Dick will be grateful He will worse luck I can but go and try I can t conceive a woman in her senses refusing Dick Talk that out with the girl I have seen you wheedle an angry Mahdieh woman into giving you dates This won t be a tithe as difficult You had better not be here to morrow afternoon because the Nilghai and I will be in possession It is an order Obey Dick said Torpenhow next morning can I do anything for you No Leave me alone How often must I remind you that I m blind Nothing I could go for to fetch for to carry for to bring No Take those infernal creaking boots of yours away Poor chap said Torpenhow to himself I must have been sitting on his nerves lately He wants a lighter step Then aloud Very well Since you re so independent I m going off for four or five days Say good bye at least The housekeeper will look after you and Keneu has my rooms Dick s face fell You won t be longer than a week at the outside I know I m touched in the temper but I can t get on without you Can t you You ll have to do without me in a little time and you ll be glad I m gone Dick felt his way back to the big chair and wondered what these things might mean He did not wish to be tended by the housekeeper and yet Torpenhow s constant tenderness jarred on him He did not exactly know what he wanted The darkness would not lift and Maisie s unopened letters felt worn and old from much handling He could never read them for himself as long as life endured but Maisie might have sent him some fresh ones to play with The Nilghai entered with a gift a piece of red modelling wax He fancied that Dick might find interest in using his hands Dick poked and patted the stuff for a few minutes and Is it like anything in the world he said drearily Take it away I may get the touch of the blind in fifty years Do you know where Torpenhow has gone The Nilghai knew nothing We re staying in his rooms till he comes back Can we do anything for you I d like to be left alone please Don t think I m ungrateful but I m best alone The Nilghai chuckled and Dick resumed his drowsy brooding and sullen rebellion against fate He had long since ceased to think about the work he had done in the old days and the desire to do more work had departed from him He was exceedingly sorry for himself and the completeness of his tender grief soothed him But his soul and his body cried for Maisie Maisie who would understand His mind pointed out that Maisie having her own work to do would not care His experience had taught him that when money was exhausted women went away and that when a man was knocked out of the race the others trampled on him Then at the least said Dick in reply she could use me as I used Binat for some sort of a study I wouldn t ask more than to be near her again even though I knew that another man was making love to her Ugh what a dog I am A voice on the staircase began to sing joyfully When we go go go away from here Our creditors will weep and they will wail Our absence much regretting when they find that they ve been getting Out of England by next Tuesday s Indian mail Following the trampling of feet slamming of Torpenhow s door and the sound of voices in strenuous debate some one squeaked And see you good fellows I have found a new water bottle firs class patent eh how you say Open himself inside out Dick sprang to his feet He knew the voice well That s Cassavetti come back from the Continent Now I know why Torp went away There s a row somewhere and I m out of it The Nilghai commanded silence in vain That s for my sake Dick said bitterly The birds are getting ready to fly and they wouldn t tell me I can hear Morten Sutherland and Mackaye Half the War Correspondents in London are there and I m out of it He stumbled across the landing and plunged into Torpenhow s room He could feel that it was full of men Where s the trouble said he In the Balkans at last Why didn t some one tell me We thought you wouldn t be interested said the Nilghai shamefacedly It s in the Soudan as usual You lucky dogs Let me sit here while you talk I shan t be a skeleton at the feast Cassavetti where are you Your English is as bad as ever Dick was led into a chair He heard the rustle of the maps and the talk swept forward carrying him with it Everybody spoke at once discussing press censorships railway routes transport water supply the capacities of generals these in language that would have horrified a trusting public ranging asserting denouncing and laughing at the top of their voices There was the glorious certainty of war in the Soudan at any moment The Nilghai said so and it was well to be in readiness The Keneu had telegraphed to Cairo for horses Cassavetti had stolen a perfectly inaccurate list of troops that would be ordered forward and was reading it out amid profane interruptions and the Keneu introduced to Dick some man unknown who would be employed as war artist by the Central Southern Syndicate It s his first outing said the Keneu Give him some tips about riding camels Oh those camels groaned Cassavetti I shall learn to ride him again and now I am so much all soft Listen you good fellows I know your military arrangement very well There will go the Royal Argalshire Sutherlanders So it was read to me upon best authority A roar of laughter interrupted him Sit down said the Nilghai The lists aren t even made out in the War Office Will there be any force at Suakin said a voice Then the outcries redoubled and grew mixed thus How many Egyptian troops will they use God help the Fellaheen There s a railway in Plumstead marshes doing duty as a fives court We shall have the Suakin Berber line built at last Canadian voyageurs are too careful Give me a half drunk Krooman in a whale boat Who commands the Desert column No they never blew up the big rock in the Ghineh bend We shall have to be hauled up as usual Somebody tell me if there s an Indian contingent or I ll break everybody s head Don t tear the map in two It s a war of occupation I tell you to connect with the African companies in the South There s Guinea worm in most of the wells on that route Then the Nilghai despairing of peace bellowed like a fog horn and beat upon the table with both hands But what becomes of Torpenhow said Dick in the silence that followed Torp s in abeyance just now He s off love making somewhere I suppose said the Nilghai He said he was going to stay at home said the Keneu Is he said Dick with an oath He won t I m not much good now but if you and the Nilghai hold him down I ll engage to trample on him till he sees reason He ll stay behind indeed He s the best of you all There ll be some tough work by Omdurman We shall come there to stay this time But I forgot I wish I were going with you So do we all Dickie said the Keneu And I most of all said the new artist of the Central Southern Syndicate Could you tell me I ll give you one piece of advice Dick answered moving towards the door If you happen to be cut over the head in a scrimmage don t guard Tell the man to go on cutting You ll find it cheapest in the end Thanks for letting me look in There s grit in Dick said the Nilghai an hour later when the room was emptied of all save the Keneu It was the sacred call of the war trumpet Did you notice how he answered to it Poor fellow Let s look at him said the Keneu The excitement of the talk had died away Dick was sitting by the studio table with his head on his arms when the men came in He did not change his position It hurts he moaned God forgive me but it hurts cruelly and yet y know the world has a knack of spinning round all by itself Shall I see Torp before he goes Oh yes You ll see him said the Nilghai CHAPTER XIII The sun went down an hour ago I wonder if I face towards home If I lost my way in the light of day How shall I find it now night is come Old Song MAISIE come to bed It s so hot I can t sleep Don t worry Maisie put her elbows on the window sill and looked at the moonlight on the straight poplar flanked road Summer had come upon Vitry sur Marne and parched it to the bone The grass was dry burnt in the meadows the clay by the bank of the river was caked to brick the roadside flowers were long since dead and the roses in the garden hung withered on their stalks The heat in the little low bedroom under the eaves was almost intolerable The very moonlight on the wall of Kami s studio across the road seemed to make the night hotter and the shadow of the big bell handle by the closed gate cast a bar of inky black that caught Maisie s eye and annoyed her Horrid thing It should be all white she murmured And the gate isn t in the middle of the wall either I never noticed that before Maisie was hard to please at that hour First the heat of the past few weeks had worn her down secondly her work and particularly the study of a female head intended to represent the Melancolia and not finished in time for the Salon was unsatisfactory thirdly Kami had said as much two days before fourthly but so completely fourthly that it was hardly worth thinking about Dick her property had not written to her for more than six weeks She was angry with the heat with Kami and with her work but she was exceedingly angry with Dick She had written to him three times each time proposing a fresh treatment of her Melancolia Dick had taken no notice of these communications She had resolved to write no more When she returned to England in the autumn for her pride s sake she could not return earlier she would speak to him She missed the Sunday afternoon conferences more than she cared to admit All that Kami said was Continuez mademoiselle continuez toujours and he had been repeating the wearisome counsel through the hot summer exactly like a cicada an old gray cicada in a black alpaca coat white trousers and a huge felt hat But Dick had tramped masterfully up and down her little studio north of the cool green London park and had said things ten times worse than continuez before he snatched the brush out of her hand and showed her where the error lay His last letter Maisie remembered contained some trivial advice about not sketching in the sun or drinking water at wayside farmhouses and he had said that not once but three times as if he did not know that Maisie could take care of herself But what was he doing that he could not trouble to write A murmur of voices in the road made her lean from the window A cavalryman of the little garrison in the town was talking to Kami s cook The moonlight glittered on the scabbard of his sabre which he was holding in his hand lest it should clank inopportunely The cook s cap cast deep shadows on her face which was close to the conscript s He slid his arm round her waist and there followed the sound of a kiss Faugh said Maisie stepping back What s that said the red haired girl who was tossing uneasily outside her bed Only a conscript kissing the cook said Maisie They ve gone away now She leaned out of the window again and put a shawl over her nightgown to guard against chills There was a very small night breeze abroad and a sun baked rose below nodded its head as one who knew unutterable secrets Was it possible that Dick should turn his thoughts from her work and his own and descend to the degradation of Suzanne and the conscript He could not The rose nodded its head and one leaf therewith It looked like a naughty little devil scratching its ear Dick could not because thought Maisie he is mine mine mine He said he was I m sure I don t care what he does It will only spoil his work if he does and it will spoil mine too The rose continued to nod in the futile way peculiar to flowers There was no earthly reason why Dick should not disport himself as he chose except that he was called by Providence which was Maisie to assist Maisie in her work And her work was the preparation of pictures that went sometimes to English provincial exhibitions as the notices in the scrap book proved and that were invariably rejected by the Salon when Kami was plagued into allowing her to send them up Her work in the future it seemed would be the preparation of pictures on exactly similar lines which would be rejected in exactly the same way The red haired girl threshed distressfully across the sheets It s too hot to sleep she moaned and the interruption jarred Exactly the same way Then she would divide her years between the little studio in England and Kami s big studio at Vitry sur Marne No she would go to another master who should force her into the success that was her right if patient toil and desperate endeavour gave one a right to anything Dick had told her that he had worked ten years to understand his craft She had worked ten years and ten years were nothing Dick had said that ten years were nothing but that was in regard to herself only He had said this very man who could not find time to write that he would wait ten years for her and that she was bound to come back to him sooner or later He had said this in the absurd letter about sunstroke and diphtheria and then he had stopped writing He was wandering up and down moonlit streets kissing cooks She would like to lecture him now not in her nightgown of course but properly dressed severely and from a height Yet if he was kissing other girls he certainly would not care whether she lectured him or not He would laugh at her Very good She would go back to her studio and prepare pictures that went et cetera et cetera The mill wheel of thought swung round slowly that no section of it might be slurred over and the red haired girl tossed and turned behind her Maisie put her chin in her hands and decided that there could be no doubt whatever of the villainy of Dick To justify herself she began unwomanly to weigh the evidence There was a boy and he had said he loved her And he kissed her kissed her on the cheek by a yellow sea poppy that nodded its head exactly like the maddening dry rose in the garden Then there was an interval and men had told her that they loved her just when she was busiest with her work Then the boy came back and at their very second meeting had told her that he loved her Then he had But there was no end to the things he had done He had given her his time and his powers He had spoken to her of Art housekeeping technique teacups the abuse of pickles as a stimulant that was rude sable hair brushes he had given her the best in her stock she used them daily he had given her advice that she profited by and now and again a look Such a look The look of a beaten hound waiting for the word to crawl to his mistress s feet In return she had given him nothing whatever except here she brushed her mouth against the open work sleeve f her nightgown the privilege of kissing her once And on the mouth too Disgraceful Was that not enough and more than enough and if it was not had he not cancelled the debt by not writing and probably kissing other girls Maisie you ll catch a chill Do go and lie down said the wearied voice of her companion I can t sleep a wink with you at the window Maisie shrugged her shoulders and did not answer She was reflecting on the meannesses of Dick and on other meannesses with which he had nothing to do The moonlight would not let her sleep It lay on the skylight of the studio across the road in cold silver she stared at it intently and her thoughts began to slide one into the other The shadow of the big bell handle in the wall grew short lengthened again and faded out as the moon went down behind the pasture and a hare came limping home across the road Then the dawn wind washed through the upland grasses and brought coolness with it and the cattle lowed by the drought shrunk river Maisie s head fell forward on the window sill and the tangle of black hair covered her arms Maisie wake up You ll catch a chill Yes dear yes dear She staggered to her bed like a wearied child and as she buried her face in the pillows she muttered I think I think But he ought to have written Day brought the routine of the studio the smell of paint and turpentine and the monotone wisdom of Kami who was a leaden artist but a golden teacher if the pupil were only in sympathy with him Maisie was not in sympathy that day and she waited impatiently for the end of the work She knew when it was coming for Kami would gather his black alpaca coat into a bunch behind him and with faded blue eyes that saw neither pupils nor canvas look back into the past to recall the history of one Binat You have all done not so badly he would say But you shall remember that it is not enough to have the method and the art and the power nor even that which is touch but you shall have also the conviction that nails the work to the wall Of the so many I taught here the students would begin to unfix drawing pins or get their tubes together the very so many that I have taught the best was Binat All that comes of the study and the work and the knowledge was to him even when he came After he left me he should have done all that could be done with the colour the form and the knowledge Only he had not the conviction So to day I hear no more of Binat the best of my pupils and that is long ago So to day too you will be glad to hear no more of me Continuez mesdemoiselles and above all with conviction He went into the garden to smoke and mourn over the lost Binat as the pupils dispersed to their several cottages or loitered in the studio to make plans for the cool of the afternoon Maisie looked at her very unhappy Melancolia restrained a desire to grimace before it and was hurrying across the road to write a letter to Dick when she was aware of a large man on a white troop horse How Torpenhow had managed in the course of twenty hours to find his way to the hearts of the cavalry officers in quarters at Vitry sur Marne to discuss with them the certainty of a glorious revenge for France to reduce the colonel to tears of pure affability and to borrow the best horse in the squadron for the journey to Kami s studio is a mystery that only special correspondents can unravel I beg your pardon said he It seems an absurd question to ask but the fact is that I don t know her by any other name Is there any young lady here that is called Maisie I am Maisie was the answer from the depths of a great sun hat I ought to introduce myself he said as the horse capered in the blinding white dust My name is Torpenhow Dick Heldar is my best friend and and the fact is that he has gone blind Blind said Maisie stupidly He can t be blind He has been stone blind for nearly two months Maisie lifted up her face and it was pearly white No No Not blind I won t have him blind Would you care to see for yourself said Torpenhow Now at once Oh no The Paris train doesn t go through this place till to night There will be ample time Did mister Heldar send you to me Certainly not Dick wouldn t do that sort of thing He s sitting in his studio turning over some letters that he can t read because he s blind There was a sound of choking from the sun hat Maisie bowed her head and went into the cottage where the red haired girl was on a sofa complaining of a headache Dick s blind said Maisie taking her breath quickly as she steadied herself against a chair back My Dick s blind What The girl was on the sofa no longer A man has come from England to tell me He hasn t written to me for six weeks Are you going to him I must think Think I should go back to London and see him and I should kiss his eyes and kiss them and kiss them until they got well again If you don t go I shall Oh what am I talking about You wicked little idiot Go to him at once Go Torpenhow s neck was blistering but he preserved a smile of infinite patience as Maisie appeared bareheaded in the sunshine I am coming said she her eyes on the ground You will be at Vitry Station then at seven this evening This was an order delivered by one who was used to being obeyed Maisie said nothing but she felt grateful that there was no chance of disputing with this big man who took everything for granted and managed a squealing horse with one hand She returned to the red haired girl who was weeping bitterly and between tears kisses very few of those menthol packing and an interview with Kami the sultry afternoon wore away Thought might come afterwards Her present duty was to go to Dick Dick who owned the wondrous friend and sat in the dark playing with her unopened letters But what will you do she said to her companion I Oh I shall stay here and finish your Melancolia she said smiling pitifully Write to me afterwards That night there ran a legend through Vitry sur Marne of a mad Englishman doubtless suffering from sunstroke who had drunk all the officers of the garrison under the table had borrowed a horse from the lines and had then and there eloped after the English custom with one of those more mad English girls who drew pictures down there under the care of that good Monsieur Kami They are very droll said Suzanne to the conscript in the moonlight by the studio wall She walked always with those big eyes that saw nothing and yet she kisses me on both cheeks as though she were my sister and gives me see ten francs The conscript levied a contribution on both gifts for he prided himself on being a good soldier Torpenhow spoke very little to Maisie during the journey to Calais but he was careful to attend to all her wants to get her a compartment entirely to herself and to leave her alone He was amazed of the ease with which the matter had been accomplished The safest thing would be to let her think things out By Dick s showing when he was off his head she must have ordered him about very thoroughly Wonder how she likes being under orders Maisie never told She sat in the empty compartment often with her eyes shut that she might realise the sensation of blindness It was an order that she should return to London swiftly and she found herself at last almost beginning to enjoy the situation This was better than looking after luggage and a red haired friend who never took any interest in her surroundings But there appeared to be a feeling in the air that she Maisie of all people was in disgrace Therefore she justified her conduct to herself with great success till Torpenhow came up to her on the steamer and without preface began to tell the story of Dick s blindness suppressing a few details but dwelling at length on the miseries of delirium He stopped before he reached the end as though he had lost interest in the subject and went forward to smoke Maisie was furious with him and with herself She was hurried on from Dover to London almost before she could ask for breakfast and she was past any feeling of indignation now was bidden curtly to wait in a hall at the foot of some lead covered stairs while Torpenhow went up to make inquiries Again the knowledge that she was being treated like a naughty little girl made her pale cheeks flame It was all Dick s fault for being so stupid as to go blind Torpenhow led her up to a shut door which he opened very softly Dick was sitting by the window with his chin on his chest There were three envelopes in his hand and he turned them over and over The big man who gave orders was no longer by her side and the studio door snapped behind her Dick thrust the letters into his pocket as he heard the sound Hullo Torp Is that you I ve been so lonely His voice had taken the peculiar flatness of the blind Maisie pressed herself up into a corner of the room Her heart was beating furiously and she put one hand on her breast to keep it quiet Dick was staring directly at her and she realised for the first time that he was blind Shutting her eyes in a rail way carriage to open them when she pleased was child s play This man was blind though his eyes were wide open Torp is that you They said you were coming Dick looked puzzled and a little irritated at the silence No it s only me was the answer in a strained little whisper Maisie could hardly move her lips H m said Dick composedly without moving This is a new phenomenon Darkness I m getting used to but I object to hearing voices Was he mad then as well as blind that he talked to himself Maisie s heart beat more wildly and she breathed in gasps Dick rose and began to feel his way across the room touching each table and chair as he passed Once he caught his foot on a rug and swore dropping on his knees to feel what the obstruction might be Maisie remembered him walking in the Park as though all the earth belonged to him tramping up and down her studio two months ago and flying up the gangway of the Channel steamer The beating of her heart was making her sick and Dick was coming nearer guided by the sound of her breathing She put out a hand mechanically to ward him off or to draw him to herself she did not know which It touched his chest and he stepped back as though he had been shot It s Maisie said he with a dry sob What are you doing here I came I came to see you please Dick s lips closed firmly Won t you sit down then You see I ve had some bother with my eyes and I know I know Why didn t you tell me I couldn t write You might have told mister Torpenhow What has he to do with my affairs He he brought me from Vitry sur Marne He thought I ought to see you Why what has happened Can I do anything for you No I can t I forgot Oh Dick I m so sorry I ve come to tell you and Let me take you back to your chair Don t I m not a child You only do that out of pity I never meant to tell you anything about it I m no good now I m down and done for Let me alone He groped back to his chair his chest labouring as he sat down Maisie watched him and the fear went out of her heart to be followed by a very bitter shame He had spoken a truth that had been hidden from the girl 
4411-14501-0000	train-other-500	through every step of the impetuous flight to London for he was indeed down and done for masterful no longer but rather a little abject neither an artist stronger than she nor a man to be looked up to
none	none	 only some blind one that sat in a chair and seemed on the point of crying 
4411-14501-0001	train-other-500	She was immensely and unfeignedly sorry for him more sorry than she had ever been for any one in her life but not sorry enough to deny his words So
none	none	 she stood still and felt ashamed and a little hurt 
4411-14501-0002	train-other-500	because she had honestly intended that her journey should end triumphantly and now she was only filled with pity most startlingly distinct from love Well said Dick
none	none	 his face steadily turned away 
4411-14501-0003	train-other-500	I never meant to worry you any more What s the matter He was conscious that Maisie was catching her breath but was as unprepared as herself for the torrent of emotion that followed
4411-14501-0004	train-other-500	She had dropped into a chair and was sobbing with her face hidden in her hands I can t I can t she cried desperately Indeed I can t It isn t my fault
4411-14501-0005	train-other-500	I m so sorry Oh Dickie I m so sorry
none	none	 Dick s shoulders straightened again 
4411-14501-0006	train-other-500	for the words lashed like a whip
none	none	 Still the sobbing continued 
4411-14501-0007	train-other-500	It is not good to realise that you have failed in the hour of trial or flinched before the mere possibility of making sacrifices I do despise myself indeed I do
4411-14501-0008	train-other-500	But I can t Oh Dickie you wouldn t ask me would you wailed Maisie She looked up for a minute and by chance it happened that Dick s eyes fell on hers
4411-14501-0009	train-other-500	The unshaven face was very white and set and the lips were trying to force themselves into a smile But it was the worn out eyes that Maisie feared Her Dick had gone blind
none	none	 and left in his place some one that she could hardly recognise till he spoke Who is asking you to do anything Maisie 
4411-14501-0010	train-other-500	I told you how it would be What s the use of worrying For pity s sake don t cry like that it isn t worth it You don t know how I hate myself Oh Dick help me
none	none	 help me The passion of tears had grown beyond her control and was beginning to alarm the man 
4411-14501-0011	train-other-500	He stumbled forward and put his arm round her and her head fell on his shoulder Hush dear hush Don t cry You re quite right and you ve nothing to reproach yourself with you never had
4411-14501-0012	train-other-500	You re only a little upset by the journey and I don t suppose you ve had any breakfast
none	none	 What a brute Torp was to bring you over 
4411-14501-0013	train-other-500	I wanted to come I did indeed she protested Very well And now you ve come and seen and I m immensely grateful
4411-14501-0014	train-other-500	When you re better you shall go away and get something to eat What sort of a passage did you have coming over Maisie was crying more subduedly for the first time in her life glad that she had something to lean against
4411-14501-0015	train-other-500	Dick patted her on the shoulder tenderly but clumsily for he was not quite sure where her shoulder might be She drew herself out of his arms at last and waited trembling and most unhappy
4411-14501-0016	train-other-500	He had felt his way to the window to put the width of the room between them and to quiet a little the tumult in his heart Are you better now he said Yes but
none	none	 don t you hate me I hate you 
4411-14501-0017	train-other-500	My God I Isn t isn t there anything I could do for you then I ll stay here in England to do it if you like Perhaps I could come and see you sometimes I think not dear
4411-14501-0018	train-other-500	It would be kindest not to see me any more please
none	none	 I don t want to seem rude but 
4411-14501-0019	train-other-500	don t you think perhaps you had almost better go now He was conscious that he could not bear himself as a man if the strain continued much longer I don t deserve anything else I ll go Dick
none	none	 Oh I m so miserable 
4411-14501-0020	train-other-500	Nonsense You ve nothing to worry about I d tell you if you had Wait a moment dear I ve got something to give you first I meant it for you ever since this little trouble began It s my Melancolia
4411-14501-0021	train-other-500	she was a beauty when I last saw her You can keep her for me and if ever you re poor you can sell her She s worth a few hundreds at any state of the market He groped among his canvases
4411-14501-0022	train-other-500	She s framed in black Is this a black frame that I have my hand on There she is What do you think of her He turned a scarred formless muddle of paint towards Maisie
4411-14501-0023	train-other-500	and the eyes strained as though they would catch her wonder and surprise One thing and one thing only could she do for him Well The voice was fuller
none	none	 and more rounded because the man knew he was speaking of his best work 
4411-14501-0024	train-other-500	Maisie looked at the blur and a lunatic desire to laugh caught her by the throat But for Dick s sake whatever this mad blankness might mean she must make no sign
none	none	 Her voice choked with hard held tears as she answered still gazing at the wreck Oh Dick it is good He heard the little hysterical gulp and took it for tribute 
4411-14501-0025	train-other-500	Won t you have it then I ll send it over to your house if you will I
none	none	 Oh yes thank you Ha ha If she did not fly at once the laughter that was worse than tears would kill her 
4411-14501-0026	train-other-500	She turned and ran choking and blinded
none	none	 down the staircases that were empty of life to take refuge in a cab 
4411-14501-0027	train-other-500	and go to her house across the Parks There she sat down in the dismantled drawing room and thought of Dick in his blindness useless till the end of life and of herself in her own eyes
4411-14501-0028	train-other-500	Behind the sorrow the shame and the humiliation lay fear of the cold wrath of the red haired girl when Maisie should return Maisie had never feared her companion before Not until she found herself saying
none	none	 Well he never asked me 
4411-14501-0029	train-other-500	did she realise her scorn of herself
none	none	 And that is the end of Maisie 
4411-14501-0030	train-other-500	For Dick was reserved more searching torment He could not realise at first that Maisie whom he had ordered to go had left him without a word of farewell He was savagely angry against Torpenhow
4411-14501-0031	train-other-500	who had brought upon him this humiliation and troubled his miserable peace Then his dark hour came and he was alone with himself and his desires to get what help he could from the darkness The queen could do no wrong
4411-14501-0032	train-other-500	but in following the right so far as it served her work she had wounded her one subject more than his own brain would let him know
none	none	 It s all I had 
4411-14501-0033	train-other-500	and I ve lost it he said as soon as the misery permitted clear thinking And Torp will think that he has been so infernally clever that I shan t have the heart to tell him
4411-14501-0034	train-other-500	I must think this out quietly Hullo said Torpenhow entering the studio after Dick had enjoyed two hours of thought I m back Are you feeling any better
none	none	 Torp I don t know what to say 
4411-14501-0036	train-other-500	Come here Dick coughed huskily wondering indeed what he should say and how to say it temperately What s the need for saying anything Get up and tramp
4411-14501-0037	train-other-500	Torpenhow was perfectly satisfied They walked up and down as of custom Torpenhow s hand on Dick s shoulder and Dick buried in his own thoughts
none	none	 How in the world did you find it all out 
4411-14501-0038	train-other-500	said Dick at last You shouldn t go off your head if you want to keep secrets Dickie It was absolutely impertinent on my part but if you d seen me rocketing about
none	none	 on a half trained French troop horse under a blazing sun you d have laughed 
4411-14501-0039	train-other-500	There will be a charivari in my rooms to night Seven other devils
none	none	 I know 
4411-14501-0040	train-other-500	the row in the Southern Soudan I surprised their councils the other day and it made me unhappy Have you fixed your flint to go
none	none	 Who d you work for 
4411-14501-0041	train-other-500	Haven t signed any contracts yet I wanted to see how your business would turn out
none	none	 Would you have stayed with me then if 
4411-14501-0042	train-other-500	things had gone wrong He put his question cautiously Don t ask me too much I m only a man You ve tried to be an angel very successfully Oh ye es Well
4411-14501-0043	train-other-500	do you attend the function to night We shall be half screwed before the morning
none	none	 All the men believe the war s a certainty I don t think I will old man if it s all the same to you I ll stay quiet here 
4411-14501-0044	train-other-500	And meditate I don t blame you You observe a good time if ever a man did That night there was a tumult on the stairs
none	none	 The correspondents poured in from theatre dinner and music hall 
4411-14501-0045	train-other-500	to Torpenhow s room that they might discuss their plan of campaign in the event of military operations becoming a certainty
none	none	 Torpenhow the Keneu and the Nilghai 
4411-14501-0046	train-other-500	had bidden all the men they had worked with to the orgy and mister Beeton the housekeeper declared that never before in his checkered experience had he seen quite such a fancy lot of gentlemen
4411-14501-0047	train-other-500	They waked the chambers with shoutings and song and the elder men were quite as bad as the younger For the chances of war were in front of them and all knew what those meant
none	none	 Sitting in his own room a little perplexed by the noise across the landing 
4411-14501-0048	train-other-500	Dick suddenly began to laugh to himself When one comes to think of it the situation is intensely comic Maisie s quite right poor little thing I didn t know she could cry like that before
4411-14501-0049	train-other-500	but now I know what Torp thinks I m sure he d be quite fool enough to stay at home and try to console me if he knew Besides
none	none	 it isn t nice to own that you ve been thrown over like a broken chair 
4411-14501-0050	train-other-500	I must carry this business through alone as usual If there isn t a war and Torp finds out
none	none	 I shall look foolish that s all 
4411-14501-0051	train-other-500	If there is a way I mustn t interfere with another man s chances Business is business and I want to be alone I want to be alone What a row they re making
4411-14501-0052	train-other-500	Somebody hammered at the studio door Come out and frolic Dickie said the Nilghai I should like to but I can t I m not feeling frolicsome
4411-14501-0053	train-other-500	Then I ll tell the boys and they ll drag you like a badger Please not old man On my word I d sooner be left alone just now Very good
none	none	 Can we send anything in to you Fizz for instance 
4411-14501-0054	train-other-500	Cassavetti is beginning to sing songs of the Sunny South already For one minute Dick considered the proposition seriously No thanks
none	none	 I ve a headache already 
4411-14501-0055	train-other-500	Virtuous child That s the effect of emotion on the young All my congratulations Dick
none	none	 I also was concerned in the conspiracy for your welfare 
4411-14501-0056	train-other-500	Go to the devil oh send Binkie in here The little dog entered on elastic feet riotous from having been made much of all the evening
none	none	 He had helped to sing the choruses but scarcely inside the studio he realised 
4411-14501-0057	train-other-500	that this was no place for tail wagging and settled himself on Dick s lap till it was bedtime Then he went to bed with Dick
none	none	 who counted every hour as it struck 
4411-14501-0058	train-other-500	and rose in the morning with a painfully clear head to receive Torpenhow s more formal congratulations and a particular account of the last night s revels You aren t looking very happy for a newly accepted man said Torpenhow
4411-14501-0059	train-other-500	Never mind that it s my own affair and I m all right Do you really go Yes
none	none	 With the old Central Southern as usual 
4411-14501-0060	train-other-500	They wired and I accepted on better terms than before When do you start The day after to morrow for Brindisi Thank God Dick spoke from the bottom of his heart
none	none	 Well that s not a pretty way of saying you re glad to get rid of me 
4411-14501-0061	train-other-500	But men in your condition are allowed to be selfish
none	none	 I didn t mean that Will you get a hundred pounds cashed for me before you leave 
4411-14501-0062	train-other-500	That s a slender amount for housekeeping isn t it
none	none	 Oh it s only for 
4411-14501-0063	train-other-500	marriage expenses Torpenhow brought him the money counted it out in fives and tens and carefully put it away in the writing table Now I suppose I shall have to listen to his ravings about his girl until I go
4411-14501-0064	train-other-500	Heaven send us patience with a man in love he said to himself
none	none	 But never a word did Dick say of Maisie or marriage 
4411-14501-0065	train-other-500	He hung in the doorway of Torpenhow s room when the latter was packing and asked innumerable questions about the coming campaign till Torpenhow began to feel annoyed You re a secretive animal Dickie and you consume your own smoke don t you
4411-14501-0066	train-other-500	he said on the last evening I I suppose so
none	none	 By the way how long do you think this war will last 
4411-14501-0067	train-other-500	Days weeks or months One can never tell It may go on for years
4411-14501-0068	train-other-500	I wish I were going Good Heavens You re the most unaccountable creature Hasn t it occurred to you that you re going to be married thanks to me Of course yes I m going to be married
4411-14501-0069	train-other-500	so I am Going to be married I m awfully grateful to you Haven t I told you that You might be going to be hanged by the look of you said Torpenhow
none	none	 And the next day Torpenhow bade him good bye and left him to the loneliness he had so much desired CHAPTER XIV Yet at the last ere our spearmen had found him Yet at the last ere a sword thrust could save Yet at the last with his masters around him He of the Faith spoke as master to slave Yet at the last tho the Kafirs had maimed him Broken by bondage and wrecked by the reiver Yet at the last tho the darkness had claimed him He called upon Allah and died a believer Kizzilbashi BEG your pardon mister Heldar but but isn t nothin going to happen said mister Beeton No Dick had just waked to another morning of blank despair and his temper was of the shortest Tain t my regular business o course sir and what I say is Mind your own business and let other people mind theirs but just before mister Torpenhow went away he give me to understand like that you might be moving into a house of your own so to speak a sort of house with rooms upstairs and downstairs where you d be better attended to though I try to act just by all our tenants Don t I Ah That must have been a mad house I shan t trouble you to take me there yet Get me my breakfast please and leave me alone I hope I haven t done anything wrong sir but you know I hope that as far as a man can I tries to do the proper thing by all the gentlemen in chambers and more particular those whose lot is hard such as you for instance mister Heldar You likes soft roe bloater don t you Soft roe bloaters is scarcer than hard roe but what I says is Never mind a little extra trouble so long as you give satisfaction to the tenants mister Beeton withdrew and left Dick to himself Torpenhow had been long away there was no more rioting in the chambers and Dick had settled down to his new life which he was weak enough to consider nothing better than death It is hard to live alone in the dark confusing the day and night dropping to sleep through sheer weariness at mid day and rising restless in the chill of the dawn At first Dick on his awakenings would grope along the corridors of the chambers till he heard some one snore Then he would know that the day had not yet come and return wearily to his bedroom Later he learned not to stir till there was a noise and movement in the house and mister Beeton advised him to get up Once dressed and dressing now that Torpenhow was away was a lengthy business because collars ties and the like hid themselves in far corners of the room and search meant head beating against chairs and trunks once dressed there was nothing whatever to do except to sit still and brood till the three daily meals came Centuries separated breakfast from lunch and lunch from dinner and though a man prayed for hundreds of years that his mind might be taken from him God would never hear Rather the mind was quickened and the revolving thoughts ground against each other as millstones grind when there is no corn between and yet the brain would not wear out and give him rest It continued to think at length with imagery and all manner of reminiscences It recalled Maisie and past success reckless travels by land and sea the glory of doing work and feeling that it was good and suggested all that might have happened had the eyes only been faithful to their duty When thinking ceased through sheer weariness there poured into Dick s soul tide on tide of overwhelming purposeless fear dread of starvation always terror lest the unseen ceiling should crush down upon him fear of fire in the chambers and a louse s death in red flame and agonies of fiercer horror that had nothing to do with any fear of death Then Dick bowed his head and clutching the arms of his chair fought with his sweating self till the tinkle of plates told him that something to eat was being set before him mister Beeton would bring the meal when he had time to spare and Dick learned to hang upon his speech which dealt with badly fitted gas plugs waste pipes out of repair little tricks for driving picture nails into walls and the sins of the charwoman or the housemaids In the lack of better things the small gossip of a servant s hall becomes immensely interesting and the screwing of a washer on a tap an event to be talked over for days Once or twice a week too mister Beeton would take Dick out with him when he went marketing in the morning to haggle with tradesmen over fish lamp wicks mustard tapioca and so forth while Dick rested his weight first on one foot and then on the other and played aimlessly with the tins and string ball on the counter Then they would perhaps meet one of mister Beeton s friends and Dick standing aside a little would hold his peace till mister Beeton was willing to go on again The life did not increase his self respect He abandoned shaving as a dangerous exercise and being shaved in a barber s shop meant exposure of his infirmity He could not see that his clothes were properly brushed and since he had never taken any care of his personal appearance he became every known variety of sloven A blind man cannot deal with cleanliness till he has been some months used to the darkness If he demand attendance and grow angry at the want of it he must assert himself and stand upright Then the meanest menial can see that he is blind and therefore of no consequence A wise man will keep his eyes on the floor and sit still For amusement he may pick coal lump by lump out of the scuttle with the tongs and pile it in a little heap in the fender keeping count of the lumps which must all be put back again one by one and very carefully He may set himself sums if he cares to work them out he may talk to himself or to the cat if she chooses to visit him and if his trade has been that of an artist he may sketch in the air with his forefinger but that is too much like drawing a pig with the eyes shut He may go to his bookshelves and count his books ranging them in order of their size or to his wardrobe and count his shirts laying them in piles of two or three on the bed as they suffer from frayed cuffs or lost buttons Even this entertainment wearies after a time and all the times are very very long Dick was allowed to sort a tool chest where mister Beeton kept hammers taps and nuts lengths of gas pipes oil bottles and string If I don t have everything just where I know where to look for it why then I can t find anything when I do want it You ve no idea sir the amount of little things that these chambers uses up said mister Beeton Fumbling at the handle of the door as he went out It s hard on you sir I do think it s hard on you Ain t you going to do anything sir I ll pay my rent and messing Isn t that enough I wasn t doubting for a moment that you couldn t pay your way sir but I ave often said to my wife It s ard on im because it isn t as if he was an old man nor yet a middle aged one but quite a young gentleman That s where it comes so ard I suppose so said Dick absently This particular nerve through long battering had ceased to feel much I was thinking continued mister Beeton still making as if to go that you might like to hear my boy Alf read you the papers sometimes of an evening He do read beautiful seeing he s only nine I should be very grateful said Dick Only let me make it worth his while We wasn t thinking of that sir but of course it s in your own ands but only to ear Alf sing A Boy s best Friend is is Mother Ah I ll hear him sing that too Let him come this evening with the newspapers Alf was not a nice child being puffed up with many school board certificates for good conduct and inordinately proud of his singing mister Beeton remained beaming while the child wailed his way through a song of some eight eight line verses in the usual whine of a young Cockney and after compliments left him to read Dick the foreign telegrams Ten minutes later Alf returned to his parents rather pale and scared E said e couldn t stand it no more he explained He never said you read badly Alf missus Beeton spoke No E said I read beautiful Said e never eard any one read like that but e said e couldn t abide the stuff in the papers P raps he s lost some money in the Stocks Were you readin him about Stocks Alf No it was all about fightin out there where the soldiers is gone a great long piece with all the lines close together and very hard words in it E give me arf a crown because I read so well And e says the next time there s anything e wants read e ll send for me That s good hearing but I do think for all the half crown put it into the kicking donkey money box Alf and let me see you do it he might have kept you longer Why he couldn t have begun to understand how beautiful you read He s best left to hisself gentlemen always are when they re downhearted said mister Beeton Alf s rigorously limited powers of comprehending Torpenhow s special correspondence had waked the devil of unrest in Dick He could hear through the boy s nasal chant the camels grunting in the squares behind the soldiers outside Suakin could hear the men swearing and chaffing across the cooking pots and could smell the acrid wood smoke as it drifted over camp before the wind of the desert That night he prayed to God that his mind might be taken from him offering for proof that he was worthy of this favour the fact that he had not shot himself long ago That prayer was not answered and indeed Dick knew in his heart of hearts that only a lingering sense of humour and no special virtue had kept him alive Suicide he had persuaded himself would be a ludicrous insult to the gravity of the situation as well as a weak kneed confession of fear Just for the fun of the thing he said to the cat who had taken Binkie s place in his establishment I should like to know how long this is going to last I can live for a year on the hundred pounds Torp cashed for me I must have two or three thousand at least in the Bank twenty or thirty years more provided for that is to say Then I fall back on my hundred and twenty a year which will be more by that time Let s consider Twenty five thirty five a man s in his prime then they say forty five a middle aged man just entering politics fifty five died at the comparatively early age of fifty five according to the newspapers Bah How these Christians funk death Sixty five we re only getting on in years Seventy five is just possible though Great hell cat O fifty years more of solitary confinement in the dark You ll die and Beeton will die and Torp will die and Mai everybody else will die but I shall be alive and kicking with nothing to do I m very sorry for myself I should like some one else to be sorry for me Evidently I m not going mad before I die but the pain s just as bad as ever Some day when you re vivisected cat O they ll tie you down on a little table and cut you open but don t be afraid they ll take precious good care that you don t die You ll live and you ll be very sorry then that you weren t sorry for me Perhaps Torp will come back or I wish I could go to Torp and the Nilghai even though I were in their way Pussy left the room before the speech was ended and Alf as he entered found Dick addressing the empty hearth rug There s a letter for you sir he said Perhaps you d like me to read it Lend it to me for a minute and I ll tell you The outstretched hand shook just a little and the voice was not over steady It was within the limits of human possibility that that was no letter from Maisie He knew the heft of three closed envelopes only too well It was a foolish hope that the girl should write to him for he did not realise that there is a wrong which admits of no reparation though the evildoer may with tears and the heart s best love strive to mend all It is best to forget that wrong whether it be caused or endured since it is as remediless as bad work once put forward Read it then said Dick and Alf began intoning according to the rules of the Board School I could have given you love I could have given you loyalty such as you never dreamed of Do you suppose I cared what you were But you chose to whistle everything down the wind for nothing My only excuse for you is that you are so young That s all he said returning the paper to be dropped into the fire What was in the letter asked missus Beeton when Alf returned I don t know I think it was a circular or a tract about not whistlin at everything when you re young I must have stepped on something when I was alive and walking about and it has bounced up and hit me God help it whatever it is unless it was all a joke But I don t know any one who d take the trouble to play a joke on me Love and loyalty for nothing It sounds tempting enough I wonder whether I have lost anything really Dick considered for a long time but could not remember when or how he had put himself in the way of winning these trifles at a woman s hands Still the letter as touching on matters that he preferred not to think about stung him into a fit of frenzy that lasted for a day and night When his heart was so full of despair that it would hold no more body and soul together seemed to be dropping without check through the darkness Then came fear of darkness and desperate attempts to reach the light again But there was no light to be reached When that agony had left him sweating and breathless the downward flight would recommence till the gathering torture of it spurred him into another fight as hopeless as the first Followed some few minutes of sleep in which he dreamed that he saw Then the procession of events would repeat itself till he was utterly worn out and the brain took up its everlasting consideration of Maisie and might have beens At the end of everything mister Beeton came to his room and volunteered to take him out Not marketing this time but we ll go into the Parks if you like Be damned if I do quoth Dick Keep to the streets and walk up and down I like to hear the people round me This was not altogether true The blind in the first stages of their infirmity dislike those who can move with a free stride and unlifted arms but Dick had no earthly desire to go to the Parks Once and only once since Maisie had shut her door he had gone there under Alf s charge Alf forgot him and fished for minnows in the Serpentine with some companions After half an hour s waiting Dick almost weeping with rage and wrath caught a passer by who introduced him to a friendly policeman who led him to a four wheeler opposite the Albert Hall He never told mister Beeton of Alf s forgetfulness but this was not the manner in which he was used to walk the Parks aforetime What streets would you like to walk down then said mister Beeton sympathetically His own ideas of a riotous holiday meant picnicking on the grass of Green Park with his family and half a dozen paper bags full of food Keep to the river said Dick and they kept to the river and the rush of it was in his ears till they came to Blackfriars Bridge and struck thence on to the Waterloo Road mister Beeton explaining the beauties of the scenery as he went on And walking on the other side of the pavement said he unless I m much mistaken is the young woman that used to come to your rooms to be drawed I never forgets a face and I never remembers a name except paying tenants o course Stop her said Dick It s Bessie Broke Tell her I d like to speak to her again Quick man mister Beeton crossed the road under the noses of the omnibuses and arrested Bessie then on her way northward She recognised him as the man in authority who used to glare at her when she passed up Dick s staircase and her first impulse was to run Wasn t you mister Heldar s model said mister Beeton planting himself in front of her You was He s on the other side of the road and he d like to see you Why said Bessie faintly She remembered indeed had never for long forgotten an affair connected with a newly finished picture Because he has asked me to do so and because he s most particular blind Drunk No Orspital blind He can t see That s him over there Dick was leaning against the parapet of the bridge as mister Beeton pointed him out a stub bearded bowed creature wearing a dirty magenta coloured neckcloth outside an unbrushed coat There was nothing to fear from such an one Even if he chased her Bessie thought he could not follow far She crossed over and Dick s face lighted up It was long since a woman of any kind had taken the trouble to speak to him I hope you re well mister Heldar said Bessie a little puzzled mister Beeton stood by with the air of an ambassador and breathed responsibly I m very well indeed and by Jove I m glad to see hear you I mean Bess You never thought it worth while to turn up and see us again after you got your money I don t know why you should Are you going anywhere in particular just now I was going for a walk said Bessie Not the old business Dick spoke under his breath Lor no I paid my premium Bessie was very proud of that word for a barmaid sleeping in and I m at the bar now quite respectable Indeed I am mister Beeton had no special reason to believe in the loftiness of human nature Therefore he dissolved himself like a mist and returned to his gas plugs without a word of apology Bessie watched the flight with a certain uneasiness but so long as Dick appeared to be ignorant of the harm that had been done to him It s hard work pulling the beer handles she went on and they ve got one of them penny in the slot cash machines so if you get wrong by a penny at the end of the day but then I don t believe the machinery is right Do you I ve only seen it work mister Beeton He s gone I m afraid I must ask you to help me home then I ll make it worth your while You see The sightless eyes turned towards her and Bessie saw It isn t taking you out of your way he said hesitatingly I can ask a policeman if it is Not at all I come on at seven and I m off at four That s easy hours Good God but I m on all the time I wish I had some work to do too Let s go home Bess He turned and cannoned into a man on the sidewalk recoiling with an oath Bessie took his arm and said nothing as she had said nothing when he had ordered her to turn her face a little more to the light They walked for some time in silence the girl steering him deftly through the crowd And where s where s mister Torpenhow she inquired at last He has gone away to the desert Where s that Dick pointed to the right East out of the mouth of the river said he Then west then south and then east again all along the under side of Europe Then south again God knows how far The explanation did not enlighten Bessie in the least but she held her tongue and looked to Dick s patch till they came to the chambers We ll have tea and muffins he said joyously I can t tell you Bessie how glad I am to find you again What made you go away so suddenly I didn t think you d want me any more she said emboldened by his ignorance I didn t as a matter of fact but afterwards At any rate I m glad you ve come You know the stairs So Bessie led him home to his own place there was no one to hinder and shut the door of the studio What a mess was her first word All these things haven t been looked after for months and months No only weeks Bess You can t expect them to care I don t know what you expect them to do They ought to know what you ve paid them for The dust s just awful It s all over the easel I don t use it much now All over the pictures and the floor and all over your coat I d like to speak to them housemaids Ring for tea then Dick felt his way to the one chair he used by custom Bessie saw the action and as far as in her lay was touched But there remained always a keen sense of new found superiority and it was in her voice when she spoke How long have you been like this she said wrathfully as though the blindness were some fault of the housemaids How As you are The day after you went away with the check almost as soon as my picture was finished I hardly saw her alive Then they ve been cheating you ever since that s all I know their nice little ways A woman may love one man and despise another but on general feminine principles she will do her best to save the man she despises from being defrauded Her loved one can look to himself but the other man being obviously an idiot needs protection I don t think mister Beeton cheats much said Dick Bessie was flouncing up and down the room and he was conscious of a keen sense of enjoyment as he heard the swish of her skirts and the light step between Tea and muffins she said shortly when the ring at the bell was answered two teaspoonfuls and one over for the pot I don t want the old teapot that was here when I used to come It don t draw Get another The housemaid went away scandalised and Dick chuckled Then he began to cough as Bessie banged up and down the studio disturbing the dust What are you trying to do Put things straight This is like unfurnished lodgings How could you let it go so How could I help it Dust away She dusted furiously and in the midst of all the pother entered missus Beeton Her husband on his return had explained the situation winding up with the peculiarly felicitous proverb Do unto others as you would be done by She had descended to put into her place the person who demanded muffins and an uncracked teapot as though she had a right to both Muffins ready yet said Bess still dusting She was no longer a drab of the streets but a young lady who thanks to Dick s check had paid her premium and was entitled to pull beer handles with the best Being neatly dressed in black she did not hesitate to face missus Beeton and there passed between the two women certain regards that Dick would have appreciated The situation adjusted itself by eye Bessie had won and missus Beeton returned to cook muffins and make scathing remarks about models hussies trollops and the like to her husband There s nothing to be got of interfering with him Liza he said Alf you go along into the street to play When he isn t crossed he s as kindly as kind but when he s crossed he s the devil and all We took too many little things out of his rooms since he was blind to be that particular about what he does They ain t no objects to a blind man of course but if it was to come into court we d get the sack Yes I did introduce him to that girl because I m a feelin man myself Much too feelin missus Beeton slapped the muffins into the dish and thought of comely housemaids long since dismissed on suspicion I ain t ashamed of it and it isn t for us to judge him hard so long as he pays quiet and regular as he do I know how to manage young gentlemen you know how to cook for them and what I says is let each stick to his own business and then there won t be any trouble Take them muffins down Liza and be sure you have no words with that young woman His lot is cruel hard and if he s crossed he do swear worse than any one I ve ever served That s a little better said Bessie sitting down to the tea You needn t wait thank you missus Beeton I had no intention of doing such I do assure you Bessie made no answer whatever This she knew was the way in which real ladies routed their foes and when one is a barmaid at a first class public house one may become a real lady at ten minutes notice Her eyes fell on Dick opposite her and she was both shocked and displeased There were droppings of food all down the front of his coat the mouth under the ragged ill grown beard drooped sullenly the forehead was lined and contracted and on the lean temples the hair was a dusty indeterminate colour that might or might not have been called gray The utter misery and self abandonment of the man appealed to her and at the bottom of her heart lay the wicked feeling that he was humbled and brought low who had once humbled her Oh it is good to hear you moving about said Dick rubbing his hands Tell us all about your bar successes Bessie and the way you live now Never mind that I m quite respectable as you d see by looking at me You don t seem to live too well What made you go blind that sudden Why isn t there any one to look after you Dick was too thankful for the sound of her voice to resent the tone of it I was cut across the head a long time ago and that ruined my eyes I don t suppose anybody thinks it worth while to look after me any more Why should they and mister Beeton really does everything I want Don t you know any gentlemen and ladies then while you was well A few but I don t care to have them looking at me I suppose that s why you ve growed a beard Take it off it don t become you Good gracious child do you imagine that I think of what becomes of me these days You ought Get that taken off before I come here again I suppose I can come can t I I d be only too grateful if you did I don t think I treated you very well in the old days I used to make you angry Very angry you did I m sorry for it then Come and see me when you can and as often as you can God knows there isn t a soul in the world to take that trouble except you and mister Beeton A lot of trouble he s taking and she too This with a toss of the head They ve let you do anyhow and they haven t done anything for you I ve only to look and see that much I ll come and I ll be glad to come but you must go and be shaved and you must get some other clothes those ones aren t fit to be seen I have heaps somewhere he said helplessly I know you have Tell mister Beeton to give you a new suit and I ll brush it and keep it clean You may be as blind as a barn door mister Heldar but it doesn t excuse you looking like a sweep Do I look like a sweep then Oh I m sorry for you I m that sorry for you she cried impulsively and took Dick s hands Mechanically he lowered his head as if to kiss she was the only woman who had taken pity on him and he was not too proud for a little pity now She stood up to go Nothing o that kind till you look more like a gentleman It s quite easy when you get shaved and some clothes He could hear her drawing on her gloves and rose to say good bye She passed behind him kissed him audaciously on the back of the neck and ran away as swiftly as on the day when she had destroyed the Melancolia To think of me kissing mister Heldar she said to herself after all he s done to me and all Well I m sorry for him and if he was shaved he wouldn t be so bad to look at but Oh them Beetons how shameful they ve treated him I know Beeton s wearing his shirt on his back to day just as well as if I d aired it To morrow I ll see I wonder if he has much of his own It might be worth more than the bar I wouldn t have to do any work and just as respectable as if no one knew Dick was not grateful to Bessie for her parting gift He was acutely conscious of it in the nape of his neck throughout the night but it seemed among very many other things to enforce the wisdom of getting shaved He was shaved accordingly in the morning and felt the better for it A fresh suit of clothes white linen and the knowledge that some one in the world said that she took an interest in his personal appearance made him carry himself almost upright for the brain was relieved for a while from thinking of Maisie who under other circumstances might have given that kiss and a million others Let us consider said he after lunch The girl can t care and it s a toss up whether she comes again or not but if money can buy her to look after me she shall be bought Nobody else in the world would take the trouble and I can make it worth her while She s a child of the gutter holding brevet rank as a barmaid so she shall have everything she wants if she ll only come and talk and look after me He rubbed his newly shorn chin and began to perplex himself with the thought of her not coming I suppose I did look rather a sweep he went on I had no reason to look otherwise I knew things dropped on my clothes but it didn t matter It would be cruel if she didn t come She must Maisie came once and that was enough for her She was quite right She had something to work for This creature has only beer handles to pull unless she has deluded some young man into keeping company with her Fancy being cheated for the sake of a counter jumper We re falling pretty low Something cried aloud within him This will hurt more than anything that has gone before It will recall and remind and suggest and tantalise and in the end drive you mad I know it I know it Dick cried clenching his hands despairingly but good heavens is a poor blind beggar never to get anything out of his life except three meals a day and a greasy waistcoat I wish she d come Early in the afternoon time she came because there was no young man in her life just then and she thought of material advantages which would allow her to be idle for the rest of her days I shouldn t have known you she said approvingly You look as you used to look a gentleman that was proud of himself Don t you think I deserve another kiss then said Dick flushing a little Maybe but you won t get it yet Sit down and let s see what I can do for you I m certain sure mister Beeton cheats you now that you can t go through the housekeeping books every month Isn t that true You d better come and housekeep for me then Bessie Couldn t do it in these chambers you know that as well as I do I know but we might go somewhere else if you thought it worth your while I d try to look after you anyhow but I shouldn t care to have to work for both of us This was tentative Dick laughed Do you remember where I used to keep my bank book said he Torp took it to be balanced just before he went away Look and see It was generally under the tobacco jar Ah Well Oh Four thousand two hundred and ten pounds nine shillings and a penny Oh my You can have the penny That s not bad for one year s work Is that and a hundred and twenty pounds a year good enough The idleness and the pretty clothes were almost within her reach now but she must by being housewifely show that she deserved them Yes but you d have to move and if we took an inventory I think we d find that mister Beeton has been prigging little things out of the rooms here and there They don t look as full as they used Never mind we ll let him have them The only thing I m particularly anxious to take away is that picture I used you for when you used to swear at me We ll pull out of this place Bess and get away as far as ever we can Oh yes she said uneasily I don t know where I can go to get away from myself but I ll try and you shall have all the pretty frocks that you care for You ll like that Give me that kiss now Bess Ye gods it s good to put one s arm round a woman s waist again Then came the fulfilment of the prophecy within the brain If his arm were thus round Maisie s waist and a kiss had just been given and taken between them why then He pressed the girl more closely to himself because the pain whipped him She was wondering how to explain a little accident to the Melancolia At any rate if this man really desired the solace of her company and certainly he would relapse into his original slough if she withdrew it he would not be more than just a little vexed It would be delightful at least to see what would happen and by her teachings it was good for a man to stand in certain awe of his companion She laughed nervously and slipped out of his reach I shouldn t worrit about that picture if I was you she began in the hope of turning his attention It s at the back of all my canvases somewhere Find it Bess you know it as well as I do I know but But what You ve wit enough to manage the sale of it to a dealer Women haggle much better than men It might be a matter of eight or nine hundred pounds to to us I simply didn t like to think about it for a long time It was mixed up with my life so But we ll cover up our tracks and get rid of everything eh Make a fresh start from the beginning Bess Then she began to repent very much indeed because she knew the value of money Still it was probable that the blind man was overestimating the value of his work Gentlemen she knew were absurdly particular about their things She giggled as a nervous housemaid giggles when she tries to explain the breakage of a pipe I m very sorry but you remember I was I was angry with you before mister Torpenhow went away You were very angry child and on my word I think you had some right to be Then I but aren t you sure mister Torpenhow didn t tell you Tell me what Good gracious what are you making such a fuss about when you might just as well be giving me another kiss He was beginning to learn not for the first time in his experience that kissing is a cumulative poison The more you get of it the more you want Bessie gave the kiss promptly whispering as she did so I was so angry I rubbed out that picture with the turpentine You aren t angry are you What Say that again The man s hand had closed on her wrist I rubbed it out with turps and the knife faltered Bessie I thought you d only have to do it over again You did do it over again didn t you Oh let go of my wrist you re hurting me Isn t there anything left of the thing N nothing that looks like anything I m sorry I didn t know you d take on about it I only meant to do it in fun You aren t going to hit me Hit you No Let s think He did not relax his hold upon her wrist but stood staring at the carpet Then he shook his head as a young steer shakes it when the lash of the stock whip cross his nose warns him back to the path on to the shambles that he would escape For weeks he had forced himself not to think of the Melancolia because she was a part of his dead life With Bessie s return and certain new prospects that had developed themselves the Melancolia lovelier in his imagination than she had ever been on canvas reappeared By her aid he might have procured mor money wherewith to amuse Bess and to forget Maisie as well as another taste of an almost forgotten success Now thanks to a vicious little housemaid s folly there was nothing to look for not even the hope that he might some day take an abiding interest in the housemaid Worst of all he had been made to appear ridiculous in Maisie s eyes A woman will forgive the man who has ruined her life s work so long as he gives her love a man may forgive those who ruin the love of his life but he will never forgive the destruction of his work Tck tck tck said Dick between his teeth and then laughed softly It s an omen Bessie and a good many things considered it serves me right for doing what I have done By Jove that accounts for Maisie s running away She must have thought me perfectly mad small blame to her The whole picture ruined isn t it so What made you do it Because I was that angry I m not angry now I m awful sorry I wonder It doesn t matter anyhow I m to blame for making the mistake What mistake Something you wouldn t understand dear Great heavens to think that a little piece of dirt like you could throw me out of stride Dick was talking to himself as Bessie tried to shake off his grip on her wrist I ain t a piece of dirt and you shouldn t call me so I did it cause I hated you and I m only sorry now cause you re cause you re Exactly because I m blind There s noting like tact in little things Bessie began to sob She did not like being shackled against her will she was afraid of the blind face and the look upon it and was sorry too that her great revenge had only made Dick laugh Don t cry he said and took her into his arms You only did what you thought right I I ain t a little piece of dirt and if you say that I ll never come to you again You don t know what you ve done to me I m not angry indeed I m not Be quiet for a minute Bessie remained in his arms shrinking Dick s first thought was connected with Maisie and it hurt him as white hot iron hurts an open sore Not for nothing is a man permitted to ally himself to the wrong woman The first pang the first sense of things lost is but the prelude to the play for the very just Providence who delights in causing pain has decreed that the agony shall return and that in the midst of keenest pleasure They know this pain equally who have forsaken or been forsaken by the love of their life and in their new wives arms are compelled to realise it It is better to remain alone and suffer only the misery of being alone so long as it is possible to find distraction in daily work When that resource goes the man is to be pitied and left alone These things and some others Dick considered while he was holding Bessie to his heart Though you mayn t know it he said raising his head the Lord is a just and a terrible God Bess with a very strong sense of humour It serves me right how it serves me right Torp could understand it if he were here he must have suffered something at your hands child but only for a minute or so I saved him Set that to my credit some one Let me go said Bess her face darkening Let me go All in good time Did you ever attend Sunday school Never Let me go I tell you you re making fun of me Indeed I m not I m making fun of myself Thus He saved others himself he cannot save It isn t exactly a school board text He released her wrist but since he was between her and the door she could not escape What an enormous amount of mischief one little woman can do I m sorry I m awful sorry about the picture I m not I m grateful to you for spoiling it What were we talking about before you mentioned the thing About getting away and money Me and you going away Of course We will get away that is to say I will And me You shall have fifty whole pounds for spoiling a picture Then you won t I m afraid not dear Think of fifty pounds for pretty things all to yourself You said you couldn t do anything without me That was true a little while ago I m better now thank you Get me my hat S pose I don t Beeton will and you ll lose fifty pounds That s all Get it Bessie cursed under her breath She had pitied the man sincerely had kissed him with almost equal sincerity for he was not unhandsome it pleased her to be in a way and for a time his protector and above all there were four thousand pounds to be handled by some one Now through a slip of the tongue and a little feminine desire to give a little not too much pain she had lost the money the blessed idleness and the pretty things the companionship and the chance of looking outwardly as respectable as a real lady Now fill me a pipe Tobacco doesn t taste but it doesn t matter and I ll think things out What s the day of the week Bess Tuesday Then Thursday s mail day What a fool what a blind fool I have been Twenty two pounds covers my passage home again Allow ten for additional expenses We must put up at Madam Binat s for old time s sake Thirty two pounds altogether Add a hundred for the cost of the last trip Gad won t Torp stare to see me a hundred and thirty two leaves seventy eight for baksheesh I shall need it and to play with What are you crying for Bess It wasn t your fault child it was mine altogether Oh you funny little opossum mop your eyes and take me out I want the pass book and the check book Stop a minute Four thousand pounds at four per cent that s safe interest means a hundred and sixty pounds a year one hundred and twenty pounds a year also safe is two eighty and two hundred and eighty pounds added to three hundred a year means gilded luxury for a single woman Bess we ll go to the bank Richer by two hundred and ten pounds stored in his money belt Dick caused Bessie now thoroughly bewildered to hurry from the bank to the P and O offices where he explained things tersely Port Said single first cabin as close to the baggage hatch as possible What ship s going The Colgong said the clerk She s a wet little hooker Is it Tilbury and a tender or Galleons and the docks Galleons Twelve forty Thursday Thanks Change please I can t see very well will you count it into my hand If they all took their passages like that instead of talking about their trunks life would be worth something said the clerk to his neighbour who was trying to explain to a harassed mother of many that condensed milk is just as good for babes at sea as daily dairy Being nineteen and unmarried he spoke with conviction We are now quoth Dick as they returned to the studio patting the place where his money belt covered ticket and money beyond the reach of man or devil or woman which is much more important I ve had three little affairs to carry through before Thursday but I needn t ask you to help Bess Come here on Thursday morning at nine We ll breakfast and you shall take me down to Galleons Station What are you going to do Going away of course What should I stay for But you can t look after yourself I can do anything I didn t realise it before but I can I ve done a great deal already Resolution shall be treated to one kiss if Bessie doesn t object Strangely enough Bessie objected and Dick laughed I suppose you re right Well come at nine the day after to morrow and you ll get your money Shall I sure I don t bilk and you won t know whether I do or not unless you come Oh but it s long and long to wait Good bye Bessie send Beeton here as you go out The housekeeper came What are all the fittings of my rooms worth said Dick imperiously Tisn t for me to say sir Some things is very pretty and some is wore out dreadful I m insured for two hundred and seventy Insurance policies is no criterion though I don t say Oh damn your longwindedness You ve made your pickings out of me and the other tenants Why you talked of retiring and buying a public house the other day Give a straight answer to a straight question Fifty said mister Beeton without a moment s hesitation Double it or I ll break up half my sticks and burn the rest He felt his way to a bookstand that supported a pile of sketch books and wrenched out one of the mahogany pillars That s sinful sir said the housekeeper alarmed It s my own One hundred or One hundred it is It ll cost me three and six to get that there pilaster mended I thought so What an out and out swindler you must have been to spring that price at once I hope I ve done nothing to dissatisfy any of the tenants least of all you sir Never mind that Get me the money to morrow and see that all my clothes are packed in the little brown bullock trunk I m going But the quarter s notice I ll pay forfeit Look after the packing and leave me alone mister Beeton discussed this new departure with his wife who decided that Bessie was at the bottom of it all Her husband took a more charitable view It s very sudden but then he was always sudden in his ways Listen to him now There was a sound of chanting from Dick s room We ll never come back any more boys We ll never come back no more We ll go to the deuce on any excuse And never come back no more Oh say we re afloat or ashore boys Oh say we re afloat or ashore But we ll never come back any more boys We ll never come back no more mister Beeton mister Beeton Where the deuce is my pistol Quick he s going to shoot himself avin gone mad said missus Beeton mister Beeton addressed Dick soothingly but it was some time before the latter threshing up and down his bedroom could realise the intention of the promises to find everything to morrow sir Oh you copper nosed old fool you impotent Academician he shouted at last Do you suppose I want to shoot myself Take the pistol in your silly shaking hand then If you touch it it will go off because it s loaded It s among my campaign kit somewhere in the parcel at the bottom of the trunk Long ago Dick had carefully possessed himself of a forty pound weight field equipment constructed by the knowledge of his own experience It was this put away treasure that he was trying to find and rehandle mister Beeton whipped the revolver out of its place on the top of the package and Dick drove his hand among the khaki coat and breeches the blue cloth leg bands and the heavy flannel shirts doubled over a pair of swan neck spurs Under these and the water bottle lay a sketch book and a pigskin case of stationery These we don t want you can have them mister Beeton Everything else I ll keep Pack em on the top right hand side of my trunk When you ve done that come into the studio with your wife I want you both Wait a minute get me a pen and a sheet of notepaper It is not an easy thing to write when you cannot see and Dick had particular reasons for wishing that his work should be clear So he began following his right hand with his left The badness of this writing is because I am blind and cannot see my pen H mph even a lawyer can t mistake that It must be signed I suppose but it needn t be witnessed Now an inch lower why did I never learn to use a type writer This is the last will and testament of me Richard Heldar I am in sound bodily and mental health and there is no previous will to revoke That s all right Damn the pen Whereabouts on the paper was I I leave everything that I possess in the world including four thousand pounds and two thousand seven hundred and twenty eight pounds held for me oh I can t get this straight He tore off half the sheet and began again with the caution about the handwriting Then I leave all the money I possess in the world to here followed Maisie s name and the names of the two banks that held the money It mayn t be quite regular but no one has a shadow of a right to dispute it and I ve given Maisie s address Come in mister Beeton This is my signature I want you and your wife to witness it Thanks To morrow you must take me to the landlord and I ll pay forfeit for leaving without notice and I ll lodge this paper with him in case anything happens while I m away Now we re going to light up the studio stove Stay with me and give me my papers as I want em No one knows until he has tried how fine a blaze a year s accumulation of bills letters and dockets can make Dick stuffed into the stove every document in the studio saving only three unopened letters destroyed sketch books rough note books new and half finished canvases alike What a lot of rubbish a tenant gets about him if he stays long enough in one place to be sure said mister Beeton at last He does Is there anything more left Dick felt round the walls Not a thing and the stove s nigh red hot Excellent and you ve lost about a thousand pounds worth of sketches Ho ho Quite a thousand pounds worth if I can remember what I used to be Yes sir politely mister Beeton was quite sure that Dick had gone mad otherwise he would have never parted with his excellent furniture for a song The canvas things took up storage room and were much better out of the way There remained only to leave the little will in safe hands that could not be accomplished till to morrow Dick groped about the floor picking up the last pieces of paper assured himself again and again that there remained no written word or sign of his past life in drawer or desk and sat down before the stove till the fire died out and the contracting iron cracked in the silence of the night CHAPTER XV With a heart of furious fancies Whereof I am commander With a burning spear and a horse of air To the wilderness I wander With a knight of ghosts and shadows I summoned am to tourney Ten leagues beyond the wide world s end Methinks it is no journey Tom a Bedlam s Song GOOD BYE Bess I promised you fifty Here s a hundred all that I got for my furniture from Beeton That will keep you in pretty frocks for some time You ve been a good little girl all things considered but you ve given me and Torpenhow a fair amount of trouble Give mister Torpenhow my love if you see him won t you Of course I will dear Now take me up the gang plank and into the cabin Once aboard the lugger and the maid is and I am free I mean Who ll look after you on this ship The head steward if there s any use in money The doctor when we come to Port Said if I know anything of P and O doctors After that the Lord will provide as He used to do Bess found Dick his cabin in the wild turmoil of a ship full of leavetakers and weeping relatives Then he kissed her and laid himself down in his bunk until the decks should be clear He who had taken so long to move about his own darkened rooms well understood the geography of a ship and the necessity of seeing to his own comforts was as wine to him Before the screw began to thrash the ship along the Docks he had been introduced to the head steward had royally tipped him secured a good place at table opened out his baggage and settled himself down with joy in the cabin It was scarcely necessary to feel his way as he moved about for he knew everything so well Then God was very kind a deep sleep of weariness came upon him just as he would have thought of Maisie and he slept till the steamer had cleared the mouth of the Thames and was lifting to the pulse of the Channel The rattle of the engines the reek of oil and paint and a very familiar sound in the next cabin roused him to his new inheritance Oh it s good to be alive again He yawned stretched himself vigorously and went on deck to be told that they were almost abreast of the lights of Brighton This is no more open water than Trafalgar Square is a common the free levels begin at Ushant but none the less Dick could feel the healing of the sea at work upon him already A boisterous little cross swell swung the steamer disrespectfully by the nose and one wave breaking far aft spattered the quarterdeck and the pile of new deck chairs He heard the foam fall with the clash of broken glass was stung in the face by a cupful and sniffing luxuriously felt his way to the smoking room by the wheel There a strong breeze found him blew his cap off and left him bareheaded in the doorway and the smoking room steward understanding that he was a voyager of experience said that the weather would be stiff in the chops off the Channel and more than half a gale in the Bay These things fell as they were foretold and Dick enjoyed himself to the utmost It is allowable and even necessary at sea to lay firm hold upon tables stanchions and ropes in moving from place to place On land the man who feels with his hands is patently blind At sea even a blind man who is not sea sick can jest with the doctor over the weakness of his fellows Dick told the doctor many tales and these are coin of more value than silver if properly handled smoked with him till unholy hours of the night and so won his short lived regard that he promised Dick a few hours of his time when they came to Port Said And the sea roared or was still as the winds blew and the engines sang their song day and night and the sun grew stronger day by day and Tom the Lascar barber shaved Dick of a morning under the opened hatch grating where the cool winds blew and the awnings were spread and the passengers made merry and at last they came to Port Said Take me said Dick to the doctor to Madame Binat s if you know where that is Whew said the doctor I do There s not much to choose between em but I suppose you re aware that that s one of the worst houses in the place They ll rob you to begin with and knife you later Not they Take me there and I can look after myself So he was brought to Madame Binat s and filled his nostrils with the well remembered smell of the East that runs without a change from the Canal head to Hong Kong and his mouth with the villainous Lingua Franca of the Levant The heat smote him between the shoulder blades with the buffet of an old friend his feet slipped on the sand and his coat sleeve was warm as new baked bread when he lifted it to his nose Madame Binat smiled with the smile that knows no astonishment when Dick entered the drinking shop which was one source of her gains But for a little accident of complete darkness he could hardly realise that he had ever quitted the old life that hummed in his ears Somebody opened a bottle of peculiarly strong Schiedam The smell reminded Dick of Monsieur Binat who by the way had spoken of art and degradation Binat was dead Madame said as much when the doctor departed scandalised so far as a ship s doctor can be at the warmth of Dick s reception Dick was delighted at it They remember me here after a year They have forgotten me across the water by this time Madame I want a long talk with you when you re at liberty It is good to be back again In the evening she set an iron topped cafe table out on the sands and Dick and she sat by it while the house behind them filled with riot merriment oaths and threats The stars came out and the lights of the shipping in the harbour twinkled by the head of the Canal Yes The war is good for trade my friend but what dost thou do here We have not forgotten thee I was over there in England and I went blind But there was the glory first We heard of it here even here I and Binat and thou hast used the head of Yellow Tina she is still alive so often and so well that Tina laughed when the papers arrived by the mail boats It was always something that we here could recognise in the paintings And then there was always the glory and the money for thee I am not poor I shall pay you well Not to me Thou hast paid for everything Under her breath Mon Dieu to be blind and so young What horror Dick could not see her face with the pity on it or his own with the discoloured hair at the temples He did not feel the need of pity he was too anxious to get to the front once more and explained his desire And where The Canal is full of the English ships Sometimes they fire as they used to do when the war was here ten years ago Beyond Cairo there is fighting but how canst thou go there without a correspondent s passport And in the desert there is always fighting but that is impossible also said she I must go to Suakin He knew thanks to Alf s readings that Torpenhow was at work with the column that was protecting the construction of the Suakin Berber line P and O steamers do not touch at that port and besides Madame Binat knew everybody whose help or advice was worth anything They were not respectable folk but they could cause things to be accomplished which is much more important when there is work toward But at Suakin they are always fighting That desert breeds men always and always more men And they are so bold Why to Suakin My friend is there Thy friend Chtt Thy friend is death then Madame Binat dropped a fat arm on the table top filled Dick s glass anew and looked at him closely under the stars There was no need that he should bow his head in assent and say No He is a man but if it should arrive blamest thou I blame she laughed shrilly Who am I that I should blame any one except those who try to cheat me over their consommations But it is very terrible I must go to Suakin Think for me A great deal has changed within the year and the men I knew are not here The Egyptian lighthouse steamer goes down the Canal to Suakin and the post boats But even then Do not think any longer I know and it is for me to think Thou shalt go thou shalt go and see thy friend Be wise Sit here until the house is a little quiet I must attend to my guests and afterwards go to bed Thou shalt go in truth thou shalt go To morrow As soon as may be She was talking as though he were a child He sat at the table listening to the voices in the harbour and the streets and wondering how soon the end would come till Madame Binat carried him off to bed and ordered him to sleep The house shouted and sang and danced and revelled Madame Binat moving through it with one eye on the liquor payments and the girls and the other on Dick s interests To this latter end she smiled upon scowling and furtive Turkish officers of fellaheen regiments and more than kind to camel agents of no nationality whatever In the early morning being then appropriately dressed in a flaming red silk ball dress with a front of tarnished gold embroidery and a necklace of plate glass diamonds she made chocolate and carried it in to Dick It is only I and I am of discreet age eh Drink and eat the roll too Thus in France mothers bring their sons when those behave wisely the morning chocolate She sat down on the side of the bed whispering It is all arranged Thou wilt go by the lighthouse boat That is a bribe of ten pounds English The captain is never paid by the Government The boat comes to Suakin in four days There will go with thee George a Greek muleteer Another bribe of ten pounds I will pay they must not know of thy money George will go with thee as far as he goes with his mules Then he comes back to me for his well beloved is here and if I do not receive a telegram from Suakin saying that thou art well the girl answers for George Thank you He reached out sleepily for the cup You are much too kind Madame If there were anything that I might do I would say stay here and be wise but I do not think that would be best for thee She looked at her liquor stained dress with a sad smile Nay thou shalt go in truth thou shalt go It is best so My boy it is best so She stooped and kissed Dick between the eyes That is for good morning she said going away When thou art dressed we will speak to George and make everything ready But first we must open the little trunk Give me the keys The amount of kissing lately has been simply scandalous I shall expect Torp to kiss me next He is more likely to swear at me for getting in his way though Well it won t last long Ohe Madame help me to my toilette of the guillotine There will be no chance of dressing properly out yonder He was rummaging among his new campaign kit and rowelling his hands with the spurs There are two ways of wearing well oiled ankle jacks spotless blue bands khaki coat and breeches and a perfectly pipeclayed helmet The right way is the way of the untired man master of himself setting out upon an expedition well pleased Everything must be very correct Dick explained It will become dirty afterwards but now it is good to feel well dressed Is everything as it should be He patted the revolver neatly hidden under the fulness of the blouse on the right hip and fingered his collar I can do no more Madame said between laughing and crying Look at thyself but I forgot I am very content He stroked the creaseless spirals of his leggings Now let us go and see the captain and George and the lighthouse boat Be quick Madame But thou canst not be seen by the harbour walking with me in the daylight Figure to yourself if some English ladies There are no English ladies and if there are I have forgotten them Take me there In spite of this burning impatience it was nearly evening ere the lighthouse boat began to move Madame had said a great deal both to George and the captain touching the arrangements that were to be made for Dick s benefit Very few men who had the honour of her acquaintance cared to disregard Madame s advice That sort of contempt might end in being knifed by a stranger in a gambling hell upon surprisingly short provocation For six days two of them were wasted in the crowded Canal the little steamer worked her way to Suakin where she was to pick up the superintendent of the lighthouse and Dick made it his business to propitiate George who was distracted with fears for the safety of his light of love and half inclined to make Dick responsible for his own discomfort When they arrived George took him under his wing and together they entered the red hot seaport encumbered with the material and wastage of the Suakin Berger line from locomotives in disconsolate fragments to mounds of chairs and pot sleepers If you keep with me said George nobody will ask for passports or what you do They are all very busy Yes but I should like to hear some of the Englishmen talk They might remember me I was known here a long time ago when I was some one indeed A long time ago is a very long time ago here The graveyards are full Now listen This new railway runs out so far as Tanai el Hassan that is seven miles Then there is a camp They say that beyond Tanai el Hassan the English troops go forward and everything that they require will be brought to them by this line Ah Base camp I see That s a better business than fighting Fuzzies in the open For this reason even the mules go up in the iron train Iron what It is all covered with iron because it is still being shot at An armoured train Better and better Go on faithful George And I go up with my mules to night Only those who particularly require to go to the camp go out with the train They begin to shoot not far from the city The dears they always used to Dick snuffed the smell of parched dust heated iron and flaking paint with delight Certainly the old life was welcoming him back most generously When I have got my mules together I go up to night but you must first send a telegram of Port Said declaring that I have done you no harm Madame has you well in hand Would you stick a knife into me if you had the chance I have no chance said the Greek She is there with that woman I see It s a bad thing to be divided between love of woman and the chance of loot I sympathise with you George They went to the telegraph office unquestioned for all the world was desperately busy and had scarcely time to turn its head and Suakin was the last place under sky that would be chosen for holiday ground On their return the voice of an English subaltern asked Dick what he was doing The blue goggles were over his eyes and he walked with his hand on George s elbow as he replied Egyptian Government mules My orders are to give them over to the A C G at Tanai el Hassan Any occasion to show my papers Oh certainly not I beg your pardon I d no right to ask but not seeing your face before I I go out in the train to night I suppose said Dick boldly There will be no difficulty in loading up the mules will there You can see the horse platforms from here You must have them loaded up early The young man went away wondering what sort of broken down waif this might be who talked like a gentleman and consorted with Greek muleteers Dick felt unhappy To outface an English officer is no small thing but the bluff loses relish when one plays it from the utter dark and stumbles up and down rough ways thinking and eternally thinking of what might have been if things had fallen out otherwise and all had been as it was not George shared his meal with Dick and went off to the mule lines His charge sat alone in a shed with his face in his hands Before his tight shut eyes danced the face of Maisie laughing with parted lips There was a great bustle and clamour about him He grew afraid and almost called for George I say have you got your mules ready It was the voice of the subaltern over his shoulder My man s looking after them The the fact is I ve a touch of ophthalmia and can t see very well By Jove that s bad You ought to lie up in hospital for a while I ve had a turn of it myself It s as bad as being blind So I find it When does this armoured train go At six o clock It takes an hour to cover the seven miles Are the Fuzzies on the rampage eh About three nights a week Fact is I m in acting command of the night train It generally runs back empty to Tanai for the night Big camp at Tanai I suppose Pretty big It has to feed our desert column somehow Is that far off Between thirty and forty miles in an infernal thirsty country Is the country quiet between Tanai and our men More or less I shouldn t care to cross it alone or with a subaltern s command for the matter of that but the scouts get through it in some extraordinary fashion They always did Have you been here before then I was through most of the trouble when it first broke out In the service and cashiered was the subaltern s first thought so he refrained from putting any questions There s your man coming up with the mules It seems rather queer That I should be mule leading said Dick I didn t mean to say so but it is Forgive me it s beastly impertinence I know but you speak like a man who has been at a public school There s no mistaking the tone I am a public school man I thought so I say I don t want to hurt your feelings but you re a little down on your luck aren t you I saw you sitting with your head in your hands and that s why I spoke Thanks I am about as thoroughly and completely broke as a man need be Suppose I mean I m a public school man myself Couldn t I perhaps take it as a loan y know and You re much too good but on my honour I ve as much money as I want I tell you what you could do for me though and put me under an everlasting obligation Let me come into the bogie truck of the train There is a fore truck isn t there Yes How d you know I ve been in an armoured train before Only let me see hear some of the fun I mean and I ll be grateful I go at my own risk as a non combatant The young man thought for a minute All right he said We re supposed to be an empty train and there s no one to blow me up at the other end George and a horde of yelling amateur assistants had loaded up the mules and the narrow gauge armoured train plated with three eighths inch boiler plate till it looked like one long coffin stood ready to start Two bogie trucks running before the locomotive were completely covered in with plating except that the leading one was pierced in front for the muzzle of a machine gun and the second at either side for lateral fire The trucks together made one long iron vaulted chamber in which a score of artillerymen were rioting Whitechapel last train Ah I see yer kissin in the first class there somebody shouted just as Dick was clamouring into the forward truck Lordy Ere s a real live passenger for the Kew Tanai Acton and Ealin train Echo sir Speshul edition Star sir Shall I get you a foot warmer said another Thanks I ll pay my footing said Dick and relations of the most amiable were established ere silence came with the arrival of the subaltern and the train jolted out over the rough track This is an immense improvement on shooting the unimpressionable Fuzzy in the open said Dick from his place in the corner Oh but he s still unimpressed There he goes said the subaltern as a bullet struck the outside of the truck We always have at least one demonstration against the night train Generally they attack the rear truck where my junior commands He gets all the fun of the fair Not to night though Listen said Dick A flight of heavy handed bullets was succeeded by yelling and shouts The children of the desert valued their nightly amusement and the train was an excellent mark Is it worth giving them half a hopper full the subaltern asked of the engine which was driven by a Lieutenant of Sappers I should think so This is my section of the line They ll be playing old Harry with my permanent way if we don t stop em Right O Hrrmph said the machine gun through all its five noses as the subaltern drew the lever home The empty cartridges clashed on the floor and the smoke blew back through the truck There was indiscriminate firing at the rear of the train and return fire from the darkness without and unlimited howling Dick stretched himself on the floor wild with delight at the sounds and the smells God is very good I never thought I d hear this again Give em hell men Oh give em hell he cried The train stopped for some obstruction on the line ahead and a party went out to reconnoitre but came back cursing for spades The children of the desert had piled sand and gravel on the rails and twenty minutes were lost in clearing it away Then the slow progress recommenced to be varied with more shots more shoutings the steady clack and kick of the machine guns and a final difficulty with a half lifted rail ere the train came under the protection of the roaring camp at Tanai el Hassan Now you see why it takes an hour and a half to fetch her through said the subaltern unshipping the cartridge hopper above his pet gun It was a lark though I only wish it had lasted twice as long How superb it must have looked from outside said Dick sighing regretfully It palls after the first few nights By the way when you ve settled about your mules come and see what we can find to eat in my tent I m Bennil of the Gunners in the artillery lines and mind you don t fall over my tent ropes in the dark But it was all dark to Dick He could only smell the camels the hay bales the cooking the smoky fires and the tanned canvas of the tents as he stood where he had dropped from the train shouting for George There was a sound of light hearted kicking on the iron skin of the rear trucks with squealing and grunting George was unloading the mules The engine was blowing off steam nearly in Dick s ear a cold wind of the desert danced between his legs he was hungry and felt tired and dirty so dirty that he tried to brush his coat with his hands That was a hopeless job he thrust his hands into his pockets and began to count over the many times that he had waited in strange or remote places for trains or camels mules or horses to carry him to his business In those days he could see few men more clearly and the spectacle of an armed camp at dinner under the stars was an ever fresh pleasure to the eye There was colour light and motion without which no man has much pleasure in living This night there remained for him only one more journey through the darkness that never lifts to tell a man how far he has travelled Then he would grip Torpenhow s hand again Torpenhow who was alive and strong and lived in the midst of the action that had once made the reputation of a man called Dick Heldar not in the least to be confused with the blind bewildered vagabond who seemed to answer to the same name Yes he would find Torpenhow and come as near to the old life as might be Afterwards he would forget everything Bessie who had wrecked the Melancolia and so nearly wrecked his life Beeton who lived in a strange unreal city full of tin tacks and gas plugs and matters that no men needed that irrational being who had offered him love and loyalty for nothing but had not signed her name and most of all Maisie who from her own point of view was undeniably right in all she did but oh at this distance so tantalisingly fair George s hand on his arm pulled him back to the situation And what now said George Oh yes of course What now Take me to the camel men Take me to where the scouts sit when they come in from the desert They sit by their camels and the camels eat grain out of a black blanket held up at the corners and the men eat by their side just like camels Take me there The camp was rough and rutty and Dick stumbled many times over the stumps of scrub The scouts were sitting by their beasts as Dick knew they would The light of the dung fires flickered on their bearded faces and the camels bubbled and mumbled beside them at rest It was no part of Dick s policy to go into the desert with a convoy of supplies That would lead to impertinent questions and since a blind non combatant is not needed at the front he would probably be forced to return to Suakin He must go up alone and go immediately Now for one last bluff the biggest of all he said Peace be with you brethren The watchful George steered him to the circle of the nearest fire The heads of the camel sheiks bowed gravely and the camels scenting a European looked sideways curiously like brooding hens half ready to get to their feet A beast and a driver to go to the fighting line to night said Dick A Mulaid said a voice scornfully naming the best baggage breed that he knew A Bisharin returned Dick with perfect gravity A Bisharin without saddle galls Therefore no charge of thine shock head Two or three minutes passed Then We be knee haltered for the night There is no going out from the camp Not for money H m Ah English money Another depressing interval of silence How much Twenty five pounds English paid into the hand of the driver at my journey s end and as much more into the hand of the camel sheik here to be paid when the driver returns This was royal payment and the sheik who knew that he would get his commission on this deposit stirred in Dick s behalf For scarcely one night s journey fifty pounds Land and wells and good trees and wives to make a man content for the rest of his days Who speaks said Dick I said a voice I will go but there is no going from the camp Fool I know that a camel can break his knee halter and the sentries do not fire if one goes in chase Twenty five pounds and another twenty five pounds But the beast must be a good Bisharin I will take no baggage camel Then the bargaining began and at the end of half an hour the first deposit was paid over to the sheik who talked in low tones to the driver Dick heard the latter say A little way out only Any baggage beast will serve Am I a fool to waste my cattle for a blind man And though I cannot see Dick lifted his voice a little yet I carry that which has six eyes and the driver will sit before me If we do not reach the English troops in the dawn he will be dead But where in God s name are the troops Unless thou knowest let another man ride Dost thou know Remember it will be life or death to thee I know said the driver sullenly Stand back from my beast I am going to slip him Not so swiftly George hold the camel s head a moment I want to feel his cheek The hands wandered over the hide till they found the branded half circle that is the mark of the Biharin the light built riding camel That is well Cut this one loose Remember no blessing of God comes on those who try to cheat the blind The men chuckled by the fires at the camel driver s discomfiture He had intended to substitute a slow saddle galled baggage colt Stand back one shouted lashing the Biharin under the belly with a quirt Dick obeyed as soon as he felt the nose string tighten in his hand and a cry went up Illaha Aho He is loose With a roar and a grunt the Biharin rose to his feet and plunged forward toward the desert his driver following with shouts and lamentation George caught Dick s arm and hurried him stumbling and tripping past a disgusted sentry who was used to stampeding camels What s the row now he cried Every stitch of my kit on that blasted dromedary Dick answered after the manner of a common soldier Go on and take care your throat s not cut out side you and your dromedary s The outcries ceased when the camel had disappeared behind a hillock and his driver had called him back and made him kneel down Mount first said Dick Then climbing into the second seat and gently screwing the pistol muzzle into the small of his companion s back Go on in God s name and swiftly Good bye George Remember me to Madame and have a good time with your girl Get forward child of the Pit A few minutes later he was shut up in a great silence hardly broken by the creaking of the saddle and the soft pad of the tireless feet Dick adjusted himself comfortably to the rock and pitch of the pace girthed his belt tighter and felt the darkness slide past For an hour he was conscious only of the sense of rapid progress A good camel he said at last He was never underfed He is my own and clean bred the driver replied Go on His head dropped on his chest and he tried to think but the tenor of his thoughts was broken because he was very sleepy In the half doze in seemed that he was learning a punishment hymn at missus Jennett s He had committed some crime as bad as Sabbath breaking and she had locked him up in his bedroom But he could never repeat more than the first two lines of the hymn When Israel of the Lord believed Out of the land of bondage came He said them over and over thousands of times The driver turned in the saddle to see if there were any chance of capturing the revolver and ending the ride Dick roused struck him over the head with the butt and stormed himself wide awake Somebody hidden in a clump of camel thorn shouted as the camel toiled up rising ground A shot was fired and the silence shut down again bringing the desire to sleep Dick could think no longer He was too tired and stiff and cramped to do more than nod uneasily from time to time waking with a start and punching the driver with the pistol Is there a moon he asked drowsily She is near her setting I wish that I could see her Halt the camel At least let me hear the desert talk The man obeyed Out of the utter stillness came one breath of wind It rattled the dead leaves of a shrub some distance away and ceased A handful of dry earth detached itself from the edge of a rail trench and crumbled softly to the bottom Go on The night is very cold Those who have watched till the morning know how the last hour before the light lengthens itself into many eternities It seemed to Dick that he had never since the beginning of original darkness done anything at all save jolt through the air Once in a thousand years he would finger the nailheads on the saddle front and count them all carefully Centuries later he would shift his revolver from his right hand to his left and allow the eased arm to drop down at his side From the safe distance of London he was watching himself thus employed watching critically Yet whenever he put out his hand to the canvas that he might paint the tawny yellow desert under the glare of the sinking moon the black shadow of a camel and the two bowed figures atop that hand held a revolver and the arm was numbed from wrist to collar bone Moreover he was in the dark and could see no canvas of any kind whatever The driver grunted and Dick was conscious of a change in the air I smell the dawn he whispered It is here and yonder are the troops Have I done well The camel stretched out its neck and roared as there came down wind the pungent reek of camels in the square Go on We must get there swiftly Go on They are moving in their camp There is so much dust that I cannot see what they do Am I in better case Go forward They could hear the hum of voices ahead the howling and the bubbling of the beasts and the hoarse cries of the soldiers girthing up for the day Two or three shots were fired Is that at us Surely they can see that I am English Dick spoke angrily Nay it is from the desert the driver answered cowering in his saddle Go forward my child Well it is that the dawn did not uncover us an hour ago The camel headed straight for the column and the shots behind multiplied The children of the desert had arranged that most uncomfortable of surprises a dawn attack for the English troops and were getting their distance by snap shots at the only moving object without the square What luck What stupendous and imperial luck said Dick It s just before the battle mother Oh God has been most good to me Only the agony of the thought made him screw up his eyes for an instant Maisie Allahu We are in said the man as he drove into the rearguard and the camel knelt Who the deuce are you Despatches or what What s the strength of the enemy behind that ridge How did you get through asked a dozen voices For all answer Dick took a long breath unbuckled his belt and shouted from the saddle at the top of a wearied and dusty voice Torpenhow Ohe Torp Coo ee Tor pen how A bearded man raking in the ashes of a fire for a light to his pipe moved very swiftly towards that cry as the rearguard facing about began to fire at the puffs of smoke from the hillocks around Gradually the scattered white cloudlets drew out into the long lines of banked white that hung heavily in the stillness of the dawn before they turned over wave like and glided into the valleys The soldiers in the square were coughing and swearing as their own smoke obstructed their view and they edged forward to get beyond it A wounded camel leaped to its feet and roared aloud the cry ending in a bubbling grunt Some one had cut its throat to prevent confusion Then came the thick sob of a man receiving his death wound from a bullet then a yell of agony and redoubled firing There was no time to ask any questions Get down man Get down behind the camel No Put me I pray in the forefront of the battle Dick turned his face to Torpenhow and raised his hand to set his helmet straight but miscalculating the distance knocked it off Torpenhow saw that his hair was gray on the temples and that his face was the face of an old man Come down you damned fool Dickie come off And Dick came obediently but as a tree falls pitching sideways from the Bisharin s saddle at Torpenhow s feet His luck had held to the last even to the crowning mercy of a kindly bullet through his head Torpenhow knelt under the lee of the camel with Dick s body in his arms End of Project Gutenberg s The Light That Failed by Rudyard Kipling END OF
