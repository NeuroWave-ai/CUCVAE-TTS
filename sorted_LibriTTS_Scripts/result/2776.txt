none	none	 SISTERS OF THE GOLDEN CIRCLE THE ROMANCE OF A BUSY BROKER AFTER TWENTY YEARS LOST ON DRESS PARADE BY COURIER THE FURNISHED ROOM THE BRIEF DEBUT OF TILDY TOBIN S PALM Tobin and me the two of us went down to Coney one day for there was four dollars between us and Tobin had need of distractions For there was Katie Mahorner his sweetheart of County Sligo lost since she started for America three months before with two hundred dollars her own savings and one hundred dollars from the sale of Tobin s inherited estate a fine cottage and pig on the Bog Shannaugh And since the letter that Tobin got saying that she had started to come to him not a bit of news had he heard or seen of Katie Mahorner Tobin advertised in the papers but nothing could be found of the colleen So to Coney me and Tobin went thinking that a turn at the chutes and the smell of the popcorn might raise the heart in his bosom But Tobin was a hardheaded man and the sadness stuck in his skin He ground his teeth at the crying balloons he cursed the moving pictures and though he would drink whenever asked he scorned Punch and Judy and was for licking the tintype men as they came So I gets him down a side way on a board walk where the attractions were some less violent At a little six by eight stall Tobin halts with a more human look in his eye Tis here says he I will be diverted I ll have the palm of me hand investigated by the wonderful palmist of the Nile and see if what is to be will be Tobin was a believer in signs and the unnatural in nature He possessed illegal convictions in his mind along the subjects of black cats lucky numbers and the weather predictions in the papers We went into the enchanted chicken coop which was fixed mysterious with red cloth and pictures of hands with lines crossing em like a railroad centre The sign over the door says it is Madame Zozo the Egyptian Palmist There was a fat woman inside in a red jumper with pothooks and beasties embroidered upon it Tobin gives her ten cents and extends one of his hands She lifts Tobin s hand which is own brother to the hoof of a drayhorse and examines it to see whether tis a stone in the frog or a cast shoe he has come for Man says this Madame Zozo the line of your fate shows Tis not me foot at all says Tobin interrupting Sure tis no beauty but ye hold the palm of me hand The line shows says the Madame that ye ve not arrived at your time of life without bad luck And there s more to come The mount of Venus or is that a stone bruise shows that ye ve been in love There s been trouble in your life on account of your sweetheart Tis Katie Mahorner she has references with whispers Tobin to me in a loud voice to one side I see says the palmist a great deal of sorrow and tribulation with one whom ye cannot forget I see the lines of designation point to the letter K and the letter M in her name Whist says Tobin to me do ye hear that Look out goes on the palmist for a dark man and a light woman for they ll both bring ye trouble Ye ll make a voyage upon the water very soon and have a financial loss I see one line that brings good luck There s a man coming into your life who will fetch ye good fortune Ye ll know him when ye see him by his crooked nose Is his name set down asks Tobin Twill be convenient in the way of greeting when he backs up to dump off the good luck His name says the palmist thoughtful looking is not spelled out by the lines but they indicate tis a long one and the letter o should be in it There s no more to tell Good evening Don t block up the door Tis wonderful how she knows says Tobin as we walk to the pier As we squeezed through the gates a nigger man sticks his lighted segar against Tobin s ear and there is trouble Tobin hammers his neck and the women squeal and by presence of mind I drag the little man out of the way before the police comes Tobin is always in an ugly mood when enjoying himself On the boat going back when the man calls Who wants the good looking waiter Tobin tried to plead guilty feeling the desire to blow the foam off a crock of suds but when he felt in his pocket he found himself discharged for lack of evidence Somebody had disturbed his change during the commotion So we sat dry upon the stools listening to the Dagoes fiddling on deck If anything Tobin was lower in spirits and less congenial with his misfortunes than when we started On a seat against the railing was a young woman dressed suitable for red automobiles with hair the colour of an unsmoked meerschaum In passing by Tobin kicks her foot without intentions and being polite to ladies when in drink he tries to give his hat a twist while apologising But he knocks it off and the wind carries it overboard Tobin came back and sat down and I began to look out for him for the man s adversities were becoming frequent He was apt when pushed so close by hard luck to kick the best dressed man he could see and try to take command of the boat Presently Tobin grabs my arm and says excited Jawn says he do ye know what we re doing We re taking a voyage upon the water There now says I subdue yeself The boat ll land in ten minutes more Look says he at the light lady upon the bench And have ye forgotten the nigger man that burned me ear And isn t the money I had gone a dollar sixty five it was I thought he was no more than summing up his catastrophes so as to get violent with good excuse as men will do and I tried to make him understand such things was trifles Listen says Tobin Ye ve no ear for the gift of prophecy or the miracles of the inspired What did the palmist lady tell ye out of me hand Tis coming true before your eyes Look out says she for a dark man and a light woman they ll bring ye trouble Have ye forgot the nigger man though he got some of it back from me fist Can ye show me a lighter woman than the blonde lady that was the cause of me hat falling in the water And where s the dollar sixty five I had in me vest when we left the shooting gallery The way Tobin put it it did seem to corroborate the art of prediction though it looked to me that these accidents could happen to any one at Coney without the implication of palmistry Tobin got up and walked around on deck looking close at the passengers out of his little red eyes I asked him the interpretation of his movements Ye never know what Tobin has in his mind until he begins to carry it out Ye should know says he I m working out the salvation promised by the lines in me palm I m looking for the crooked nose man that s to bring the good luck Tis all that will save us Jawn did ye ever see a straighter nosed gang of hellions in the days of your life Twas the nine thirty boat and we landed and walked up town through Twenty second Street Tobin being without his hat On a street corner standing under a gas light and looking over the elevated road at the moon was a man A long man he was dressed decent with a segar between his teeth and I saw that his nose made two twists from bridge to end like the wriggle of a snake Tobin saw it at the same time and I heard him breathe hard like a horse when you take the saddle off He went straight up to the man and I went with him Good night to ye Tobin says to the man The man takes out his segar and passes the compliments sociable Would ye hand us your name asks Tobin and let us look at the size of it It may be our duty to become acquainted with ye My name says the man polite is Friedenhausman Maximus G Friedenhausman Tis the right length says Tobin Do you spell it with an o anywhere down the stretch of it I do not says the man Can ye spell it with an o inquires Tobin turning anxious If your conscience says the man with the nose is indisposed toward foreign idioms ye might to please yourself smuggle the letter into the penultimate syllable Tis well says Tobin Ye re in the presence of Jawn Malone and Daniel Tobin Tis highly appreciated says the man with a bow And now since I cannot conceive that ye would hold a spelling bee upon the street corner will ye name some reasonable excuse for being at large By the two signs answers Tobin trying to explain which ye display according to the reading of the Egyptian palmist from the sole of me hand ye ve been nominated to offset with good luck the lines of trouble leading to the nigger man and the blonde lady with her feet crossed in the boat besides the financial loss of a dollar sixty five all so far fulfilled according to Hoyle The man stopped smoking and looked at me Have ye any amendments he asks to offer to that statement or are ye one too I thought by the looks of ye ye might have him in charge None says I to him except that as one horseshoe resembles another so are ye the picture of good luck as predicted by the hand of me friend If not then the lines of Danny s hand may have been crossed I don t know There s two of ye says the man with the nose looking up and down for the sight of a policeman I ve enjoyed your company immense Good night With that he shoves his segar in his mouth and moves across the street stepping fast But Tobin sticks close to one side of him and me at the other What says he stopping on the opposite sidewalk and pushing back his hat do ye follow me I tell ye he says very loud I m proud to have met ye But it is my desire to be rid of ye I am off to me home Do says Tobin leaning against his sleeve Do be off to your home And I will sit at the door of it till ye come out in the morning For the dependence is upon ye to obviate the curse of the nigger man and the blonde lady and the financial loss of the one sixty five Tis a strange hallucination says the man turning to me as a more reasonable lunatic Hadn t ye better get him home Listen man says I to him Daniel Tobin is as sensible as he ever was Maybe he is a bit deranged on account of having drink enough to disturb but not enough to settle his wits but he is no more than following out the legitimate path of his superstitions and predicaments which I will explain to you With that I relates the facts about the palmist lady and how the finger of suspicion points to him as an instrument of good fortune Now understand I concludes my position in this riot I am the friend of me friend Tobin according to me interpretations Tis easy to be a friend to the prosperous for it pays tis not hard to be a friend to the poor for ye get puffed up by gratitude and have your picture printed standing in front of a tenement with a scuttle of coal and an orphan in each hand But it strains the art of friendship to be true friend to a born fool And that s what I m doing says I for in my opinion there s no fortune to be read from the palm of me hand that wasn t printed there with the handle of a pick And though ye ve got the crookedest nose in New York City I misdoubt that all the fortune tellers doing business could milk good luck from ye But the lines of Danny s hand pointed to ye fair and I ll assist him to experiment with ye until he s convinced ye re dry After that the man turns sudden to laughing He leans against a corner and laughs considerable Then he claps me and Tobin on the backs of us and takes us by an arm apiece Tis my mistake says he How could I be expecting anything so fine and wonderful to be turning the corner upon me I came near being found unworthy Hard by says he is a cafe snug and suitable for the entertainment of idiosyncrasies Let us go there and have drink while we discuss the unavailability of the categorical So saying he marched me and Tobin to the back room of a saloon and ordered the drinks and laid the money on the table He looks at me and Tobin like brothers of his and we have the segars Ye must know says the man of destiny that me walk in life is one that is called the literary I wander abroad be night seeking idiosyncrasies in the masses and truth in the heavens above When ye came upon me I was in contemplation of the elevated road in conjunction with the chief luminary of night The rapid transit is poetry and art the moon but a tedious dry body moving by rote But these are private opinions for in the business of literature the conditions are reversed Tis me hope to be writing a book to explain the strange things I have discovered in life Ye will put me in a book says Tobin disgusted will ye put me in a book 
6895_92806_000016_000002	train-clean-360	I will not 
none	none	says the man for the covers will not hold ye Not yet The best I can do is to enjoy ye meself for the time is not ripe for destroying the limitations of print Ye would look fantastic in type All alone by meself must I drink this cup of joy But I thank ye boys I am truly grateful The talk of ye says Tobin blowing through his moustache and pounding the table with his fist is an eyesore to me patience There was good luck promised out of the crook of your nose but ye bear fruit like the bang of a drum Ye resemble with your noise of books the wind blowing through a crack Sure now I would be thinking the palm of me hand lied but for the coming true of the nigger man and the blonde lady and Whist says the long man would ye be led astray by physiognomy Me nose will do what it can within bounds Let us have these glasses filled again for tis good to keep idiosyncrasies well moistened they being subject to deterioration in a dry moral atmosphere So the man of literature makes good to my notion for he pays cheerful for everything the capital of me and Tobin being exhausted by prediction But Tobin is sore and drinks quiet with the red showing in his eye By and by we moved out for twas eleven o clock and stands a bit upon the sidewalk And then the man says he must be going home and invites me and Tobin to walk that way We arrives on a side street two blocks away where there is a stretch of brick houses with high stoops and iron fences The man stops at one of them and looks up at the top windows which he finds dark Tis me humble dwelling says he and I begin to perceive by the signs that me wife has retired to slumber Therefore I will venture a bit in the way of hospitality Tis me wish that ye enter the basement room where we dine and partake of a reasonable refreshment There will be some fine cold fowl and cheese and a bottle or two of ale Ye will be welcome to enter and eat for I am indebted to ye for diversions The appetite and conscience of me and Tobin was congenial to the proposition though twas sticking hard in Danny s superstitions to think that a few drinks and a cold lunch should represent the good fortune promised by the palm of his hand Step down the steps says the man with the crooked nose and I will enter by the door above and let ye in I will ask the new girl we have in the kitchen says he to make ye a pot of coffee to drink before ye go Tis fine coffee Katie Mahorner makes for a green girl just landed three months Step in says the man and I ll send her down to ye THE GIFT OF THE MAGI One dollar and eighty seven cents That was all And sixty cents of it was in pennies Pennies saved one and two at a time by bulldozing the grocer and the vegetable man and the butcher until one s cheeks burned with the silent imputation of parsimony that such close dealing implied Three times Della counted it One dollar and eighty seven cents And the next day would be Christmas There was clearly nothing to do but flop down on the shabby little couch and howl So Della did it Which instigates the moral reflection that life is made up of sobs sniffles and smiles with sniffles predominating While the mistress of the home is gradually subsiding from the first stage to the second take a look at the home A furnished flat at eight dollars per week It did not exactly beggar description but it certainly had that word on the lookout for the mendicancy squad In the vestibule below was a letter box into which no letter would go and an electric button from which no mortal finger could coax a ring Also appertaining thereunto was a card bearing the name mister James Dillingham Young The Dillingham had been flung to the breeze during a former period of prosperity when its possessor was being paid thirty dollars per week Now when the income was shrunk to twenty dollars the letters of Dillingham looked blurred as though they were thinking seriously of contracting to a modest and unassuming D But whenever mister James Dillingham Young came home and reached his flat above he was called Jim and greatly hugged by missus James Dillingham Young already introduced to you as Della Which is all very good Della finished her cry and attended to her cheeks with the powder rag She stood by the window and looked out dully at a grey cat walking a grey fence in a grey backyard Tomorrow would be Christmas Day and she had only one dollar eighty seven cents with which to buy Jim a present She had been saving every penny she could for months with this result Twenty dollars a week doesn t go far Expenses had been greater than she had calculated They always are Only one dollar eighty seven cents to buy a present for Jim Her Jim Many a happy hour she had spent planning for something nice for him Something fine and rare and sterling something just a little bit near to being worthy of the honour of being owned by Jim There was a pier glass between the windows of the room Perhaps you have seen a pier glass in an eight dollars flat A very thin and very agile person may by observing his reflection in a rapid sequence of longitudinal strips obtain a fairly accurate conception of his looks Della being slender had mastered the art Suddenly she whirled from the window and stood before the glass Her eyes were shining brilliantly but her face had lost its colour within twenty seconds Rapidly she pulled down her hair and let it fall to its full length Now there were two possessions of the James Dillingham Youngs in which they both took a mighty pride One was Jim s gold watch that had been his father s and his grandfather s The other was Della s hair Had the Queen of Sheba lived in the flat across the airshaft Della would have let her hair hang out the window some day to dry just to depreciate Her Majesty s jewels and gifts Had King Solomon been the janitor with all his treasures piled up in the basement Jim would have pulled out his watch every time he passed just to see him pluck at his beard from envy So now Della s beautiful hair fell about her rippling and shining like a cascade of brown waters It reached below her knee and made itself almost a garment for her And then she did it up again nervously and quickly Once she faltered for a minute and stood still while a tear or two splashed on the worn red carpet On went her old brown jacket on went her old brown hat With a whirl of skirts and with the brilliant sparkle still in her eyes she fluttered out the door and down the stairs to the street Where she stopped the sign read Mme Sofronie Hair Goods of All Kinds One flight up Della ran and collected herself panting Madame large too white chilly hardly looked the Sofronie Will you buy my hair asked Della I buy hair said Madame Take yer hat off and let s have a sight at the looks of it Down rippled the brown cascade Twenty dollars said Madame lifting the mass with a practised hand Give it to me quick said Della Oh and the next two hours tripped by on rosy wings Forget the hashed metaphor She was ransacking the stores for Jim s present She found it at last It surely had been made for Jim and no one else There was no other like it in any of the stores and she had turned all of them inside out It was a platinum fob chain simple and chaste in design properly proclaiming its value by substance alone and not by meretricious ornamentation as all good things should do It was even worthy of The Watch As soon as she saw it she knew that it must be Jim s It was like him Quietness and value the description applied to both Twenty one dollars they took from her for it and she hurried home with the eighty seven cents With that chain on his watch Jim might be properly anxious about the time in any company Grand as the watch was he sometimes looked at it on the sly on account of the old leather strap that he used in place of a chain When Della reached home her intoxication gave way a little to prudence and reason She got out her curling irons and lighted the gas and went to work repairing the ravages made by generosity added to love Which is always a tremendous task dear friends a mammoth task Within forty minutes her head was covered with tiny close lying curls that made her look wonderfully like a truant schoolboy She looked at her reflection in the mirror long carefully and critically If Jim doesn t kill me she said to herself before he takes a second look at me he ll say I look like a Coney Island chorus girl But what could I do oh what could I do with a dollar and eighty seven cents At seven o clock the coffee was made and the frying pan was on the back of the stove hot and ready to cook the chops Jim was never late Della doubled the fob chain in her hand and sat on the corner of the table near the door that he always entered Then she heard his step on the stair away down on the first flight and she turned white for just a moment She had a habit for saying little silent prayers about the simplest everyday things and now she whispered Please God make him think I am still pretty The door opened and Jim stepped in and closed it He looked thin and very serious Poor fellow he was only twenty two and to be burdened with a family He needed a new overcoat and he was without gloves Jim stopped inside the door as immovable as a setter at the scent of quail His eyes were fixed upon Della and there was an expression in them that she could not read and it terrified her It was not anger nor surprise nor disapproval nor horror nor any of the sentiments that she had been prepared for He simply stared at her fixedly with that peculiar expression on his face Della wriggled off the table and went for him Jim darling she cried don t look at me that way I had my hair cut off and sold because I couldn t have lived through Christmas without giving you a present It ll grow out again you won t mind will you I just had to do it My hair grows awfully fast Say Merry Christmas Jim and let s be happy You don t know what a nice what a beautiful nice gift I ve got for you You ve cut off your hair asked Jim laboriously as if he had not arrived at that patent fact yet even after the hardest mental labor Cut it off and sold it said Della Don t you like me just as well anyhow I m me without my hair ain t I Jim looked about the room curiously You say your hair is gone he said with an air almost of idiocy You needn t look for it said Della It s sold I tell you sold and gone too It s Christmas Eve boy Be good to me for it went for you Maybe the hairs of my head were numbered she went on with sudden serious sweetness but nobody could ever count my love for you Shall I put the chops on Jim Out of his trance Jim seemed quickly to wake He enfolded his Della For ten seconds let us regard with discreet scrutiny some inconsequential object in the other direction Eight dollars a week or a million a year what is the difference A mathematician or a wit would give you the wrong answer The magi brought valuable gifts but that was not among them This dark assertion will be illuminated later on Jim drew a package from his overcoat pocket and threw it upon the table Don t make any mistake Dell he said about me I don t think there s anything in the way of a haircut or a shave or a shampoo that could make me like my girl any less But if you ll unwrap that package you may see why you had me going a while at first White fingers and nimble tore at the string and paper And then an ecstatic scream of joy and then alas a quick feminine change to hysterical tears and wails necessitating the immediate employment of all the comforting powers of the lord of the flat For there lay The Combs the set of combs side and back that Della had worshipped long in a Broadway window Beautiful combs pure tortoise shell with jewelled rims just the shade to wear in the beautiful vanished hair They were expensive combs she knew and her heart had simply craved and yearned over them without the least hope of possession And now they were hers but the tresses that should have adorned the coveted adornments were gone But she hugged them to her bosom and at length she was able to look up with dim eyes and a smile and say My hair grows so fast Jim And then Della leaped up like a little singed cat and cried Oh oh Jim had not yet seen his beautiful present She held it out to him eagerly upon her open palm The dull precious metal seemed to flash with a reflection of her bright and ardent spirit Isn t it a dandy Jim I hunted all over town to find it You ll have to look at the time a hundred times a day now Give me your watch I want to see how it looks on it Instead of obeying Jim tumbled down on the couch and put his hands under the back of his head and smiled Dell said he let s put our Christmas presents away and keep em a while They re too nice to use just at present I sold the watch to get the money to buy your combs And now suppose you put the chops on The magi as you know were wise men wonderfully wise men who brought gifts to the Babe in the manger They invented the art of giving Christmas presents Being wise their gifts were no doubt wise ones possibly bearing the privilege of exchange in case of duplication And here I have lamely related to you the uneventful chronicle of two foolish children in a flat who most unwisely sacrificed for each other the greatest treasures of their house But in a last word to the wise of these days let it be said that of all who give gifts these two were the wisest Of all who give and receive gifts such as they are wisest Everywhere they are wisest They are the magi A COSMOPOLITE IN A CAFE 
6895_92805_000001_000000	train-clean-360	At midnight the cafe was crowded 
none	none	By some chance the little table at which I sat had escaped the eye of incomers and two vacant chairs at it extended their arms with venal hospitality to the influx of patrons And then a cosmopolite sat in one of them and I was glad for I held a theory that since Adam no true citizen of the world has existed We hear of them and we see foreign labels on much luggage but we find travellers instead of cosmopolites I invoke your consideration of the scene the marble topped tables the range of leather upholstered wall seats the gay company the ladies dressed in demi state toilets speaking in an exquisite visible chorus of taste economy opulence or art the sedulous and largess loving garcons the music wisely catering to all with its raids upon the composers the melange of talk and laughter and if you will the Wuerzburger in the tall glass cones that bend to your lips as a ripe cherry sways on its branch to the beak of a robber jay I was told by a sculptor from Mauch Chunk that the scene was truly Parisian My cosmopolite was named E Rushmore Coglan and he will be heard from next summer at Coney Island He is to establish a new attraction there he informed me offering kingly diversion And then his conversation rang along parallels of latitude and longitude He took the great round world in his hand so to speak familiarly contemptuously and it seemed no larger than the seed of a Maraschino cherry in a table d hote grape fruit

telling you of a cold he acquired in a Chicago lake breeze and how old Escamila cured it in Buenos Ayres with a hot infusion of the chuchula weed You would have addressed a letter to E Rushmore Coglan esquire the Earth Solar System the Universe and have mailed it feeling confident that it would be delivered to him I was sure that I had found at last the one true cosmopolite since Adam and I listened to his worldwide discourse fearful lest I should discover in it the local note of the mere globe trotter But his opinions never fluttered or drooped he was as impartial to cities countries and continents as the winds or gravitation And as E Rushmore Coglan prattled of this little planet I thought with glee of a great almost cosmopolite who wrote for the whole world and dedicated himself to Bombay In a poem he has to say that there is pride and rivalry between the cities of the earth and that the men that breed from them they traffic up and down but cling to their cities hem as a child to the mother s gown And whenever they walk by roaring streets unknown they remember their native city most faithful foolish fond making her mere breathed name their bond upon their bond And my glee was roused because I had caught mister Kipling napping Here I had found a man not made from dust one who had no narrow boasts of birthplace or country one who if he bragged at all would brag of his whole round globe against the Martians and the inhabitants of the Moon Expression on these subjects was precipitated from E Rushmore Coglan by the third corner to our table While Coglan was describing to me the topography along the Siberian Railway the orchestra glided into a medley The concluding air was Dixie and as the exhilarating notes tumbled forth they were almost overpowered by a great clapping of hands from almost every table It is worth a paragraph to say that this remarkable scene can be witnessed every evening in numerous cafes in the City of New York Tons of brew have been consumed over theories to account for it Some have conjectured hastily that all Southerners in town hie themselves to cafes at nightfall This applause of the rebel air in a Northern city does puzzle a little but it is not insolvable The war with Spain many years generous mint and watermelon crops a few long shot winners at the New Orleans race track and the brilliant banquets given by the Indiana and Kansas citizens who compose the North Carolina Society have made the South rather a fad in Manhattan Your manicure will lisp softly that your left forefinger reminds her so much of a gentleman s in Richmond Va Oh certainly but many a lady has to work now the war you know When Dixie was being played a dark haired young man sprang up from somewhere with a Mosby guerrilla yell and waved frantically his soft brimmed hat Then he strayed through the smoke dropped into the vacant chair at our table and pulled out cigarettes The evening was at the period when reserve is thawed One of us mentioned three Wuerzburgers to the waiter the dark haired young man acknowledged his inclusion in the order by a smile and a nod I hastened to ask him a question because I wanted to try out a theory I had Would you mind telling me I began whether you are from The fist of E Rushmore Coglan banged the table and I was jarred into silence Excuse me said he but that s a question I never like to hear asked What does it matter where a man is from Is it fair to judge a man by his post office address Why I ve seen Kentuckians who hated whiskey Virginians who weren t descended from Pocahontas Indianians who hadn t written a novel Mexicans who didn t wear velvet trousers with silver dollars sewed along the seams funny Englishmen spendthrift Yankees cold blooded Southerners narrow minded Westerners and New Yorkers who were too busy to stop for an hour on the street to watch a one armed grocer s clerk do up cranberries in paper bags Let a man be a man and don t handicap him with the label of any section Pardon me I said but my curiosity was not altogether an idle one I know the South and when the band plays Dixie I like to observe I have formed the belief that the man who applauds that air with special violence and ostensible sectional loyalty is invariably a native of either Secaucus N J or the district between Murray Hill Lyceum and the Harlem River this city I was about to put my opinion to the test by inquiring of this gentleman when you interrupted with your own larger theory I must confess And now the dark haired young man spoke to me and it became evident that his mind also moved along its own set of grooves I should like to be a periwinkle said he mysteriously on the top of a valley and sing tooralloo ralloo This was clearly too obscure so I turned again to Coglan I ve been around the world twelve times said he

6895_92806_000054_000000	train-clean-360	 By the deported snakes he exclaimed Jawn McCaskey and his lady have been fightin for an hour and a quarter by the watch 
none	none	The missis could give him forty pounds weight Strength to his arm Policeman Cleary strolled back around the corner Old man Denny folded his paper and hurried up the steps just as missus Murphy was about to lock the door for the night THE SKYLIGHT ROOM First missus Parker would show you the double parlours You would not dare to interrupt her description of their advantages and of the merits of the gentleman who had occupied them for eight years Then you would manage to stammer forth the confession that you were neither a doctor nor a dentist missus Parker s manner of receiving the admission was such that you could never afterward entertain the same feeling toward your parents who had neglected to train you up in one of the professions that fitted missus Parker s parlours Next you ascended one flight of stairs and looked at the second floor back at eight dollars Convinced by her second floor manner that it was worth the twelve dollars that mister Toosenberry always paid for it until he left to take charge of his brother s orange plantation in Florida near Palm Beach where missus McIntyre always spent the winters that had the double front room with private bath you managed to babble that you wanted something still cheaper If you survived missus Parker s scorn you were taken to look at mister Skidder s large hall room on the third floor mister Skidder s room was not vacant He wrote plays and smoked cigarettes in it all day long But every room hunter was made to visit his room to admire the lambrequins After each visit mister Skidder from the fright caused by possible eviction would pay something on his rent Then oh then if you still stood on one foot with your hot hand clutching the three moist dollars in your pocket and hoarsely proclaimed your hideous and culpable poverty nevermore would missus Parker be cicerone of yours She would honk loudly the word Clara she would show you her back and march downstairs Then Clara the coloured maid would escort you up the carpeted ladder that served for the fourth flight and show you the Skylight Room It occupied sevenxeight feet of floor space at the middle of the hall On each side of it was a dark lumber closet or storeroom In it was an iron cot a washstand and a chair A shelf was the dresser Its four bare walls seemed to close in upon you like the sides of a coffin Your hand crept to your throat you gasped you looked up as from a well and breathed once more Through the glass of the little skylight you saw a square of blue infinity Two dollars suh Clara would say in her half contemptuous half Tuskegeenial tones One day Miss Leeson came hunting for a room She carried a typewriter made to be lugged around by a much larger lady She was a very little girl with eyes and hair that had kept on growing after she had stopped and that always looked as if they were saying Goodness me Why didn t you keep up with us missus Parker showed her the double parlours In this closet she said one could keep a skeleton or anaesthetic or coal But I am neither a doctor nor a dentist said Miss Leeson with a shiver missus Parker gave her the incredulous pitying sneering icy stare that she kept for those who failed to qualify as doctors or dentists and led the way to the second floor back Eight dollars said Miss Leeson Dear me I m not Hetty if I do look green I m just a poor little working girl Show me something higher and lower mister Skidder jumped and strewed the floor with cigarette stubs at the rap on his door Excuse me mister Skidder said missus Parker with her demon s smile at his pale looks I didn t know you were in I asked the lady to have a look at your lambrequins They re too lovely for anything said Miss Leeson smiling in exactly the way the angels do After they had gone mister Skidder got very busy erasing the tall black haired heroine from his latest unproduced play and inserting a small roguish one with heavy bright hair and vivacious features Anna Held ll jump at it said mister Skidder to himself putting his feet up against the lambrequins and disappearing in a cloud of smoke like an aerial cuttlefish Presently the tocsin call of Clara sounded to the world the state of Miss Leeson s purse A dark goblin seized her mounted a Stygian stairway thrust her into a vault with a glimmer of light in its top and muttered the menacing and cabalistic words Two dollars I ll take it sighed Miss Leeson sinking down upon the squeaky iron bed Every day Miss Leeson went out to work At night she brought home papers with handwriting on them and made copies with her typewriter Sometimes she had no work at night and then she would sit on the steps of the high stoop with the other roomers Miss Leeson was not intended for a sky light room when the plans were drawn for her creation She was gay hearted and full of tender whimsical fancies Once she let mister Skidder read to her three acts of his great unpublished comedy It s No Kid or The Heir of the Subway There was rejoicing among the gentlemen roomers whenever Miss Leeson had time to sit on the steps for an hour or two But Miss Longnecker the tall blonde who taught in a public school and said Well really to everything you said sat on the top step and sniffed And Miss Dorn who shot at the moving ducks at Coney every Sunday and worked in a department store sat on the bottom step and sniffed Miss Leeson sat on the middle step and the men would quickly group around her Especially mister Skidder who had cast her in his mind for the star part in a private romantic unspoken drama in real life And especially mister Hoover who was forty five fat flush and foolish And especially very young mister Evans who set up a hollow cough to induce her to ask him to leave off cigarettes The men voted her the funniest and jolliest ever but the sniffs on the top step and the lower step were implacable I pray you let the drama halt while Chorus stalks to the footlights and drops an epicedian tear upon the fatness of mister Hoover Tune the pipes to the tragedy of tallow the bane of bulk the calamity of corpulence Tried out Falstaff might have rendered more romance to the ton than would have Romeo s rickety ribs to the ounce A lover may sigh but he must not puff To the train of Momus are the fat men remanded In vain beats the faithfullest heart above a fifty two inch belt Avaunt Hoover Hoover forty five flush and foolish might carry off Helen herself Hoover forty five flush foolish and fat is meat for perdition There was never a chance for you Hoover As missus Parker s roomers sat thus one summer s evening Miss Leeson looked up into the firmament and cried with her little gay laugh Why there s Billy Jackson I can see him from down here too All looked up some at the windows of skyscrapers some casting about for an airship Jackson guided It s that star explained Miss Leeson pointing with a tiny finger Not the big one that twinkles the steady blue one near it I can see it every night through my skylight I named it Billy Jackson Well really said Miss Longnecker I didn t know you were an astronomer Miss Leeson Oh yes said the small star gazer I know as much as any of them about the style of sleeves they re going to wear next fall in Mars Well really said Miss Longnecker The star you refer to is Gamma of the constellation Cassiopeia It is nearly of the second magnitude and its meridian passage is Oh said the very young mister Evans I think Billy Jackson is a much better name for it Same here said mister Hoover loudly breathing defiance to Miss Longnecker I think Miss Leeson has just as much right to name stars as any of those old astrologers had Well really said Miss Longnecker I wonder whether it s a shooting star remarked Miss Dorn I hit nine ducks and a rabbit out of ten in the gallery at Coney Sunday He doesn t show up very well from down here said Miss Leeson You ought to see him from my room You know you can see stars even in the daytime from the bottom of a well At night my room is like the shaft of a coal mine and it makes Billy Jackson look like the big diamond pin that Night fastens her kimono with There came a time after that when Miss Leeson brought no formidable papers home to copy And when she went out in the morning instead of working she went from office to office and let her heart melt away in the drip of cold refusals transmitted through insolent office boys This went on There came an evening when she wearily climbed missus Parker s stoop at the hour when she always returned from her dinner at the restaurant But she had had no dinner As she stepped into the hall mister Hoover met her and seized his chance He asked her to marry him and his fatness hovered above her like an avalanche She dodged and caught the balustrade He tried for her hand and she raised it and smote him weakly in the face Step by step she went up dragging herself by the railing She passed mister Skidder s door as he was red inking a stage direction for Myrtle Delorme Miss Leeson in his unaccepted comedy to pirouette across stage from L to the side of the Count Up the carpeted ladder she crawled at last and opened the door of the skylight room She was too weak to light the lamp or to undress She fell upon the iron cot her fragile body scarcely hollowing the worn springs And in that Erebus of the skylight room she slowly raised her heavy eyelids and smiled For Billy Jackson was shining down on her calm and bright and constant through the skylight There was no world about her She was sunk in a pit of blackness with but that small square of pallid light framing the star that she had so whimsically and oh so ineffectually named Miss Longnecker must be right it was Gamma of the constellation Cassiopeia and not Billy Jackson And yet she could not let it be Gamma As she lay on her back she tried twice to raise her arm The third time she got two thin fingers to her lips and blew a kiss out of the black pit to Billy Jackson Her arm fell back limply Good bye Billy she murmured faintly You re millions of miles away and you won t even twinkle once But you kept where I could see you most of the time up there when there wasn t anything else but darkness to look at didn t you Millions of miles Good bye Billy Jackson Clara the coloured maid found the door locked at ten the next day and they forced it open Vinegar and the slapping of wrists and burnt feathers proving of no avail some one ran to phone for an ambulance In due time it backed up to the door with much gong clanging and the capable young medico in his white linen coat ready active confident with his smooth face half debonair half grim danced up the steps Ambulance call to forty nine he said briefly What s the trouble Oh yes doctor sniffed missus Parker as though her trouble that there should be trouble in the house was the greater I can t think what can be the matter with her Nothing we could do would bring her to It s a young woman a Miss Elsie yes a Miss Elsie Leeson Never before in my house What room cried the doctor in a terrible voice to which missus Parker was a stranger The skylight room It Evidently the ambulance doctor was familiar with the location of skylight rooms He was gone up the stairs four at a time missus Parker followed slowly as her dignity demanded On the first landing she met him coming back bearing the astronomer in his arms He stopped and let loose the practised scalpel of his tongue not loudly Gradually missus Parker crumpled as a stiff garment that slips down from a nail Ever afterward there remained crumples in her mind and body Sometimes her curious roomers would ask her what the doctor said to her Let that be she would answer If I can get forgiveness for having heard it I will be satisfied The ambulance physician strode with his burden through the pack of hounds that follow the curiosity chase and even they fell back along the sidewalk abashed for his face was that of one who bears his own dead They noticed that he did not lay down upon the bed prepared for it in the ambulance the form that he carried and all that he said was Drive like h l Wilson to the driver That is all Is it a story In the next morning s paper I saw a little news item and the last sentence of it may help you as it helped me to weld the incidents together It recounted the reception into Bellevue Hospital of a young woman who had been removed from No forty nine East street suffering from debility induced by starvation It concluded with these words doctor William Jackson the ambulance physician who attended the case says the patient will recover A SERVICE OF LOVE When one loves one s Art no service seems too hard That is our premise This story shall draw a conclusion from it and show at the same time that the premise is incorrect That will be a new thing in logic and a feat in story telling somewhat older than the great wall of China Joe Larrabee came out of the post oak flats of the Middle West pulsing with a genius for pictorial art At six he drew a picture of the town pump with a prominent citizen passing it hastily This effort was framed and hung in the drug store window by the side of the ear of corn with an uneven number of rows At twenty he left for New York with a flowing necktie and a capital tied up somewhat closer Delia Caruthers did things in six octaves so promisingly in a pine tree village in the South that her relatives chipped in enough in her chip hat for her to go North and finish They could not see her f but that is our story Joe and Delia met in an atelier where a number of art and music students had gathered to discuss chiaroscuro Wagner music Rembrandt s works pictures Waldteufel wall paper Chopin and Oolong Joe and Delia became enamoured one of the other or each of the other as you please and in a short time were married for see above when one loves one s Art no service seems too hard mister and missus Larrabee began housekeeping in a flat It was a lonesome flat something like the A sharp way down at the left hand end of the keyboard And they were happy for they had their Art and they had each other And my advice to the rich young man would be sell all thou hast and give it to the poor janitor for the privilege of living in a flat with your Art and your Delia Flat dwellers shall indorse my dictum that theirs is the only true happiness If a home is happy it cannot fit too close let the dresser collapse and become a billiard table let the mantel turn to a rowing machine the escritoire to a spare bedchamber the washstand to an upright piano let the four walls come together if they will so you and your Delia are between But if home be the other kind let it be wide and long enter you at the Golden Gate hang your hat on Hatteras your cape on Cape Horn and go out by the Labrador Joe was painting in the class of the great Magister you know his fame His fees are high his lessons are light his high lights have brought him renown Delia was studying under Rosenstock you know his repute as a disturber of the piano keys They were mighty happy as long as their money lasted So is every but I will not be cynical Their aims were very clear and defined Joe was to become capable very soon of turning out pictures that old gentlemen with thin side whiskers and thick pocketbooks would sandbag one another in his studio for the privilege of buying Delia was to become familiar and then contemptuous with Music so that when she saw the orchestra seats and boxes unsold she could have sore throat and lobster in a private dining room and refuse to go on the stage But the best in my opinion was the home life in the little flat the ardent voluble chats after the day s study the cozy dinners and fresh light breakfasts the interchange of ambitions ambitions interwoven each with the other s or else inconsiderable the mutual help and inspiration and overlook my artlessness stuffed olives and cheese sandwiches at eleven p m But after a while Art flagged It sometimes does even if some switchman doesn t flag it Everything going out and nothing coming in as the vulgarians say Money was lacking to pay mister Magister and Herr Rosenstock their prices When one loves one s Art no service seems too hard So Delia said she must give music lessons to keep the chafing dish bubbling For two or three days she went out canvassing for pupils One evening she came home elated Joe dear she said gleefully I ve a pupil And oh the loveliest people General General A B Pinkney s daughter on Seventy first street Such a splendid house Joe you ought to see the front door Byzantine I think you would call it And inside Oh Joe I never saw anything like it before My pupil is his daughter Clementina I dearly love her already She s a delicate thing dresses always in white and the sweetest simplest manners Only eighteen years old I m to give three lessons a week and just think Joe five dollars a lesson I don t mind it a bit for when I get two or three more pupils I can resume my lessons with Herr Rosenstock Now smooth out that wrinkle between your brows dear and let s have a nice supper That s all right for you Dele said Joe attacking a can of peas with a carving knife and a hatchet but how about me Do you think I m going to let you hustle for wages while I philander in the regions of high art Not by the bones of Benvenuto Cellini I guess I can sell papers or lay cobblestones and bring in a dollar or two Delia came and hung about his neck Joe dear you are silly You must keep on at your studies It is not as if I had quit my music and gone to work at something else While I teach I learn I am always with my music And we can live as happily as millionaires on fifteen dollars a week You mustn t think of leaving mister Magister All right said Joe reaching for the blue scalloped vegetable dish But I hate for you to be giving lessons It isn t Art But you re a trump and a dear to do it When one loves one s Art no service seems too hard said Delia Magister praised the sky in that sketch I made in the park said Joe And Tinkle gave me permission to hang two of them in his window I may sell one if the right kind of a moneyed idiot sees them I m sure you will said Delia sweetly And now let s be thankful for general Pinkney and this veal roast During all of the next week the Larrabees had an early breakfast Joe was enthusiastic about some morning effect sketches he was doing in Central Park and Delia packed him off breakfasted coddled praised and kissed at seven o clock Art is an engaging mistress It was most times seven o clock when he returned in the evening At the end of the week Delia sweetly proud but languid triumphantly tossed three five dollar bills on the eightxten inches centre table of the eightxten feet flat parlour Sometimes she said a little wearily Clementina tries me I m afraid she doesn t practise enough and I have to tell her the same things so often And then she always dresses entirely in white and that does get monotonous But general Pinkney is the dearest old man I wish you could know him Joe He comes in sometimes when I am with Clementina at the piano he is a widower you know and stands there pulling his white goatee And how are the semiquavers and the demisemiquavers progressing he always asks I wish you could see the wainscoting in that drawing room Joe And those Astrakhan rug portieres And Clementina has such a funny little cough I hope she is stronger than she looks Oh I really am getting attached to her she is so gentle and high bred general Pinkney s brother was once Minister to Bolivia And then Joe with the air of a Monte Cristo drew forth a ten a five a two and a one all legal tender notes and laid them beside Delia s earnings Sold that watercolour of the obelisk to a man from Peoria he announced overwhelmingly Don t joke with me said Delia not from Peoria All the way I wish you could see him Dele Fat man with a woollen muffler and a quill toothpick He saw the sketch in Tinkle s window and thought it was a windmill at first He was game though and bought it anyhow He ordered another an oil sketch of the Lackawanna freight depot to take back with him Music lessons Oh I guess Art is still in it I m so glad you ve kept on said Delia heartily You re bound to win dear Thirty three dollars We never had so much to spend before We ll have oysters to night And filet mignon with champignons said Joe Where is the olive fork On the next Saturday evening Joe reached home first He spread his eighteen dollars on the parlour table and washed what seemed to be a great deal of dark paint from his hands Half an hour later Delia arrived her right hand tied up in a shapeless bundle of wraps and bandages How is this asked Joe after the usual greetings Delia laughed but not very joyously Clementina she explained insisted upon a Welsh rabbit after her lesson She is such a queer girl Welsh rabbits at five in the afternoon The General was there You should have seen him run for the chafing dish Joe just as if there wasn t a servant in the house I know Clementina isn t in good health she is so nervous In serving the rabbit she spilled a great lot of it boiling hot over my hand and wrist It hurt awfully Joe And the dear girl was so sorry But general Pinkney Joe that old man nearly went distracted He rushed downstairs and sent somebody they said the furnace man or somebody in the basement out to a drug store for some oil and things to bind it up with It doesn t hurt so much now What s this asked Joe taking the hand tenderly and pulling at some white strands beneath the bandages It s something soft said Delia that had oil on it Oh Joe did you sell another sketch She had seen the money on the table Did I said Joe just ask the man from Peoria He got his depot to day and he isn t sure but he thinks he wants another parkscape and a view on the Hudson What time this afternoon did you burn your hand Dele Five o clock I think said Dele plaintively The iron I mean the rabbit came off the fire about that time You ought to have seen general Pinkney Joe when Sit down here a moment Dele said Joe He drew her to the couch sat beside her and put his arm across her shoulders What have you been doing for the last two weeks Dele he asked She braved it for a moment or two with an eye full of love and stubbornness and murmured a phrase or two vaguely of general Pinkney but at length down went her head and out came the truth and tears I couldn t get any pupils she confessed And I couldn t bear to have you give up your lessons and I got a place ironing shirts in that big Twenty fourth street laundry And I think I did very well to make up both General Pinkney and Clementina don t you Joe And when a girl in the laundry set down a hot iron on my hand this afternoon I was all the way home making up that story about the Welsh rabbit You re not angry are you Joe And if I hadn t got the work you mightn t have sold your sketches to that man from Peoria He wasn t from Peoria said Joe slowly Well it doesn t matter where he was from How clever you are Joe and kiss me Joe and what made you ever suspect that I wasn t giving music lessons to Clementina I didn t said Joe until to night And I wouldn t have then only I sent up this cotton waste and oil from the engine room this afternoon for a girl upstairs who had her hand burned with a smoothing iron I ve been firing the engine in that laundry for the last two weeks And then you didn t My purchaser from Peoria said Joe and general Pinkney are both creations of the same art but you wouldn t call it either painting or music And then they both laughed and Joe began When one loves one s Art no service seems But Delia stopped him with her hand on his lips No she said just When one loves THE COMING OUT OF MAGGIE Every Saturday night the Clover Leaf Social Club gave a hop in the hall of the Give and Take Athletic Association on the East Side In order to attend one of these dances you must be a member of the Give and Take or if you belong to the division that starts off with the right foot in waltzing you must work in Rhinegold s paper box factory Still any Clover Leaf was privileged to escort or be escorted by an outsider to a single dance But mostly each Give and Take brought the paper box girl that he affected and few strangers could boast of having shaken a foot at the regular hops Maggie Toole on account of her dull eyes broad mouth and left handed style of footwork in the two step went to the dances with Anna McCarty and her fellow Anna and Maggie worked side by side in the factory and were the greatest chums ever So Anna always made Jimmy Burns take her by Maggie s house every Saturday night so that her friend could go to the dance with them The Give and Take Athletic Association lived up to its name The hall of the association in Orchard street was fitted out with muscle making inventions With the fibres thus builded up the members were wont to engage the police and rival social and athletic organisations in joyous combat Between these more serious occupations the Saturday night hop with the paper box factory girls came as a refining influence and as an efficient screen For sometimes the tip went round and if you were among the elect that tiptoed up the dark back stairway you might see as neat and satisfying a little welter weight affair to a finish as ever happened inside the ropes On Saturdays Rhinegold s paper box factory closed at three P M On one such afternoon Anna and Maggie walked homeward together At Maggie s door Anna said as usual Be ready at seven sharp Mag and Jimmy and me ll come by for you But what was this Instead of the customary humble and grateful thanks from the non escorted one there was to be perceived a high poised head a prideful dimpling at the corners of a broad mouth and almost a sparkle in a dull brown eye Thanks Anna said Maggie but you and Jimmy needn t bother to night I ve a gentleman friend that s coming round to escort me to the hop The comely Anna pounced upon her friend shook her chided and beseeched her Maggie Toole catch a fellow Plain dear loyal unattractive Maggie so sweet as a chum so unsought for a two step or a moonlit bench in the little park How was it When did it happen Who was it You ll see to night said Maggie flushed with the wine of the first grapes she had gathered in Cupid s vineyard He s swell all right He s two inches taller than Jimmy and an up to date dresser I ll introduce him Anna just as soon as we get to the hall Anna and Jimmy were among the first Clover Leafs to arrive that evening Anna s eyes were brightly fixed upon the door of the hall to catch the first glimpse of her friend s catch At eight thirty Miss Toole swept into the hall with her escort Quickly her triumphant eye discovered her chum under the wing of her faithful Jimmy Oh gee cried Anna Mag ain t made a hit oh no Swell fellow well I guess Style Look at um Go as far as you like said Jimmy with sandpaper in his voice Cop him out if you want him These new guys always win out with the push Don t mind me He don t squeeze all the limes I guess Huh Shut up Jimmy You know what I mean I m glad for Mag First fellow she ever had Oh here they come Across the floor Maggie sailed like a coquettish yacht convoyed by a stately cruiser And truly her companion justified the encomiums of the faithful chum He stood two inches taller than the average Give and Take athlete his dark hair curled his eyes and his teeth flashed whenever he bestowed his frequent smiles The young men of the Clover Leaf Club pinned not their faith to the graces of person as much as they did to its prowess its achievements in hand to hand conflicts and its preservation from the legal duress that constantly menaced it The member of the association who would bind a paper box maiden to his conquering chariot scorned to employ Beau Brummel airs They were not considered honourable methods of warfare The swelling biceps the coat straining at its buttons over the chest the air of conscious conviction of the supereminence of the male in the cosmogony of creation even a calm display of bow legs as subduing and enchanting agents in the gentle tourneys of Cupid these were the approved arms and ammunition of the Clover Leaf gallants They viewed then genuflexions and alluring poses of this visitor with their chins at a new angle A friend of mine mister Terry O Sullivan was Maggie s formula of introduction She led him around the room presenting him to each new arriving Clover Leaf Almost was she pretty now with the unique luminosity in her eyes that comes to a girl with her first suitor and a kitten with its first mouse Maggie Toole s got a fellow at last was the word that went round among the paper box girls Pipe Mag s floor walker thus the Give and Takes expressed their indifferent contempt Usually at the weekly hops Maggie kept a spot on the wall warm with her back She felt and showed so much gratitude whenever a self sacrificing partner invited her to dance that his pleasure was cheapened and diminished She had even grown used to noticing Anna joggle the reluctant Jimmy with her elbow as a signal for him to invite her chum to walk over his feet through a two step But to night the pumpkin had turned to a coach and six Terry O Sullivan was a victorious Prince Charming and Maggie Toole winged her first butterfly flight And though our tropes of fairyland be mixed with those of entomology they shall not spill one drop of ambrosia from the rose crowned melody of Maggie s one perfect night The girls besieged her for introductions to her fellow The Clover Leaf young men after two years of blindness suddenly perceived charms in Miss Toole They flexed their compelling muscles before her and bespoke her for the dance Thus she scored but to Terry O Sullivan the honours of the evening fell thick and fast He shook his curls he smiled and went easily through the seven motions for acquiring grace in your own room before an open window ten minutes each day He danced like a faun he introduced manner and style and atmosphere his words came trippingly upon his tongue and he waltzed twice in succession with the paper box girl that Dempsey Donovan brought Dempsey was the leader of the association He wore a dress suit and could chin the bar twice with one hand He was one of Big Mike O Sullivan s lieutenants and was never troubled by trouble No cop dared to arrest him Whenever he broke a pushcart man s head or shot a member of the Heinrick B Sweeney Outing and Literary Association in the kneecap an officer would drop around and say The Cap n d like to see ye a few minutes round to the office whin ye have time Dempsey me boy But there would be sundry gentlemen there with large gold fob chains and black cigars and somebody would tell a funny story and then Dempsey would go back and work half an hour with the six pound dumbbells So doing a tight rope act on a wire stretched across Niagara was a safe terpsichorean performance compared with waltzing twice with Dempsey Donovan s paper box girl At ten o clock the jolly round face of Big Mike O Sullivan shone at the door for five minutes upon the scene He always looked in for five minutes smiled at the girls and handed out real perfectos to the delighted boys Dempsey Donovan was at his elbow instantly talking rapidly Big Mike looked carefully at the dancers smiled shook his head and departed The music stopped The dancers scattered to the chairs along the walls Terry O Sullivan with his entrancing bow relinquished a pretty girl in blue to her partner and started back to find Maggie Dempsey intercepted him in the middle of the floor Some fine instinct that Rome must have bequeathed to us caused nearly every one to turn and look at them there was a subtle feeling that two gladiators had met in the arena Two or three Give and Takes with tight coat sleeves drew nearer One moment mister O Sullivan said Dempsey I hope you re enjoying yourself Where did you say you live The two gladiators were well matched Dempsey had perhaps ten pounds of weight to give away The O Sullivan had breadth with quickness Dempsey had a glacial eye a dominating slit of a mouth an indestructible jaw a complexion like a belle s and the coolness of a champion The visitor showed more fire in his contempt and less control over his conspicuous sneer They were enemies by the law written when the rocks were molten They were each too splendid too mighty too incomparable to divide pre eminence One only must survive I live on Grand said O Sullivan insolently and no trouble to find me at home Where do you live Dempsey ignored the question You say your name s O Sullivan he went on Well Big Mike says he never saw you before Lots of things he never saw said the favourite of the hop As a rule went on Dempsey huskily sweet O Sullivans in this district know one another You escorted one of our lady members here and we want a chance to make good If you ve got a family tree let s see a few historical O Sullivan buds come out on it Or do you want us to dig it out of you by the roots Suppose you mind your own business suggested O Sullivan blandly Dempsey s eye brightened He held up an inspired forefinger as though a brilliant idea had struck him I ve got it now he said cordially It was just a little mistake You ain t no O Sullivan You are a ring tailed monkey Excuse us for not recognising you at first O Sullivan s eye flashed He made a quick movement but Andy Geoghan was ready and caught his arm Dempsey nodded at Andy and William McMahan the secretary of the club and walked rapidly toward a door at the rear of the hall Two other members of the Give and Take Association swiftly joined the little group Terry O Sullivan was now in the hands of the Board of Rules and Social Referees They spoke to him briefly and softly and conducted him out through the same door at the rear This movement on the part of the Clover Leaf members requires a word of elucidation Back of the association hall was a smaller room rented by the club In this room personal difficulties that arose on the ballroom floor were settled man to man with the weapons of nature under the supervision of the board No lady could say that she had witnessed a fight at a Clover Leaf hop in several years Its gentlemen members guaranteed that So easily and smoothly had Dempsey and the board done their preliminary work that many in the hall had not noticed the checking of the fascinating O Sullivan s social triumph Among these was Maggie She looked about for her escort Smoke up said Rose Cassidy Wasn t you on Demps Donovan picked a scrap with your Lizzie boy and they ve waltzed out to the slaughter room with him How s my hair look done up this way Mag Maggie laid a hand on the bosom of her cheesecloth waist Gone to fight with Dempsey she said breathlessly They ve got to be stopped Dempsey Donovan can t fight him Why he ll he ll kill him Ah what do you care said Rosa Don t some of em fight every hop But Maggie was off darting her zig zag way through the maze of dancers She burst through the rear door into the dark hall and then threw her solid shoulder against the door of the room of single combat It gave way and in the instant that she entered her eye caught the scene the Board standing about with open watches Dempsey Donovan in his shirt sleeves dancing light footed with the wary grace of the modern pugilist within easy reach of his adversary Terry O Sullivan standing with arms folded and a murderous look in his dark eyes And without slacking the speed of her entrance she leaped forward with a scream leaped in time to catch and hang upon the arm of O Sullivan that was suddenly uplifted and to whisk from it the long bright stiletto that he had drawn from his bosom The knife fell and rang upon the floor Cold steel drawn in the rooms of the Give and Take Association Such a thing had never happened before Every one stood motionless for a minute Andy Geoghan kicked the stiletto with the toe of his shoe curiously like an antiquarian who has come upon some ancient weapon unknown to his learning And then O Sullivan hissed something unintelligible between his teeth Dempsey and the board exchanged looks And then Dempsey looked at O Sullivan without anger as one looks at a stray dog and nodded his head in the direction of the door The back stairs Giuseppi he said briefly Somebody ll pitch your hat down after you Maggie walked up to Dempsey Donovan There was a brilliant spot of red in her cheeks down which slow tears were running But she looked him bravely in the eye I knew it Dempsey she said as her eyes grew dull even in their tears I knew he was a Guinea His name s Tony Spinelli I hurried in when they told me you and him was scrappin Them Guineas always carries knives But you don t understand Dempsey I never had a fellow in my life I got tired of comin with Anna and Jimmy every night so I fixed it with him to call himself O Sullivan and brought him along I knew there d be nothin doin for him if he came as a Dago I guess I ll resign from the club now Dempsey turned to Andy Geoghan Chuck that cheese slicer out of the window he said and tell em inside that mister O Sullivan has had a telephone message to go down to Tammany Hall And then he turned back to Maggie Say Mag he said I ll see you home And how about next Saturday night Will you come to the hop with me if I call around for you It was remarkable how quickly Maggie s eyes could change from dull to a shining brown With you Dempsey she stammered Say will a duck swim MAN ABOUT TOWN There were two or three things that I wanted to know I do not care about a mystery So I began to inquire It took me two weeks to find out what women carry in dress suit cases And then I began to ask why a mattress is made in two pieces This serious query was at first received with suspicion because it sounded like a conundrum I was at last assured that its double form of construction was designed to make lighter the burden of woman who makes up beds I was so foolish as to persist begging to know why then they were not made in two equal pieces whereupon I was shunned The third draught that I craved from the fount of knowledge was enlightenment concerning the character known as A Man About Town He was more vague in my mind than a type should be We must have a concrete idea of anything even if it be an imaginary idea before we can comprehend it Now I have a mental picture of John Doe that is as clear as a steel engraving His eyes are weak blue he wears a brown vest and a shiny black serge coat He stands always in the sunshine chewing something and he keeps half shutting his pocket knife and opening it again with his thumb And if the Man Higher Up is ever found take my assurance for it he will be a large pale man with blue wristlets showing under his cuffs and he will be sitting to have his shoes polished within sound of a bowling alley and there will be somewhere about him turquoises But the canvas of my imagination when it came to limning the Man About Town was blank I fancied that he had a detachable sneer like the smile of the Cheshire cat and attached cuffs and that was all Whereupon I asked a newspaper reporter about him Why said he a Man About Town something between a rounder and a clubman He isn t exactly well he fits in between missus Fish s receptions and private boxing bouts He doesn t well he doesn t belong either to the Lotos Club or to the Jerry McGeogheghan Galvanised Iron Workers Apprentices Left Hook Chowder Association I don t exactly know how to describe him to you You ll see him everywhere there s anything doing Yes I suppose he s a type Dress clothes every evening knows the ropes calls every policeman and waiter in town by their first names No he never travels with the hydrogen derivatives You generally see him alone or with another man My friend the reporter left me and I wandered further afield By this time the three thousand one hundred twenty six electric lights on the Rialto were alight People passed but they held me not Paphian eyes rayed upon me and left me unscathed Diners heimgangers shop girls confidence men panhandlers actors highwaymen millionaires and outlanders hurried skipped strolled sneaked swaggered and scurried by me but I took no note of them I knew them all I had read their hearts they had served I wanted my Man About Town He was a type and to drop him would be an error a typograph but no let us continue Let us continue with a moral digression To see a family reading the Sunday paper gratifies The sections have been separated Papa is earnestly scanning the page that pictures the young lady exercising before an open window and bending but there there Mamma is interested in trying to guess the missing letters in the word N w Yo k The oldest girls are eagerly perusing the financial reports for a certain young man remarked last Sunday night that he had taken a flyer in Q X Z Willie the eighteen year old son who attends the New York public school is absorbed in the weekly article describing how to make over an old skirt for he hopes to take a prize in sewing on graduation day Grandma is holding to the comic supplement with a two hours grip and little Tottie the baby is rocking along the best she can with the real estate transfers This view is intended to be reassuring for it is desirable that a few lines of this story be skipped For it introduces strong drink I went into a cafe to and while it was being mixed I asked the man who grabs up your hot Scotch spoon as soon as you lay it down what he understood by the term epithet description designation characterisation or appellation viz a Man About Town Why said he carefully it means a fly guy that s wise to the all night push see It s a hot sport that you can t bump to the rail anywhere between the Flatirons see I guess that s about what it means I thanked him and departed On the sidewalk a Salvation lassie shook her contribution receptacle gently against my waistcoat pocket Would you mind telling me I asked her if you ever meet with the character commonly denominated as A Man About Town during your daily wanderings I think I know whom you mean she answered with a gentle smile We see them in the same places night after night They are the devil s body guard and if the soldiers of any army are as faithful as they are their commanders are well served We go among them diverting a few pennies from their wickedness to the Lord s service She shook the box again and I dropped a dime into it In front of a glittering hotel a friend of mine a critic was climbing from a cab He seemed at leisure and I put my question to him He answered me conscientiously as I was sure he would There is a type of Man About Town in New York he answered The term is quite familiar to me but I don t think I was ever called upon to define the character before It would be difficult to point you out an exact specimen I would say offhand that it is a man who had a hopeless case of the peculiar New York disease of wanting to see and know At six o clock each day life begins with him He follows rigidly the conventions of dress and manners but in the business of poking his nose into places where he does not belong he could give pointers to a civet cat or a jackdaw He is the man who has chased Bohemia about the town from rathskeller to roof garden and from Hester street to Harlem until you can t find a place in the city where they don t cut their spaghetti with a knife Your Man About Town has done that He is always on the scent of something new He is curiosity impudence and omnipresence Hansoms were made for him and gold banded cigars and the curse of music at dinner There are not so many of him but his minority report is adopted everywhere I m glad you brought up the subject I ve felt the influence of this nocturnal blight upon our city but I never thought to analyse it before I can see now that your Man About Town should have been classified long ago In his wake spring up wine agents and cloak models and the orchestra plays Let s All Go Up to Maud s for him by request instead of Haendel He makes his rounds every evening while you and I see the elephant once a week When the cigar store is raided he winks at the officer familiar with his ground and walks away immune while you and I search among the Presidents for names and among the stars for addresses to give the desk sergeant My friend the critic paused to acquire breath for fresh eloquence I seized my advantage You have classified him I cried with joy You have painted his portrait in the gallery of city types But I must meet one face to face I must study the Man About Town at first hand Where shall I find him How shall I know him Without seeming to hear me the critic went on And his cab driver was waiting for his fare too He is the sublimated essence of Butt in the refined intrinsic extract of Rubber the concentrated purified irrefutable unavoidable spirit of Curiosity and Inquisitiveness A new sensation is the breath in his nostrils when his experience is exhausted he explores new fields with the indefatigability of a Excuse me I interrupted but can you produce one of this type It is a new thing to me I must study it I will search the town over until I find one Its habitat must be here on Broadway I am about to dine here said my friend Come inside and if there is a Man About Town present I will point him out to you I know most of the regular patrons here I am not dining yet I said to him You will excuse me I am going to find my Man About Town this night if I have to rake New York from the Battery to Little Coney Island I left the hotel and walked down Broadway The pursuit of my type gave a pleasant savour of life and interest to the air I breathed I was glad to be in a city so great so complex and diversified Leisurely and with something of an air I strolled along with my heart expanding at the thought that I was a citizen of great Gotham a sharer in its magnificence and pleasures a partaker in its glory and prestige I turned to cross the street I heard something buzz like a bee and then I took a long pleasant ride with Santos Dumont When I opened my eyes I remembered a smell of gasoline and I said aloud Hasn t it passed yet A hospital nurse laid a hand that was not particularly soft upon my brow that was not at all fevered A young doctor came along grinned and handed me a morning newspaper Want to see how it happened he asked cheerily I read the article Its headlines began where I heard the buzzing leave off the night before It closed with these lines Bellevue Hospital where it was said that his injuries were not serious He appeared to be a typical Man About Town THE COP AND THE ANTHEM On his bench in Madison Square Soapy moved uneasily When wild geese honk high of nights and when women without sealskin coats grow kind to their husbands and when Soapy moves uneasily on his bench in the park you may know that winter is near at hand A dead leaf fell in Soapy s lap That was Jack Frost s card Jack is kind to the regular denizens of Madison Square and gives fair warning of his annual call At the corners of four streets he hands his pasteboard to the North Wind footman of the mansion of All Outdoors so that the inhabitants thereof may make ready Soapy s mind became cognisant of the fact that the time had come for him to resolve himself into a singular Committee of Ways and Means to provide against the coming rigour And therefore he moved uneasily on his bench The hibernatorial ambitions of Soapy were not of the highest In them there were no considerations of Mediterranean cruises of soporific Southern skies drifting in the Vesuvian Bay Three months on the Island was what his soul craved Three months of assured board and bed and congenial company safe from Boreas and bluecoats seemed to Soapy the essence of things desirable For years the hospitable Blackwell s had been his winter quarters Just as his more fortunate fellow New Yorkers had bought their tickets to Palm Beach and the Riviera each winter so Soapy had made his humble arrangements for his annual hegira to the Island And now the time was come On the previous night three Sabbath newspapers distributed beneath his coat about his ankles and over his lap had failed to repulse the cold as he slept on his bench near the spurting fountain in the ancient square So the Island loomed big and timely in Soapy s mind He scorned the provisions made in the name of charity for the city s dependents In Soapy s opinion the Law was more benign than Philanthropy There was an endless round of institutions municipal and eleemosynary on which he might set out and receive lodging and food accordant with the simple life But to one of Soapy s proud spirit the gifts of charity are encumbered If not in coin you must pay in humiliation of spirit for every benefit received at the hands of philanthropy As Caesar had his Brutus every bed of charity must have its toll of a bath every loaf of bread its compensation of a private and personal inquisition Wherefore it is better to be a guest of the law which though conducted by rules does not meddle unduly with a gentleman s private affairs Soapy having decided to go to the Island at once set about accomplishing his desire There were many easy ways of doing this The pleasantest was to dine luxuriously at some expensive restaurant and then after declaring insolvency be handed over quietly and without uproar to a policeman An accommodating magistrate would do the rest Soapy left his bench and strolled out of the square and across the level sea of asphalt where Broadway and Fifth Avenue flow together Up Broadway he turned and halted at a glittering cafe where are gathered together nightly the choicest products of the grape the silkworm and the protoplasm Soapy had confidence in himself from the lowest button of his vest upward He was shaven and his coat was decent and his neat black ready tied four in hand had been presented to him by a lady missionary on Thanksgiving Day If he could reach a table in the restaurant unsuspected success would be his The portion of him that would show above the table would raise no doubt in the waiter s mind A roasted mallard duck thought Soapy would be about the thing with a bottle of Chablis and then Camembert a demi tasse and a cigar One dollar for the cigar would be enough The total would not be so high as to call forth any supreme manifestation of revenge from the cafe management and yet the meat would leave him filled and happy for the journey to his winter refuge But as Soapy set foot inside the restaurant door the head waiter s eye fell upon his frayed trousers and decadent shoes Strong and ready hands turned him about and conveyed him in silence and haste to the sidewalk and averted the ignoble fate of the menaced mallard Soapy turned off Broadway It seemed that his route to the coveted island was not to be an epicurean one Some other way of entering limbo must be thought of At a corner of Sixth Avenue electric lights and cunningly displayed wares behind plate glass made a shop window conspicuous Soapy took a cobblestone and dashed it through the glass People came running around the corner a policeman in the lead Soapy stood still with his hands in his pockets and smiled at the sight of brass buttons Where s the man that done that inquired the officer excitedly Don t you figure out that I might have had something to do with it said Soapy not without sarcasm but friendly as one greets good fortune The policeman s mind refused to accept Soapy even as a clue Men who smash windows do not remain to parley with the law s minions They take to their heels The policeman saw a man half way down the block running to catch a car With drawn club he joined in the pursuit Soapy with disgust in his heart loafed along twice unsuccessful On the opposite side of the street was a restaurant of no great pretensions It catered to large appetites and modest purses Its crockery and atmosphere were thick its soup and napery thin Into this place Soapy took his accusive shoes and telltale trousers without challenge At a table he sat and consumed beefsteak flapjacks doughnuts and pie And then to the waiter be betrayed the fact that the minutest coin and himself were strangers Now get busy and call a cop said Soapy And don t keep a gentleman waiting No cop for youse said the waiter with a voice like butter cakes and an eye like the cherry in a Manhattan cocktail Hey Con Neatly upon his left ear on the callous pavement two waiters pitched Soapy He arose joint by joint as a carpenter s rule opens and beat the dust from his clothes Arrest seemed but a rosy dream The Island seemed very far away A policeman who stood before a drug store two doors away laughed and walked down the street Five blocks Soapy travelled before his courage permitted him to woo capture again This time the opportunity presented what he fatuously termed to himself a cinch A young woman of a modest and pleasing guise was standing before a show window gazing with sprightly interest at its display of shaving mugs and inkstands and two yards from the window a large policeman of severe demeanour leaned against a water plug It was Soapy s design to assume the role of the despicable and execrated masher The refined and elegant appearance of his victim and the contiguity of the conscientious cop encouraged him to believe that he would soon feel the pleasant official clutch upon his arm that would insure his winter quarters on the right little tight little isle Soapy straightened the lady missionary s ready made tie dragged his shrinking cuffs into the open set his hat at a killing cant and sidled toward the young woman He made eyes at her was taken with sudden coughs and hems smiled smirked and went brazenly through the impudent and contemptible litany of the masher With half an eye Soapy saw that the policeman was watching him fixedly The young woman moved away a few steps and again bestowed her absorbed attention upon the shaving mugs Soapy followed boldly stepping to her side raised his hat and said Ah there Bedelia Don t you want to come and play in my yard The policeman was still looking The persecuted young woman had but to beckon a finger and Soapy would be practically en route for his insular haven Already he imagined he could feel the cozy warmth of the station house The young woman faced him and stretching out a hand caught Soapy s coat sleeve Sure Mike she said joyfully if you ll blow me to a pail of suds I d have spoke to you sooner but the cop was watching With the young woman playing the clinging ivy to his oak Soapy walked past the policeman overcome with gloom He seemed doomed to liberty At the next corner he shook off his companion and ran He halted in the district where by night are found the lightest streets hearts vows and librettos Women in furs and men in greatcoats moved gaily in the wintry air A sudden fear seized Soapy that some dreadful enchantment had rendered him immune to arrest The thought brought a little of panic upon it and when he came upon another policeman lounging grandly in front of a transplendent theatre he caught at the immediate straw of disorderly conduct On the sidewalk Soapy began to yell drunken gibberish at the top of his harsh voice He danced howled raved and otherwise disturbed the welkin The policeman twirled his club turned his back to Soapy and remarked to a citizen Tis one of them Yale lads celebratin the goose egg they give to the Hartford College Noisy but no harm We ve instructions to lave them be Disconsolate Soapy ceased his unavailing racket Would never a policeman lay hands on him In his fancy the Island seemed an unattainable Arcadia He buttoned his thin coat against the chilling wind In a cigar store he saw a well dressed man lighting a cigar at a swinging light His silk umbrella he had set by the door on entering Soapy stepped inside secured the umbrella and sauntered off with it slowly The man at the cigar light followed hastily My umbrella he said sternly Oh is it sneered Soapy adding insult to petit larceny Well why don t you call a policeman I took it Your umbrella Why don t you call a cop There stands one on the corner The umbrella owner slowed his steps Soapy did likewise with a presentiment that luck would again run against him The policeman looked at the two curiously Of course said the umbrella man that is well you know how these mistakes occur I if it s your umbrella I hope you ll excuse me I picked it up this morning in a restaurant If you recognise it as yours why I hope you ll Of course it s mine said Soapy viciously The ex umbrella man retreated The policeman hurried to assist a tall blonde in an opera cloak across the street in front of a street car that was approaching two blocks away Soapy walked eastward through a street damaged by improvements He hurled the umbrella wrathfully into an excavation He muttered against the men who wear helmets and carry clubs Because he wanted to fall into their clutches they seemed to regard him as a king who could do no wrong At length Soapy reached one of the avenues to the east where the glitter and turmoil was but faint He set his face down this toward Madison Square for the homing instinct survives even when the home is a park bench But on an unusually quiet corner Soapy came to a standstill Here was an old church quaint and rambling and gabled Through one violet stained window a soft light glowed where no doubt the organist loitered over the keys making sure of his mastery of the coming Sabbath anthem For there drifted out to Soapy s ears sweet music that caught and held him transfixed against the convolutions of the iron fence The moon was above lustrous and serene vehicles and pedestrians were few sparrows twittered sleepily in the eaves for a little while the scene might have been a country churchyard And the anthem that the organist played cemented Soapy to the iron fence for he had known it well in the days when his life contained such things as mothers and roses and ambitions and friends and immaculate thoughts and collars The conjunction of Soapy s receptive state of mind and the influences about the old church wrought a sudden and wonderful change in his soul He viewed with swift horror the pit into which he had tumbled the degraded days unworthy desires dead hopes wrecked faculties and base motives that made up his existence And also in a moment his heart responded thrillingly to this novel mood An instantaneous and strong impulse moved him to battle with his desperate fate He would pull himself out of the mire he would make a man of himself again he would conquer the evil that had taken possession of him There was time he was comparatively young yet he would resurrect his old eager ambitions and pursue them without faltering Those solemn but sweet organ notes had set up a revolution in him To morrow he would go into the roaring downtown district and find work A fur importer had once offered him a place as driver He would find him to morrow and ask for the position He would be somebody in the world He would Soapy felt a hand laid on his arm He looked quickly around into the broad face of a policeman What are you doin here asked the officer Nothin said Soapy Then come along said the policeman Three months on the Island said the Magistrate in the Police Court the next morning AN ADJUSTMENT OF NATURE

none	none	There amid the steam of vegetables and the vapours of acres of ham and the crash of crockery the clatter of steel the screaming of short orders the cries of the hungering and all the horrid tumult of feeding man surrounded by swarms of the buzzing winged beasts bequeathed us by Pharaoh Milly steered her magnificent way like some great liner cleaving among the canoes of howling savages 
203_126577_000006_000000	train-clean-360	Our Goddess of Grub was built on lines so majestic that they could be followed only with awe 
7297_92812_000005_000001	train-clean-360	Her sleeves were always rolled above her elbows She could have taken us three musketeers in her two hands and dropped us out of the window

none	none	One of us compared the harmony existing between a Haydn symphony and pistache ice cream to the exquisite congruity between Milly and Cypher s
203_126577_000008_000000	train-clean-360	 There is a certain fate hanging over Milly said Kraft and if it overtakes her she is lost to Cypher s and to us

203_126577_000021_000000	train-clean-360	It was our love of the Unerring Artistic Adjustment of Nature that inspired us 
203_126577_000021_000001	train-clean-360	We could not give her over to a lumberman doubly accursed by wealth and provincialism 
7297_92812_000020_000002	train-clean-360	We shuddered to think of Milly with her voice modulated and her elbows covered pouring tea in the marble teepee of a tree murderer

none	none	Kraft spent his puny store of coin at the bar and then gave Judkins and me such an appealing look that we went down to the last dime we had in toasting our guest Then when our ammunition was gone and the Klondiker still somewhat sober began to babble again of Milly Kraft whispered into his ear such a polite barbed insult relating to people who were miserly with their funds that the miner crashed down handful after handful of silver and notes calling for all the fluids in the world to drown the imputation 
203_126577_000033_000000	train-clean-360	Thus the work was accomplished

none	none	MEMOIRS OF A YELLOW DOG I don t suppose it will knock any of you people off your perch to read a contribution from an animal mister Kipling and a good many others have demonstrated the fact that animals can express themselves in remunerative English and no magazine goes to press nowadays without an animal story in it except the old style monthlies that are still running pictures of Bryan and the Mont Pelee horror But you needn t look for any stuck up literature in my piece such as Bearoo the bear and Snakoo the snake and Tammanoo the tiger talk in the jungle books A yellow dog that s spent most of his life in a cheap New York flat sleeping in a corner on an old sateen underskirt the one she spilled port wine on at the Lady Longshoremen s banquet mustn t be expected to perform any tricks with the art of speech I was born a yellow pup date locality pedigree and weight unknown The first thing I can recollect an old woman had me in a basket at Broadway and Twenty third trying to sell me to a fat lady Old Mother Hubbard was boosting me to beat the band as a genuine Pomeranian Hambletonian Red Irish Cochin China Stoke Pogis fox terrier The fat lady chased a V around among the samples of gros grain flannelette in her shopping bag till she cornered it and gave up From that moment I was a pet a mamma s own wootsey squidlums Say gentle reader did you ever have a two hundred pound woman breathing a flavour of Camembert cheese and Peau d Espagne pick you up and wallop her nose all over you remarking all the time in an Emma Eames tone of voice Oh oo s um oodlum doodlum woodlum toodlum bitsy witsy skoodlums From a pedigreed yellow pup I grew up to be an anonymous yellow cur looking like a cross between an Angora cat and a box of lemons But my mistress never tumbled She thought that the two primeval pups that Noah chased into the ark were but a collateral branch of my ancestors It took two policemen to keep her from entering me at the Madison Square Garden for the Siberian bloodhound prize I ll tell you about that flat The house was the ordinary thing in New York paved with Parian marble in the entrance hall and cobblestones above the first floor Our fiat was three well not flights climbs up My mistress rented it unfurnished and put in the regular things nineteen oh three antique unholstered parlour set oil chromo of geishas in a Harlem tea house rubber plant and husband By Sirius there was a biped I felt sorry for He was a little man with sandy hair and whiskers a good deal like mine Henpecked well toucans and flamingoes and pelicans all had their bills in him He wiped the dishes and listened to my mistress tell about the cheap ragged things the lady with the squirrel skin coat on the second floor hung out on her line to dry And every evening while she was getting supper she made him take me out on the end of a string for a walk If men knew how women pass the time when they are alone they d never marry Laura Lean Jibbey peanut brittle a little almond cream on the neck muscles dishes unwashed half an hour s talk with the iceman reading a package of old letters a couple of pickles and two bottles of malt extract one hour peeking through a hole in the window shade into the flat across the air shaft that s about all there is to it Twenty minutes before time for him to come home from work she straightens up the house fixes her rat so it won t show and gets out a lot of sewing for a ten minute bluff I led a dog s life in that flat Most all day I lay there in my corner watching that fat woman kill time I slept sometimes and had pipe dreams about being out chasing cats into basements and growling at old ladies with black mittens as a dog was intended to do Then she would pounce upon me with a lot of that drivelling poodle palaver and kiss me on the nose but what could I do A dog can t chew cloves I began to feel sorry for Hubby dog my cats if I didn t We looked so much alike that people noticed it when we went out so we shook the streets that Morgan s cab drives down and took to climbing the piles of last December s snow on the streets where cheap people live One evening when we were thus promenading and I was trying to look like a prize saint Bernard and the old man was trying to look like he wouldn t have murdered the first organ grinder he heard play Mendelssohn s wedding march I looked up at him and said in my way What are you looking so sour about you oakum trimmed lobster She don t kiss you You don t have to sit on her lap and listen to talk that would make the book of a musical comedy sound like the maxims of Epictetus You ought to be thankful you re not a dog Brace up Benedick and bid the blues begone The matrimonial mishap looked down at me with almost canine intelligence in his face Why doggie says he good doggie You almost look like you could speak What is it doggie Cats Cats Could speak But of course he couldn t understand Humans were denied the speech of animals The only common ground of communication upon which dogs and men can get together is in fiction In the flat across the hall from us lived a lady with a black and tan terrier Her husband strung it and took it out every evening but he always came home cheerful and whistling One day I touched noses with the black and tan in the hall and I struck him for an elucidation See here Wiggle and Skip I says you know that it ain t the nature of a real man to play dry nurse to a dog in public I never saw one leashed to a bow wow yet that didn t look like he d like to lick every other man that looked at him But your boss comes in every day as perky and set up as an amateur prestidigitator doing the egg trick How does he do it Don t tell me he likes it Him says the black and tan Why he uses Nature s Own Remedy He gets spifflicated At first when we go out he s as shy as the man on the steamer who would rather play pedro when they make em all jackpots By the time we ve been in eight saloons he don t care whether the thing on the end of his line is a dog or a catfish I ve lost two inches of my tail trying to sidestep those swinging doors The pointer I got from that terrier vaudeville please copy set me to thinking One evening about six o clock my mistress ordered him to get busy and do the ozone act for Lovey I have concealed it until now but that is what she called me The black and tan was called Tweetness I consider that I have the bulge on him as far as you could chase a rabbit Still Lovey is something of a nomenclatural tin can on the tail of one s self respect At a quiet place on a safe street I tightened the line of my custodian in front of an attractive refined saloon I made a dead ahead scramble for the doors whining like a dog in the press despatches that lets the family know that little Alice is bogged while gathering lilies in the brook Why darn my eyes says the old man with a grin darn my eyes if the saffron coloured son of a seltzer lemonade ain t asking me in to take a drink Lemme see how long s it been since I saved shoe leather by keeping one foot on the foot rest I believe I ll I knew I had him Hot Scotches he took sitting at a table For an hour he kept the Campbells coming I sat by his side rapping for the waiter with my tail and eating free lunch such as mamma in her flat never equalled with her homemade truck bought at a delicatessen store eight minutes before papa comes home When the products of Scotland were all exhausted except the rye bread the old man unwound me from the table leg and played me outside like a fisherman plays a salmon Out there he took off my collar and threw it into the street Poor doggie says he good doggie She shan t kiss you any more S a darned shame Good doggie go away and get run over by a street car and be happy I refused to leave I leaped and frisked around the old man s legs happy as a pug on a rug You old flea headed woodchuck chaser I said to him you moon baying rabbit pointing egg stealing old beagle can t you see that I don t want to leave you Can t you see that we re both Pups in the Wood and the missis is the cruel uncle after you with the dish towel and me with the flea liniment and a pink bow to tie on my tail Why not cut that all out and be pards forever more Maybe you ll say he didn t understand maybe he didn t But he kind of got a grip on the Hot Scotches and stood still for a minute thinking Doggie says he finally we don t live more than a dozen lives on this earth and very few of us live to be more than three hundred If I ever see that flat any more I m a flat and if you do you re flatter and that s no flattery I m offering sixty to one that Westward Ho wins out by the length of a dachshund There was no string but I frolicked along with my master to the Twenty third street ferry And the cats on the route saw reason to give thanks that prehensile claws had been given them On the Jersey side my master said to a stranger who stood eating a currant bun Me and my doggie we are bound for the Rocky Mountains But what pleased me most was when my old man pulled both of my ears until I howled and said You common monkey headed rat tailed sulphur coloured son of a door mat do you know what I m going to call you I thought of Lovey and I whined dolefully I m going to call you Pete says my master and if I d had five tails I couldn t have done enough wagging to do justice to the occasion THE LOVE PHILTRE OF IKEY SCHOENSTEIN 
1025_92814_000008_000000	train-clean-360	The Blue Light Drug Store is downtown between the Bowery and First Avenue where the distance between the two streets is the shortest 
1025_92814_000008_000001	train-clean-360	The Blue Light does not consider that pharmacy is a thing of bric a brac scent and ice cream soda 
none	none	If you ask it for pain killer it will not give you a bonbon The Blue Light scorns the labour saving arts of modern pharmacy 
1025_92814_000009_000001	train-clean-360	It macerates its opium and percolates its own laudanum and paregoric To this day pills are made behind its tall prescription desk pills rolled out on its own pill tile divided with a spatula rolled with the finger and thumb dusted with calcined magnesia and delivered in little round pasteboard pill boxes 
1025_92814_000009_000002	train-clean-360	The store is on a corner about which coveys of ragged plumed hilarious children play and become candidates for the cough drops and soothing syrups that wait for them inside 
none	none	Ikey Schoenstein was the night clerk of the Blue Light and the friend of his customers Thus it is on the East Side where the heart of pharmacy is not glace There as it should be the druggist is a counsellor a confessor an adviser an able and willing missionary and mentor whose learning is respected whose occult wisdom is venerated and whose medicine is often poured untasted into the gutter Therefore Ikey s corniform be spectacled nose and narrow knowledge bowed figure was well known in the vicinity of the Blue Light and his advice and notice were much desired 
1025_92814_000011_000000	train-clean-360	Ikey roomed and breakfasted at missus Riddle s two squares away 
none	none	missus Riddle had a daughter named Rosy 
1025_92814_000011_000002	train-clean-360	The circumlocution has been in vain you must have guessed it Ikey adored Rosy 
none	none	She tinctured all his thoughts she was the compound extract of all that was chemically pure and officinal the dispensatory contained nothing equal to her But Ikey was timid and his hopes remained insoluble in the menstruum of his backwardness and fears Behind his counter he was a superior being calmly conscious of special knowledge and worth outside he was a weak kneed purblind motorman cursed rambler with ill fitting clothes stained with chemicals and smelling of socotrine aloes and valerianate of ammonia 
1025_92814_000012_000000	train-clean-360	The fly in Ikey s ointment thrice welcome pat trope was Chunk McGowan 
none	none	mister McGowan was also striving to catch the bright smiles tossed about by Rosy 
1025_92814_000013_000001	train-clean-360	But he was no outfielder as Ikey was he picked them off the bat At the same time he was Ikey s friend and customer and often dropped in at the Blue Light Drug Store to have a bruise painted with iodine or get a cut rubber plastered after a pleasant evening spent along the Bowery 
none	none	One afternoon McGowan drifted in in his silent easy way and sat comely smooth faced hard indomitable good natured upon a stool Ikey said he when his friend had fetched his mortar and sat opposite grinding gum benzoin to a powder get busy with your ear It s drugs for me if you ve got the line I need Ikey scanned the countenance of mister McGowan for the usual evidences of conflict but found none Take your coat off he ordered
1025_92814_000017_000001	train-clean-360	 I guess already that you have been stuck in the ribs with a knife 
1025_92814_000017_000002	train-clean-360	I have many times told you those Dagoes would do you up 
1025_92814_000018_000000	train-clean-360	mister McGowan smiled 
none	none	Not them he said
1025_92814_000018_000002	train-clean-360	 Not any Dagoes 
1025_92814_000018_000003	train-clean-360	But you ve located the diagnosis all right enough it s under my coat near the ribs 
none	none	Say Ikey Rosy and me are goin to run away and get married to night 
1025_92814_000019_000000	train-clean-360	Ikey s left forefinger was doubled over the edge of the mortar holding it steady 
none	none	He gave it a wild rap with the pestle but felt it not Meanwhile mister McGowan s smile faded to a look of perplexed gloom That is he continued if she keeps in the notion until the time comes We ve been layin pipes for the getaway for two weeks 
1025_92814_000020_000002	train-clean-360	One day she says she will the same evenin she says nixy 
1025_92814_000020_000003	train-clean-360	We ve agreed on to night and Rosy s stuck to the affirmative this time for two whole days 
1025_92814_000020_000004	train-clean-360	But it s five hours yet till the time and I m afraid she ll stand me up when it comes to the scratch 
none	none	You said you wanted drugs remarked Ikey 
1025_92814_000022_000000	train-clean-360	mister McGowan looked ill at ease and harassed a condition opposed to his usual line of demeanour 
1025_92814_000022_000001	train-clean-360	He made a patent medicine almanac into a roll and fitted it with unprofitable carefulness about his finger 
none	none	I wouldn t have this double handicap make a false start to night for a million he said I ve got a little flat up in Harlem all ready with chrysanthemums on the table and a kettle ready to boil And I ve engaged a pulpit pounder to be ready at his house for us at nine point thirty It s got to come off And if Rosy don t change her mind again mister 
1025_92814_000023_000005	train-clean-360	McGowan ceased a prey to his doubts 
1025_92814_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t see then yet said Ikey shortly what makes it that you talk of drugs or what I can be doing about it 
none	none	Old man Riddle don t like me a little bit went on the uneasy suitor bent upon marshalling his arguments
1025_92814_000025_000001	train-clean-360	 For a week he hasn t let Rosy step outside the door with me 
none	none	If it wasn t for losin a boarder they d have bounced me long ago I m makin twenty dollars a week and she ll never regret flyin the coop with Chunk McGowan
1025_92814_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 You will excuse me Chunk said Ikey 
1025_92814_000026_000001	train-clean-360	 I must make a prescription that is to be called for soon 
none	none	Say said McGowan looking up suddenly say Ikey ain t there a drug of some kind some kind of powders that ll make a girl like you better if you give em to her 
1025_92814_000028_000000	train-clean-360	Ikey s lip beneath his nose curled with the scorn of superior enlightenment but before he could answer McGowan continued 
1025_92814_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 Tim Lacy told me he got some once from a croaker uptown and fed em to his girl in soda water 
none	none	From the very first dose he was ace high and everybody else looked like thirty cents to her 
1025_92814_000029_000002	train-clean-360	They was married in less than two weeks 
1025_92814_000030_000000	train-clean-360	Strong and simple was Chunk McGowan 
none	none	A better reader of men than Ikey was could have seen that his tough frame was strung upon fine wires Like a good general who was about to invade the enemy s territory he was seeking to guard every point against possible failure I thought went on Chunk hopefully that if I had one of them powders to give Rosy when I see her at supper to night it might brace her up and keep her from reneging on the proposition to skip I guess she don t need a mule team to drag her away but women are better at coaching than they are at running bases If the stuff ll work just for a couple of hours it ll do the trick When is this foolishness of running away to be happening asked Ikey Nine o clock said mister McGowan Supper s at seven 
1025_92814_000033_000002	train-clean-360	At eight Rosy goes to bed with a headache 
1025_92814_000033_000003	train-clean-360	At nine old Parvenzano lets me through to his back yard where there s a board off Riddle s fence next door 
none	none	I go under her window and help her down the fire escape We ve got to make it early on the preacher s account 
1025_92814_000033_000006	train-clean-360	It s all dead easy if Rosy don t balk when the flag drops 
1025_92814_000033_000007	train-clean-360	Can you fix me one of them powders Ikey 
none	none	Ikey Schoenstein rubbed his nose slowly
1025_92814_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 Chunk said he it is of drugs of that nature that pharmaceutists must have much carefulness 
1025_92814_000035_000001	train-clean-360	To you alone of my acquaintance would I intrust a powder like that 
none	none	But for you I shall make it and you shall see how it makes Rosy to think of you Ikey went behind the prescription desk 
1025_92814_000036_000001	train-clean-360	There he crushed to a powder two soluble tablets each containing a quarter of a grain of morphia 
none	none	To them he added a little sugar of milk to increase the bulk and folded the mixture neatly in a white paper 
1025_92814_000036_000003	train-clean-360	Taken by an adult this powder would insure several hours of heavy slumber without danger to the sleeper This he handed to Chunk McGowan telling him to administer it in a liquid if possible and received the hearty thanks of the backyard Lochinvar 
none	none	The subtlety of Ikey s action becomes apparent upon recital of his subsequent move He sent a messenger for mister Riddle and disclosed the plans of mister McGowan for eloping with Rosy 
1025_92814_000037_000002	train-clean-360	mister Riddle was a stout man brick dusty of complexion and sudden in action 
1025_92814_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 Much obliged he said briefly to Ikey 
1025_92814_000038_000001	train-clean-360	 The lazy Irish loafer 
1025_92814_000038_000002	train-clean-360	My own room s just above Rosy s 
1025_92814_000038_000003	train-clean-360	I ll just go up there myself after supper and load the shot gun and wait 
none	none	If he comes in my back yard he ll go away in a ambulance instead of a bridal chaise With Rosy held in the clutches of Morpheus for a many hours deep slumber and the bloodthirsty parent waiting armed and forewarned Ikey felt that his rival was close indeed upon discomfiture All night in the Blue Light Drug Store he waited at his duties for chance news of the tragedy but none came At eight o clock in the morning the day clerk arrived and Ikey started hurriedly for missus Riddle s to learn the outcome And lo as he stepped out of the store who but Chunk McGowan sprang from a passing street car and grasped his hand Chunk McGowan with a victor s smile and flushed with joy Pulled it off said Chunk with Elysium in his grin Rosy hit the fire escape on time to a second and we was under the wire at the Reverend s at nine point threeO one four 
1025_92814_000042_000002	train-clean-360	She s up at the flat she cooked eggs this mornin in a blue kimono Lord how lucky I am 
1025_92814_000042_000003	train-clean-360	You must pace up some day Ikey and feed with us 
1025_92814_000042_000004	train-clean-360	I ve got a job down near the bridge and that s where I m heading for now 
1025_92814_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 The the powder stammered Ikey 
1025_92814_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh that stuff you gave me said Chunk broadening his grin well it was this way 
1025_92814_000044_000001	train-clean-360	I sat down at the supper table last night at Riddle s and I looked at Rosy and I says to myself Chunk if you get the girl get her on the square don t try any hocus pocus with a thoroughbred like her And I keeps the paper you give me in my pocket 
none	none	And then my lamps fall on another party present who I says to myself is failin in a proper affection toward his comin son in law so I watches my chance and dumps that powder in old man Riddle s coffee see 
7131-92815-0000	train-other-500	MAMMON AND THE ARCHER Old Anthony Rockwall retired manufacturer and proprietor of Rockwall s Eureka Soap looked out the library window of his Fifth Avenue mansion and grinned His neighbour to the right
7131-92815-0001	train-other-500	the aristocratic clubman G Van Schuylight Suffolk Jones came out to his waiting motor car wrinkling a contumelious nostril as usual at the Italian renaissance sculpture of the soap palace s front elevation Stuck up old statuette of nothing doing
7131-92815-0002	train-other-500	commented the ex Soap King The Eden Musee ll get that old frozen Nesselrode yet if he don t watch out I ll have this house painted red white and blue next summer and see if that ll make his Dutch nose turn up any higher And then Anthony Rockwall who never cared for bells
7131-92815-0003	train-other-500	went to the door of his library and shouted Mike in the same voice that had once chipped off pieces of the welkin on the Kansas prairies Tell my son said Anthony to the answering menial to come in here before he leaves the house When young Rockwall entered the library
7131-92815-0004	train-other-500	the old man laid aside his newspaper looked at him with a kindly grimness on his big smooth ruddy countenance rumpled his mop of white hair with one hand and rattled the keys in his pocket with the other Richard said Anthony Rockwall what do you pay for the soap that you use
none	none	 Richard only six months home from college was startled a little 
7131-92815-0005	train-other-500	He had not yet taken the measure of this sire of his who was as full of unexpectednesses as a girl at her first party Six dollars a dozen I think dad And your clothes I suppose about sixty dollars as a rule You re a gentleman
7131-92815-0006	train-other-500	said Anthony decidedly I ve heard of these young bloods spending twenty four dollars a dozen for soap and going over the hundred mark for clothes You ve got as much money to waste as any of em and yet you stick to what s decent and moderate Now I use the old Eureka not only for sentiment but it s the purest soap made
none	none	 Whenever you pay more than ten cents a cake for soap you buy bad perfumes and labels 
7131-92815-0007	train-other-500	But fifty cents is doing very well for a young man in your generation position and condition As I said you re a gentleman
none	none	 They say it takes three generations to make one They re off Money ll do it as slick as soap grease It s made you one By hokey it s almost made one of me 
7131-92815-0008	train-other-500	I m nearly as impolite and disagreeable and ill mannered as these two old Knickerbocker gents on each side of me that can t sleep of nights because I bought in between em There are some things that money can t accomplish remarked young Rockwall rather gloomily
7131-92815-0009	train-other-500	Now don t say that said old Anthony shocked
none	none	 I bet my money on money every time I ve been through the encyclopaedia down to Y looking for something you can t buy with it and I expect to have to take up the appendix next week 
7131-92815-0010	train-other-500	I m for money against the field Tell me something money won t buy For one thing answered Richard rankling a little it won t buy one into the exclusive circles of society
7131-92815-0011	train-other-500	Oho won t it thundered the champion of the root of evil You tell me where your exclusive circles would be if the first Astor hadn t had the money to pay for his steerage passage over Richard sighed
7131-92815-0012	train-other-500	And that s what I was coming to said the old man less boisterously That s why I asked you to come in There s something going wrong with you boy I ve been noticing it for two weeks Out with it
none	none	 I guess I could lay my hands on eleven millions within twenty four hours besides the real estate If it s your liver there s the Rambler down in the bay coaled and ready to steam down to the Bahamas in two days Not a bad guess dad you haven t missed it far 
7131-92815-0013	train-other-500	Ah said Anthony keenly what s her name Richard began to walk up and down the library floor There was enough comradeship and sympathy in this crude old father of his to draw his confidence Why don t you ask her
7131-92815-0014	train-other-500	demanded old Anthony She ll jump at you You ve got the money and the looks and you re a decent boy Your hands are clean You ve got no Eureka soap on em You ve been to college but she ll overlook that I haven t had a chance said Richard Make one said Anthony
7131-92815-0015	train-other-500	Take her for a walk in the park or a straw ride or walk home with her from church Chance Pshaw You don t know the social mill dad She s part of the stream that turns it Every hour and minute of her time is arranged for days in advance
none	none	 I must have that girl dad or this town is a blackjack swamp forevermore And I can t write it I can t do that Tut said the old man Do you mean to tell me that with all the money I ve got you can t get an hour or two of a girl s time for yourself I ve put it off too late She s going to sail for Europe at noon day after to morrow for a two years stay I m to see her alone to morrow evening for a few minutes 
7131-92815-0016	train-other-500	She s at Larchmont now at her aunt s I can t go there
none	none	 But I m allowed to meet her with a cab at the Grand Central Station to morrow evening at the eight point thirty train 
7131-92815-0017	train-other-500	We drive down Broadway to Wallack s at a gallop
none	none	 where her mother and a box party will be waiting for us in the lobby Do you think she would listen to a declaration from me during that six or eight minutes under those circumstances 
7131-92815-0018	train-other-500	No And what chance would I have in the theatre or afterward None

chuckled Anthony Good by Kelly SPRINGTIME A LA CARTE It was a day in March Never never begin a story this way when you write one No opening could possibly be worse It is unimaginative flat dry and likely to consist of mere wind But in this instance it is allowable For the following paragraph which should have inaugurated the narrative is too wildly extravagant and preposterous to be flaunted in the face of the reader without preparation Sarah was crying over her bill of fare Think of a New York girl shedding tears on the menu card To account for this you will be allowed to guess that the lobsters were all out or that she had sworn ice cream off during Lent or that she had ordered onions or that she had just come from a Hackett matinee And then all these theories being wrong you will please let the story proceed The gentleman who announced that the world was an oyster which he with his sword would open made a larger hit than he deserved It is not difficult to open an oyster with a sword But did you ever notice any one try to open the terrestrial bivalve with a typewriter Like to wait for a dozen raw opened that way Sarah had managed to pry apart the shells with her unhandy weapon far enough to nibble a wee bit at the cold and clammy world within She knew no more shorthand than if she had been a graduate in stenography just let slip upon the world by a business college So not being able to stenog she could not enter that bright galaxy of office talent She was a free lance typewriter and canvassed for odd jobs of copying The most brilliant and crowning feat of Sarah s battle with the world was the deal she made with Schulenberg s Home Restaurant The restaurant was next door to the old red brick in which she ball roomed One evening after dining at Schulenberg s forty cent five course table d hote served as fast as you throw the five baseballs at the coloured gentleman s head Sarah took away with her the bill of fare It was written in an almost unreadable script neither English nor German and so arranged that if you were not careful you began with a toothpick and rice pudding and ended with soup and the day of the week The next day Sarah showed Schulenberg a neat card on which the menu was beautifully typewritten with the viands temptingly marshalled under their right and proper heads from hors d oeuvre to not responsible for overcoats and umbrellas Schulenberg became a naturalised citizen on the spot Before Sarah left him she had him willingly committed to an agreement She was to furnish typewritten bills of fare for the twenty one tables in the restaurant a new bill for each day s dinner and new ones for breakfast and lunch as often as changes occurred in the food or as neatness required In return for this Schulenberg was to send three meals per diem to Sarah s hall room by a waiter an obsequious one if possible and furnish her each afternoon with a pencil draft of what Fate had in store for Schulenberg s customers on the morrow Mutual satisfaction resulted from the agreement Schulenberg s patrons now knew what the food they ate was called even if its nature sometimes puzzled them And Sarah had food during a cold dull winter which was the main thing with her And then the almanac lied and said that spring had come Spring comes when it comes The frozen snows of January still lay like adamant in the crosstown streets The hand organs still played In the Good Old Summertime with their December vivacity and expression Men began to make thirty day notes to buy Easter dresses Janitors shut off steam And when these things happen one may know that the city is still in the clutches of winter One afternoon Sarah shivered in her elegant hall bedroom house heated scrupulously clean conveniences seen to be appreciated She had no work to do except Schulenberg s menu cards Sarah sat in her squeaky willow rocker and looked out the window The calendar on the wall kept crying to her Springtime is here Sarah springtime is here I tell you Look at me Sarah my figures show it You ve got a neat figure yourself Sarah a nice springtime figure why do you look out the window so sadly Sarah s room was at the back of the house Looking out the window she could see the windowless rear brick wall of the box factory on the next street But the wall was clearest crystal and Sarah was looking down a grassy lane shaded with cherry trees and elms and bordered with raspberry bushes and Cherokee roses Spring s real harbingers are too subtle for the eye and ear Some must have the flowering crocus the wood starring dogwood the voice of bluebird even so gross a reminder as the farewell handshake of the retiring buckwheat and oyster before they can welcome the Lady in Green to their dull bosoms But to old earth s choicest kin there come straight sweet messages from his newest bride telling them they shall be no stepchildren unless they choose to be On the previous summer Sarah had gone into the country and loved a farmer In writing your story never hark back thus It is bad art and cripples interest Let it march march Sarah stayed two weeks at Sunnybrook Farm There she learned to love old Farmer Franklin s son Walter Farmers have been loved and wedded and turned out to grass in less time But young Walter Franklin was a modern agriculturist He had a telephone in his cow house and he could figure up exactly what effect next year s Canada wheat crop would have on potatoes planted in the dark of the moon It was in this shaded and raspberried lane that Walter had wooed and won her And together they had sat and woven a crown of dandelions for her hair He had immoderately praised the effect of the yellow blossoms against her brown tresses and she had left the chaplet there and walked back to the house swinging her straw sailor in her hands They were to marry in the spring at the very first signs of spring Walter said And Sarah came back to the city to pound her typewriter A knock at the door dispelled Sarah s visions of that happy day A waiter had brought the rough pencil draft of the Home Restaurant s next day fare in old Schulenberg s angular hand Sarah sat down to her typewriter and slipped a card between the rollers She was a nimble worker Generally in an hour and a half the twenty one menu cards were written and ready To day there were more changes on the bill of fare than usual The soups were lighter pork was eliminated from the entrees figuring only with Russian turnips among the roasts The gracious spirit of spring pervaded the entire menu Lamb that lately capered on the greening hillsides was becoming exploited with the sauce that commemorated its gambols The song of the oyster though not silenced was dimuendo con amore The frying pan seemed to be held inactive behind the beneficent bars of the broiler The pie list swelled the richer puddings had vanished the sausage with his drapery wrapped about him barely lingered in a pleasant thanatopsis with the buckwheats and the sweet but doomed maple Sarah s fingers danced like midgets above a summer stream Down through the courses she worked giving each item its position according to its length with an accurate eye Just above the desserts came the list of vegetables Carrots and peas asparagus on toast the perennial tomatoes and corn and succotash lima beans cabbage and then Sarah was crying over her bill of fare Tears from the depths of some divine despair rose in her heart and gathered to her eyes Down went her head on the little typewriter stand and the keyboard rattled a dry accompaniment to her moist sobs For she had received no letter from Walter in two weeks and the next item on the bill of fare was dandelions dandelions with some kind of egg but bother the egg dandelions with whose golden blooms Walter had crowned her his queen of love and future bride dandelions the harbingers of spring her sorrow s crown of sorrow reminder of her happiest days Madam I dare you to smile until you suffer this test Let the Marechal Niel roses that Percy brought you on the night you gave him your heart be served as a salad with French dressing before your eyes at a Schulenberg table d hote Had Juliet so seen her love tokens dishonoured the sooner would she have sought the lethean herbs of the good apothecary But what a witch is Spring Into the great cold city of stone and iron a message had to be sent There was none to convey it but the little hardy courier of the fields with his rough green coat and modest air He is a true soldier of fortune this dent de lion this lion s tooth as the French chefs call him Flowered he will assist at love making wreathed in my lady s nut brown hair young and callow and unblossomed he goes into the boiling pot and delivers the word of his sovereign mistress By and by Sarah forced back her tears The cards must be written But still in a faint golden glow from her dandeleonine dream she fingered the typewriter keys absently for a little while with her mind and heart in the meadow lane with her young farmer But soon she came swiftly back to the rock bound lanes of Manhattan and the typewriter began to rattle and jump like a strike breaker s motor car At six o clock the waiter brought her dinner and carried away the typewritten bill of fare When Sarah ate she set aside with a sigh the dish of dandelions with its crowning ovarious accompaniment As this dark mass had been transformed from a bright and love indorsed flower to be an ignominious vegetable so had her summer hopes wilted and perished Love may as Shakespeare said feed on itself but Sarah could not bring herself to eat the dandelions that had graced as ornaments the first spiritual banquet of her heart s true affection At seven thirty the couple in the next room began to quarrel the man in the room above sought for A on his flute the gas went a little lower three coal wagons started to unload the only sound of which the phonograph is jealous cats on the back fences slowly retreated toward Mukden By these signs Sarah knew that it was time for her to read She got out The Cloister and the Hearth the best non selling book of the month settled her feet on her trunk and began to wander with Gerard The front door bell rang The landlady answered it Sarah left Gerard and Denys treed by a bear and listened Oh yes you would just as she did And then a strong voice was heard in the hall below and Sarah jumped for her door leaving the book on the floor and the first round easily the bear s You have guessed it She reached the top of the stairs just as her farmer came up three at a jump and reaped and garnered her with nothing left for the gleaners Why haven t you written oh why cried Sarah New York is a pretty large town said Walter Franklin I came in a week ago to your old address I found that you went away on a Thursday That consoled some it eliminated the possible Friday bad luck But it didn t prevent my hunting for you with police and otherwise ever since I wrote said Sarah vehemently Never got it Then how did you find me The young farmer smiled a springtime smile I dropped into that Home Restaurant next door this evening said he I don t care who knows it I like a dish of some kind of greens at this time of the year I ran my eye down that nice typewritten bill of fare looking for something in that line When I got below cabbage I turned my chair over and hollered for the proprietor He told me where you lived I remember sighed Sarah happily That was dandelions below cabbage I d know that cranky capital W way above the line that your typewriter makes anywhere in the world said Franklin Why there s no W in dandelions said Sarah in surprise The young man drew the bill of fare from his pocket and pointed to a line Sarah recognised the first card she had typewritten that afternoon There was still the rayed splotch in the upper right hand corner where a tear had fallen But over the spot where one should have read the name of the meadow plant the clinging memory of their golden blossoms had allowed her fingers to strike strange keys Between the red cabbage and the stuffed green peppers was the item DEAREST WALTER WITH HARD BOILED EGG THE GREEN DOOR Suppose you should be walking down Broadway after dinner with ten minutes allotted to the consummation of your cigar while you are choosing between a diverting tragedy and something serious in the way of vaudeville Suddenly a hand is laid upon your arm You turn to look into the thrilling eyes of a beautiful woman wonderful in diamonds and Russian sables She thrusts hurriedly into your hand an extremely hot buttered roll flashes out a tiny pair of scissors snips off the second button of your overcoat meaningly ejaculates the one word parallelogram and swiftly flies down a cross street looking back fearfully over her shoulder That would be pure adventure Would you accept it Not you You would flush with embarrassment you would sheepishly drop the roll and continue down Broadway fumbling feebly for the missing button This you would do unless you are one of the blessed few in whom the pure spirit of adventure is not dead True adventurers have never been plentiful They who are set down in print as such have been mostly business men with newly invented methods They have been out after the things they wanted golden fleeces holy grails lady loves treasure crowns and fame The true adventurer goes forth aimless and uncalculating to meet and greet unknown fate A fine example was the Prodigal Son when he started back home Half adventurers brave and splendid figures have been numerous From the Crusades to the Palisades they have enriched the arts of history and fiction and the trade of historical fiction But each of them had a prize to win a goal to kick an axe to grind a race to run a new thrust in tierce to deliver a name to carve a crow to pick so they were not followers of true adventure In the big city the twin spirits Romance and Adventure are always abroad seeking worthy wooers As we roam the streets they slyly peep at us and challenge us in twenty different guises Without knowing why we look up suddenly to see in a window a face that seems to belong to our gallery of intimate portraits in a sleeping thoroughfare we hear a cry of agony and fear coming from an empty and shuttered house instead of at our familiar curb a cab driver deposits us before a strange door which one with a smile opens for us and bids us enter a slip of paper written upon flutters down to our feet from the high lattices of Chance we exchange glances of instantaneous hate affection and fear with hurrying strangers in the passing crowds a sudden douse of rain and our umbrella may be sheltering the daughter of the Full Moon and first cousin of the Sidereal System at every corner handkerchiefs drop fingers beckon eyes besiege and the lost the lonely the rapturous the mysterious the perilous changing clues of adventure are slipped into our fingers But few of us are willing to hold and follow them We are grown stiff with the ramrod of convention down our backs We pass on and some day we come at the end of a very dull life to reflect that our romance has been a pallid thing of a marriage or two a satin rosette kept in a safe deposit drawer and a lifelong feud with a steam radiator Rudolf Steiner was a true adventurer Few were the evenings on which he did not go forth from his hall bedchamber in search of the unexpected and the egregious The most interesting thing in life seemed to him to be what might lie just around the next corner Sometimes his willingness to tempt fate led him into strange paths Twice he had spent the night in a station house again and again he had found himself the dupe of ingenious and mercenary tricksters his watch and money had been the price of one flattering allurement But with undiminished ardour he picked up every glove cast before him into the merry lists of adventure One evening Rudolf was strolling along a crosstown street in the older central part of the city Two streams of people filled the sidewalks the home hurrying and that restless contingent that abandons home for the specious welcome of the thousand candle power table d hote The young adventurer was of pleasing presence and moved serenely and watchfully By daylight he was a salesman in a piano store He wore his tie drawn through a topaz ring instead of fastened with a stick pin and once he had written to the editor of a magazine that Junie s Love Test by Miss Libbey had been the book that had most influenced his life During his walk a violent chattering of teeth in a glass case on the sidewalk seemed at first to draw his attention with a qualm to a restaurant before which it was set but a second glance revealed the electric letters of a dentist s sign high above the next door A giant negro fantastically dressed in a red embroidered coat yellow trousers and a military cap discreetly distributed cards to those of the passing crowd who consented to take them This mode of dentistic advertising was a common sight to Rudolf Usually he passed the dispenser of the dentist s cards without reducing his store but tonight the African slipped one into his hand so deftly that he retained it there smiling a little at the successful feat When he had travelled a few yards further he glanced at the card indifferently Surprised he turned it over and looked again with interest One side of the card was blank on the other was written in ink three words The Green Door And then Rudolf saw three steps in front of him a man throw down the card the negro had given him as he passed Rudolf picked it up It was printed with the dentist s name and address and the usual schedule of plate work and bridge work and crowns and specious promises of painless operations The adventurous piano salesman halted at the corner and considered Then he crossed the street walked down a block recrossed and joined the upward current of people again Without seeming to notice the negro as he passed the second time he carelessly took the card that was handed him Ten steps away he inspected it In the same handwriting that appeared on the first card The Green Door was inscribed upon it Three or four cards were tossed to the pavement by pedestrians both following and leading him These fell blank side up Rudolf turned them over Every one bore the printed legend of the dental parlours Rarely did the arch sprite Adventure need to beckon twice to Rudolf Steiner his true follower But twice it had been done and the quest was on Rudolf walked slowly back to where the giant negro stood by the case of rattling teeth This time as he passed he received no card In spite of his gaudy and ridiculous garb the Ethiopian displayed a natural barbaric dignity as he stood offering the cards suavely to some allowing others to pass unmolested Every half minute he chanted a harsh unintelligible phrase akin to the jabber of car conductors and grand opera And not only did he withhold a card this time but it seemed to Rudolf that he received from the shining and massive black countenance a look of cold almost contemptuous disdain The look stung the adventurer He read in it a silent accusation that he had been found wanting Whatever the mysterious written words on the cards might mean the black had selected him twice from the throng for their recipient and now seemed to have condemned him as deficient in the wit and spirit to engage the enigma Standing aside from the rush the young man made a rapid estimate of the building in which he conceived that his adventure must lie Five stories high it rose A small restaurant occupied the basement The first floor now closed seemed to house millinery or furs The second floor by the winking electric letters was the dentist s Above this a polyglot babel of signs struggled to indicate the abodes of palmists dressmakers musicians and doctors Still higher up draped curtains and milk bottles white on the window sills proclaimed the regions of domesticity After concluding his survey Rudolf walked briskly up the high flight of stone steps into the house Up two flights of the carpeted stairway he continued and at its top paused The hallway there was dimly lighted by two pale jets of gas one far to his right the other nearer to his left He looked toward the nearer light and saw within its wan halo a green door For one moment he hesitated then he seemed to see the contumelious sneer of the African juggler of cards and then he walked straight to the green door and knocked against it Moments like those that passed before his knock was answered measure the quick breath of true adventure What might not be behind those green panels Gamesters at play cunning rogues baiting their traps with subtle skill beauty in love with courage and thus planning to be sought by it danger death love disappointment ridicule any of these might respond to that temerarious rap A faint rustle was heard inside and the door slowly opened A girl not yet twenty stood there white faced and tottering She loosed the knob and swayed weakly groping with one hand Rudolf caught her and laid her on a faded couch that stood against the wall He closed the door and took a swift glance around the room by the light of a flickering gas jet Neat but extreme poverty was the story that he read The girl lay still as if in a faint Rudolf looked around the room excitedly for a barrel People must be rolled upon a barrel who no no that was for drowned persons He began to fan her with his hat That was successful for he struck her nose with the brim of his derby and she opened her eyes And then the young man saw that hers indeed was the one missing face from his heart s gallery of intimate portraits The frank grey eyes the little nose turning pertly outward the chestnut hair curling like the tendrils of a pea vine seemed the right end and reward of all his wonderful adventures But the face was wofully thin and pale The girl looked at him calmly and then smiled Fainted didn t I she asked weakly Well who wouldn t You try going without anything to eat for three days and see Himmel exclaimed Rudolf jumping up Wait till I come back He dashed out the green door and down the stairs In twenty minutes he was back again kicking at the door with his toe for her to open it With both arms he hugged an array of wares from the grocery and the restaurant On the table he laid them bread and butter cold meats cakes pies pickles oysters a roasted chicken a bottle of milk and one of red hot tea This is ridiculous said Rudolf blusteringly to go without eating You must quit making election bets of this kind Supper is ready He helped her to a chair at the table and asked Is there a cup for the tea On the shelf by the window she answered When he turned again with the cup he saw her with eyes shining rapturously beginning upon a huge Dill pickle that she had rooted out from the paper bags with a woman s unerring instinct He took it from her laughingly and poured the cup full of milk Drink that first he ordered and then you shall have some tea and then a chicken wing If you are very good you shall have a pickle to morrow And now if you ll allow me to be your guest we ll have supper He drew up the other chair The tea brightened the girl s eyes and brought back some of her colour She began to eat with a sort of dainty ferocity like some starved wild animal She seemed to regard the young man s presence and the aid he had rendered her as a natural thing not as though she undervalued the conventions but as one whose great stress gave her the right to put aside the artificial for the human But gradually with the return of strength and comfort came also a sense of the little conventions that belong and she began to tell him her little story It was one of a thousand such as the city yawns at every day the shop girl s story of insufficient wages further reduced by fines that go to swell the store s profits of time lost through illness and then of lost positions lost hope and the knock of the adventurer upon the green door But to Rudolf the history sounded as big as the Iliad or the crisis in Junie s Love Test To think of you going through all that he exclaimed It was something fierce said the girl solemnly And you have no relatives or friends in the city None whatever I am all alone in the world too said Rudolf after a pause I am glad of that said the girl promptly and somehow it pleased the young man to hear that she approved of his bereft condition Very suddenly her eyelids dropped and she sighed deeply I m awfully sleepy she said and I feel so good Then Rudolf rose and took his hat I ll say good night A long night s sleep will be fine for you He held out his hand and she took it and said good night But her eyes asked a question so eloquently so frankly and pathetically that he answered it with words Oh I m coming back to morrow to see how you are getting along You can t get rid of me so easily Then at the door as though the way of his coming had been so much less important than the fact that he had come she asked How did you come to knock at my door He looked at her for a moment remembering the cards and felt a sudden jealous pain What if they had fallen into other hands as adventurous as his Quickly he decided that she must never know the truth He would never let her know that he was aware of the strange expedient to which she had been driven by her great distress One of our piano tuners lives in this house he said I knocked at your door by mistake The last thing he saw in the room before the green door closed was her smile At the head of the stairway he paused and looked curiously about him And then he went along the hallway to its other end and coming back ascended to the floor above and continued his puzzled explorations Every door that he found in the house was painted green Wondering he descended to the sidewalk The fantastic African was still there Rudolf confronted him with his two cards in his hand Will you tell me why you gave me these cards and what they mean he asked In a broad good natured grin the negro exhibited a splendid advertisement of his master s profession Dar it is boss he said pointing down the street But I spect you is a little late for de fust act Looking the way he pointed Rudolf saw above the entrance to a theatre the blazing electric sign of its new play The Green Door I m informed dat it s a fust rate show sah said the negro De agent what represents it pussented me with a dollar sah to distribute a few of his cards along with de doctah s May I offer you one of de doctah s cards sah At the corner of the block in which he lived Rudolf stopped for a glass of beer and a cigar When he had come out with his lighted weed he buttoned his coat pushed back his hat and said stoutly to the lamp post on the corner All the same I believe it was the hand of Fate that doped out the way for me to find her Which conclusion under the circumstances certainly admits Rudolf Steiner to the ranks of the true followers of Romance and Adventure FROM THE CABBY S SEAT The cabby has his point of view It is more single minded perhaps than that of a follower of any other calling From the high swaying seat of his hansom he looks upon his fellow men as nomadic particles of no account except when possessed of migratory desires He is Jehu and you are goods in transit Be you President or vagabond to cabby you are only a Fare he takes you up cracks his whip joggles your vertebrae and sets you down When time for payment arrives if you exhibit a familiarity with legal rates you come to know what contempt is if you find that you have left your pocketbook behind you are made to realise the mildness of Dante s imagination It is not an extravagant theory that the cabby s singleness of purpose and concentrated view of life are the results of the hansom s peculiar construction The cock of the roost sits aloft like Jupiter on an unsharable seat holding your fate between two thongs of inconstant leather Helpless ridiculous confined bobbing like a toy mandarin you sit like a rat in a trap you before whom butlers cringe on solid land and must squeak upward through a slit in your peripatetic sarcophagus to make your feeble wishes known Then in a cab you are not even an occupant you are contents You are a cargo at sea and the cherub that sits up aloft has Davy Jones s street and number by heart One night there were sounds of revelry in the big brick tenement house next door but one to McGary s Family Cafe The sounds seemed to emanate from the apartments of the Walsh family The sidewalk was obstructed by an assortment of interested neighbours who opened a lane from time to time for a hurrying messenger bearing from McGary s goods pertinent to festivity and diversion The sidewalk contingent was engaged in comment and discussion from which it made no effort to eliminate the news that Norah Walsh was being married In the fulness of time there was an eruption of the merry makers to the sidewalk The uninvited guests enveloped and permeated them and upon the night air rose joyous cries congratulations laughter and unclassified noises born of McGary s oblations to the hymeneal scene Close to the curb stood Jerry O Donovan s cab Night hawk was Jerry called but no more lustrous or cleaner hansom than his ever closed its doors upon point lace and November violets And Jerry s horse I am within bounds when I tell you that he was stuffed with oats until one of those old ladies who leave their dishes unwashed at home and go about having expressmen arrested would have smiled yes smiled to have seen him Among the shifting sonorous pulsing crowd glimpses could be had of Jerry s high hat battered by the winds and rains of many years of his nose like a carrot battered by the frolicsome athletic progeny of millionaires and by contumacious fares of his brass buttoned green coat admired in the vicinity of McGary s It was plain that Jerry had usurped the functions of his cab and was carrying a load Indeed the figure may be extended and he be likened to a bread waggon if we admit the testimony of a youthful spectator who was heard to remark Jerry has got a bun From somewhere among the throng in the street or else out of the thin stream of pedestrians a young woman tripped and stood by the cab The professional hawk s eye of Jerry caught the movement He made a lurch for the cab overturning three or four onlookers and himself no he caught the cap of a water plug and kept his feet Like a sailor shinning up the ratlins during a squall Jerry mounted to his professional seat Once he was there McGary s liquids were baffled He seesawed on the mizzenmast of his craft as safe as a Steeple Jack rigged to the flagpole of a skyscraper Step in lady said Jerry gathering his lines The young woman stepped into the cab the doors shut with a bang Jerry s whip cracked in the air the crowd in the gutter scattered and the fine hansom dashed away crosstown When the oat spry horse had hedged a little his first spurt of speed Jerry broke the lid of his cab and called down through the aperture in the voice of a cracked megaphone trying to please Where now will ye be drivin to Anywhere you please came up the answer musical and contented Tis drivin for pleasure she is thought Jerry And then he suggested as a matter of course Take a thrip around in the park lady Twill be ilegant cool and fine Just as you like answered the fare pleasantly The cab headed for Fifth avenue and sped up that perfect street Jerry bounced and swayed in his seat The potent fluids of McGary were disquieted and they sent new fumes to his head He sang an ancient song of Killisnook and brandished his whip like a baton Inside the cab the fare sat up straight on the cushions looking to right and left at the lights and houses Even in the shadowed hansom her eyes shone like stars at twilight When they reached Fifty ninth street Jerry s head was bobbing and his reins were slack But his horse turned in through the park gate and began the old familiar nocturnal round And then the fare leaned back entranced and breathed deep the clean wholesome odours of grass and leaf and bloom And the wise beast in the shafts knowing his ground struck into his by the hour gait and kept to the right of the road Habit also struggled successfully against Jerry s increasing torpor He raised the hatch of his storm tossed vessel and made the inquiry that cabbies do make in the park Like shtop at the Cas sino lady Gezzer r freshm s n lish n the music Ev body shtops I think that would be nice said the fare They reined up with a plunge at the Casino entrance The cab doors flew open The fare stepped directly upon the floor At once she was caught in a web of ravishing music and dazzled by a panorama of lights and colours Some one slipped a little square card into her hand on which was printed a number thirty four She looked around and saw her cab twenty yards away already lining up in its place among the waiting mass of carriages cabs and motor cars And then a man who seemed to be all shirt front danced backward before her and next she was seated at a little table by a railing over which climbed a jessamine vine There seemed to be a wordless invitation to purchase she consulted a collection of small coins in a thin purse and received from them license to order a glass of beer There she sat inhaling and absorbing it all the new coloured new shaped life in a fairy palace in an enchanted wood At fifty tables sat princes and queens clad in all the silks and gems of the world And now and then one of them would look curiously at Jerry s fare They saw a plain figure dressed in a pink silk of the kind that is tempered by the word foulard and a plain face that wore a look of love of life that the queens envied Twice the long hands of the clocks went round Royalties thinned from their al fresco thrones and buzzed or clattered away in their vehicles of state The music retired into cases of wood and bags of leather and baize Waiters removed cloths pointedly near the plain figure sitting almost alone Jerry s fare rose and held out her numbered card simply Is there anything coming on the ticket she asked A waiter told her it was her cab check and that she should give it to the man at the entrance This man took it and called the number Only three hansoms stood in line The driver of one of them went and routed out Jerry asleep in his cab He swore deeply climbed to the captain s bridge and steered his craft to the pier His fare entered and the cab whirled into the cool fastnesses of the park along the shortest homeward cuts At the gate a glimmer of reason in the form of sudden suspicion seized upon Jerry s beclouded mind One or two things occurred to him He stopped his horse raised the trap and dropped his phonographic voice like a lead plummet through the aperture I want to see four dollars before goin any further on th thrip Have ye got th dough Four dollars laughed the fare softly dear me no I ve only got a few pennies and a dime or two Jerry shut down the trap and slashed his oat fed horse The clatter of hoofs strangled but could not drown the sound of his profanity He shouted choking and gurgling curses at the starry heavens he cut viciously with his whip at passing vehicles he scattered fierce and ever changing oaths and imprecations along the streets so that a late truck driver crawling homeward heard and was abashed But he knew his recourse and made for it at a gallop At the house with the green lights beside the steps he pulled up He flung wide the cab doors and tumbled heavily to the ground Come on you he said roughly His fare came forth with the Casino dreamy smile still on her plain face Jerry took her by the arm and led her into the police station A gray moustached sergeant looked keenly across the desk He and the cabby were no strangers Sargeant began Jerry in his old raucous martyred thunderous tones of complaint I ve got a fare here that Jerry paused He drew a knotted red hand across his brow The fog set up by McGary was beginning to clear away A fare sargeant he continued with a grin that I want to inthroduce to ye It s me wife that I married at ould man Walsh s this avening And a divil of a time we had tis thrue Shake hands wid th sargeant Norah and we ll be off to home Before stepping into the cab Norah sighed profoundly I

7337-92819-0040	train-other-500	my pen is not the kind intended for him I am no carpenter At ten minutes to seven Dulcie was ready She looked at herself in the wrinkly mirror The reflection was satisfactory The dark blue dress fitting without a wrinkle
7337-92819-0041	train-other-500	the hat with its jaunty black feather the but slightly soiled gloves all representing self denial even of food itself were vastly becoming Dulcie forgot everything else for a moment except that she was beautiful
7337-92819-0042	train-other-500	and that life was about to lift a corner of its mysterious veil for her to observe its wonders No gentleman had ever asked her out before Now she was going for a brief moment into the glitter and exalted show

7337-92819-0047	train-other-500	the only one there was to approve or condemn what she did Straight and slender and tall with a look of sorrowful reproach on his handsome melancholy face General Kitchener
7337-92819-0048	train-other-500	fixed his wonderful eyes on her out of his gilt photograph frame on the dresser Dulcie turned like an automatic doll to the landlady Tell him I can t go she said dully
none	none	 Tell him I m sick or something 
7337-92819-0049	train-other-500	Tell him I m not going out After the door was closed and locked Dulcie fell upon her bed crushing her black tip and cried for ten minutes General Kitchener was her only friend He was Dulcie s ideal of a gallant knight
7337-92819-0050	train-other-500	He looked as if he might have a secret sorrow and his wonderful moustache was a dream and she was a little afraid of that stern yet tender look in his eyes She used to have little fancies that he would call at the house sometime and ask for her
7337-92819-0051	train-other-500	with his sword clanking against his high boots Once when a boy was rattling a piece of chain against a lamp post
none	none	 she had opened the window and looked out 
7337-92819-0052	train-other-500	But there was no use She knew that General Kitchener was away over in Japan leading his army against the savage Turks and he would never step out of his gilt frame for her Yet one look from him had vanquished Piggy that night
7337-92819-0053	train-other-500	Yes for that night When her cry was over Dulcie got up and took off her best dress and put on her old blue kimono She wanted no dinner She sang two verses of Sammy
7337-92819-0054	train-other-500	Then she became intensely interested in a little red speck on the side of her nose And after that was attended to she drew up a chair to the rickety table and told her fortune with an old deck of cards
none	none	 The horrid impudent thing she said aloud 
7337-92819-0055	train-other-500	And I never gave him a word or a look to make him think it At nine o clock Dulcie took a tin box of crackers and a little pot of raspberry jam out of her trunk and had a feast She offered General Kitchener some jam on a cracker
none	none	 but he only looked at her as the sphinx would have looked at a butterfly 
7337-92819-0056	train-other-500	if there are butterflies in the desert Don t eat it if you don t want to said Dulcie
none	none	 And don t put on so many airs and scold so with your eyes 
7337-92819-0057	train-other-500	I wonder if you d be so superior and snippy if you had to live on six dollars a week
none	none	 It was not a good sign for Dulcie to be rude to General Kitchener And then she turned Benvenuto Cellini 
7337-92819-0058	train-other-500	face downward with a severe gesture
none	none	 But that was not inexcusable for she had always thought he was Henry VIII and she did not approve of him 
7337-92819-0059	train-other-500	At half past nine Dulcie took a last look at the pictures on the dresser
7337-92819-0060	train-other-500	turned out the light and skipped into bed It s an awful thing to go to bed with a good night look at General Kitchener William Muldoon the Duchess of Marlborough and Benvenuto Cellini This story really doesn t get anywhere at all The rest of it comes later
7337-92819-0061	train-other-500	sometime when Piggy asks Dulcie again to dine with him and she is feeling lonelier than usual and General Kitchener happens to be looking the other way and then As I said before
7337-92819-0062	train-other-500	I dreamed that I was standing near a crowd of prosperous looking angels
none	none	 and a policeman took me by the wing and asked if I belonged with them Who are they I asked Why said he they are the men who hired working girls and paid em five or six dollars a week to live on Are you one of the bunch Not on your immortality said I I m only the fellow that set fire to an orphan asylum and murdered a blind man for his pennies THE CALIPH CUPID AND THE CLOCK

1025_92820_000006_000000	train-clean-360	Prince Michael sat on his favourite bench and smiled 
1025_92820_000006_000001	train-clean-360	It was a diverting thought to him that he was wealthy enough to buy every one of those close ranged bulky window lit mansions that faced him if he chose

1025_92820_000006_000006	train-clean-360	For he had tasted of the fruit of the tree of life and finding it bitter in his mouth had stepped out of Eden for a time to seek distraction close to the unarmoured beating heart of the world

1025_92820_000008_000000	train-clean-360	And as Prince Michael s eye rested upon the glowing face of the great clock in the tower his smile altruistic as it was became slightly tinged with contempt

none	none	Brightly but the perpendicular line of perplexity between his brows was not smoothed away 
1025_92820_000012_000002	train-clean-360	He laughed and even then it did not 
1025_92820_000012_000003	train-clean-360	But he accepted the momentary diversion

none	none	Its face is that of a tyrant its numbers are false as those on a lottery ticket its hands are those of a bunco steerer who makes an appointment with you to your ruin Let me entreat you to throw off its humiliating bonds and to cease to order your affairs by that insensate monitor of brass and steel I don t usually said the young man
1025_92820_000016_000001	train-clean-360	 I carry a watch except when I ve got my radiant rags on 
none	none	I know human nature as I do the trees and grass said the Prince with earnest dignity
1025_92820_000017_000001	train-clean-360	 I am a master of philosophy a graduate in art and I hold the purse of a Fortunatus 
1025_92820_000017_000002	train-clean-360	There are few mortal misfortunes that I cannot alleviate or overcome 
none	none	I have read your countenance and found in it honesty and nobility as well as distress 
1025_92820_000017_000004	train-clean-360	I beg of you to accept my advice or aid 
none	none	Do not belie the intelligence I see in your face by judging from my appearance of my ability to defeat your troubles 
1025_92820_000018_000000	train-clean-360	The young man glanced at the clock again and frowned darkly 
none	none	When his gaze strayed from the glowing horologue of time it rested intently upon a four story red brick house in the row of dwellings opposite to where he sat 
1025_92820_000018_000002	train-clean-360	The shades were drawn and the lights in many rooms shone dimly through them 
1025_92820_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 Ten minutes to nine exclaimed the young man with an impatient gesture of despair 
none	none	He turned his back upon the house and took a rapid step or two in a contrary direction
1025_92820_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 Remain commanded Prince Michael in so potent a voice that the disturbed one wheeled around with a somewhat chagrined laugh 
none	none	I ll give her the ten minutes and then I m off he muttered and then aloud to the Prince I ll join you in confounding all clocks my friend and throw in women too
1025_92820_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 Sit down said the Prince calmly 
none	none	I do not accept your addition Women are the natural enemies of clocks and therefore the allies of those who would seek liberation from these monsters that measure our follies and limit our pleasures 
1025_92820_000022_000002	train-clean-360	If you will so far confide in me I would ask you to relate to me your story 
1025_92820_000023_000000	train-clean-360	The young man threw himself upon the bench with a reckless laugh 
1025_92820_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 Your Royal Highness I will he said in tones of mock deference 
1025_92820_000024_000001	train-clean-360	 Do you see yonder house the one with three upper windows lighted 
none	none	Well at six o clock I stood in that house with the young lady I am that is I was engaged to 
1025_92820_000024_000003	train-clean-360	I had been doing wrong my dear Prince I had been a naughty boy and she had heard of it 
1025_92820_000024_000004	train-clean-360	I wanted to be forgiven of course we are always wanting women to forgive us aren t we Prince 
1025_92820_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 I want time to think it over said she 
1025_92820_000025_000001	train-clean-360	 There is one thing certain I will either fully forgive you or I will never see your face again There will be no half way business 
1025_92820_000025_000002	train-clean-360	At half past eight she said at exactly half past eight you may be watching the middle upper window of the top floor 
1025_92820_000025_000003	train-clean-360	If I decide to forgive I will hang out of that window a white silk scarf 
1025_92820_000025_000004	train-clean-360	You will know by that that all is as was before and you may come to me 
none	none	If you see no scarf you may consider that everything between us is ended forever That concluded the young man bitterly is why I have been watching that clock 
1025_92820_000025_000006	train-clean-360	The time for the signal to appear has passed twenty three minutes ago 
1025_92820_000025_000007	train-clean-360	Do you wonder that I am a little disturbed my Prince of Rags and Whiskers 
1025_92820_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 Let me repeat to you said Prince Michael in his even well modulated tones that women are the natural enemies of clocks 
1025_92820_000026_000001	train-clean-360	Clocks are an evil women a blessing 
none	none	The signal may yet appear
1025_92820_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 Never on your principality exclaimed the young man hopelessly 
1025_92820_000027_000001	train-clean-360	 You don t know Marian of course 
1025_92820_000027_000002	train-clean-360	She s always on time to the minute 
1025_92820_000027_000003	train-clean-360	That was the first thing about her that attracted me 
1025_92820_000027_000004	train-clean-360	I ve got the mitten instead of the scarf 
none	none	I ought to have known at eight point thirty one that my goose was cooked I ll go West on the eleven point forty five to night with Jack Milburn 
1025_92820_000027_000007	train-clean-360	The jig s up 
1025_92820_000027_000008	train-clean-360	I ll try Jack s ranch awhile and top off with the Klondike and whiskey 
none	none	Good night er er Prince 
1025_92820_000028_000000	train-clean-360	Prince Michael smiled his enigmatic gentle comprehending smile and caught the coat sleeve of the other 
none	none	The brilliant light in the Prince s eyes was softening to a dreamier cloudy translucence
1025_92820_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 Wait he said solemnly till the clock strikes 
1025_92820_000029_000001	train-clean-360	I have wealth and power and knowledge above most men but when the clock strikes I am afraid 
1025_92820_000029_000002	train-clean-360	Stay by me until then 
1025_92820_000029_000003	train-clean-360	This woman shall be yours 
1025_92820_000029_000004	train-clean-360	You have the word of the hereditary Prince of Valleluna 
none	none	On the day of your marriage I will give you one hundred thousand dollars and a palace on the Hudson 
1025_92820_000029_000006	train-clean-360	But there must be no clocks in that palace they measure our follies and limit our pleasures 
1025_92820_000029_000007	train-clean-360	Do you agree to that 
none	none	Of course said the young man cheerfully they re a nuisance anyway always ticking and striking and getting you late for dinner 
1025_92820_000031_000000	train-clean-360	He glanced again at the clock in the tower 
1025_92820_000031_000001	train-clean-360	The hands stood at three minutes to nine 
1025_92820_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 I think said Prince Michael that I will sleep a little 
1025_92820_000032_000001	train-clean-360	The day has been fatiguing 
none	none	He stretched himself upon a bench with the manner of one who had slept thus before You will find me in this park on any evening when the weather is suitable said the Prince sleepily
1025_92820_000034_000001	train-clean-360	 Come to me when your marriage day is set and I will give you a cheque for the money 
none	none	Thanks Your Highness said the young man seriously
1025_92820_000035_000001	train-clean-360	 It doesn t look as if I would need that palace on the Hudson but I appreciate your offer just the same 
none	none	Prince Michael sank into deep slumber 
1025_92820_000036_000001	train-clean-360	His battered hat rolled from the bench to the ground 
1025_92820_000036_000002	train-clean-360	The young man lifted it placed it over the frowsy face and moved one of the grotesquely relaxed limbs into a more comfortable position 
none	none	Poor devil he said as he drew the tattered clothes closer about the Prince s breast 
1025_92820_000037_000000	train-clean-360	Sonorous and startling came the stroke of nine from the clock tower 
1025_92820_000037_000001	train-clean-360	The young man sighed again turned his face for one last look at the house of his relinquished hopes and cried aloud profane words of holy rapture 
none	none	From the middle upper window blossomed in the dusk a waving snowy fluttering wonderful divine emblem of forgiveness and promised joy By came a citizen rotund comfortable home hurrying unknowing of the delights of waving silken scarfs on the borders of dimly lit parks Will you oblige me with the time sir asked the young man and the citizen shrewdly conjecturing his watch to be safe dragged it out and announced
1025_92820_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 Twenty nine and a half minutes past eight sir 
1025_92820_000042_000000	train-clean-360	And then from habit he glanced at the clock in the tower and made further oration 
1025_92820_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 By George that clock s half an hour fast 
none	none	First time in ten years I ve known it to be off 
1025_92820_000043_000002	train-clean-360	This watch of mine never varies a 
none	none	But the citizen was talking to vacancy He turned and saw his hearer a fast receding black shadow flying in the direction of a house with three lighted upper windows And in the morning came along two policemen on their way to the beats they owned 
1025_92820_000045_000001	train-clean-360	The park was deserted save for one dilapidated figure that sprawled asleep on a bench 
1025_92820_000045_000002	train-clean-360	They stopped and gazed upon it 
1025_92820_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 It s Dopy Mike said one 
1025_92820_000046_000001	train-clean-360	 He hits the pipe every night 
1025_92820_000046_000002	train-clean-360	Park bum for twenty years 
none	none	On his last legs I guess 
1025_92820_000047_000000	train-clean-360	The other policeman stooped and looked at something crumpled and crisp in the hand of the sleeper 
none	none	Gee he remarked
1025_92820_000048_000001	train-clean-360	 He s doped out a fifty dollar bill anyway 
1025_92820_000048_000002	train-clean-360	Wish I knew the brand of hop that he smokes 
none	none	And then Rap rap rap went the club of realism against the shoe soles of Prince Michael of the Electorate of Valleluna SISTERS OF THE GOLDEN CIRCLE The Rubberneck Auto was about ready to start The merry top riders had been assigned to their seats by the gentlemanly conductor The sidewalk was blockaded with sightseers who had gathered to stare at sightseers justifying the natural law that every creature on earth is preyed upon by some other creature The megaphone man raised his instrument of torture the inside of the great automobile began to thump and throb like the heart of a coffee drinker The top riders nervously clung to the seats the old lady from Valparaiso Indiana shrieked to be put ashore But before a wheel turns listen to a brief preamble through the cardiaphone which shall point out to you an object of interest on life s sightseeing tour Swift and comprehensive is the recognition of white man for white man in African wilds instant and sure is the spiritual greeting between mother and babe unhesitatingly do master and dog commune across the slight gulf between animal and man immeasurably quick and sapient are the brief messages between one and one s beloved But all these instances set forth only slow and groping interchange of sympathy and thought beside one other instance which the Rubberneck coach shall disclose You shall learn if you have not learned already what two beings of all earth s living inhabitants most quickly look into each other s hearts and souls when they meet face to face The gong whirred and the Glaring at Gotham car moved majestically upon its instructive tour On the highest rear seat was James Williams of Cloverdale Missouri and his Bride Capitalise it friend typo that last word word of words in the epiphany of life and love The scent of the flowers the booty of the bee the primal drip of spring waters the overture of the lark the twist of lemon peel on the cocktail of creation such is the bride Holy is the wife revered the mother galliptious is the summer girl but the bride is the certified check among the wedding presents that the gods send in when man is married to mortality The car glided up the Golden Way On the bridge of the great cruiser the captain stood trumpeting the sights of the big city to his passengers Wide mouthed and open eared they heard the sights of the metropolis thundered forth to their eyes Confused delirious with excitement and provincial longings they tried to make ocular responses to the megaphonic ritual In the solemn spires of spreading cathedrals they saw the home of the Vanderbilts in the busy bulk of the Grand Central depot they viewed wonderingly the frugal cot of Russell Sage Bidden to observe the highlands of the Hudson they gaped unsuspecting at the upturned mountains of a new laid sewer To many the elevated railroad was the Rialto on the stations of which uniformed men sat and made chop suey of your tickets And to this day in the outlying districts many have it that Chuck Connors with his hand on his heart leads reform and that but for the noble municipal efforts of one Parkhurst a district attorney the notorious Bishop Potter gang would have destroyed law and order from the Bowery to the Harlem River But I beg you to observe missus James Williams Hattie Chalmers that was once the belle of Cloverdale Pale blue is the bride s if she will and this colour she had honoured Willingly had the moss rosebud loaned to her cheeks of its pink and as for the violet her eyes will do very well as they are thank you A useless strip of white chaf oh no he was guiding the auto car of white chiffon or perhaps it was grenadine or tulle was tied beneath her chin pretending to hold her bonnet in place But you know as well as I do that the hatpins did the work And on missus James Williams s face was recorded a little library of the world s best thoughts in three volumes Volume No one contained the belief that James Williams was about the right sort of thing Volume No two was an essay on the world declaring it to be a very excellent place Volume No three disclosed the belief that in occupying the highest seat in a Rubberneck auto they were travelling the pace that passes all understanding James Williams you would have guessed was about twenty four It will gratify you to know that your estimate was so accurate He was exactly twenty three years eleven months and twenty nine days old He was well built active strong jawed good natured and rising He was on his wedding trip Dear kind fairy please cut out those orders for money and forty H P touring cars and fame and a new growth of hair and the presidency of the boat club Instead of any of them turn backward oh turn backward and give us just a teeny weeny bit of our wedding trip over again Just an hour dear fairy so we can remember how the grass and poplar trees looked and the bow of those bonnet strings tied beneath her chin even if it was the hatpins that did the work Can t do it Very well hurry up with that touring car and the oil stock then Just in front of missus James Williams sat a girl in a loose tan jacket and a straw hat adorned with grapes and roses Only in dreams and milliners shops do we alas gather grapes and roses at one swipe This girl gazed with large blue eyes credulous when the megaphone man roared his doctrine that millionaires were things about which we should be concerned Between blasts she resorted to Epictetian philosophy in the form of pepsin chewing gum At this girl s right hand sat a young man about twenty four He was well built active strong jawed and good natured But if his description seems to follow that of James Williams divest it of anything Cloverdalian This man belonged to hard streets and sharp corners He looked keenly about him seeming to begrudge the asphalt under the feet of those upon whom he looked down from his perch While the megaphone barks at a famous hostelry let me whisper you through the low tuned cardiaphone to sit tight for now things are about to happen and the great city will close over them again as over a scrap of ticker tape floating down from the den of a Broad street bear The girl in the tan jacket twisted around to view the pilgrims on the last seat The other passengers she had absorbed the seat behind her was her Bluebeard s chamber Her eyes met those of missus James Williams Between two ticks of a watch they exchanged their life s experiences histories hopes and fancies And all mind you with the eye before two men could have decided whether to draw steel or borrow a match The bride leaned forward low She and the girl spoke rapidly together their tongues moving quickly like those of two serpents a comparison that is not meant to go further Two smiles and a dozen nods closed the conference And now in the broad quiet avenue in front of the Rubberneck car a man in dark clothes stood with uplifted hand From the sidewalk another hurried to join him The girl in the fruitful hat quickly seized her companion by the arm and whispered in his ear That young man exhibited proof of ability to act promptly Crouching low he slid over the edge of the car hung lightly for an instant and then disappeared Half a dozen of the top riders observed his feat wonderingly but made no comment deeming it prudent not to express surprise at what might be the conventional manner of alighting in this bewildering city The truant passenger dodged a hansom and then floated past like a leaf on a stream between a furniture van and a florist s delivery wagon The girl in the tan jacket turned again and looked in the eyes of missus James Williams Then she faced about and sat still while the Rubberneck auto stopped at the flash of the badge under the coat of the plainclothes man What s eatin you demanded the megaphonist abandoning his professional discourse for pure English Keep her at anchor for a minute ordered the officer There s a man on board we want a Philadelphia burglar called Pinky McGuire There he is on the back seat Look out for the side Donovan Donovan went to the hind wheel and looked up at James Williams Come down old sport he said pleasantly We ve got you Back to Sleepytown for yours It ain t a bad idea hidin on a Rubberneck though I ll remember that Softly through the megaphone came the advice of the conductor Better step off sir and explain The car must proceed on its tour James Williams belonged among the level heads With necessary slowness he picked his way through the passengers down to the steps at the front of the car His wife followed but she first turned her eyes and saw the escaped tourist glide from behind the furniture van and slip behind a tree on the edge of the little park not fifty feet away Descended to the ground James Williams faced his captors with a smile He was thinking what a good story he would have to tell in Cloverdale about having been mistaken for a burglar The Rubberneck coach lingered out of respect for its patrons What could be a more interesting sight than this My name is James Williams of Cloverdale Missouri he said kindly so that they would not be too greatly mortified I have letters here that will show You ll come with us please announced the plainclothes man Pinky McGuire s description fits you like flannel washed in hot suds A detective saw you on the Rubberneck up at Central Park and phoned down to take you in Do your explaining at the station house James Williams s wife his bride of two weeks looked him in the face with a strange soft radiance in her eyes and a flush on her cheeks looked him in the face and said Go with em quietly Pinky and maybe it ll be in your favour And then as the Glaring at Gotham car rolled away she turned and threw a kiss his wife threw a kiss at some one high up on the seats of the Rubberneck Your girl gives you good advice McGuire said Donovan Come on now And then madness descended upon and occupied James Williams He pushed his hat far upon the back of his head My wife seems to think I am a burglar he said recklessly I never heard of her being crazy therefore I must be And if I m crazy they can t do anything to me for killing you two fools in my madness Whereupon he resisted arrest so cheerfully and industriously that cops had to be whistled for and afterwards the reserves to disperse a few thousand delighted spectators At the station house the desk sergeant asked for his name McDoodle the Pink or Pinky the Brute I forget which was James Williams s answer But you can bet I m a burglar don t leave that out And you might add that it took five of em to pluck the Pink I d especially like to have that in the records In an hour came missus James Williams with Uncle Thomas of Madison Avenue in a respect compelling motor car and proofs of the hero s innocence for all the world like the third act of a drama backed by an automobile mfg company After the police had sternly reprimanded James Williams for imitating a copyrighted burglar and given him as honourable a discharge as the department was capable of missus Williams rearrested him and swept him into an angle of the station house James Williams regarded her with one eye He always said that Donovan closed the other while somebody was holding his good right hand Never before had he given her a word of reproach or of reproof If you can explain he began rather stiffly why you Dear she interrupted listen It was an hour s pain and trial to you I did it for her I mean the girl who spoke to me on the coach I was so happy Jim so happy with you that I didn t dare to refuse that happiness to another Jim they were married only this morning those two and I wanted him to get away While they were struggling with you I saw him slip from behind his tree and hurry across the park That s all of it dear I had to do it Thus does one sister of the plain gold band know another who stands in the enchanted light that shines but once and briefly for each one By rice and satin bows does mere man become aware of weddings But bride knoweth bride at the glance of an eye And between them swiftly passes comfort and meaning in a language that man and widows wot not of THE ROMANCE OF A BUSY BROKER 
7223-92822-0000	train-other-500	Pitcher confidential clerk in the office of Harvey Maxwell broker allowed a look of mild interest and surprise to visit his usually expressionless countenance when his employer briskly entered at half past nine
7223-92822-0001	train-other-500	in company with his young lady stenographer With a snappy Good morning Pitcher Maxwell dashed at his desk as though he were intending to leap over it and then plunged into the great heap of letters and telegrams waiting there for him
7223-92822-0002	train-other-500	The young lady had been Maxwell s stenographer for a year She was beautiful in a way that was decidedly unstenographic She forewent the pomp of the alluring pompadour
7223-92822-0003	train-other-500	She wore no chains bracelets or lockets She had not the air of being about to accept an invitation to luncheon Her dress was grey and plain but it fitted her figure with fidelity and discretion
7223-92822-0004	train-other-500	In her neat black turban hat was the gold green wing of a macaw On this morning she was softly and shyly radiant Her eyes were dreamily bright her cheeks genuine peachblow her expression a happy one
none	none	 tinged with reminiscence 
7223-92822-0005	train-other-500	Pitcher still mildly curious noticed a difference in her ways this morning Instead of going straight into the adjoining room where her desk was she lingered slightly irresolute in the outer office
7223-92822-0006	train-other-500	Once she moved over by Maxwell s desk near enough for him to be aware of her presence The machine sitting at that desk was no longer a man it was a busy New York broker moved by buzzing wheels
7223-92822-0007	train-other-500	and uncoiling springs Well what is it Anything asked Maxwell sharply His opened mail lay like a bank of stage snow on his crowded desk His keen grey eye
7223-92822-0008	train-other-500	impersonal and brusque flashed upon her half impatiently Nothing answered the stenographer moving away with a little smile mister Pitcher she said to the confidential clerk
7223-92822-0009	train-other-500	did mister Maxwell say anything yesterday about engaging another stenographer He did answered Pitcher He told me to get another one I notified the agency yesterday afternoon to send over a few samples this morning
none	none	 It s nine point forty five o clock 
7223-92822-0010	train-other-500	and not a single picture hat or piece of pineapple chewing gum has showed up yet I will do the work as usual then said the young lady until some one comes to fill the place And she went to her desk at once
7223-92822-0011	train-other-500	and hung the black turban hat with the gold green macaw wing in its accustomed place He who has been denied the spectacle of a busy Manhattan broker during a rush of business is handicapped for the profession of anthropology
7223-92822-0012	train-other-500	The poet sings of the crowded hour of glorious life The broker s hour is not only crowded but the minutes and seconds are hanging to all the straps and packing both front and rear platforms
7223-92822-0013	train-other-500	And this day was Harvey Maxwell s busy day The ticker began to reel out jerkily its fitful coils of tape the desk telephone had a chronic attack of buzzing Men began to throng into the office
none	none	 and call at him over the railing 
7223-92822-0014	train-other-500	jovially sharply viciously excitedly Messenger boys ran in and out with messages and telegrams The clerks in the office jumped about like sailors during a storm
7223-92822-0015	train-other-500	Even Pitcher s face relaxed into something resembling animation On the Exchange there were hurricanes and landslides and snowstorms and glaciers and volcanoes and those elemental disturbances
7223-92822-0016	train-other-500	were reproduced in miniature in the broker s offices Maxwell shoved his chair against the wall and transacted business after the manner of a toe dancer He jumped from ticker to phone
7223-92822-0017	train-other-500	from desk to door with the trained agility of a harlequin
none	none	 In the midst of this growing and important stress 
7223-92822-0018	train-other-500	the broker became suddenly aware of a high rolled fringe of golden hair under a nodding canopy of velvet and ostrich tips an imitation sealskin sacque and a string of beads as large as hickory nuts
7223-92822-0019	train-other-500	ending near the floor with a silver heart There was a self possessed young lady connected with these accessories and Pitcher was there to construe her Lady from the Stenographer s Agency to see about the position said Pitcher Maxwell turned half around
7223-92822-0020	train-other-500	with his hands full of papers and ticker tape What position he asked with a frown Position of stenographer said Pitcher You told me yesterday to call them up and have one sent over this morning You are losing your mind Pitcher said Maxwell
none	none	 Why should I have given you any such instructions 
7223-92822-0021	train-other-500	Miss Leslie has given perfect satisfaction during the year she has been here The place is hers as long as she chooses to retain it There s no place open here madam Countermand that order with the agency Pitcher and don t bring any more of em in here
7223-92822-0022	train-other-500	The silver heart left the office swinging and banging itself independently against the office furniture as it indignantly departed Pitcher seized a moment to remark to the bookkeeper
7223-92822-0023	train-other-500	that the old man seemed to get more absent minded and forgetful every day of the world The rush and pace of business grew fiercer and faster On the floor they were pounding half a dozen stocks in which Maxwell s customers were heavy investors

7223-92822-0027	train-other-500	with a fountain pen over his right ear and his hair hanging in disorderly strings over his forehead His window was open for the beloved janitress Spring had turned on a little warmth through the waking registers of the earth
7223-92822-0028	train-other-500	And through the window came a wandering perhaps a lost odour a delicate sweet odour of lilac that fixed the broker for a moment immovable For this odour belonged to Miss Leslie
7223-92822-0029	train-other-500	it was her own and hers only The odour brought her vividly almost tangibly before him The world of finance dwindled suddenly to a speck And she was in the next room

7223-92822-0032	train-other-500	Maxwell leaned one elbow on her desk He still clutched fluttering papers with both hands and the pen was above his ear Miss Leslie he began hurriedly I have but a moment to spare

none	none	 I was frightened at first Don t you remember Harvey We were married last evening at eight o clock in the Little Church Around the Corner AFTER TWENTY YEARS The policeman on the beat moved up the avenue impressively The impressiveness was habitual and not for show for spectators were few The time was barely ten o clock at night but chilly gusts of wind with a taste of rain in them had well nigh de peopled the streets Trying doors as he went twirling his club with many intricate and artful movements turning now and then to cast his watchful eye adown the pacific thoroughfare the officer with his stalwart form and slight swagger made a fine picture of a guardian of the peace The vicinity was one that kept early hours Now and then you might see the lights of a cigar store or of an all night lunch counter but the majority of the doors belonged to business places that had long since been closed When about midway of a certain block the policeman suddenly slowed his walk In the doorway of a darkened hardware store a man leaned with an unlighted cigar in his mouth As the policeman walked up to him the man spoke up quickly It s all right officer he said reassuringly I m just waiting for a friend It s an appointment made twenty years ago Sounds a little funny to you doesn t it Well I ll explain if you d like to make certain it s all straight About that long ago there used to be a restaurant where this store stands Big Joe Brady s restaurant Until five years ago said the policeman It was torn down then The man in the doorway struck a match and lit his cigar The light showed a pale square jawed face with keen eyes and a little white scar near his right eyebrow His scarfpin was a large diamond oddly set Twenty years ago to night said the man I dined here at Big Joe Brady s with Jimmy Wells my best chum and the finest chap in the world He and I were raised here in New York just like two brothers together I was eighteen and Jimmy was twenty The next morning I was to start for the West to make my fortune You couldn t have dragged Jimmy out of New York he thought it was the only place on earth Well we agreed that night that we would meet here again exactly twenty years from that date and time no matter what our conditions might be or from what distance we might have to come We figured that in twenty years each of us ought to have our destiny worked out and our fortunes made whatever they were going to be It sounds pretty interesting said the policeman Rather a long time between meets though it seems to me Haven t you heard from your friend since you left Well yes for a time we corresponded said the other But after a year or two we lost track of each other You see the West is a pretty big proposition and I kept hustling around over it pretty lively But I know Jimmy will meet me here if he s alive for he always was the truest stanchest old chap in the world He ll never forget I came a thousand miles to stand in this door to night and it s worth it if my old partner turns up The waiting man pulled out a handsome watch the lids of it set with small diamonds Three minutes to ten he announced It was exactly ten o clock when we parted here at the restaurant door Did pretty well out West didn t you asked the policeman You bet I hope Jimmy has done half as well He was a kind of plodder though good fellow as he was I ve had to compete with some of the sharpest wits going to get my pile A man gets in a groove in New York It takes the West to put a razor edge on him The policeman twirled his club and took a step or two I ll be on my way Hope your friend comes around all right Going to call time on him sharp I should say not said the other I ll give him half an hour at least If Jimmy is alive on earth he ll be here by that time So long officer Good night sir said the policeman passing on along his beat trying doors as he went There was now a fine cold drizzle falling and the wind had risen from its uncertain puffs into a steady blow The few foot passengers astir in that quarter hurried dismally and silently along with coat collars turned high and pocketed hands And in the door of the hardware store the man who had come a thousand miles to fill an appointment uncertain almost to absurdity with the friend of his youth smoked his cigar and waited About twenty minutes he waited and then a tall man in a long overcoat with collar turned up to his ears hurried across from the opposite side of the street He went directly to the waiting man Is that you Bob he asked doubtfully Is that you Jimmy Wells cried the man in the door Bless my heart exclaimed the new arrival grasping both the other s hands with his own It s Bob sure as fate I was certain I d find you here if you were still in existence Well well well twenty years is a long time The old restaurant s gone Bob I wish it had lasted so we could have had another dinner there How has the West treated you old man Bully it has given me everything I asked it for You ve changed lots Jimmy I never thought you were so tall by two or three inches Oh I grew a bit after I was twenty Doing well in New York Jimmy Moderately I have a position in one of the city departments Come on Bob we ll go around to a place I know of and have a good long talk about old times The two men started up the street arm in arm The man from the West his egotism enlarged by success was beginning to outline the history of his career The other submerged in his overcoat listened with interest At the corner stood a drug store brilliant with electric lights When they came into this glare each of them turned simultaneously to gaze upon the other s face The man from the West stopped suddenly and released his arm You re not Jimmy Wells he snapped Twenty years is a long time but not long enough to change a man s nose from a Roman to a pug It sometimes changes a good man into a bad one said the tall man You ve been under arrest for ten minutes Silky Bob Chicago thinks you may have dropped over our way and wires us she wants to have a chat with you Going quietly are you That s sensible Now before we go on to the station here s a note I was asked to hand you You may read it here at the window It s from Patrolman Wells The man from the West unfolded the little piece of paper handed him His hand was steady when he began to read but it trembled a little by the time he had finished The note was rather short Bob I was at the appointed place on time When you struck the match to light your cigar I saw it was the face of the man wanted in Chicago Somehow I couldn t do it myself so I went around and got a plain clothes man to do the job JIMMY LOST ON DRESS PARADE mister Towers chandler was pressing his evening suit in his hall bedroom One iron was heating on a small gas stove the other was being pushed vigorously back and forth to make the desirable crease that would be seen later on extending in straight lines from mister Chandler s patent leather shoes to the edge of his low cut vest So much of the hero s toilet may be intrusted to our confidence The remainder may be guessed by those whom genteel poverty has driven to ignoble expedient Our next view of him shall be as he descends the steps of his lodging house immaculately and correctly clothed calm assured handsome in appearance the typical new york young clubman setting out slightly bored to inaugurate the pleasures of the evening Chandler s honorarium was eighteen dollars per week He was employed in the office of an architect He was twenty two years old he considered architecture to be truly an art and he honestly believed though he would not have dared to admit it in New York that the Flatiron Building was inferior in design to the great cathedral in Milan Out of each week s earnings Chandler set aside one dollar At the end of each ten weeks with the extra capital thus accumulated he purchased one gentleman s evening from the bargain counter of stingy old Father Time He arrayed himself in the regalia of millionaires and presidents he took himself to the quarter where life is brightest and showiest and there dined with taste and luxury With ten dollars a man may for a few hours play the wealthy idler to perfection The sum is ample for a well considered meal a bottle bearing a respectable label commensurate tips a smoke cab fare and the ordinary etceteras This one delectable evening culled from each dull seventy was to Chandler a source of renascent bliss To the society bud comes but one debut it stands alone sweet in her memory when her hair has whitened but to Chandler each ten weeks brought a joy as keen as thrilling as new as the first had been To sit among bon vivants under palms in the swirl of concealed music to look upon the habitues of such a paradise and to be looked upon by them what is a girl s first dance and short sleeved tulle compared with this Up Broadway Chandler moved with the vespertine dress parade For this evening he was an exhibit as well as a gazer For the next sixty nine evenings he would be dining in cheviot and worsted at dubious table d hotes at whirlwind lunch counters on sandwiches and beer in his hall bedroom He was willing to do that for he was a true son of the great city of razzle dazzle and to him one evening in the limelight made up for many dark ones Chandler protracted his walk until the Forties began to intersect the great and glittering primrose way for the evening was yet young and when one is of the beau monde only one day in seventy one loves to protract the pleasure Eyes bright sinister curious admiring provocative alluring were bent upon him for his garb and air proclaimed him a devotee to the hour of solace and pleasure At a certain corner he came to a standstill proposing to himself the question of turning back toward the showy and fashionable restaurant in which he usually dined on the evenings of his especial luxury Just then a girl scuddled lightly around the corner slipped on a patch of icy snow and fell plump upon the sidewalk Chandler assisted her to her feet with instant and solicitous courtesy The girl hobbled to the wall of the building leaned against it and thanked him demurely I think my ankle is strained she said It twisted when I fell Does it pain you much inquired Chandler Only when I rest my weight upon it I think I will be able to walk in a minute or two If I can be of any further service suggested the young man I will call a cab or Thank you said the girl softly but heartily I am sure you need not trouble yourself any further It was so awkward of me And my shoe heels are horridly common sense I can t blame them at all Chandler looked at the girl and found her swiftly drawing his interest She was pretty in a refined way and her eye was both merry and kind She was inexpensively clothed in a plain black dress that suggested a sort of uniform such as shop girls wear Her glossy dark brown hair showed its coils beneath a cheap hat of black straw whose only ornament was a velvet ribbon and bow She could have posed as a model for the self respecting working girl of the best type A sudden idea came into the head of the young architect He would ask this girl to dine with him Here was the element that his splendid but solitary periodic feasts had lacked His brief season of elegant luxury would be doubly enjoyable if he could add to it a lady s society This girl was a lady he was sure her manner and speech settled that And in spite of her extremely plain attire he felt that he would be pleased to sit at table with her These thoughts passed swiftly through his mind and he decided to ask her It was a breach of etiquette of course but oftentimes wage earning girls waived formalities in matters of this kind They were generally shrewd judges of men and thought better of their own judgment than they did of useless conventions His ten dollars discreetly expended would enable the two to dine very well indeed The dinner would no doubt be a wonderful experience thrown into the dull routine of the girl s life and her lively appreciation of it would add to his own triumph and pleasure I think he said to her with frank gravity that your foot needs a longer rest than you suppose Now I am going to suggest a way in which you can give it that and at the same time do me a favour I was on my way to dine all by my lonely self when you came tumbling around the corner You come with me and we ll have a cozy dinner and a pleasant talk together and by that time your game ankle will carry you home very nicely I am sure The girl looked quickly up into Chandler s clear pleasant countenance Her eyes twinkled once very brightly and then she smiled ingenuously But we don t know each other it wouldn t be right would it she said doubtfully There is nothing wrong about it said the young man candidly I ll introduce myself permit me mister Towers Chandler After our dinner which I will try to make as pleasant as possible I will bid you good evening or attend you safely to your door whichever you prefer But dear me said the girl with a glance at Chandler s faultless attire In this old dress and hat Never mind that said Chandler cheerfully I m sure you look more charming in them than any one we shall see in the most elaborate dinner toilette My ankle does hurt yet admitted the girl attempting a limping step I think I will accept your invitation mister Chandler You may call me Miss Marian Come then Miss Marian said the young architect gaily but with perfect courtesy you will not have far to walk There is a very respectable and good restaurant in the next block You will have to lean on my arm so and walk slowly It is lonely dining all by one s self I m just a little bit glad that you slipped on the ice When the two were established at a well appointed table with a promising waiter hovering in attendance Chandler began to experience the real joy that his regular outing always brought to him The restaurant was not so showy or pretentious as the one further down Broadway which he always preferred but it was nearly so The tables were well filled with prosperous looking diners there was a good orchestra playing softly enough to make conversation a possible pleasure and the cuisine and service were beyond criticism His companion even in her cheap hat and dress held herself with an air that added distinction to the natural beauty of her face and figure And it is certain that she looked at Chandler with his animated but self possessed manner and his kindling and frank blue eyes with something not far from admiration in her own charming face Then it was that the Madness of Manhattan the frenzy of Fuss and Feathers the Bacillus of Brag the Provincial Plague of Pose seized upon Towers Chandler He was on Broadway surrounded by pomp and style and there were eyes to look at him On the stage of that comedy he had assumed to play the one night part of a butterfly of fashion and an idler of means and taste He was dressed for the part and all his good angels had not the power to prevent him from acting it So he began to prate to Miss Marian of clubs of teas of golf and riding and kennels and cotillions and tours abroad and threw out hints of a yacht lying at Larchmont He could see that she was vastly impressed by this vague talk so he endorsed his pose by random insinuations concerning great wealth and mentioned familiarly a few names that are handled reverently by the proletariat It was Chandler s short little day and he was wringing from it the best that could be had as he saw it And yet once or twice he saw the pure gold of this girl shine through the mist that his egotism had raised between him and all objects This way of living that you speak of she said sounds so futile and purposeless Haven t you any work to do in the world that might interest you more My dear Miss Marian he exclaimed work Think of dressing every day for dinner of making half a dozen calls in an afternoon with a policeman at every corner ready to jump into your auto and take you to the station if you get up any greater speed than a donkey cart s gait We do nothings are the hardest workers in the land The dinner was concluded the waiter generously fed and the two walked out to the corner where they had met Miss Marian walked very well now her limp was scarcely noticeable Thank you for a nice time she said frankly I must run home now I liked the dinner very much mister Chandler He shook hands with her smiling cordially and said something about a game of bridge at his club He watched her for a moment walking rather rapidly eastward and then he found a cab to drive him slowly homeward In his chilly bedroom Chandler laid away his evening clothes for a sixty nine days rest He went about it thoughtfully That was a stunning girl he said to himself She s all right too I d be sworn even if she does have to work Perhaps if I d told her the truth instead of all that razzle dazzle we might but confound it I had to play up to my clothes Thus spoke the brave who was born and reared in the wigwams of the tribe of the Manhattans The girl after leaving her entertainer sped swiftly cross town until she arrived at a handsome and sedate mansion two squares to the east facing on that avenue which is the highway of Mammon and the auxiliary gods Here she entered hurriedly and ascended to a room where a handsome young lady in an elaborate house dress was looking anxiously out the window Oh you madcap exclaimed the elder girl when the other entered When will you quit frightening us this way It is two hours since you ran out in that rag of an old dress and Marie s hat Mamma has been so alarmed She sent Louis in the auto to try to find you You are a bad thoughtless Puss The elder girl touched a button and a maid came in a moment Marie tell mamma that Miss Marian has returned Don t scold sister I only ran down to Mme Theo s to tell her to use mauve insertion instead of pink My costume and Marie s hat were just what I needed Every one thought I was a shopgirl I am sure Dinner is over dear you stayed so late I know I slipped on the sidewalk and turned my ankle I could not walk so I hobbled into a restaurant and sat there until I was better That is why I was so long The two girls sat in the window seat looking out at the lights and the stream of hurrying vehicles in the avenue The younger one cuddled down with her head in her sister s lap We will have to marry some day she said dreamily both of us We have so much money that we will not be allowed to disappoint the public Do you want me to tell you the kind of a man I could love Sis Go on you scatterbrain smiled the other I could love a man with dark and kind blue eyes who is gentle and respectful to poor girls who is handsome and good and does not try to flirt But I could love him only if he had an ambition an object some work to do in the world I would not care how poor he was if I could help him build his way up But sister dear the kind of man we always meet the man who lives an idle life between society and his clubs I could not love a man like that even if his eyes were blue and he were ever so kind to poor girls whom he met in the street BY COURIER It was neither the season nor the hour when the Park had frequenters and it is likely that the young lady who was seated on one of the benches at the side of the walk had merely obeyed a sudden impulse to sit for a while and enjoy a foretaste of coming Spring She rested there pensive and still A certain melancholy that touched her countenance must have been of recent birth for it had not yet altered the fine and youthful contours of her cheek nor subdued the arch though resolute curve of her lips A tall young man came striding through the park along the path near which she sat Behind him tagged a boy carrying a suit case At sight of the young lady the man s face changed to red and back to pale again He watched her countenance as he drew nearer with hope and anxiety mingled on his own He passed within a few yards of her but he saw no evidence that she was aware of his presence or existence Some fifty yards further on he suddenly stopped and sat on a bench at one side The boy dropped the suit case and stared at him with wondering shrewd eyes The young man took out his handkerchief and wiped his brow It was a good handkerchief a good brow and the young man was good to look at He said to the boy I want you to take a message to that young lady on that bench Tell her I am on my way to the station to leave for San Francisco where I shall join that Alaska moose hunting expedition Tell her that since she has commanded me neither to speak nor to write to her I take this means of making one last appeal to her sense of justice for the sake of what has been Tell her that to condemn and discard one who has not deserved such treatment without giving him her reasons or a chance to explain is contrary to her nature as I believe it to be Tell her that I have thus to a certain degree disobeyed her injunctions in the hope that she may yet be inclined to see justice done Go and tell her that The young man dropped a half dollar into the boy s hand The boy looked at him for a moment with bright canny eyes out of a dirty intelligent face and then set off at a run He approached the lady on the bench a little doubtfully but unembarrassed He touched the brim of the old plaid bicycle cap perched on the back of his head The lady looked at him coolly without prejudice or favour Lady he said dat gent on de oder bench sent yer a song and dance by me If yer don t know de guy and he s tryin to do de Johnny act say de word and I ll call a cop in t ree minutes If yer does know him and he s on de square w y I ll spiel yer de bunch of hot air he sent yer The young lady betrayed a faint interest A song and dance she said in a deliberate sweet voice that seemed to clothe her words in a diaphanous garment of impalpable irony A new idea in the troubadour line I suppose I used to know the gentleman who sent you so I think it will hardly be necessary to call the police You may execute your song and dance but do not sing too loudly It is a little early yet for open air vaudeville and we might attract attention Awe said the boy with a shrug down the length of him yer know what I mean lady Tain t a turn it s wind He told me to tell yer he s got his collars and cuffs in dat grip for a scoot clean out to Frisco Den he s goin to shoot snow birds in de Klondike He says yer told him not to send round no more pink notes nor come hangin over de garden gate and he takes dis means of puttin yer wise He says yer refereed him out like a has been and never give him no chance to kick at de decision He says yer swiped him and never said why The slightly awakened interest in the young lady s eyes did not abate Perhaps it was caused by either the originality or the audacity of the snow bird hunter in thus circumventing her express commands against the ordinary modes of communication She fixed her eye on a statue standing disconsolate in the dishevelled park and spoke into the transmitter Tell the gentleman that I need not repeat to him a description of my ideals He knows what they have been and what they still are So far as they touch on this case absolute loyalty and truth are the ones paramount Tell him that I have studied my own heart as well as one can and I know its weakness as well as I do its needs That is why I decline to hear his pleas whatever they may be I did not condemn him through hearsay or doubtful evidence and that is why I made no charge But since he persists in hearing what he already well knows you may convey the matter Tell him that I entered the conservatory that evening from the rear to cut a rose for my mother Tell him I saw him and Miss Ashburton beneath the pink oleander The tableau was pretty but the pose and juxtaposition were too eloquent and evident to require explanation I left the conservatory and at the same time the rose and my ideal You may carry that song and dance to your impresario I m shy on one word lady Jux jux put me wise on dat will yer Juxtaposition or you may call it propinquity or if you like being rather too near for one maintaining the position of an ideal The gravel spun from beneath the boy s feet He stood by the other bench The man s eyes interrogated him hungrily The boy s were shining with the impersonal zeal of the translator De lady says dat she s on to de fact dat gals is dead easy when a feller comes spielin ghost stories and tryin to make up and dat s why she won t listen to no soft soap She says she caught yer dead to rights huggin a bunch o calico in de hot house She side stepped in to pull some posies and yer was squeezin de oder gal to beat de band She says it looked cute all right all right but it made her sick She says yer better git busy and make a sneak for de train The young man gave a low whistle and his eyes flashed with a sudden thought His hand flew to the inside pocket of his coat and drew out a handful of letters Selecting one he handed it to the boy following it with a silver dollar from his vest pocket Give that letter to the lady he said and ask her to read it Tell her that it should explain the situation Tell her that if she had mingled a little trust with her conception of the ideal much heartache might have been avoided Tell her that the loyalty she prizes so much has never wavered Tell her I am waiting for an answer The messenger stood before the lady De gent says he s had de ski bunk put on him widout no cause He says he s no bum guy and lady yer read dat letter and I ll bet yer he s a white sport all right The young lady unfolded the letter somewhat doubtfully and read it DEAR doctor ARNOLD I want to thank you for your most kind and opportune aid to my daughter last Friday evening when she was overcome by an attack of her old heart trouble in the conservatory at missus Waldron s reception Had you not been near to catch her as she fell and to render proper attention we might have lost her I would be glad if you would call and undertake the treatment of her case Gratefully yours ROBERT ASHBURTON The young lady refolded the letter and handed it to the boy De gent wants an answer said the messenger Wot s de word The lady s eyes suddenly flashed on him bright smiling and wet Tell that guy on the other bench she said with a happy tremulous laugh that his girl wants him THE FURNISHED ROOM Restless shifting fugacious as time itself is a certain vast bulk of the population of the red brick district of the lower West Side Homeless they have a hundred homes They flit from furnished room to furnished room transients forever transients in abode transients in heart and mind They sing Home Sweet Home in ragtime they carry their lares et penates in a bandbox their vine is entwined about a picture hat a rubber plant is their fig tree Hence the houses of this district having had a thousand dwellers should have a thousand tales to tell mostly dull ones no doubt but it would be strange if there could not be found a ghost or two in the wake of all these vagrant guests One evening after dark a young man prowled among these crumbling red mansions ringing their bells At the twelfth he rested his lean hand baggage upon the step and wiped the dust from his hatband and forehead The bell sounded faint and far away in some remote hollow depths To the door of this the twelfth house whose bell he had rung came a housekeeper who made him think of an unwholesome surfeited worm that had eaten its nut to a hollow shell and now sought to fill the vacancy with edible lodgers He asked if there was a room to let Come in said the housekeeper Her voice came from her throat her throat seemed lined with fur I have the third floor back vacant since a week back Should you wish to look at it The young man followed her up the stairs A faint light from no particular source mitigated the shadows of the halls They trod noiselessly upon a stair carpet that its own loom would have forsworn It seemed to have become vegetable to have degenerated in that rank sunless air to lush lichen or spreading moss that grew in patches to the staircase and was viscid under the foot like organic matter At each turn of the stairs were vacant niches in the wall Perhaps plants had once been set within them If so they had died in that foul and tainted air It may be that statues of the saints had stood there but it was not difficult to conceive that imps and devils had dragged them forth in the darkness and down to the unholy depths of some furnished pit below This is the room said the housekeeper from her furry throat It s a nice room It ain t often vacant I had some most elegant people in it last summer no trouble at all and paid in advance to the minute The water s at the end of the hall Sprowls and Mooney kept it three months They done a vaudeville sketch Miss B retta Sprowls you may have heard of her Oh that was just the stage names right there over the dresser is where the marriage certificate hung framed The gas is here and you see there is plenty of closet room It s a room everybody likes It never stays idle long Do you have many theatrical people rooming here asked the young man They comes and goes A good proportion of my lodgers is connected with the theatres Yes sir this is the theatrical district Actor people never stays long anywhere I get my share Yes they comes and they goes He engaged the room paying for a week in advance He was tired he said and would take possession at once He counted out the money The room had been made ready she said even to towels and water As the housekeeper moved away he put for the thousandth time the question that he carried at the end of his tongue A young girl Miss Vashner Miss Eloise Vashner do you remember such a one among your lodgers She would be singing on the stage most likely A fair girl of medium height and slender with reddish gold hair and a dark mole near her left eyebrow No I don t remember the name Them stage people has names they change as often as their rooms They comes and they goes No I don t call that one to mind No Always no Five months of ceaseless interrogation and the inevitable negative So much time spent by day in questioning managers agents schools and choruses by night among the audiences of theatres from all star casts down to music halls so low that he dreaded to find what he most hoped for He who had loved her best had tried to find her He was sure that since her disappearance from home this great water girt city held her somewhere but it was like a monstrous quicksand shifting its particles constantly with no foundation its upper granules of to day buried to morrow in ooze and slime The furnished room received its latest guest with a first glow of pseudo hospitality a hectic haggard perfunctory welcome like the specious smile of a demirep The sophistical comfort came in reflected gleams from the decayed furniture the ragged brocade upholstery of a couch and two chairs a foot wide cheap pier glass between the two windows from one or two gilt picture frames and a brass bedstead in a corner The guest reclined inert upon a chair while the room confused in speech as though it were an apartment in Babel tried to discourse to him of its divers tenantry A polychromatic rug like some brilliant flowered rectangular tropical islet lay surrounded by a billowy sea of soiled matting Upon the gay papered wall were those pictures that pursue the homeless one from house to house The Huguenot Lovers The First Quarrel The Wedding Breakfast Psyche at the Fountain The mantel s chastely severe outline was ingloriously veiled behind some pert drapery drawn rakishly askew like the sashes of the Amazonian ballet Upon it was some desolate flotsam cast aside by the room s marooned when a lucky sail had borne them to a fresh port a trifling vase or two pictures of actresses a medicine bottle some stray cards out of a deck One by one as the characters of a cryptograph become explicit the little signs left by the furnished room s procession of guests developed a significance The threadbare space in the rug in front of the dresser told that lovely woman had marched in the throng Tiny finger prints on the wall spoke of little prisoners trying to feel their way to sun and air A splattered stain raying like the shadow of a bursting bomb witnessed where a hurled glass or bottle had splintered with its contents against the wall Across the pier glass had been scrawled with a diamond in staggering letters the name Marie It seemed that the succession of dwellers in the furnished room had turned in fury perhaps tempted beyond forbearance by its garish coldness and wreaked upon it their passions The furniture was chipped and bruised the couch distorted by bursting springs seemed a horrible monster that had been slain during the stress of some grotesque convulsion Some more potent upheaval had cloven a great slice from the marble mantel Each plank in the floor owned its particular cant and shriek as from a separate and individual agony It seemed incredible that all this malice and injury had been wrought upon the room by those who had called it for a time their home and yet it may have been the cheated home instinct surviving blindly the resentful rage at false household gods that had kindled their wrath A hut that is our own we can sweep and adorn and cherish The young tenant in the chair allowed these thoughts to file soft shod through his mind while there drifted into the room furnished sounds and furnished scents He heard in one room a tittering and incontinent slack laughter in others the monologue of a scold the rattling of dice a lullaby and one crying dully above him a banjo tinkled with spirit Doors banged somewhere the elevated trains roared intermittently a cat yowled miserably upon a back fence And he breathed the breath of the house a dank savour rather than a smell a cold musty effluvium as from underground vaults mingled with the reeking exhalations of linoleum and mildewed and rotten woodwork Then suddenly as he rested there the room was filled with the strong sweet odour of mignonette It came as upon a single buffet of wind with such sureness and fragrance and emphasis that it almost seemed a living visitant And the man cried aloud What dear as if he had been called and sprang up and faced about The rich odour clung to him and wrapped him around He reached out his arms for it all his senses for the time confused and commingled How could one be peremptorily called by an odour Surely it must have been a sound But was it not the sound that had touched that had caressed him She has been in this room he cried and he sprang to wrest from it a token for he knew he would recognize the smallest thing that had belonged to her or that she had touched This enveloping scent of mignonette the odour that she had loved and made her own whence came it The room had been but carelessly set in order Scattered upon the flimsy dresser scarf were half a dozen hairpins those discreet indistinguishable friends of womankind feminine of gender infinite of mood and uncommunicative of tense These he ignored conscious of their triumphant lack of identity Ransacking the drawers of the dresser he came upon a discarded tiny ragged handkerchief He pressed it to his face It was racy and insolent with heliotrope he hurled it to the floor In another drawer he found odd buttons a theatre programme a pawnbroker s card two lost marshmallows a book on the divination of dreams In the last was a woman s black satin hair bow which halted him poised between ice and fire But the black satin hair bow also is femininity s demure impersonal common ornament and tells no tales And then he traversed the room like a hound on the scent skimming the walls considering the corners of the bulging matting on his hands and knees rummaging mantel and tables the curtains and hangings the drunken cabinet in the corner for a visible sign unable to perceive that she was there beside around against within above him clinging to him wooing him calling him so poignantly through the finer senses that even his grosser ones became cognisant of the call Once again he answered loudly Yes dear and turned wild eyed to gaze on vacancy for he could not yet discern form and colour and love and outstretched arms in the odour of mignonette Oh God whence that odour and since when have odours had a voice to call Thus he groped He burrowed in crevices and corners and found corks and cigarettes These he passed in passive contempt But once he found in a fold of the matting a half smoked cigar and this he ground beneath his heel with a green and trenchant oath He sifted the room from end to end He found dreary and ignoble small records of many a peripatetic tenant but of her whom he sought and who may have lodged there and whose spirit seemed to hover there he found no trace And then he thought of the housekeeper He ran from the haunted room downstairs and to a door that showed a crack of light She came out to his knock He smothered his excitement as best he could Will you tell me madam he besought her who occupied the room I have before I came Yes sir I can tell you again Twas Sprowls and Mooney as I said Miss B retta Sprowls it was in the theatres but Missis Mooney she was My house is well known for respectability The marriage certificate hung framed on a nail over What kind of a lady was Miss Sprowls in looks I mean Why black haired sir short and stout with a comical face They left a week ago Tuesday And before they occupied it Why there was a single gentleman connected with the draying business He left owing me a week Before him was Missis Crowder and her two children that stayed four months and back of them was old mister Doyle whose sons paid for him He kept the room six months That goes back a year sir and further I do not remember He thanked her and crept back to his room The room was dead The essence that had vivified it was gone The perfume of mignonette had departed In its place was the old stale odour of mouldy house furniture of atmosphere in storage The ebbing of his hope drained his faith He sat staring at the yellow singing gaslight Soon he walked to the bed and began to tear the sheets into strips With the blade of his knife he drove them tightly into every crevice around windows and door When all was snug and taut he turned out the light turned the gas full on again and laid himself gratefully upon the bed It was missus McCool s night to go with the can for beer So she fetched it and sat with missus Purdy in one of those subterranean retreats where house keepers foregather and the worm dieth seldom I rented out my third floor back this evening said missus Purdy across a fine circle of foam A young man took it He went up to bed two hours ago Now did ye missus Purdy ma am said missus McCool with intense admiration You do be a wonder for rentin rooms of that kind And did ye tell him then she concluded in a husky whisper laden with mystery Rooms said missus Purdy in her furriest tones are furnished for to rent I did not tell him missus McCool Tis right ye are ma am tis by renting rooms we kape alive Ye have the rale sense for business ma am There be many people will rayjict the rentin of a room if they be tould a suicide has been after dyin in the bed of it As you say we has our living to be making remarked missus Purdy Yis ma am tis true Tis just one wake ago this day I helped ye lay out the third floor back A pretty slip of a colleen she was to be killin herself wid the gas a swate little face she had missus Purdy ma am She d a been called handsome as you say said missus Purdy assenting but critical but for that mole she had a growin by her left eyebrow Do fill up your glass again missus McCool THE BRIEF DEBUT OF TILDY If you do not know Bogle s Chop House and Family Restaurant it is your loss For if you are one of the fortunate ones who dine expensively you should be interested to know how the other half consumes provisions And if you belong to the half to whom waiters checks are things of moment you should know Bogle s for there you get your money s worth in quantity at least Bogle s is situated in that highway of bourgeoisie that boulevard of Brown Jones and Robinson Eighth Avenue There are two rows of tables in the room six in each row On each table is a caster stand containing cruets of condiments and seasons From the pepper cruet you may shake a cloud of something tasteless and melancholy like volcanic dust From the salt cruet you may expect nothing Though a man should extract a sanguinary stream from the pallid turnip yet will his prowess be balked when he comes to wrest salt from Bogle s cruets Also upon each table stands the counterfeit of that benign sauce made from the recipe of a nobleman in India At the cashier s desk sits Bogle cold sordid slow smouldering and takes your money Behind a mountain of toothpicks he makes your change files your check and ejects at you like a toad a word about the weather Beyond a corroboration of his meteorological statement you would better not venture You are not Bogle s friend you are a fed transient customer and you and he may not meet again until the blowing of Gabriel s dinner horn So take your change and go to the devil if you like There you have Bogle s sentiments The needs of Bogle s customers were supplied by two waitresses and a Voice One of the waitresses was named Aileen She was tall beautiful lively gracious and learned in persiflage Her other name There was no more necessity for another name at Bogle s than there was for finger bowls The name of the other waitress was Tildy Why do you suggest Matilda Please listen this time Tildy Tildy Tildy was dumpy plain faced and too anxious to please to please Repeat the last clause to yourself once or twice and make the acquaintance of the duplicate infinite The Voice at Bogle s was invisible It came from the kitchen and did not shine in the way of originality It was a heathen Voice and contented itself with vain repetitions of exclamations emitted by the waitresses concerning food Will it tire you to be told again that Aileen was beautiful Had she donned a few hundred dollars worth of clothes and joined the Easter parade and had you seen her you would have hastened to say so yourself The customers at Bogle s were her slaves Six tables full she could wait upon at once They who were in a hurry restrained their impatience for the joy of merely gazing upon her swiftly moving graceful figure They who had finished eating ate more that they might continue in the light of her smiles Every man there and they were mostly men tried to make his impression upon her Aileen could successfully exchange repartee against a dozen at once And every smile that she sent forth lodged like pellets from a scatter gun in as many hearts And all this while she would be performing astounding feats with orders of pork and beans pot roasts ham and sausage and the wheats and any quantity of things on the iron and in the pan and straight up and on the side With all this feasting and flirting and merry exchange of wit Bogle s came mighty near being a salon with Aileen for its Madame Recamier If the transients were entranced by the fascinating Aileen the regulars were her adorers There was much rivalry among many of the steady customers Aileen could have had an engagement every evening At least twice a week some one took her to a theatre or to a dance One stout gentleman whom she and Tildy had privately christened The Hog presented her with a turquoise ring Another one known as Freshy who rode on the Traction Company s repair wagon was going to give her a poodle as soon as his brother got the hauling contract in the Ninth And the man who always ate spareribs and spinach and said he was a stock broker asked her to go to Parsifal with him I don t know where this place is said Aileen while talking it over with Tildy but the wedding ring s got to be on before I put a stitch into a travelling dress ain t that right Well I guess But Tildy In steaming chattering cabbage scented Bogle s there was almost a heart tragedy Tildy with the blunt nose the hay coloured hair the freckled skin the bag o meal figure had never had an admirer Not a man followed her with his eyes when she went to and fro in the restaurant save now and then when they glared with the beast hunger for food None of them bantered her gaily to coquettish interchanges of wit None of them loudly jollied her of mornings as they did Aileen accusing her when the eggs were slow in coming of late hours in the company of envied swains No one had ever given her a turquoise ring or invited her upon a voyage to mysterious distant Parsifal Tildy was a good waitress and the men tolerated her They who sat at her tables spoke to her briefly with quotations from the bill of fare and then raised their voices in honeyed and otherwise flavoured accents eloquently addressed to the fair Aileen They writhed in their chairs to gaze around and over the impending form of Tildy that Aileen s pulchritude might season and make ambrosia of their bacon and eggs And Tildy was content to be the unwooed drudge if Aileen could receive the flattery and the homage The blunt nose was loyal to the short Grecian She was Aileen s friend and she was glad to see her rule hearts and wean the attention of men from smoking pot pie and lemon meringue But deep below our freckles and hay coloured hair the unhandsomest of us dream of a prince or a princess not vicarious but coming to us alone There was a morning when Aileen tripped in to work with a slightly bruised eye and Tildy s solicitude was almost enough to heal any optic Fresh guy explained Aileen last night as I was going home at Twenty third and Sixth Sashayed up so he did and made a break I turned him down cold and he made a sneak but followed me down to Eighteenth and tried his hot air again Gee but I slapped him a good one side of the face Then he give me that eye Does it look real awful Til I should hate that mister Nicholson should see it when he comes in for his tea and toast at ten Tildy listened to the adventure with breathless admiration No man had ever tried to follow her She was safe abroad at any hour of the twenty four What bliss it must have been to have had a man follow one and black one s eye for love Among the customers at Bogle s was a young man named Seeders who worked in a laundry office mister Seeders was thin and had light hair and appeared to have been recently rough dried and starched He was too diffident to aspire to Aileen s notice so he usually sat at one of Tildy s tables where he devoted himself to silence and boiled weakfish One day when mister Seeders came in to dinner he had been drinking beer There were only two or three customers in the restaurant When mister Seeders had finished his weakfish he got up put his arm around Tildy s waist kissed her loudly and impudently walked out upon the street snapped his fingers in the direction of the laundry and hied himself to play pennies in the slot machines at the Amusement Arcade For a few moments Tildy stood petrified Then she was aware of Aileen shaking at her an arch forefinger and saying Why Til you naughty girl Ain t you getting to be awful Miss Slyboots First thing I know you ll be stealing some of my fellows I must keep an eye on you my lady Another thing dawned upon Tildy s recovering wits In a moment she had advanced from a hopeless lowly admirer to be an Eve sister of the potent Aileen She herself was now a man charmer a mark for Cupid a Sabine who must be coy when the Romans were at their banquet boards Man had found her waist achievable and her lips desirable The sudden and amatory Seeders had as it were performed for her a miraculous piece of one day laundry work He had taken the sackcloth of her uncomeliness had washed dried starched and ironed it and returned it to her sheer embroidered lawn the robe of Venus herself The freckles on Tildy s cheeks merged into a rosy flush Now both Circe and Psyche peeped from her brightened eyes Not even Aileen herself had been publicly embraced and kissed in the restaurant Tildy could not keep the delightful secret When trade was slack she went and stood at Bogle s desk Her eyes were shining she tried not to let her words sound proud and boastful A gentleman insulted me to day she said He hugged me around the waist and kissed me That so said Bogle cracking open his business armour After this week you get a dollar a week more At the next regular meal when Tildy set food before customers with whom she had acquaintance she said to each of them modestly as one whose merit needed no bolstering A gentleman insulted me to day in the restaurant He put his arm around my waist and kissed me The diners accepted the revelation in various ways some incredulously some with congratulations others turned upon her the stream of badinage that had hitherto been directed at Aileen alone And Tildy s heart swelled in her bosom for she saw at last the towers of Romance rise above the horizon of the grey plain in which she had for so long travelled For two days mister Seeders came not again During that time Tildy established herself firmly as a woman to be wooed She bought ribbons and arranged her hair like Aileen s and tightened her waist two inches She had a thrilling but delightful fear that mister Seeders would rush in suddenly and shoot her with a pistol He must have loved her desperately and impulsive lovers are always blindly jealous Even Aileen had not been shot at with a pistol And then Tildy rather hoped that he would not shoot at her for she was always loyal to Aileen and she did not want to overshadow her friend At four o clock on the afternoon of the third day mister Seeders came in There were no customers at the tables At the back end of the restaurant Tildy was refilling the mustard pots and Aileen was quartering pies mister Seeders walked back to where they stood Tildy looked up and saw him gasped and pressed the mustard spoon against her heart A red hair bow was in her hair she wore Venus s Eighth Avenue badge the blue bead necklace with the swinging silver symbolic heart mister Seeders was flushed and embarrassed He plunged one hand into his hip pocket and the other into a fresh pumpkin pie Miss Tildy said he I want to apologise for what I done the other evenin Tell you the truth I was pretty well tanked up or I wouldn t of done it I wouldn t do no lady that a way when I was sober So I hope Miss Tildy you ll accept my pology and believe that I wouldn t of done it if I d known what I was doin and hadn t of been drunk With this handsome plea mister Seeders backed away and departed feeling that reparation had been made But behind the convenient screen Tildy had thrown herself flat upon a table among the butter chips and the coffee cups and was sobbing her heart out out and back again to the grey plain wherein travel they with blunt noses and hay coloured hair From her knot she had torn the red hair bow and cast it upon the floor Seeders she despised utterly she had but taken his kiss as that of a pioneer and prophetic prince who might have set the clocks going and the pages to running in fairyland But the kiss had been maudlin and unmeant the court had not stirred at the false alarm she must forevermore remain the Sleeping Beauty Yet not all was lost Aileen s arm was around her and Tildy s red hand groped among the butter chips till it found the warm clasp of her friend s Don t you fret Til said Aileen who did not understand entirely That turnip faced little clothespin of a Seeders ain t worth it He ain t anything of a gentleman or he wouldn t ever of apologised END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE FOUR MILLION This file should be
