James to convert Rochester Dismission of Rochester Dismission of Clarendon Tyrconnel Lord Deputy Dismay of the English Colonists in Ireland Effect of the Fall of the Hydes JAMES was now at the height of power and prosperity Both in England and in Scotland he had vanquished his enemies and had punished them with a severity which had indeed excited their bitterest hatred but had at the same time effectually quelled their courage The Whig party seemed extinct The name of Whig was never used except as a term of reproach The Parliament was devoted to the King and it was in his power to keep that Parliament to the end of his reign The Church was louder than ever in professions of attachment to him and had during the late insurrection acted up to those professions The Judges were his tools and if they ceased to be so it was in his power to remove them The corporations were filled with his creatures His revenues far exceeded those of his predecessors His pride rose high He was not the same man who a few months before in doubt whether his throne might not be overturned in a hour had implored foreign help with unkingly supplications and had accepted it with tears of gratitude Visions of dominion and glory rose before him He already saw himself in imagination the umpire of Europe the champion of many states oppressed by one too powerful monarchy So early as the month of June he had assured the United Provinces that as soon as the affairs of England were settled he would show the world how little he feared France In conformity with these assurances he within a month after the battle of Sedgemoor concluded with the States General a defensive treaty framed in the very spirit of the Triple League It was regarded both at the Hague and at Versailles as a most significant circumstance that Halifax who was the constant and mortal enemy of French ascendency and who had scarcely ever before been consulted on any grave affair since the beginning of the reign took the lead on this occasion and seemed to have the royal ear It was a circumstance not less significant that no previous communication was made to Barillon Both he and his master were taken by surprise Lewis was much troubled and expressed great and not unreasonable anxiety as to the ulterior designs of the prince who had lately been his pensioner and vassal There were strong rumours that William of Orange was busied in organizing a great confederacy which was to include both branches of the House of Austria the United Provinces the kingdom of Sweden and the electorate of Brandenburg It now seemed that this confederacy would have at its head the King and Parliament of England In fact negotiations tending to such a result were actually opened Spain proposed to form a close alliance with James and he listened to the proposition with favour though it was evident that such an alliance would be little less than a declaration of war against France But he postponed his final decision till after the Parliament should have reassembled The fate of Christendom depended on the temper in which he might then find the Commons If they were disposed to acquiesce in his plans of domestic government there would be nothing to prevent him from interfering with vigour and authority in the great dispute which must soon be brought to an issue on the Continent If they were refractory he must relinquish all thought of arbitrating between contending nations must again implore French assistance must again submit to French dictation must sink into a potentate of the third or fourth class and must indemnify himself for the contempt with which he would be regarded abroad by triumphs over law and public opinion at home one It seemed indeed that it would not be easy for him to demand more than the Commons were disposed to give Already they had abundantly proved that they were desirous to maintain his prerogatives unimpaired and that they were by no means extreme to mark his encroachments on the rights of the people Indeed eleven twelfths of the members were either dependents of the court or zealous Cavaliers from the country There were few things which such an assembly could pertinaciously refuse to the Sovereign and happily for the nation those few things were the very things on which James had set his heart One of his objects was to obtain a repeal of the Habeas Corpus Act which he hated as it was natural that a tyrant should hate the most stringent curb that ever legislation imposed on tyranny This feeling remained deeply fixed in his mind to the last and appears in the instructions which he drew up in exile for the guidance of his son two But the Habeas Corpus Act though passed during the ascendency of the Whigs was not more dear to the Whigs than to the Tories It is indeed not wonderful that this great law should be highly prized by all Englishmen without distinction of party for it is a law which not by circuitous but by direct operation adds to the security and happiness of every inhabitant of the realm three James had yet another design odious to the party which had set him on the throne and which had upheld him there He wished to form a great standing army He had taken advantage of the late insurrection to make large additions to the military force which his brother had left The bodies now designated as the first six regiments of dragoon guards the third and fourth regiments of dragoons and the nine regiments of infantry of the line from the seventh to the fifteenth inclusive had just been raised four The effect of these augmentations and of the recall of the garrison of Tangier was that the number of regular troops in England had in a few months been increased from six thousand to near twenty thousand No English King had ever in time of peace had such a force at his command Yet even with this force James was not content He often repeated that no confidence could be placed in the fidelity of the train bands that they sympathized with all the passions of the class to which they belonged that at Sedgemoor there had been more militia men in the rebel army than in the royal encampment and that if the throne had been defended only by the array of the counties Monmouth would have marched in triumph from Lyme to London The revenue large as it was when compared with that of former Kings barely sufficed to meet this new charge A great part of the produce of the new taxes was absorbed by the naval expenditure At the close of the late reign the whole cost of the army the Tangier regiments included had been under three hundred thousand pounds a year Six hundred thousand pounds a year would not now suffice five If any further augmentation were made it would be necessary to demand a supply from Parliament and it was not likely that Parliament would be in a complying mood The very name of standing army was hateful to the whole nation and to no part of the nation more hateful than to the Cavalier gentlemen who filled the Lower House In their minds a standing army was inseparably associated with the Rump with the Protector with the spoliation of the Church with the purgation of the Universities with the abolition of the peerage with the murder of the King with the sullen reign of the Saints with cant and asceticism with fines and sequestrations with the insults which Major Generals sprung from the dregs of the people had offered to the oldest and most honourable families of the kingdom There was moreover scarcely a baronet or a squire in the Parliament who did not owe part of his importance in his own county to his rank in the militia If that national force were set aside the gentry of England must lose much of their dignity and influence It was therefore probable that the King would find it more difficult to obtain funds for the support of his army than even to obtain the repeal of the Habeas Corpus Act But both the designs which have been mentioned were subordinate to one great design on which the King s whole soul was bent but which was abhorred by those Tory gentlemen who were ready to shed their blood for his rights abhorred by that Church which had never during three generations of civil discord wavered in fidelity to his house abhorred even by that army on which in the last extremity he must rely His religion was still under proscription Many rigorous laws against Roman Catholics appeared on the Statute Book and had within no long time been rigorously executed The Test Act excluded from civil and military office all who dissented from the Church of England and by a subsequent Act passed when the fictions of Oates had driven the nation wild it had been provided that no person should sit in either House of Parliament without solemnly abjuring the doctrine of transubstantiation That the King should wish to obtain for the Church to which he belonged a complete toleration was natural and right nor is there any reason to doubt that by a little patience prudence and justice such a toleration might have been obtained The extreme antipathy and dread with which the English people regarded his religion was not to be ascribed solely or chiefly to theological animosity That salvation might be found in the Church of Rome nay that some members of that Church had been among the brightest examples of Christian virtue was admitted by all divines of the Anglican communion and by the most illustrious Nonconformists It is notorious that the penal laws against Popery were strenuously defended by many who thought Arianism Quakerism and Judaism more dangerous in a spiritual point of view than Popery and who yet showed no disposition to enact similar laws against Arians Quakers or Jews It is easy to explain why the Roman Catholic was treated with less indulgence than was shown to men who renounced the doctrine of the Nicene fathers and even to men who had not been admitted by baptism within the Christian pale There was among the English a strong conviction that the Roman Catholic where the interests of his religion were concerned thought himself free from all the ordinary rules of morality nay that he thought it meritorious to violate those rules if by so doing he could avert injury or reproach from the Church of which he was a member Nor was this opinion destitute of a show of reason It was impossible to deny that Roman Catholic casuists of great eminence had written in defence of equivocation of mental reservation of perjury and even of assassination Nor it was said had the speculations of this odious school of sophists been barren of results The massacre of Saint Bartholomew the murder of the first William of Orange the murder of Henry the Third of France the numerous conspiracies which had been formed against the life of Elizabeth and above all the gunpowder treason were constantly cited as instances of the close connection between vicious theory and vicious practice It was alleged that every one of these crimes had been prompted or applauded by Roman Catholic divines The letters which Everard Digby wrote in lemon juice from the Tower to his wife had recently been published and were often quoted He was a scholar and a gentleman upright in all ordinary dealings and strongly impressed with a sense of duty to God Yet he had been deeply concerned in the plot for blowing up King Lords and Commons and had on the brink of eternity declared that it was incomprehensible to him how any Roman Catholic should think such a design sinful The inference popularly drawn from these things was that however fair the general character of a Papist might be there was no excess of fraud or cruelty of which he was not capable when the safety and honour of his Church were at stake The extraordinary success of the fables of Oates is to be chiefly ascribed to the prevalence of this opinion It was to no purpose that the accused Roman Catholic appealed to the integrity humanity and loyalty which he had shown through the whole course of his life It was to no purpose that he called crowds of respectable witnesses of his own persuasion to contradict monstrous romances invented by the most infamous of mankind It was to no purpose that with the halter round his neck he invoked on himself the whole vengeance of the God before whom in a few moments he must appear if he had been guilty of meditating any ill to his prince or to his Protestant fellow countrymen The evidence which he produced in his favour proved only how little Popish oaths were worth His very virtues raised a presumption of his guilt That he had before him death and judgment in immediate prospect only made it more likely that he would deny what without injury to the holiest of causes he could not confess Among the unhappy men who were convicted of the murder of Godfrey was one Protestant of no high character Henry Berry It is a remarkable and well attested circumstance that Berry s last words did more to shake the credit of the plot than the dying declarations of all the pious and honourable Roman Catholics who underwent the same fate six It was not only by the ignorant populace it was not only by zealots in whom fanaticism had extinguished all reason and charity that the Roman Catholic was regarded as a man the very tenderness of whose conscience might make him a false witness an incendiary or a murderer as a man who where his Church was concerned shrank from no atrocity and could be bound by no oath If there were in that age two persons inclined by their judgment and by their temper to toleration those persons were Tillotson and Locke Yet Tillotson whose indulgence for various kinds of schismatics and heretics brought on him the reproach of heterodoxy told the House of Commons from the pulpit that it was their duty to make effectual provision against the propagation of a religion more mischievous than irreligion itself of a religion which demanded from its followers services directly opposed to the first principles of morality His temper he truly said was prone to lenity but his duty to he community forced him to be in this one instance severe He declared that in his judgment Pagans who had never heard the name of Christ and who were guided only by the light of nature were more trustworthy members of civil society than men who had been formed in the schools of the Popish casuists seven Locke in the celebrated treatise in which he laboured to show that even the grossest forms of idolatry ought not to be prohibited under penal sanctions contended that the Church which taught men not to keep faith with heretics had no claim to toleration eight It is evident that in such circumstances the greatest service which an English Roman Catholic could render to his brethren in the faith was to convince the public that whatever some rash men might in times of violent excitement have written or done his Church did not hold that any end could sanctify means inconsistent with morality And this great service it was in the power of James to render He was King He was more powerful than any English King had been within the memory of the oldest man It depended on him whether the reproach which lay on his religion should be taken away or should be made permanent Had he conformed to the laws had he fulfilled his promises had he abstained from employing any unrighteous methods for the propagation of his own theological tenets had he suspended the operation of the penal statutes by a large exercise of his unquestionable prerogative of mercy but at the same time carefully abstained from violating the civil or ecclesiastical constitution of the realm the feeling of his people must have undergone a rapid change So conspicuous an example of good faith punctiliously observed by a Popish prince towards a Protestant nation would have quieted the public apprehensions Men who saw that a Roman Catholic might safely be suffered to direct the whole executive administration to command the army and navy to convoke and dissolve the legislature to appoint the Bishops and Deans of the Church of England would soon have ceased to fear that any great evil would arise from allowing a Roman Catholic to be captain of a company or alderman of a borough It is probable that in a few years the sect so long detested by the nation would with general applause have been admitted to office and to Parliament If on the other hand James should attempt to promote the interest of his Church by violating the fundamental laws of his kingdom and the solemn promises which he had repeatedly made in the face of the whole world it could hardly be doubted that the charges which it had been the fashion to bring against the Roman Catholic religion would be considered by all Protestants as fully established For if ever a Roman Catholic could be expected to keep faith with heretics James might have been expected to keep faith with the Anglican clergy To them he owed his crown But for their strenuous opposition to the Exclusion Bill he would have been a banished man He had repeatedly and emphatically acknowledged his obligation to them and had vowed to maintain them in all their legal rights If he could not be bound by ties like these it must be evident that where his superstition was concerned no tie of gratitude or of honour could bind him To trust him would thenceforth be impossible and if his people could not trust him what member of his Church could they trust He was not supposed to be constitutionally or habitually treacherous To his blunt manner and to his want of consideration for the feelings of others he owed a much higher reputation for sincerity than he at all deserved His eulogists affected to call him James the Just If then it should appear that in turning Papist he had also turned dissembler and promisebreaker what conclusion was likely to be drawn by a nation already disposed to believe that Popery had a pernicious influence on the moral character On these grounds many of the most eminent Roman Catholics of that age and among them the Supreme Pontiff were of opinion that the interest of their Church in our island would be most effectually promoted by a moderate and constitutional policy But such reasoning had no effect on the slow understanding and imperious temper of James In his eagerness to remove the disabilities under which the professors of his religion lay he took a course which convinced the most enlightened and tolerant Protestants of his time that those disabilities were essential to the safety of the state To his policy the English Roman Catholics owed three years of lawless and insolent triumph and a hundred and forty years of subjection and degradation Many members of his Church held commissions in the newly raised regiments This breach of the law for a time passed uncensured for men were not disposed to note every irregularity which was committed by a King suddenly called upon to defend his crown and his life against rebels But the danger was now over The insurgents had been vanquished and punished Their unsuccessful attempt had strengthened the government which they had hoped to overthrow Yet still James continued to grant commissions to unqualified persons and speedily it was announced that he was determined to be no longer bound by the Test Act that he hoped to induce the Parliament to repeal that Act but that if the Parliament proved refractory he would not the less have his own way As soon as this was known a deep murmur the forerunner of a tempest gave him warning that the spirit before which his grandfather his father and his brother had been compelled to recede though dormant was not extinct Opposition appeared first in the cabinet Halifax did not attempt to conceal his disgust and alarm At the Council board he courageously gave utterance to those feelings which as it soon appeared pervaded the whole nation None of his colleagues seconded him and the subject dropped He was summoned to the royal closet and had two long conferences with his master James tried the effect of compliments and blandishments but to no purpose Halifax positively refused to promise that he would give his vote in the House of Lords for the repeal either of the Test Act or of the Habeas Corpus Act Some of those who were about the King advised him not on the eve of the meeting of Parliament to drive the most eloquent and accomplished statesman of the age into opposition They represented that Halifax loved the dignity and emoluments of office that while he continued to be Lord President it would be hardly possible for him to put forth his whole strength against the government and that to dismiss him from his high post was to emancipate him from all restraint The King was peremptory Halifax was informed that his services were no longer needed and his name was struck out of the Council Book nine His dismission produced a great sensation not only in England but also at Paris at Vienna and at the Hague for it was well known that he had always laboured to counteract the influence exercised by the court of Versailles on English affairs Lewis expressed great pleasure at the news The ministers of the United Provinces and of the House of Austria on the other hand extolled the wisdom and virtue of the discarded statesman in a manner which gave great offence at Whitehall James was particularly angry with the secretary of the imperial legation who did not scruple to say that the eminent service which Halifax had performed in the debate on the Exclusion Bill had been requited with gross ingratitude ten It soon became clear that Halifax would have many followers A portion of the Tories with their old leader Danby at their head began to hold Whiggish language Even the prelates hinted that there was a point at which the loyalty due to the prince must yield to higher considerations The discontent of the chiefs of the army was still more extraordinary and still more formidable Already began to appear the first symptoms of that feeling which three years later impelled so many officers of high rank to desert the royal standard Men who had never before had a scruple had on a sudden become strangely scrupulous Churchill gently whispered that the King was going too far Kirke just returned from his western butchery swore to stand by the Protestant religion Even if he abjured the faith in which he had been bred he would never he said become a Papist He was already bespoken If ever he did apostatize he was bound by a solemn promise to the Emperor of Morocco to turn Mussulman eleven While the nation agitated by many strong emotions looked anxiously forward to the reassembling of the Houses tidings which increased the prevailing excitement arrived from France The long and heroic struggle which the Huguenots had maintained against the French government had been brought to a final close by the ability and vigour of Richelieu That great statesman vanquished them but he confirmed to them the liberty of conscience which had been bestowed on them by the edict of Nantes They were suffered under some restraints of no galling kind to worship God according to their own ritual and to write in defence of their own doctrine They were admissible to political and military employment nor did their heresy during a considerable time practically impede their rise in the world Some of them commanded the armies of the state and others presided over important departments of the civil administration At length a change took place Lewis the Fourteenth had from an early age regarded the Calvinists with an aversion at once religious and political As a zealous Roman Catholic he detested their theological dogmas As a prince fond of arbitrary power he detested those republican theories which were intermingled with the Genevese divinity He gradually retrenched all the privileges which the schismatics enjoyed He interfered with the education of Protestant children confiscated property bequeathed to Protestant consistories and on frivolous pretexts shut up Protestant churches The Protestant ministers were harassed by the tax gatherers The Protestant magistrates were deprived of the honour of nobility The Protestant officers of the royal household were informed that His Majesty dispensed with their services Orders were given that no Protestant should be admitted into the legal profession The oppressed sect showed some faint signs of that spirit which in the preceding century had bidden defiance to the whole power of the House of Valois Massacres and executions followed Dragoons were quartered in the towns where the heretics were numerous and in the country seats of the heretic gentry and the cruelty and licentiousness of these rude missionaries was sanctioned or leniently censured by the government Still however the edict of Nantes though practically violated in its most essential provisions had not been formally rescinded and the King repeatedly declared in solemn public acts that he was resolved to maintain it But the bigots and flatterers who had his ear gave him advice which he was but too willing to take They represented to him that his rigorous policy had been eminently successful that little or no resistance had been made to his will that thousands of Huguenots had already been converted that if he would take the one decisive step which yet remained those who were still obstinate would speedily submit France would be purged from the taint of heresy and her prince would have earned a heavenly crown not less glorious than that of Saint Lewis These arguments prevailed The final blow was struck The edict of Nantes was revoked and a crowd of decrees against the sectaries appeared in rapid succession Boys and girls were torn from their parents and sent to be educated in convents All Calvinistic ministers were commanded either to abjure their religion or to quit their country within a fortnight The other professors of the reformed faith were forbidden to leave the kingdom and in order to prevent them from making their escape the outports and frontiers were strictly guarded It was thought that the flocks thus separated from the evil shepherds would soon return to the true fold But in spite of all the vigilance of the military police there was a vast emigration It was calculated that in a few months fifty thousand families quitted France for ever Nor were the refugees such as a country can well spare They were generally persons of intelligent minds of industrious habits and of austere morals In the list are to be found names eminent in war in science in literature and in art Some of the exiles offered their swords to William of Orange and distinguished themselves by the fury with which they fought against their persecutor Others avenged themselves with weapons still more formidable and by means of the presses of Holland England and Germany inflamed during thirty years the public mind of Europe against the French government A more peaceful class erected silk manufactories in the eastern suburb of London One detachment of emigrants taught the Saxons to make the stuffs and hats of which France had hitherto enjoyed a monopoly Another planted the first vines in the neighbourhood of the Cape of Good Hope twelve In ordinary circumstances the courts of Spain and of Rome would have eagerly applauded a prince who had made vigorous war on heresy But such was the hatred inspired by the injustice and haughtiness of Lewis that when he became a persecutor the courts of Spain and Rome took the side of religious liberty and loudly reprobated the cruelty of turning a savage and licentious soldiery loose on an unoffending people thirteen One cry of grief and rage rose from the whole of Protestant Europe The tidings of the revocation of the edict of Nantes reached England about a week before the day to which the Parliament stood adjourned It was clear then that the spirit of Gardiner and of Alva was still the spirit of the Roman Catholic Church Lewis was not inferior to James in generosity and humanity and was certainly far superior to James in all the abilities and acquirements of a statesman Lewis had like James repeatedly promised to respect the privileges of his Protestant subjects Yet Lewis was now avowedly a persecutor of the reformed religion What reason was there then to doubt that James waited only for an opportunity to follow the example He was already forming in defiance of the law a military force officered to a great extent by Roman Catholics Was there anything unreasonable in the apprehension that this force might be employed to do what the French dragoons had done James was almost as much disturbed as his subjects by the conduct of the court of Versailles In truth that court had acted as if it had meant to embarrass and annoy him He was about to ask from a Protestant legislature a full toleration for Roman Catholics Nothing therefore could be more unwelcome to him than the intelligence that in a neighbouring country toleration had just been withdrawn by a Roman Catholic government from Protestants His vexation was increased by a speech which the Bishop of Valence in the name of the Gallican clergy addressed at this time to Lewis the Fourteenth The pious Sovereign of England the orator said looked to the most Christian King for support against a heretical nation It was remarked that the members of the House of Commons showed particular anxiety to procure copies of this harangue and that it was read by all Englishmen with indignation and alarm fourteen James was desirous to counteract the impression which these things had made and was also at that moment by no means unwilling to let all Europe see that he was not the slave of France He therefore declared publicly that he disapproved of the manner in which the Huguenots had been treated granted to the exiles some relief from his privy purse and by letters under his great seal invited his subjects to imitate his liberality In a very few months it became clear that all this compassion was feigned for the purpose of cajoling his Parliament that he regarded the refugees with mortal hatred and that he regretted nothing so much as his own inability to do what Lewis had done On the ninth of November the Houses met The Commons were summoned to the bar of the Lords and the King spoke from the throne His speech had been composed by himself He congratulated his loving subjects on the suppression of the rebellion in the West but he added that the speed with which that rebellion had risen to a formidable height and the length of time during which it had continued to rage must convince all men how little dependence could be placed on the militia He had therefore made additions to the regular army The charge of that army would henceforth be more than double of what it had been and he trusted that the Commons would grant him the means of defraying the increased expense He then informed his hearers that he had employed some officers who had not taken the test but he knew them to be fit for public trust He feared that artful men might avail themselves of this irregularity to disturb the harmony which existed between himself and his Parliament But he would speak out He was determined not to part with servants on whose fidelity he could rely and whose help he might perhaps soon need fifteen This explicit declaration that he had broken the laws which were regarded by the nation as the chief safeguards of the established religion and that he was resolved to persist in breaking those laws was not likely to soothe the excited feelings of his subjects The Lords seldom disposed to take the lead in opposition to a government consented to vote him formal thanks for what he had said But the Commons were in a less complying mood When they had returned to their own House there was a long silence and the faces of many of the most respectable members expressed deep concern At length Middleton rose and moved the House to go instantly into committee on the King s speech but Sir Edmund Jennings a zealous Tory from Yorkshire who was supposed to speak the sentiments of Danby protested against this course and demanded time for consideration Sir Thomas Clarges maternal uncle of the Duke of Albemarle and long distinguished in Parliament as a man of business and a viligant steward of the public money took the same side The feeling of the House could not be mistaken Sir John Ernley Chancellor of the Exchequer insisted that the delay should not exceed forty eight hours but he was overruled and it was resolved that the discussion should be postponed for three days sixteen The interval was well employed by those who took the lead against the court They had indeed no light work to perform In three days a country party was to be organized The difficulty of the task is in our age not easily to be appreciated for in our age all the nation may be said to assist at every deliberation of the Lords and Commons What is said by the leaders of the ministry and of the opposition after midnight is read by the whole metropolis at dawn by the inhabitants of Northumberland and Cornwall in the afternoon and in Ireland and the Highlands of Scotland on the morrow In our age therefore the stages of legislation the rules of debate the tactics of faction the opinions temper and style of every active member of either House are familiar to hundreds of thousands Every man who now enters Parliament possesses what in the seventeenth century would have been called a great stock of parliamentary knowledge Such knowledge was then to be obtained only by actual parliamentary service The difference between an old and a new member was as great as the difference between a veteran soldier and a recruit just taken from the plough and James s Parliament contained a most unusual proportion of new members who had brought from their country seats to Westminster no political knowledge and many violent prejudices These gentlemen hated the Papists but hated the Whigs not less intensely and regarded the King with superstitious veneration To form an opposition out of such materials was a feat which required the most skilful and delicate management Some men of great weight however undertook the work and performed it with success Several experienced Whig politicians who had not seats in that Parliament gave useful advice and information On the day preceding that which had been fixed for the debate many meetings were held at which the leaders instructed the novices and it soon appeared that these exertions had not been thrown away seventeen The foreign embassies were all in a ferment It was well understood that a few days would now decide the great question whether the King of England was or was not to be the vassal of the King of France The ministers of the House of Austria were most anxious that James should give satisfaction to his Parliament Innocent had sent to London two persons charged to inculcate moderation both by admonition and by example One of them was John Leyburn an English Dominican who had been secretary to Cardinal Howard and who with some learning and a rich vein of natural humour was the most cautious dexterous and taciturn of men He had recently been consecrated Bishop of Adrumetum and named Vicar Apostolic in Great Britain Ferdinand Count of Adda an Italian of no eminent abilities but of mild temper and courtly manners had been appointed Nuncio These functionaries were eagerly welcomed by James No Roman Catholic Bishop had exercised spiritual functions in the island during more than half a century No Nuncio had been received here during the hundred and twenty seven years which had elapsed since the death of Mary Leyburn was lodged in Whitehall and received a pension of a thousand pounds a year Adda did not yet assume a public character He passed for a foreigner of rank whom curiosity had brought to London appeared daily at court and was treated with high consideration Both the Papal emissaries did their best to diminish as much as possible the odium inseparable from the offices which they filled and to restrain the rash zeal of James The Nuncio in particular declared that nothing could be more injurious to the interests of the Church of Rome than a rupture between the King and the Parliament eighteen Barillon was active on the other side The instructions which he received from Versailles on this occasion well deserve to be studied for they furnish a key to the policy systematically pursued by his master towards England during the twenty years which preceded our revolution The advices from Madrid Lewis wrote were alarming Strong hopes were entertained there that James would ally himself closely with the House of Austria as soon as he should be assured that his Parliament would give him no trouble In these circumstances it was evidently the interest of France that the Parliament should prove refractory Barillon was therefore directed to act with all possible precautions against detection the part of a makebate At court he was to omit no opportunity of stimulating the religious zeal and the kingly pride of James but at the same time it might be desirable to have some secret communication with the malecontents Such communication would indeed be hazardous and would require the utmost adroitness yet it might perhaps be in the power of the Ambassador without committing himself or his government to animate the zeal of the opposition for the laws and liberties of England and to let it be understood that those laws and liberties were not regarded by his master with an unfriendly eye nineteen Lewis when he dictated these instructions did not foresee how speedily and how completely his uneasiness would be removed by the obstinacy and stupidity of James On the twelfth of November the House of Commons resolved itself into a committee on the royal speech The Solicitor General Heneage Finch was in the chair The debate was conducted by the chiefs of the new country party with rare tact and address No expression indicating disrespect to the Sovereign or sympathy for rebels was suffered to escape The western insurrection was always mentioned with abhorrence Nothing was said of the barbarities of Kirke and Jeffreys It was admitted that the heavy expenditure which had been occasioned by the late troubles justified the King in asking some further supply but strong objections were made to the augmentation of the army and to the infraction of the Test Act The subject of the Test Act the courtiers appear to have carefully avoided They harangued however with some force on the great superiority of a regular army to a militia One of them tauntingly asked whether the defence of the kingdom was to be entrusted to the beefeaters Another said that he should be glad to know how the Devonshire trainbands who had fled in confusion before Monmouth s scythemen would have faced the household troops of Lewis But these arguments had little effect on Cavaliers who still remembered with bitterness the stern rule of the Protector The general feeling was forcibly expressed by the first of the Tory country gentlemen of England Edward Seymour He admitted that the militia was not in a satisfactory state but maintained that it might be remodelled The remodelling might require money but for his own part he would rather give a million to keep up a force from which he had nothing to fear than half a million to keep up a force of which he must ever be afraid Let the trainbands be disciplined let the navy be strengthened and the country would be secure A standing army was at best a mere drain on the public resources The soldier was withdrawn from all useful labour He produced nothing he consumed the fruits of the industry of other men and he domineered over those by whom he was supported But the nation was now threatened not only with a standing army but with a Popish standing army with a standing army officered by men who might be very amiable and honourable but who were on principle enemies to the constitution of the realm Sir William Twisden member for the county of Kent spoke on the same side with great keenness and loud applause Sir Richard Temple one of the few Whigs who had a seat in that Parliament dexterously accommodating his speech to the temper of his audience reminded the House that a standing army had been found by experience to be as dangerous to the just authority of princes as to the liberty of nations Sir John Maynard the most learned lawyer of his time took part in the debate He was now more than eighty years old and could well remember the political contests of the reign of James the First He had sate in the Long Parliament and had taken part with the Roundheads but had always been for lenient counsels and had laboured to bring about a general reconciliation His abilities which age had not impaired and his professional knowledge which had long overawed all Westminster Hall commanded the ear of the House of Commons He too declared himself against the augmentation of the regular forces After much debate it was resolved that a supply should be granted to the crown but it was also resolved that a bill should be brought in for making the militia more efficient This last resolution was tantamount to a declaration against the standing army The King was greatly displeased and it was whispered that if things went on thus the session would not be of long duration twenty On the morrow the contention was renewed The language of the country party was perceptibly bolder and sharper than on the preceding day That paragraph of the King s speech which related to supply preceded the paragraph which related to the test On this ground Middleton proposed that the paragraph relating to supply should be first considered in committee The opposition moved the previous question They contended that the reasonable and constitutional practice was to grant no money till grievances had been redressed and that there would be an end of this practice if the House thought itself bound servilely to follow the order in which matters were mentioned by the King from the throne The division was taken on the question whether Middletons motion should be put The Noes were ordered by the Speaker to go forth into the lobby They resented this much and complained loudly of his servility and partiality for they conceived that according to the intricate and subtle rule which was then in force and which in our time was superseded by a more rational and convenient practice they were entitled to keep their seats and it was held by all the Parliamentary tacticians of that age that the party which stayed in the House had an advantage over the party which went out for the accommodation on the benches was then so deficient that no person who had been fortunate enough to get a good seat was willing to lose it Nevertheless to the dismay of the ministers many persons on whose votes the court had absolutely depended were seen moving towards the door Among them was Charles Fox Paymaster of the Forces and son of Sir Stephen Fox Clerk of the Green Cloth The Paymaster had been induced by his friends to absent himself during part of the discussion But his anxiety had become insupportable He come down to the Speaker s chamber heard part of the debate withdrew and after hesitating for an hour or two between conscience and five thousand pounds a year took a manly resolution and rushed into the House just in time to vote Two officers of the army Colonel John Darcy son of the Lord Conyers and Captain James Kendall withdrew to the lobby Middleton went down to the bar and expostulated warmly with them He particularly addressed himself to Kendall a needy retainer of the court who had in obedience to the royal mandate been sent to Parliament by a packed corporation in Cornwall and who had recently obtained a grant of a hundred head of rebels sentenced to transportation Sir said Middleton have not you a troop of horse in His Majesty s service Yes my Lord answered Kendall but my elder brother is just dead and has left me seven hundred a year When the tellers had done their office it appeared that the Ayes were one hundred and eighty two and the Noes one and eighty three In that House of Commons which had been brought together by the unscrupulous use of chicanery of corruption and of violence in that House of Commons of which James had said that more than eleven twelfths of the members were such as he would himself have nominated the court had sustained a defeat on a vital question twenty one In consequence of this vote the expressions which the King had used respecting the test were on the thirteenth of November taken into consideration It was resolved after much discussion that an address should be presented to him reminding him that he could not legally continue to employ officers who refused to qualify and pressing him to give such directions as might quiet the apprehensions and jealousies of his people twenty two A motion was then made that the Lords should be requested to join in the address Whether this motion was honestly made by the opposition in the hope that the concurrence of the peers would add weight to the remonstrance or artfully made by the courtiers in the hope that a breach between the Houses might be the consequence it is now impossible to discover The proposition was rejected twenty three The House then resolved itself into a committee for the purpose of considering the amount of supply to be granted The King wanted fourteen hundred thousand pounds but the ministers saw that it would be vain to ask for so large a sum The Chancellor of the Exchequer mentioned twelve hundred thousand pounds The chiefs of the opposition replied that to vote for such a grant would be to vote for the permanence of the present military establishment they were disposed to give only so much as might suffice to keep the regular troops on foot till the militia could be remodelled and they therefore proposed four hundred thousand pounds The courtiers exclaimed against this motion as unworthy of the House and disrespectful to the King but they were manfully encountered One of the western members John Windham who sate for Salisbury especially distinguished himself He had always he said looked with dread and aversion on standing armies and recent experience had strengthened those feelings He then ventured to touch on a theme which had hitherto been studiously avoided He described the desolation of the western counties The people he said were weary of the oppression of the troops weary of free quarters of depredations of still fouler crimes which the law called felonies but for which when perpetrated by this class of felons no redress could be obtained The King s servants had indeed told the House that excellent rules had been laid down for the government of the army but none could venture to say that these rules had been observed What then was the inevitable inference Did not the contrast between the paternal injunctions issued from the throne and the insupportable tyranny of the soldiers prove that the army was even now too strong for the prince as well as for the people The Commons might surely with perfect consistency while they reposed entire confidence in the intentions of His Majesty refuse to make any addition to a force which it was clear that His Majesty could not manage The motion that the sum to be granted should not exceed four hundred thousand pounds was lost by twelve votes This victory of the ministers was little better than a defeat The leaders of the country party nothing disheartened retreated a little made another stand and proposed the sum of seven hundred thousand pounds The committee divided again and the courtiers were beaten by two hundred and twelve votes to one hundred and seventy twenty four On the following day the Commons went in procession to Whitehall with their address on the subject of the test The King received them on his throne The address was drawn up in respectful and affectionate language for the great majority of those who had voted for it were zealously and even superstitiously loyal and had readily agreed to insert some complimentary phrases and to omit every word which the courtiers thought offensive The answer of James was a cold and sullen reprimand He declared himself greatly displeased and amazed that the Commons should have profited so little by the admonition which he had given them But said he however you may proceed on your part I will be very steady in all the promises which I have made to you twenty five The Commons reassembled in their chamber discontented yet somewhat overawed To most of them the King was still an object of filial reverence Three more years filled with injuries and with insults more galling than injuries were scarcely sufficient to dissolve the ties which bound the Cavalier gentry to the throne The Speaker repeated the substance of the King s reply There was for some time a solemn stillness then the order of the day was read in regular course and the House went into committee on the bill for remodelling the militia In a few hours however the spirit of the opposition revived When at the close of the day the Speaker resumed the chair Wharton the boldest and most active of the Whigs proposed that a time should be appointed for taking His Majesty s answer into consideration John Coke member for Derby though a noted Tory seconded Wharton I hope he said that we are all Englishmen and that we shall not be frightened from our duty by a few high words It was manfully but not wisely spoken The whole House was in a tempest Take down his words To the bar To the Tower resounded from every side Those who were most lenient proposed that the offender should be reprimanded but the ministers vehemently insisted that he should be sent to prison The House might pardon they said offences committed against itself but had no right to pardon an insult offered to the crown Coke was sent to the Tower The indiscretion of one man had deranged the whole system of tactics which had been so ably concerted by the chiefs of the opposition It was in vain that at that moment Edward Seymour attempted to rally his followers exhorted them to fix a day for discussing the King s answer and expressed his confidence that the discussion would be conducted with the respect due from subjects to the sovereign The members were so much cowed by the royal displeasure and so much incensed by the rudeness of Coke that it would not have been safe to divide twenty six The House adjourned and the ministers flattered themselves that the spirit of opposition was quelled But on the morrow the nineteenth of November new and alarming symptoms appeared The time had arrived for taking into consideration the petitions which had been presented from all parts of England against the late elections When on the first meeting of the Parliament Seymour had complained of the force and fraud by which the government had prevented the sense of constituent bodies from being fairly taken he had found no seconder But many who had then flinched from his side had subsequently taken heart and with Sir John Lowther member for Cumberland at their head had before the recess suggested that there ought to be an enquiry into the abuses which had so much excited the public mind The House was now in a much more angry temper and many voices were boldly raised in menace and accusation The ministers were told that the nation expected and should have signal redress Meanwhile it was dexterously intimated that the best atonement which a gentleman who had been brought into the House by irregular means could make to the public was to use his ill acquired power in defence of the religion and liberties of his country No member who in that crisis did his duty had anything to fear It might be necessary to unseat him but the whole influence of the opposition should be employed to procure his reelection twenty seven On the same day it became clear that the spirit of opposition had spread from the Commons to the Lords and even to the episcopal bench William Cavendish Earl of Devonshire took the lead in the Upper House and he was well qualified to do so In wealth and influence he was second to none of the English nobles and the general voice designated him as the finest gentleman of his time His magnificence his taste his talents his classical learning his high spirit the grace and urbanity of his manners were admitted by his enemies His eulogists unhappily could not pretend that his morals had escaped untainted from the widespread contagion of that age Though an enemy of Popery and of arbitrary power he had been averse to extreme courses had been willing when the Exclusion Bill was lost to agree to a compromise and had never been concerned in the illegal and imprudent schemes which had brought discredit on the Whig party But though regretting part of the conduct of his friends he had not on that account failed to perform zealously the most arduous and perilous duties of friendship He had stood near Russell at the bar had parted from him on the sad morning of the execution with close embraces and with many bitter tears nay had offered to manage an escape at the hazard of his own life twenty eight This great nobleman now proposed that a day should be fixed for considering the royal speech It was contended on the other side that the Lords by voting thanks for the speech had precluded themselves from complaining of it But this objection was treated with contempt by Halifax Such thanks he said with the sarcastic pleasantry in which he excelled imply no approbation We are thankful whenever our gracious Sovereign deigns to speak to us Especially thankful are we when as on the present occasion he speaks out and gives us fair warning of what we are to suffer twenty nine Doctor Henry Compton Bishop of London spoke strongly for the motion Though not gifted with eminent abilities nor deeply versed in the learning of his profession he was always heard by the House with respect for he was one of the few clergymen who could in that age boast of noble blood His own loyalty and the loyalty of his family had been signally proved His father the second Earl of Northampton had fought bravely for King Charles the First and surrounded by the parliamentary soldiers had fallen sword in hand refusing to give or take quarter The Bishop himself before he was ordained had borne arms in the Guards and though he generally did his best to preserve the gravity and sobriety befitting a prelate some flashes of his military spirit would to the last occasionally break forth He had been entrusted with the religious education of the two Princesses and had acquitted himself of that important duty in a manner which had satisfied all good Protestants and had secured to him considerable influence over the minds of his pupils especially of the Lady Anne thirty He now declared that he was empowered to speak the sense of his brethren and that in their opinion and in his own the whole civil and ecclesiastical constitution of the realm was in danger One of the most remarkable speeches of that day was made by a young man whose eccentric career was destined to amaze Europe This was Charles Mordaunt Viscount Mordaunt widely renowned many years later as Earl of Peterborough Already he had given abundant proofs of his courage of his capacity and of that strange unsoundness of mind which made his courage and capacity almost useless to his country Already he had distinguished himself as a wit and a scholar as a soldier and a sailor He had even set his heart on rivalling Bourdaloue and Bossuet Though an avowed freethinker he had sate up all night at sea to compose sermons and had with great difficulty been prevented from edifying the crew of a man of war with his pious oratory thirty one He now addressed the House of Peers for the first time with characteristic eloquence sprightliness and audacity He blamed the Commons for not having taken a bolder line They have been afraid he said to speak out They have talked of apprehensions and jealousies What have apprehension and jealousy to do here Apprehension and jealousy are the feelings with which we regard future and uncertain evils The evil which we are considering is neither future nor uncertain A standing army exists It is officered by Papists We have no foreign enemy There is no rebellion in the land For what then is this force maintained except for the purpose of subverting our laws and establishing that arbitrary power which is so justly abhorred by Englishmen thirty two Jeffreys spoke against the motion in the coarse and savage style of which he was a master but he soon found that it was not quite so easy to browbeat the proud and powerful barons of England in their own hall as to intimidate advocates whose bread depended on his favour or prisoners whose necks were at his mercy A man whose life has been passed in attacking and domineering whatever may be his talents and courage generally makes a mean figure when he is vigorously assailed for being unaccustomed to stand on the defensive he becomes confused and the knowledge that all those whom he has insulted are enjoying his confusion confuses him still more Jeffreys was now for the first time since he had become a great man encountered on equal terms by adversaries who did not fear him To the general delight he passed at once from the extreme of insolence to the extreme of meanness and could not refrain from weeping with rage and vexation thirty three Nothing indeed was wanting to his humiliation for the House was crowded by about a hundred peers a larger number than had voted even on the great day of the Exclusion Bill The King too was present His brother had been in the habit of attending the sittings of the Lords for amusement and used often to say that a debate was as entertaining as a comedy James came not to be diverted but in the hope that his presence might impose some restraint on the discussion He was disappointed The sense of the House was so strongly manifested that after a closing speech of great keenness from Halifax the courtiers did not venture to divide An early day was fixed for taking the royal speech into consideration and it was ordered that every peer who was not at a distance from Westminster should be in his place thirty four On the following morning the King came down in his robes to the House of Lords The Usher of the Black Rod summoned the Commons to the bar and the Chancellor announced that the Parliament was prorogued to the tenth of February thirty five The members who had voted against the court were dismissed from the public service Charles Fox quitted the Pay Office The Bishop of London ceased to be Dean of the Chapel Royal and his name was struck out of the list of Privy Councillors The effect of the prorogation was to put an end to a legal proceeding of the highest importance Thomas Grey Earl of Stamford sprung from one of the most illustrious houses of England had been recently arrested and committed close prisoner to the Tower on a charge of high treason He was accused of having been concerned in the Rye House Plot A true bill had been found against him by the grand jury of the City of London and had been removed into the House of Lords the only court before which a temporal peer can during a session of Parliament be arraigned for any offence higher than a misdemeanour The first of December had been fixed for the trial and orders had been given that Westminster Hall should be fitted up with seats and hangings In consequence of the prorogation the hearing of the cause was postponed for an indefinite period and Stamford soon regained his liberty thirty six Three other Whigs of great eminence were in confinement when the session closed Charles Gerard Lord Gerard of Brandon eldest son of the Earl of Macclesfield John Hampden grandson of the renowned leader of the Long Parliament and Henry Booth Lord Delamere Gerard and Hampden were accused of having taken part in the Rye House Plot Delamere of having abetted the Western insurrection It was not the intention of the government to put either Gerard or Hampden to death Grey had stipulated for their lives before he consented to become a witness against them thirty seven But there was a still stronger reason for sparing them They were heirs to large property but their fathers were still living The court could therefore get little in the way of forfeiture and might get much in the way of ransom Gerard was tried and from the very scanty accounts which have come down to us seems to have defended himself with great spirit and force He boasted of the exertions and sacrifices made by his family in the cause of Charles the First and proved Rumsey the witness who had murdered Russell by telling one story and Cornish by telling another to be utterly undeserving of credit The jury with some hesitation found a verdict of Guilty After long imprisonment Gerard was suffered to redeem himself thirty eight Hampden had inherited the political opinions and a large share of the abilities of his grandfather but had degenerated from the uprightness and the courage by which his grandfather had been distinguished It appears that the prisoner was with cruel cunning long kept in an agony of suspense in order that his family might be induced to pay largely for mercy His spirit sank under the terrors of death When brought to the bar of the Old Bailey he not only pleaded guilty but disgraced the illustrious name which he bore by abject submissions and entreaties He protested that he had not been privy to the design of assassination but he owned that he had meditated rebellion professed deep repentance for his offence implored the intercession of the Judges and vowed that if the royal clemency were extended to him his whole life should be passed in evincing his gratitude for such goodness The Whigs were furious at his pusillanimity and loudly declared him to be far more deserving of blame than Grey who even in turning King s evidence had preserved a certain decorum Hampden s life was spared but his family paid several thousand pounds to the Chancellor Some courtiers of less note succeeded in extorting smaller sums The unhappy man had spirit enough to feel keenly the degradation to which he had stooped He survived the day of his ignominy several years He lived to see his party triumphant to be once more an important member of it to rise high in the state and to make his persecutors tremble in their turn But his prosperity was embittered by one insupportable recollection He never regained his cheerfulness and at length died by his own hand thirty nine That Delamere if he had needed the royal mercy would have found it is not very probable It is certain that every advantage which the letter of the law gave to the government was used against him without scruple or shame He was in a different situation from that in which Stamford stood The indictment against Stamford had been removed into the House of Lords during the session of Parliament and therefore could not be prosecuted till the Parliament should reassemble All the peers would then have voices and would be judges as well of law as of fact But the bill against Delamere was not found till after the prorogation forty He was therefore within the jurisdiction of the Court of the Lord High Steward This court to which belongs during a recess of Parliament the cognizance of treasons and felonies committed by temporal peers was then so constituted that no prisoner charged with a political offence could expect an impartial trial The King named a Lord High Steward The Lord High Steward named at his discretion certain peers to sit on their accused brother The number to be summoned was indefinite No challenge was allowed A simple majority provided that it consisted of twelve was sufficient to convict The High Steward was sole judge of the law and the Lords Triers formed merely a jury to pronounce on the question of fact Jeffreys was appointed High Steward He selected thirty Triers and the selection was characteristic of the man and of the times All the thirty were in politics vehemently opposed to the prisoner Fifteen of them were colonels of regiments and might be removed from their lucrative commands at the pleasure of the King Among the remaining fifteen were the Lord Treasurer the principal Secretary of State the Steward of the Household the Comptroller of the Household the Captain of the Band of Gentlemen Pensioners the Queen s Chamberlain and other persons who were bound by strong ties of interest to the court Nevertheless Delamere had some great advantages over the humbler culprits who had been arraigned at the Old Bailey There the jurymen violent partisans taken for a single day by courtly Sheriffs from the mass of society and speedily sent back to mingle with that mass were under no restraint of shame and being little accustomed to weigh evidence followed without scruple the directions of the bench But in the High Steward s Court every Trier was a man of some experience in grave affairs Every Trier filled a considerable space in the public eye Every Trier beginning from the lowest had to rise separately and to give in his verdict on his honour before a great concourse That verdict accompanied with his name would go to every part of the world and would live in history Moreover though the selected nobles were all Tories and almost all placemen many of them had begun to look with uneasiness on the King s proceedings and to doubt whether the case of Delamere might not soon be their own Jeffreys conducted himself as was his wont insolently and unjustly He had indeed an old grudge to stimulate his zeal He had been Chief Justice of Chester when Delamere then mister Booth represented that county in Parliament Booth had bitterly complained to the Commons that the dearest interests of his constituents were intrusted to a drunken jackpudding forty one The revengeful judge was now not ashamed to resort to artifices which even in an advocate would have been culpable He reminded the Lords Triers in very significant language that Delamere had in Parliament objected to the bill for attainting Monmouth a fact which was not and could not be in evidence But it was not in the power of Jeffreys to overawe a synod of peers as he had been in the habit of overawing common juries The evidence for the crown would probably have been thought amply sufficient on the Western Circuit or at the City Sessions but could not for a moment impose on such men as Rochester Godolphin and Churchill nor were they with all their faults depraved enough to condemn a fellow creature to death against the plainest rules of justice Grey Wade and Goodenough were produced but could only repeat what they had heard said by Monmouth and by Wildman s emissaries The principal witness for the prosecution a miscreant named Saxton who had been concerned in the rebellion and was now labouring to earn his pardon by swearing against all who were obnoxious to the government who proved by overwhelming evidence to have told a series of falsehoods All the Triers from Churchill who as junior baron spoke first up to the Treasurer pronounced on their honour that Delamere was not guilty The gravity and pomp of the whole proceeding made a deep impression even on the Nuncio accustomed as he was to the ceremonies of Rome ceremonies which in solemnity and splendour exceed all that the rest of the world can show forty two The King who was present and was unable to complain of a decision evidently just went into a rage with Saxton and vowed that the wretch should first be pilloried before Westminster Hall for perjury and then sent down to the West to be hanged drawn and quartered for treason forty three The public joy at the acquittal of Delamere was great The reign of terror was over The innocent began to breathe freely and false accusers to tremble One letter written on this occasion is scarcely to be read without tears The widow of Russell in her retirement learned the good news with mingled feelings I do bless God she wrote that he has caused some stop to be put to the shedding of blood in this poor land Yet when I should rejoice with them that do rejoice I seek a corner to weep in I find I am capable of no more gladness but every new circumstance the very comparing my night of sorrow after such a day with theirs of joy does from a reflection of one kind or another rack my uneasy mind Though I am far from wishing the close of theirs like mine yet I cannot refrain giving some time to lament mine was not like theirs forty four And now the tide was on the turn The death of Stafford witnessed with signs of tenderness and remorse by the populace to whose rage he was sacrificed marks the close of one proscription The acquittal of Delamere marks the close of another The crimes which had disgraced the stormy tribuneship of Shaftesbury had been fearfully expiated The blood of innocent Papists had been avenged more than tenfold by the blood of zealous Protestants Another great reaction had commenced Factions were fast taking new forms Old allies were separating Old enemies were uniting Discontent was spreading fast through all the ranks of the party lately dominant A hope still indeed faint and indefinite of victory and revenge animated the party which had lately seemed to be extinct Amidst such circumstances the eventful and troubled year sixteen eighty five terminated and the year sixteen eighty six began The prorogation had relieved the King from the gentle remonstrances of the Houses 
470-132610-0000	train-other-500	but he had still to listen to remonstrances similar in effect though uttered in a tone even more cautious and subdued Some men who had hitherto served him but too strenuously for their own fame and for the public welfare
470-132610-0001	train-other-500	had begun to feel painful misgivings and occasionally ventured to hint a small part of what they felt During many years the zeal of the English Tory for hereditary monarchy
470-132610-0002	train-other-500	and his zeal for the established religion had grown up together and had strengthened each other It had never occurred to him that the two sentiments which seemed inseparable and even identical
470-132610-0003	train-other-500	might one day be found to be not only distinct but incompatible From the commencement of the strife between the Stuarts and the Commons the cause of the crown and the cause of the hierarchy had to all appearance

470-132610-0015	train-other-500	must be filled with shame and indignation by learning that his whole life had been a lie that while he professed to belong to their communion he had really regarded them as heretics

470-132610-0018	train-other-500	had thought that on this point it was advisable to be cautious and had not ventured to inter his brother with the rites of the Church of Rome For a time therefore every man was at liberty to believe what he wished
470-132610-0019	train-other-500	The Papists claimed the deceased prince as their proselyte The Whigs execrated him as a hypocrite and a renegade The Tories regarded the report of his apostasy
470-132610-0020	train-other-500	as a calumny which Papists and Whigs had for very different reasons a common interest in circulating James now took a step which greatly disconcerted the whole Anglican party
470-132610-0021	train-other-500	Two papers in which were set forth very concisely the arguments ordinarily used by Roman Catholics in controversy with Protestants had been found in Charles s strong box

470-132610-0024	train-other-500	But James supposed that the Primate was struck dumb by the irresistible force of reason and eagerly challenged his Grace to produce with the help of the whole episcopal bench a satisfactory reply

470-132610-0030	train-other-500	James himself distributed the whole edition among his courtiers and among the people of humbler rank who crowded round his coach He gave one copy to a young woman of mean condition
470-132610-0031	train-other-500	whom he supposed to be of his own religious persuasion and assured her that she would be greatly edified and comforted by the perusal In requital of his kindness she delivered to him a few days later

470-132610-0034	train-other-500	could prevent the most eminent Roman Catholics from perceiving that the prosperity which they at length enjoyed was only temporary and unless wisely used might be fatal to them
470-132610-0035	train-other-500	They had been taught by a cruel experience that the antipathy of the nation to their religion was not a fancy which would yield to the mandate of a prince but a profound sentiment

470-132610-0039	train-other-500	it was easy to see that the violent compression of so powerful and elastic a spring would be followed by as violent a recoil The Roman Catholic peers

348-132611-0000	train-other-500	One of these was Roger Palmer Earl of Castelmaine in Ireland and husband of the Duchess of Cleveland His title had notoriously been purchased by his wife s dishonour and his own His fortune was small His temper

348-132611-0006	train-other-500	this reckless faction was strengthened by an important reinforcement Richard Talbot Earl of Tyrconnel the fiercest and most uncompromising of all those who hated the liberties and religion of England arrived at court from Dublin
348-132611-0007	train-other-500	Talbot was descended from an old Norman family which had been long settled in Leinster which had there sunk into degeneracy which had adopted the manners of the Celts which had like the Celts adhered to the old religion
348-132611-0008	train-other-500	and which had taken part with the Celts in the rebellion of sixteen forty one In his youth he had been one of the most noted sharpers and bullies of London He had been introduced to Charles and James when they were exiles in Flanders
348-132611-0009	train-other-500	as a man fit and ready for the infamous service of assassinating the Protector Soon after the Restoration Talbot attempted to obtain the favour of the royal family by a service more infamous still
348-132611-0010	train-other-500	A plea was wanted which might justify the Duke of York in breaking that promise of marriage by which he had obtained from Anne Hyde the last proof of female affection Such a plea Talbot in concert with some of his dissolute companions
348-132611-0011	train-other-500	undertook to furnish They agreed to describe the poor young lady as a creature without virtue shame or delicacy and made up long romances about tender interviews and stolen favours
none	none	 Talbot in particular related how in one of his secret visits to her he had unluckily overturned the Chancellor s inkstand upon a pile of papers and how cleverly she had averted a discovery 
348-132611-0012	train-other-500	by laying the blame of the accident on her monkey These stories which if they had been true would never have passed the lips of any but the basest of mankind were pure inventions Talbot was soon forced to own that they were so
348-132611-0013	train-other-500	and he owned it without a blush The injured lady became Duchess of York Had her husband been a man really upright and honourable he would have driven from his presence with indignation and contempt the wretches who had slandered her
348-132611-0014	train-other-500	But one of the peculiarities of James s character was that no act however wicked and shameful which had been prompted by a desire to gain his favour ever seemed to him deserving of disapprobation
348-132611-0015	train-other-500	Talbot continued to frequent the court appeared daily with brazen front before the princess whose ruin he had plotted and was installed into the lucrative post of chief pandar to her husband In no long time
348-132611-0016	train-other-500	Whitehall was thrown into confusion by the news that Dick Talbot as he was commonly called had laid a plan to murder the Duke of Ormond The bravo was sent to the Tower but in a few days

348-132611-0017	train-other-500	not to countenance this bad man who had nothing to recommend him except his fine person and his taste in dress Talbot was not only welcome at the palace when the bottle or the dicebox was going round
348-132611-0018	train-other-500	but was heard with attention on matters of business He affected the character of an Irish patriot and pleaded with great audacity and sometimes with success the cause of his countrymen whose estates had been confiscated He took care however
348-132611-0019	train-other-500	to be well paid for his services and succeeded in acquiring partly by the sale of his influence partly by gambling and partly by pimping an estate of three thousand pounds a year For under an outward show of levity profusion

none	none	 ranted cursed and swore with such frantic violence that superficial observers 
348-132611-0022	train-other-500	set him down for the wildest of libertines The multitude was unable to conceive that a man who even when sober was more furious and boastful than others when they were drunk

348-132611-0023	train-other-500	could really be a coldhearted farsighted scheming sycophant Yet such a man was Talbot In truth his hypocrisy was of a far higher and rarer sort
none	none	 than the hypocrisy which had flourished in Barebone s Parliament 
348-132611-0024	train-other-500	For the consummate hypocrite is not he who conceals vice behind the semblance of virtue but he who makes the vice which he has no objection to show a stalking horse to cover darker and more profitable vice
348-132611-0025	train-other-500	which it is for his interest to hide Talbot raised by James to the earldom of Tyrconnel had commanded the troops in Ireland during the nine months

348-132611-0027	train-other-500	had long been well known on the road which he had now to travel Between Chester and the capital there was not an inn where he had not been in a brawl Wherever he came he pressed horses in defiance of law

none	none	 he came to the court fifty two As soon as he was there 
348-132611-0030	train-other-500	he allied himself closely with Castelmaine Dover and Albeville These men called with one voice for war on the constitution of the Church and the State
none	none	 They told their master 
348-132611-0031	train-other-500	that he owed it to his religion and to the dignity of his crown to stand firm against the outcry of heretical demagogues and to let the Parliament see from the first that he would be master in spite of opposition
348-132611-0032	train-other-500	and that the only effect of opposition would be to make him a hard master Each of the two parties into which the court was divided had zealous foreign allies The ministers of Spain of the Empire and of the States General
348-132611-0033	train-other-500	were now as anxious to support Rochester as they had formerly been to support Halifax All the influence of Barillon was employed on the other side and Barillon was assisted by another French agent

none	none	 before he showed much activity fifty three Bonrepaux had raised himself from obscurity 
348-132611-0037	train-other-500	by the intelligence and industry which he had exhibited as a clerk in the department of the marine and was esteemed an adept in the mystery of mercantile politics At the close of the year sixteen eighty five
348-132611-0038	train-other-500	he was sent to London charged with several special commissions of high importance He was to lay the ground for a treaty of commerce he was to ascertain and report the state of the English fleets
348-132611-0039	train-other-500	and dockyards and he was to make some overtures to the Huguenot refugees who it was supposed
none	none	 had been so effectually tamed by penury and exile 
348-132611-0040	train-other-500	that they would thankfully accept almost any terms of reconciliation The new Envoy s origin was plebeian his stature was dwarfish his countenance was ludicrously ugly
348-132611-0041	train-other-500	and his accent was that of his native Gascony but his strong sense his keen penetration and his lively wit eminently qualified him for his post
348-132611-0042	train-other-500	In spite of every disadvantage of birth and figure he was soon known as a most pleasing companion and as a most skilful diplomatist He contrived while flirting with the Duchess of Mazarin
348-132611-0043	train-other-500	discussing literary questions with Waller and Saint Evremond and corresponding with La Fontaine to acquire a considerable knowledge of English politics
348-132611-0044	train-other-500	His skill in maritime affairs recommended him to James who had during many years paid close attention to the business of the Admiralty and understood that business as well as he was capable of understanding anything
348-132611-0045	train-other-500	They conversed every day long and freely about the state of the shipping and the dock yards The result of this intimacy was as might have been expected that the keen and vigilant Frenchman
348-132611-0046	train-other-500	conceived a great contempt for the King s abilities and character The world he said had much overrated His Britannic Majesty who had less capacity than Charles
none	none	 and not more virtues fifty four The two envoys of Lewis 
348-132611-0047	train-other-500	though pursuing one object very judiciously took different paths They made a partition of the court Bonrepaux lived chiefly with Rochester and Rochester s adherents Barillon s connections
348-132611-0048	train-other-500	were chiefly with the opposite faction The consequence was that they sometimes saw the same event in different points of view
none	none	 The best account now extant of the contest which at this time agitated Whitehall is to be found in their despatches As each of the two parties at the Court of James had the support of foreign princes so each had also the support of an ecclesiastical authority to which the King paid great deference The Supreme Pontiff was for legal and moderate courses and his sentiments were expressed by the Nuncio and by the Vicar Apostolic fifty five On the other side was a body of which the weight balanced even the weight of the Papacy the mighty Order of Jesus That at this conjuncture these two great spiritual powers once as it seemed inseparably allied should have been opposed to each other is a most important and remarkable circumstance During a period of little less than a thousand years the regular clergy had been the chief support of the Holy See By that See they had been protected from episcopal interference and the protection which they had received had been amply repaid But for their exertions it is probable that the Bishop of Rome would have been merely the honorary president of a vast aristocracy of prelates It was by the aid of the Benedictines that Gregory the Seventh was enabled to contend at once against the Franconian Caesars and against the secular priesthood It was by the aid of the Dominicans and Franciscans that Innocent the Third crushed the Albigensian sectaries In the sixteenth century the Pontificate exposed to new dangers more formidable than had ever before threatened it was saved by a new religious order which was animated by intense enthusiasm and organized with exquisite skill When the Jesuits came to the rescue of the Papacy they found it in extreme peril but from that moment the tide of battle turned Protestantism which had during a whole generation carried all before it was stopped in its progress and rapidly beaten back from the foot of the Alps to the shores of the Baltic Before the Order had existed a hundred years it had filled the whole world with memorials of great things done and suffered for the faith No religious community could produce a list of men so variously distinguished none had extended its operations over so vast a space yet in none had there ever been such perfect unity of feeling and action There was no region of the globe no walk of speculative or of active life in which Jesuits were not to be found They guided the counsels of Kings They deciphered Latin inscriptions They observed the motions of Jupiter s satellites They published whole libraries controversy casuistry history treatises on optics Alcaic odes editions of the fathers madrigals catechisms and lampoons The liberal education of youth passed almost entirely into their hands and was conducted by them with conspicuous ability They appear to have discovered the precise point to which intellectual culture can be carried without risk of intellectual emancipation Enmity itself was compelled to own that in the art of managing and forming the tender mind they had no equals Meanwhile they assiduously and successfully cultivated the eloquence of the pulpit With still greater assiduity and still greater success they applied themselves to the ministry of the confessional Throughout Catholic Europe the secrets of every government and of almost every family of note were in their keeping They glided from one Protestant country to another under innumerable disguises as gay Cavaliers as simple rustics as Puritan preachers They wandered to countries which neither mercantile avidity nor liberal curiosity had ever impelled any stranger to explore They were to be found in the garb of Mandarins superintending the observatory at Pekin They were to be found spade in hand teaching the rudiments of agriculture to the savages of Paraguay Yet whatever might be their residence whatever might be their employment their spirit was the same entire devotion to the common cause implicit obedience to the central authority None of them had chosen his dwelling place or his vocation for himself Whether the Jesuit should live under the arctic circle or under the equator whether he should pass his life in arranging gems and collating manuscripts at the Vatican or in persuading naked barbarians in the southern hemisphere not to eat each other were matters which he left with profound submission to the decision of others If he was wanted at Lima he was on the Atlantic in the next fleet If he was wanted at Bagdad he was toiling through the desert with the next caravan If his ministry was needed in some country where his life was more insecure than that of a wolf where it was a crime to harbour him where the heads and quarters of his brethren fixed in the public places showed him what he had to expect he went without remonstrance or hesitation to his doom Nor is this heroic spirit yet extinct When in our own time a new and terrible pestilence passed round the globe when in some great cities fear had dissolved all the ties which hold society together when the secular clergy had deserted their flocks when medical succour was not to be purchased by gold when the strongest natural affections had yielded to the love of life even then the Jesuit was found by the pallet which bishop and curate physician and nurse father and mother had deserted bending over infected lips to catch the faint accents of confession and holding up to the last before the expiring penitent the image of the expiring Redeemer But with the admirable energy disinterestedness and self devotion which were characteristic of the Society great vices were mingled It was alleged and not without foundation that the ardent public spirit which made the Jesuit regardless of his ease of his liberty and of his life made him also regardless of truth and of mercy that no means which could promote the interest of his religion seemed to him unlawful and that by the interest of his religion he too often meant the interest of his Society It was alleged that in the most atrocious plots recorded in history his agency could be distinctly traced that constant only in attachment to the fraternity to which he belonged he was in some countries the most dangerous enemy of freedom and in others the most dangerous enemy of order The mighty victories which he boasted that he had achieved in the cause of the Church were in the judgment of many illustrious members of that Church rather apparent than real He had indeed laboured with a wonderful show of success to reduce the world under her laws but he had done so by relaxing her laws to suit the temper of the world Instead of toiling to elevate human nature to the noble standard fixed by divine precept and example he had lowered the standard till it was beneath the average level of human nature He gloried in multitudes of converts who had been baptized in the remote regions of the East but it was reported that from some of those converts the facts on which the whole theology of the Gospel depends had been cunningly concealed and that others were permitted to avoid persecution by bowing down before the images of false gods while internally repeating Paters and Ayes Nor was it only in heathen countries that such arts were said to be practised It was not strange that people of alt ranks and especially of the highest ranks crowded to the confessionals in the Jesuit temples for from those confessionals none went discontented away There the priest was all things to all men He showed just so much rigour as might not drive those who knelt at his spiritual tribunal to the Dominican or the Franciscan church If he had to deal with a mind truly devout he spoke in the saintly tones of the primitive fathers but with that very large part of mankind who have religion enough to make them uneasy when they do wrong and not religion enough to keep them from doing wrong he followed a very different system Since he could not reclaim them from guilt it was his business to save them from remorse He had at his command an immense dispensary of anodynes for wounded consciences In the books of casuistry which had been written by his brethren and printed with the approbation of his superiors were to be found doctrines consolatory to transgressors of every class There the bankrupt was taught how he might without sin secrete his goods from his creditors The servant was taught how he might without sin run off with his master s plate The pandar was assured that a Christian man might innocently earn his living by carrying letters and messages between married women and their gallants The high spirited and punctilious gentlemen of France were gratified by a decision in favour of duelling The Italians accustomed to darker and baser modes of vengeance were glad to learn that they might without any crime shoot at their enemies from behind hedges To deceit was given a license sufficient to destroy the whole value of human contracts and of human testimony In truth if society continued to hold together if life and property enjoyed any security it was because common sense and common humanity restrained men from doing what the Society of Jesus assured them that they might with a safe conscience do So strangely were good and evil intermixed in the character of these celebrated brethren and the intermixture was the secret of their gigantic power That power could never have belonged to mere hypocrites It could never have belonged to rigid moralists It was to be attained only by men sincerely enthusiastic in the pursuit of a great end and at the same time unscrupulous as to the choice of means From the first the Jesuits had been bound by a peculiar allegiance to the Pope Their mission had been not less to quell all mutiny within the Church than to repel the hostility of her avowed enemies Their doctrine was in the highest degree what has been called on our side of the Alps Ultramontane and differed almost as much from the doctrine of Bossuet as from that of Luther They condemned the Gallican liberties the claim of oecumenical councils to control the Holy See and the claim of Bishops to an independent commission from heaven Lainez in the name of the whole fraternity proclaimed at Trent amidst the applause of the creatures of Pius the Fourth and the murmurs of French and Spanish prelates that the government of the faithful had been committed by Christ to the Pope alone that in the Pope alone all sacerdotal authority was concentrated and that through the Pope alone priests and bishops derived whatever divine authority they possessed fifty six During many years the union between the Supreme Pontiffs and the Order had continued unbroken Had that union been still unbroken when James the Second ascended the English throne had the influence of the Jesuits as well as the influence of the Pope been exerted in favour of a moderate and constitutional policy it is probable that the great revolution which in a short time changed the whole state of European affairs would never have taken place But even before the middle of the seventeenth century the Society proud of its services and confident in its strength had become impatient of the yoke A generation of Jesuits sprang up who looked for protection and guidance rather to the court of France than to the court of Rome and this disposition was not a little strengthened when Innocent the Eleventh was raised to the papal throne The Jesuits were at that time engaged in a war to the death against an enemy whom they had at first disdained but whom they had at length been forced to regard with respect and fear Just when their prosperity was at the height they were braved by a handful of opponents who had indeed no influence with the rulers of this world but who were strong in religious faith and intellectual energy Then followed a long a strange a glorious conflict of genius against power The Jesuit called cabinets tribunals universities to his aid and they responded to the call Port Royal appealed not in vain to the hearts and to the understandings of millions The dictators of Christendom found themselves on a sudden in the position of culprits They were arraigned on the charge of having systematically debased the standard of evangelical morality for the purpose of increasing their own influence and the charge was enforced in a manner which at once arrested the attention of the whole world for the chief accuser was Blaise Pascal His intellectual powers were such as have rarely been bestowed on any of the children of men and the vehemence of the zeal which animated him was but too well proved by the cruel penances and vigils under which his macerated frame sank into an early grave His spirit was the spirit of Saint Bernard but the delicacy of his wit the purity the energy the simplicity of his rhetoric had never been equalled except by the great masters of Attic eloquence All Europe read and admired laughed and wept The Jesuits attempted to reply but their feeble answers were received by the public with shouts of mockery They wanted it is true no talent or accomplishment into which men can be drilled by elaborate discipline but such discipline though it may bring out the powers of ordinary minds has a tendency to suffocate rather than to develop original genius It was universally acknowledged that in the literary contest the Jansenists were completely victorious To the Jesuits nothing was left but to oppress the sect which they could not confute Lewis the Fourteenth was now their chief support His conscience had from boyhood been in their keeping and he had learned from them to abhor Jansenism quite as much as he abhorred Protestantism and very much more than he abhorred Atheism Innocent the Eleventh on the other hand leaned to the Jansenist opinions The consequence was that the Society found itself in a situation never contemplated by its founder The Jesuits were estranged from the Supreme Pontiff and they were closely allied with a prince who proclaimed himself the champion of the Gallican liberties and the enemy of Ultramontane pretensions Thus the Order became in England an instrument of the designs of Lewis and laboured with a success which the Roman Catholics afterwards long and bitterly deplored to widen the breach between the King and the Parliament to thwart the Nuncio to undermine the power of the Lord Treasurer and to support the most desperate schemes of Tyrconnel Thus on one side were the Hydes and the whole body of Tory churchmen Powis and all the most respectable noblemen and gentlemen of the King s own faith the States General the House of Austria and the Pope On the other side were a few Roman Catholic adventurers of broken fortune and tainted reputation backed by France and by the Jesuits The chief representative of the Jesuits at Whitehall was an English brother of the Order who had during some time acted as Viceprovincial who had been long regarded by James with peculiar favour and who had lately been made Clerk of the Closet This man named Edward Petre was descended from an honourable family His manners were courtly his speech was flowing and plausible but he was weak and vain covetous and ambitious Of all the evil counsellors who had access to the royal ear he bore perhaps the largest part in the ruin of the House of Stuart The obstinate and imperious nature of the King gave great advantages to those who advised him to be firm to yield nothing and to make himself feared One state maxim had taken possession of his small understanding and was not to be dislodged by reason To reason indeed he was not in the habit of attending His mode of arguing if it is to be so called was one not uncommon among dull and stubborn persons who are accustomed to be surrounded by their inferiors He asserted a proposition and as often as wiser people ventured respectfully to show that it was erroneous he asserted it again in exactly the same words and conceived that by doing so he at once disposed of all objections fifty seven I will make no concession he often repeated my father made concessions and he was beheaded fifty eight If it were true that concession had been fatal to Charles the First a man of sense would have known that a single experiment is not sufficient to establish a general rule even in sciences much less complicated than the science of government that since the beginning of the world no two political experiments were ever made of which all the conditions were exactly alike and that the only way to learn civil prudence from history is to examine and compare an immense number of cases But if the single instance on which the King relied proved anything it proved that he was in the wrong There can be little doubt that if Charles had frankly made to the Short Parliament which met in the spring of sixteen forty but one half of the concessions which he made a few months later to the Long Parliament he would have lived and died a powerful King On the other hand there can be no doubt whatever that if he had refused to make any concession to the Long Parliament and had resorted to arms in defence of the ship money and of the Star Chamber he would have seen in the hostile ranks Hyde and Falkland side by side with Hollis and Hampden But in truth he would not have been able to resort to arms for nor twenty Cavaliers would have joined his standard It was to his large concessions alone that he owed the support of that great body of noblemen and gentlemen who fought so long and so gallantly in his cause But it would have been useless to represent these things to James Another fatal delusion had taken possession of his mind and was never dispelled till it had ruined him He firmly believed that do what he might the members of the Church of England would act up to their principles It had he knew been proclaimed from ten thousand pulpits it had been solemnly declared by the University of Oxford that even tyranny as frightful as that of the most depraved of the Caesars did not justify subjects in resisting the royal authority and hence he was weak enough to conclude that the whole body of Tory gentlemen and clergymen would let him plunder oppress and insult them without lifting an arm against him It seems strange that any man should have passed his fiftieth year without discovering that people sometimes do what they think wrong and James had only to look into his own heart for abundant proof that even a strong sense of religious duty will not always prevent frail human beings from indulging their passions in defiance of divine laws and at the risk of awful penalties He must have been conscious that though he thought adultery sinful he was an adulterer but nothing could convince him that any man who professed to think rebellion sinful would ever in any extremity be a rebel The Church of England was in his view a passive victim which he might without danger outrage and torture at his pleasure nor did he ever see his error till the Universities were preparing to coin their plate for the purpose of supplying the military chest of his enemies and till a Bishop long renowned for loyalty had thrown aside his cassock girt on a sword and taken the command of a regiment of insurgents In these fatal follies the King was artfully encouraged by a minister who had been an Exclusionist and who still called himself a Protestant the Earl of Sunderland The motives and conduct of this unprincipled politician have often been misrepresented He was in his own lifetime accused by the Jacobites of having even before the beginning of the reign of James determined to bring about a revolution in favour of the Prince of Orange and of having with that view recommended a succession of outrages on the civil and ecclesiastical constitution of the realm This idle story has been repeated down to our own days by ignorant writers But no well informed historian whatever might be his prejudices has condescended to adopt it for it rests on no evidence whatever and scarcely any evidence would convince reasonable men that Sunderland deliberately incurred guilt and infamy in order to bring about a change by which it was clear that he could not possibly be a gainer and by which in fact he lost immense wealth and influence Nor is there the smallest reason for resorting to so strange a hypothesis For the truth lies on the surface Crooked as this man s course was the law which determined it was simple His conduct is to be ascribed to the alternate influence of cupidity and fear on a mind highly susceptible of both those passions and quicksighted rather than farsighted He wanted more power and more money More power he could obtain only at Rochester s expense and the obvious way to obtain power at Rochester s expense was to encourage the dislike which the King felt for Rochester s moderate counsels Money could be most easily and most largely obtained from the court of Versailles and Sunderland was eager to sell himself to that court He had no jovial generous vices He cared little for wine or for beauty but he desired riches with an ungovernable and insatiable desire The passion for play raged in him without measure and had not been tamed by ruinous losses His hereditary fortune was ample He had long filled lucrative posts and had neglected no art which could make them more lucrative but his ill luck at the hazard table was such that his estates were daily becoming more and more encumbered In the hope of extricating himself from his embarrassments he betrayed to Barillon all the schemes adverse to France which had been meditated in the English cabinet and hinted that a Secretary of State could in such times render services for which it might be wise in Lewis to pay largely The Ambassador told his master that six thousand guineas was the smallest gratification that could be offered to so important a minister Lewis consented to go as high as twenty five thousand crowns equivalent to about five thousand six hundred pounds sterling It was agreed that Sunderland should receive this sum yearly and that he should in return exert all his influence to prevent the reassembling of the Parliament fifty nine He joined himself therefore to the Jesuitical cabal and made so dexterous an use of the influence of that cabal that he was appointed to succeed Halifax in the high dignity of Lord President without being required to resign the far more active and lucrative post of Secretary sixty He felt however that he could never hope to obtain paramount influence in the court while he was supposed to belong to the Established Church All religions were the same to him In private circles indeed he was in the habit of talking with profane contempt of the most sacred things He therefore determined to let the King have the delight and glory of effecting a conversion Some management however was necessary No man is utterly without regard for the opinion of his fellow creatures and even Sunderland though not very sensible to shame flinched from the infamy of public apostasy He played his part with rare adroitness To the world he showed himself as a Protestant In the royal closet he assumed the character of an earnest inquirer after truth who was almost persuaded to declare himself a Roman Catholic and who while waiting for fuller illumination was disposed to render every service in his power to the professors of the old faith James who was never very discerning and who in religious matters was absolutely blind suffered himself notwithstanding all that he had seen of human knavery of the knavery of courtiers as a class and of the knavery of Sunderland in particular to be duped into the belief that divine grace had touched the most false and callous of human hearts During many months the wily minister continued to be regarded at court as a promising catechumen without exhibiting himself to the public in the character of a renegade sixty one He early suggested to the King the expediency of appointing a secret committee of Roman Catholics to advise on all matters affecting the interests of their religion This committee met sometimes at Chiffinch s lodgings and sometimes at the official apartments of Sunderland who though still nominally a Protestant was admitted to all its deliberations and soon obtained a decided ascendency over the other members Every Friday the Jesuitical cabal dined with the Secretary The conversation at table was free and the weaknesses of the prince whom the confederates hoped to manage were not spared To Petre Sunderland promised a Cardinal s hat to Castelmaine a splendid embassy to Rome to Dover a lucrative command in the Guards and to Tyrconnel high employment in Ireland Thus hound together by the strongest ties of interest these men addressed themselves to the task of subverting the Treasurer s power sixty two There were two Protestant members of the cabinet who took no decided part in the struggle Jeffreys was at this time tortured by a cruel internal malady which had been aggravated by intemperance At a dinner which a wealthy Alderman gave to some of the leading members of the government the Lord Treasurer and the Lord Chancellor were so drunk that they stripped themselves almost stark naked and were with difficulty prevented from climbing up a signpost to drink His Majesty s health The pious Treasurer escaped with nothing but the scandal of the debauch but the Chancellor brought on a violent fit of his complaint His life was for some time thought to be in serious danger James expressed great uneasiness at the thought of losing a minister who suited him so well and said with some truth that the loss of such a man could not be easily repaired Jeffreys when he became convalescent promised his support to both the contending parties and waited to see which of them would prove victorious Some curious proofs of his duplicity are still extant It has been already said that the two French agents who were then resident in London had divided the English court between them Bonrepaux was constantly with Rochester and Barillon lived with Sunderland Lewis was informed in the same week by Bonrepaux that the Chancellor was entirely with the Treasurer and by Barillon that the Chancellor was in league with the Secretary sixty three Godolphin cautious and taciturn did his best to preserve neutrality His opinions and wishes were undoubtedly with Rochester but his office made it necessary for him to be in constant attendance on the Queen and he was naturally unwilling to be on bad terms with her There is indeed reason to believe that he regarded her with an attachment more romantic than often finds place in the hearts of veteran statesmen and circumstances which it is now necessary to relate had thrown her entirely into the hands of the Jesuitical cabal sixty four The King stern as was his temper and grave as was his deportment was scarcely less under the influence of female attractions than his more lively and amiable brother had been The beauty indeed which distinguished the favourite ladies of Charles was not necessary to James Barbara Palmer Eleanor Gwynn and Louisa de Querouaille were among the finest women of their time James when young had surrendered his liberty descended below his rank and incurred the displeasure of his family for the coarse features of Anne Hyde He had soon to the great diversion of the whole court been drawn away from his plain consort by a plainer mistress Arabella Churchill His second wife though twenty years younger than himself and of no unpleasing face or figure had frequent reason to complain of his inconstancy But of all his illicit attachments the strongest was that which bound him to Catharine Sedley This woman was the daughter of Sir Charles Sedley one of the most brilliant and profligate wits of the Restoration The licentiousness of his writings is not redeemed by much grace or vivacity but the charms of his conversation were acknowledged even by sober men who had no esteem for his character To sit near him at the theatre and to hear his criticisms on a new play was regarded as a privilege sixty five Dryden had done him the honour to make him a principal interlocutor in the Dialogue on Dramatic Poesy The morals of Sedley were such as even in that age gave great scandal He on one occasion after a wild revel exhibited himself without a shred of clothing in the balcony of a tavern near Covent Garden and harangued the people who were passing in language so indecent and profane that he was driven in by a shower of brickbats was prosecuted for a misdemeanour was sentenced to a heavy fine and was reprimanded by the Court of King s Bench in the most cutting terms sixty six His daughter had inherited his abilities and his impudence Personal charms she had none with the exception of two brilliant eyes the lustre of which to men of delicate taste seemed fierce and unfeminine Her form was lean her countenance haggard Charles though he liked her conversation laughed at her ugliness and said that the priests must have recommended her to his brother by way of penance She well knew that she was not handsome and jested freely on her own homeliness Yet with strange inconsistency she loved to adorn herself magnificently and drew on herself much keen ridicule by appearing in the theatre and the ring plastered painted clad in Brussels lace glittering with diamonds and affecting all the graces of eighteen sixty seven The nature of her influence over James is not easily to be explained He was no longer young He was a religious man at least he was willing to make for his religion exertions and sacrifices from which the great majority of those who are called religious men would shrink It seems strange that any attractions should have drawn him into a course of life which he must have regarded as highly criminal and in this case none could understand where the attraction lay Catharine herself was astonished by the violence of his passion It cannot be my beauty she said for he must see that I have none and it cannot be my wit for he has not enough to know that I have any At the moment of the King s accession a sense of the new responsibility which lay on him made his mind for a time peculiarly open to religious impressions He formed and announced many good resolutions spoke in public with great severity of the impious and licentious manners of the age and in private assured his Queen and his confessor that he would see Catharine Sedley no more He wrote to his mistress entreating her to quit the apartments which she occupied at Whitehall and to go to a house in Saint James s Square which had been splendidly furnished for her at his expense He at the same time promised to allow her a large pension from his privy purse Catharine clever strongminded intrepid and conscious of her power refused to stir In a few months it began to be whispered that the services of Chiffinch were again employed and that the mistress frequently passed and repassed through that private door through which Father Huddleston had borne the host to the bedside of Charles The King s Protestant ministers had it seems conceived a hope that their master s infatuation for this woman might cure him of the more pernicious infatuation which impelled him to attack their religion She had all the talents which could qualify her to play on his feelings to make game of his scruples to set before him in a strong light the difficulties and dangers into which he was running headlong Rochester the champion of the Church exerted himself to strengthen her influence Ormond who is popularly regarded as the personification of all that is pure and highminded in the English Cavalier encouraged the design Even Lady Rochester was not ashamed to cooperate and that in the very worst way Her office was to direct the jealousy of the injured wife towards a young lady who was perfectly innocent The whole court took notice of the coldness and rudeness with which the Queen treated the poor girl on whom suspicion had been thrown but the cause of Her Majesty s ill humour was a mystery For a time the intrigue went on prosperously and secretly Catharine often told the King plainly what the Protestant Lords of the Council only dared to hint in the most delicate phrases His crown she said was at stake the old dotard Arundell and the blustering Tyrconnel would lead him to his ruin It is possible that her caresses might have done what the united exhortations of the Lords and the Commons of the House of Austria and the Holy See had failed to do but for a strange mishap which changed the whole face of affairs James in a fit of fondness determined to make his mistress Countess of Dorchester in her own right Catharine saw all the peril of such a step and declined the invidious honour Her lover was obstinate and himself forced the patent into her hands She at last accepted it on one condition which shows her confidence in her own power and in his weakness She made him give her a solemn promise not that he would never quit her but that if he did so he would himself announce his resolution to her and grant her one parting interview As soon as the news of her elevation got abroad the whole palace was in an uproar The warm blood of Italy boiled in the veins of the Queen Proud of her youth and of her charms of her high rank and of her stainless chastity she could not without agonies of grief and rage see herself deserted and insulted for such a rival Rochester perhaps remembering how patiently after a short struggle Catharine of Braganza had consented to treat the mistresses of Charles with politeness had expected that after a little complaining and pouting Mary of Modena would be equally submissive It was not so She did not even attempt to conceal from the eyes of the world the violence of her emotions Day after day the courtiers who came to see her dine observed that the dishes were removed untasted from the table She suffered the tears to stream down her cheeks unconcealed in the presence of the whole circle of ministers and envoys To the King she spoke with wild vehemence Let me go she cried You have made your woman a Countess make her a Queen Put my crown on her head Only let me hide myself in some convent where I may never see her more Then more soberly she asked him how he reconciled his conduct to his religious professions You are ready she said to put your kingdom to hazard for the sake of your soul and yet you are throwing away your soul for the sake of that creature Father Petre on bended knees seconded these remonstrances It was his duty to do so and his duty was not the less strenuously performed because it coincided with his interest The King went on for a time sinning and repenting In his hours of remorse his penances were severe Mary treasured up to the end of her life and at her death bequeathed to the convent of Chaillot the scourge with which he had vigorously avenged her wrongs upon his own shoulders Nothing but Catharine s absence could put an end to this struggle between an ignoble love and an ignoble superstition James wrote imploring and commanding her to depart He owned that he had promised to bid her farewell in person But I know too well he added the power which you have over me I have not strength of mind enough to keep my resolution if I see you He offered her a yacht to convey her with all dignity and comfort to Flanders and threatened that if she did not go quietly she should be sent away by force She at one time worked on his feelings by pretending to be ill Then she assumed the airs of a martyr and impudently proclaimed herself a sufferer for the Protestant religion Then again she adopted the style of John Hampden She defied the King to remove her She would try the right with him While the Great Charter and the Habeas Corpus Act were the law of the land she would live where she pleased And Flanders she cried never I have learned one thing from my friend the Duchess of Mazarin and that is never to trust myself in a country where there are convents At length she selected Ireland as the place of her exile probably because the brother of her patron Rochester was viceroy there After many delays she departed leaving the victory to the Queen sixty eight The history of this extraordinary intrigue would be imperfect if it were not added that there is still extant a religious meditation written by the Treasurer with his own hand on the very same day on which the intelligence of his attempt to govern his master by means of a concubine was despatched by Bonrepaux to Versailles No composition of Ken or Leighton breathes a spirit of more fervent and exalted piety than this effusion Hypocrisy cannot be suspected for the paper was evidently meant only for the writer s own eye and was not published till he had been more than a century in his grave So much is history stranger than fiction and so true is it that nature has caprices which art dares not imitate A dramatist would scarcely venture to bring on the stage a grave prince in the decline of life ready to sacrifice his crown in order to serve the interests of his religion indefatigable in making proselytes and yet deserting and insulting a wife who had youth and beauty for the sake of a profligate paramour who had neither Still less if possible would a dramatist venture to introduce a statesman stooping to the wicked and shameful part of a procurer and calling in his wife to aid him in that dishonourable office yet in his moments of leisure retiring to his closet and there secretly pouring out his soul to his God in penitent tears and devout ejaculations sixty nine The Treasurer soon found that in using scandalous means for the purpose of obtaining a laudable end he had committed not only a crime but a folly The Queen was now his enemy She affected indeed to listen with civility while the Hydes excused their recent conduct as well as they could and she occasionally pretended to use her influence in their favour but she must have been more or less than woman if she had really forgiven the conspiracy which had been formed against her dignity and her domestic happiness by the family of her husband s first wife The Jesuits strongly represented to the King the danger which he had so narrowly escaped His reputation they said his peace his soul had been put in peril by the machinations of his prime minister The Nuncio who would gladly have counteracted the influence of the violent party and cooperated with the moderate members of the cabinet could not honestly or decently separate himself on this occasion from Father Petre James himself when parted by the sea from the charms which had so strongly fascinated him could not but regard with resentment and contempt those who had sought to govern him by means of his vices What had passed must have had the effect of raising his own Church in his esteem and of lowering the Church of England The Jesuits whom it was the fashion to represent as the most unsafe of spiritual guides as sophists who refined away the whole system of evangelical morality as sycophants who owed their influence chiefly to the indulgence with which they treated the sins of the great had reclaimed him from a life of guilt by rebukes as sharp and bold as those which David had heard from Nathan and Herod from the Baptist On the other hand zealous Protestants whose favourite theme was the laxity of Popish casuists and the wickedness of doing evil that good might come had attempted to obtain advantages for their own Church in a way which all Christians regarded as highly criminal The victory of the cabal of evil counsellors was therefore complete The King looked coldly on Rochester The courtiers and foreign ministers soon perceived that the Lord Treasurer was prime minister only in name He continued to offer his advice daily and had the mortification to find it daily rejected Yet he could not prevail on himself to relinquish the outward show of power and the emoluments which he directly and indirectly derived from his great place He did his best therefore to conceal his vexations from the public eye But his violent passions and his intemperate habits disqualified him for the part of a dissembler His gloomy looks when he came out of the council chamber showed how little he was pleased with what had passed at the board and when the bottle had gone round freely words escaped him which betrayed his uneasiness seventy He might indeed well be uneasy Indiscreet and unpopular measures followed each other in rapid succession All thought of returning to the policy of the Triple Alliance was abandoned The King explicitly avowed to the ministers of those continental powers with which he had lately intended to ally himself that all his views had undergone a change and that England was still to be as she had been under his grandfather his father and his brother of no account in Europe I am in no condition he said to the Spanish Ambassador to trouble myself about what passes abroad It is my resolution to let foreign affairs take their course to establish my authority at home and to do something for my religion A few days later he announced the same intentions to the States General seventy one From that time to the close of his ignominious reign he made no serious effort to escape from vassalage though to the last he could never hear without transports of rage that men called him a vassal The two events which proved to the public that Sunderland and Sunderland s party were victorious were the prorogation of the Parliament from February to May and the departure of Castelmaine for Rome with the appointments of an Ambassador of the highest rank seventy two Hitherto all the business of the English government at the papal court had been transacted by John Caryl This gentleman was known to his contemporaries as a man of fortune and fashion and as the author of two successful plays a tragedy in rhyme which had been made popular by the action and recitation of Betterton and a comedy which owes all its value to scenes borrowed from Moliere These pieces have long been forgotten but what Caryl could not do for himself has been done for him by a more powerful genius Half a line in the Rape of the Lock has made his name immortal Caryl who was like all the other respectable Roman Catholics an enemy to violent courses had acquitted himself of his delicate errand at Rome with good sense and good feeling The business confided to him was well done but he assumed no public character and carefully avoided all display His mission therefore put the government to scarcely any charge and excited scarcely any murmurs His place was now most unwisely supplied by a costly and ostentatious embassy offensive in the highest degree to the people of England and by no means welcome to the court of Rome Castelmaine had it in charge to demand a Cardinal s hat for his confederate Petre About the same time the King began to show in an unequivocal manner the feeling which he really entertained towards the banished Huguenots While he had still hoped to cajole his Parliament into submission and to become the head of an European coalition against France he had affected to blame the revocation of the edict of Nantes and to pity the unhappy men whom persecution had driven from their country He had caused it to be announced that at every church in the kingdom a collection would be made under his sanction for their benefit A proclamation on this subject had been drawn up in terms which might have wounded the pride of a sovereign less sensitive and vainglorious than Lewis But all was now changed The principles of the treaty of Dover were again the principles of the foreign policy of England Ample apologies were therefore made for the discourtesy with which the English government had acted towards France in showing favour to exiled Frenchmen The proclamation which had displeased Lewis was recalled seventy three The Huguenot ministers were admonished to speak with reverence of their oppressor in their public discourses as they would answer it at their peril James not only ceased to express commiseration for the sufferers but declared that he believed them to harbour the worst designs and owned that he had been guilty of an error in countenancing them One of the most eminent of the refugees John Claude had published on the Continent a small volume in which he described with great force the sufferings of his brethren Barillon demanded that some opprobrious mark should be put on his book James complied and in full council declared it to be his pleasure that Claude s libel should be burned by the hangman before the Royal Exchange Even Jeffreys was startled and ventured to represent that such a proceeding was without example that the book was written in a foreign tongue that it had been printed at a foreign press that it related entirely to transactions which had taken place in a foreign country and that no English government had ever animadverted on such works James would not suffer the question to be discussed My resolution he said is taken It has become the fashion to treat Kings disrespectfully and they must stand by each other One King should always take another s part and I have particular reasons for showing this respect to the King of France There was silence at the board The order was forthwith issued and Claude s pamphlet was committed to the flames not without the deep murmurs of many who had always been reputed steady loyalists seventy four The promised collection was long put off under various pretexts The King would gladly have broken his word but it was pledged so solemnly that he could not for very shame retract seventy five Nothing however which could cool the zeal of congregations was omitted It had been expected that according to the practice usual on such occasions the people would be exhorted to liberality from the pulpits But James was determined not to tolerate declamations against his religion and his ally The Archbishop of Canterbury was therefore commanded to inform the clergy that they must merely read the brief and must not presume to preach on the sufferings of the French Protestants seventy six Nevertheless the contributions were so large that after all deductions the sum of forty thousand pounds was paid into the Chamber of London Perhaps none of the munificent subscriptions of our own age has borne so great a proportion to the means of the nation seventy seven The King was bitterly mortified by the large amount of the collection which had been made in obedience to his own call He knew he said what all this liberality meant It was mere Whiggish spite to himself and his religion seventy eight He had already resolved that the money should be of no use to those whom the donors wished to benefit He had been during some weeks in close communication with the French embassy on this subject and had with the approbation of the court of Versailles determined on a course which it is not very easy to reconcile with those principles of toleration to which he afterwards pretended to be attached The refugees were zealous for the Calvinistic discipline and worship James therefore gave orders that none should receive a crust of bread or a basket of coals who did not first take the sacrament according to the Anglican ritual seventy nine It is strange that this inhospitable rule should have been devised by a prince who affected to consider the Test Act as an outrage on the rights of conscience for however unjustifiable it may be to establish a sacramental test for the purpose of ascertaining whether men are fit for civil and military office it is surely much more unjustifiable to establish a sacramental test for the purpose of ascertaining whether in their extreme distress they are fit objects of charity Nor had James the plea which may be urged in extenuation of the guilt of almost all other persecutors for the religion which he commanded the refugees to profess on pain of being left to starve was not his own religion His conduct towards them was therefore less excusable than that of Lewis for Lewis oppressed them in the hope of bringing them over from a damnable heresy to the true Church James oppressed them only for the purpose of forcing them to apostatize from one damnable heresy to another Several Commissioners of whom the Chancellor was one had been appointed to dispense the public alms When they met for the first time Jeffreys announced the royal pleasure The refugees he said were too generally enemies of monarchy and episcopacy If they wished for relief they must become members of the Church of England and must take the sacrament from the hands of his chaplain Many exiles who had come full of gratitude and hope to apply for succour heard their sentence and went brokenhearted away eighty May was now approaching and that month had been fixed for the meeting of the Houses but they were again prorogued to November eighty one It was not strange that the King did not wish to meet them for he had determined to adopt a policy which he knew to be in the highest degree odious to them From his predecessors he had inherited two prerogatives of which the limits had never been defined with strict accuracy and which if exerted without any limit would of themselves have sufficed to overturn the whole polity of the State and of the Church These were the dispensing power and the ecclesiastical supremacy By means of the dispensing power the King purposed to admit Roman Catholics not merely to civil and military but to spiritual offices By means of the ecclesiastical supremacy he hoped to make the Anglican clergy his instruments for the destruction of their own religion This scheme developed itself by degrees It was not thought safe to begin by granting to the whole Roman Catholic body a dispensation from all statutes imposing penalties and tests For nothing was more fully established than that such a dispensation was illegal The Cabal had in sixteen seventy two put forth a general Declaration of Indulgence The Commons as soon as they met had protested against it Charles the Second had ordered it to be cancelled in his presence and had both by his own mouth and by a written message assured the Houses that the step which had caused so much complaint should never be drawn into precedent It would have been difficult to find in all the Inns of Court a barrister of reputation to argue in defence of a prerogative which the Sovereign seated on his throne in full Parliament had solemnly renounced a few years before But it was not quite so clear that the King might not on special grounds grant exemptions to individuals by name The first object of James therefore was to obtain from the courts of common law an acknowledgment that to this extent at least he possessed the dispensing power But though his pretensions were moderate when compared with those which he put forth a few months later he soon found that he had against him almost the whole sense of Westminster Hall Four of the Judges gave him to understand that they could not on this occasion serve his purpose and it is remarkable that all the four were violent Tories and that among them were men who had accompanied Jeffreys on the Bloody Circuit and who had consented to the death of Cornish and of Elizabeth Gaunt Jones the Chief Justice of the Common Pleas a man who had never before shrunk from any drudgery however cruel or servile now held in the royal closet language which might have become the lips of the purest magistrates in our history He was plainly told that he must either give up his opinion or his place For my place he answered I care little I am old and worn out in the service of the crown but I am mortified to find that your Majesty thinks me capable of giving a judgment which none but an ignorant or a dishonest man could give I am determined said the King to have twelve Judges who will be all of my mind as to this matter Your Majesty answered Jones may find twelve Judges of your mind but hardly twelve lawyers eighty two He was dismissed together with Montague Chief Baron of the Exchequer and two puisne Judges Neville and Charlton One of the new Judges was Christopher Milton younger brother of the great poet Of Christopher little is known except that in the time of the civil war he had been a Royalist and that he now in his old age leaned towards Popery It does not appear that he was ever formally reconciled to the Church of Rome but he certainly had scruples about communicating with the Church of England and had therefore a strong interest in supporting the dispensing power eighty three The King found his counsel as refractory as his Judges The first barrister who learned that he was expected to defend the dispensing power was the Solicitor General Heneage Finch He peremptorily refused and was turned out of office on the following day eighty four The Attorney General Sawyer was ordered to draw warrants authorising members of the Church of Rome to hold benefices belonging to the Church of England Sawyer had been deeply concerned in some of the harshest and most unjustifiable prosecutions of that age and the Whigs abhorred him as a man stained with the blood of Russell and Sidney but on this occasion he showed no want of honesty or of resolution Sir said he this is not merely to dispense with a statute it is to annul the whole statute law from the accession of Elizabeth to this day I dare not do it and I implore your Majesty to consider whether such an attack upon the rights of the Church be in accordance with your late gracious promises eighty five Sawyer would have been instantly dismissed as Finch had been if the government could have found a successor but this was no easy matter It was necessary for the protection of the rights of the crown that one at least of the crown lawyers should be a man of learning ability and experience and no such man was willing to defend the dispensing power The Attorney General was therefore permitted to retain his place during some months Thomas Powis an insignificant man who had no qualification for high employment except servility was appointed Solicitor The preliminary arrangements were now complete There was a Solicitor General to argue for the dispensing power and twelve Judges to decide in favour of it The question was therefore speedily brought to a hearing Sir Edward Hales a gentleman of Kent had been converted to Popery in days when it was not safe for any man of note openly to declare himself a Papist He had kept his secret and when questioned had affirmed that he was a Protestant with a solemnity which did little credit to his principles When James had ascended the throne disguise was no longer necessary Sir Edward publicly apostatized and was rewarded with the command of a regiment of foot He had held his commission more than three months without taking the sacrament He was therefore liable to a penalty of five hundred pounds which an informer might recover by action of debt A menial servant was employed to bring a suit for this sum in the Court of King s Bench Sir Edward did not dispute the facts alleged against him but pleaded that he had letters patent authorising him to hold his commission notwithstanding the Test Act The plaintiff demurred that is to say admitted Sir Edward s plea to be true in fact but denied that it was a sufficient answer Thus was raised a simple issue of law to be decided by the court A barrister who was notoriously a tool of the government appeared for the mock plaintiff and made some feeble objections to the defendant s plea The new Solicitor General replied The Attorney General took no part in the proceedings Judgment was given by the Lord Chief Justice Sir Edward Herbert He announced that he had submitted the question to all the twelve Judges and that in the opinion of eleven of them the King might lawfully dispense with penal statutes in particular cases and for special reasons of grave importance The single dissentient Baron Street was not removed from his place He was a man of morals so bad that his own relations shrank from him and that the Prince of Orange at the time of the Revolution was advised not to see him The character of Street makes it impossible to believe that he would have been more scrupulous than his brethren The character of James makes it impossible to believe that a refractory Baron of the Exchequer would have been permitted to retain his post There can be no reasonable doubt that the dissenting Judge was like the plaintiff and the plaintiff s counsel acting collusively It was important that there should be a great preponderance of authority in favour of the dispensing power yet it was important that the bench which had been carefully packed for the occasion should appear to be independent One Judge therefore the least respectable of the twelve was permitted or more probably commanded to give his voice against the prerogative eighty six The power which the courts of law had thus recognised was not suffered to lie idle Within a month after the decision of the King s Bench had been pronounced four Roman Catholic Lords were sworn of the Privy Council Two of these Powis and Bellasyse were of the moderate party and probably took their seats with reluctance and with many sad forebodings The other two Arundell and Dover had no such misgivings eighty seven The dispensing power was at the same time employed for the purpose of enabling Roman Catholics to hold ecclesiastical preferment The new Solicitor readily drew the warrants in which Sawyer had refused to be concerned One of these warrants was in favour of a wretch named Edward Sclater who had two livings which he was determined to keep at all costs and through all changes He administered the sacrament to his parishioners according to the rites of the Church of England on Palm Sunday sixteen eighty six On Easter Sunday only seven days later he was at mass The royal dispensation authorised him to retain the emoluments of his benefices To the remonstrances of the patrons from whom he had received his preferment he replied in terms of insolent defiance and while the Roman Catholic cause prospered put forth an absurd treatise in defence of his apostasy But a very few weeks after the Revolution a great congregation assembled at Saint Mary s in the Savoy to see him received again into the bosom of the Church which he had deserted He read his recantation with tears flowing from his eyes and pronounced a bitter invective against the Popish priests whose arts had seduced him eighty eight Scarcely less infamous was the conduct of Obadiah Walker He was an aged priest of the Church of England and was well known in the University of Oxford as a man of learning He had in the late reign been suspected of leaning towards Popery but had outwardly conformed to the established religion and had at length been chosen Master of University College Soon after the accession of James Walker determined to throw off the disguise which he had hitherto worn He absented himself from the public worship of the Church of England and with some fellows and undergraduates whom he had perverted heard mass daily in his own apartments One of the first acts performed by the new Solicitor General was to draw up an instrument which authorised Walker and his proselytes to hold their benefices notwithstanding their apostasy Builders were immediately employed to turn two sets of rooms into an oratory In a few weeks the Roman Catholic rites were publicly performed in University College A Jesuit was quartered there as chaplain A press was established there under royal license for the printing of Roman Catholic tracts During two years and a half Walker continued to make war on Protestantism with all the rancour of a renegade but when fortune turned he showed that he wanted the courage of a martyr He was brought to the bar of the House of Commons to answer for his conduct and was base enough to protest that he had never changed his religion that he had never cordially approved of the doctrines of the Church of Rome and that he had never tried to bring any other person within the pale of that Church It was hardly worth while to violate the most sacred obligations of law and of plighted faith for the purpose of making such converts as these eighty nine In a short time the King went a step further Sclater and Walker had only been permitted to keep after they became Papists the preferment which had been bestowed on them while they passed for Protestants To confer a high office in the Established Church on an avowed enemy of that Church was a far bolder violation of the laws and of the royal word But no course was too bold for James The Deanery of Christchurch became vacant That office was both in dignity and in emolument one of the highest in the University of Oxford The Dean was charged with the government of a greater number of youths of high connections and of great hopes than could then be found in any other college He was also the head of a Cathedral In both characters it was necessary that he should be a member of the Church of England Nevertheless John Massey who was notoriously a member of the Church of Rome and who had not one single recommendation except that he was a member of the Church of Rome was appointed by virtue of the dispensing power and soon within the walls of Christchurch an altar was decked at which mass was daily celebrated ninety To the Nuncio the King said that what had been done at Oxford should very soon be done at Cambridge ninety one Yet even this was a small evil compared with that which Protestants had good ground to apprehend It seemed but too probable that the whole government of the Anglican Church would shortly pass into the hands of her deadly enemies Three important sees had lately become vacant that of York that of Chester and that of Oxford The Bishopric of Oxford was given to Samuel Parker a parasite whose religion if he had any religion was that of Rome and who called himself a Protestant only because he was encumbered with a wife I wished the King said to Adda to appoint an avowed Catholic but the time is not come Parker is well inclined to us he is one of us in feeling and by degrees he will bring round his clergy ninety two The Bishopric of Chester vacant by the death of John Pearson a great name both in philology and in divinity was bestowed on Thomas Cartwright a still viler sycophant than Parker The Archbishopric of York remained several years vacant As no good reason could be found for leaving so important a place unfilled men suspected that the nomination was delayed only till the King could venture to place the mitre on the head of an avowed Papist It is indeed highly probable that the Church of England was saved from this outrage by the good sense and good feeling of the Pope Without a special dispensation from Rome no Jesuit could be a Bishop and Innocent could not be induced to grant such a dispensation to Petre James did not even make any secret of his intention to exert vigorously and systematically for the destruction of the Established Church all the powers which he possessed as her head He plainly said that by a wise dispensation of Providence the Act of Supremacy would be the means of healing the fatal breach which it had caused Henry and Elizabeth had usurped a dominion which rightfully belonged to the Holy See That dominion had in the course of succession descended to an orthodox prince and would be held by him in trust for the Holy See He was authorised by law to repress spiritual abuses and the first spiritual abuse which he would repress should be the liberty which the Anglican clergy assumed of defending their own religion and of attacking the doctrines of Rome ninety three But he was met by a great difficulty The ecclesiastical supremacy which had devolved on him was by no means the same great and terrible prerogative which Elizabeth James the First and Charles the First had possessed The enactment which annexed to the crown an almost boundless visitatorial authority over the Church though it had never been formally repealed had really lost a great part of its force The substantive law remained but it remained unaccompanied by any formidable sanction or by any efficient system of procedure and was therefore little more than a dead letter The statute which restored to Elizabeth the spiritual dominion assumed by her father and resigned by her sister contained a clause authorising the sovereign to constitute a tribunal which might investigate reform and punish all ecclesiastical delinquencies Under the authority given by this clause the Court of High Commission was created That court was during many years the terror of Nonconformists and under the harsh administration of Laud became an object of fear and hatred even to those who most loved the Established Church When the Long Parliament met the High Commission was generally regarded as the most grievous of the many grievances under which the nation laboured An act was therefore somewhat hastily passed which not only took away from the Crown the power of appointing visitors to superintend the Church but abolished all ecclesiastical courts without distinction After the Restoration the Cavaliers who filled the House of Commons zealous as they were for the prerogative still remembered with bitterness the tyranny of the High Commission and were by no means disposed to revive an institution so odious They at the same time thought and not without reason that the statute which had swept away all the courts Christian of the realm without providing any substitute was open to grave objection They accordingly repealed that statute with the exception of the part which related to the High Commission Thus the Archidiaconal Courts the Consistory Courts the Court of Arches the Court of Peculiars and the Court of Delegates were revived but the enactment by which Elizabeth and her successors had been empowered to appoint Commissioners with visitatorial authority over the Church was not only not revived but was declared with the utmost strength of language to be completely abrogated It is therefore as clear as any point of constitutional law can be that James the Second was not competent to appoint a Commission with power to visit and govern the Church of England ninety four But if this were so it was to little purpose that the Act of Supremacy in high sounding words empowered him to amend what was amiss in that Church Nothing but a machinery as stringent as that which the Long Parliament had destroyed could force the Anglican clergy to become his agents for the destruction of the Anglican doctrine and discipline He therefore as early as the month of April sixteen eighty six determined to create a new Court of High Commission This design was not immediately executed It encountered the opposition of every minister who was not devoted to France and to the Jesuits It was regarded by lawyers as an outrageous violation of the law and by Churchmen as a direct attack upon the Church Perhaps the contest might have lasted longer but for an event which wounded the pride and inflamed the rage of the King He had as supreme ordinary put forth directions charging the clergy of the establishment to abstain from touching in their discourses on controverted points of doctrine Thus while sermons in defence of the Roman Catholic religion were preached on every Sunday and holiday within the precincts of the royal palaces the Church of the state the Church of the great majority of the nation was forbidden to explain and vindicate her own principles The spirit of the whole clerical order rose against this injustice William Sherlock a divine of distinguished abilities who had written with sharpness against Whigs and Dissenters and had been rewarded by the government with the Mastership of the Temple and with a pension was one of the first who incurred the royal displeasure His pension was stopped and he was severely reprimanded ninety five John Sharp Dean of Norwich and Rector of saint Giles s in the Fields soon gave still greater offence He was a man of learning and fervent piety a preacher of great fame and an exemplary parish priest In politics he was like most of his brethren a Tory and had just been appointed one of the royal chaplains He received an anonymous letter which purported to come from one of his parishioners who had been staggered by the arguments of Roman Catholic theologians and who was anxious to be satisfied that the Church of England was a branch of the true Church of Christ No divine not utterly lost to all sense of religious duty and of professional honour could refuse to answer such a call On the following Sunday Sharp delivered an animated discourse against the high pretensions of the see of Rome Some of his expressions were exaggerated distorted and carried by talebearers to Whitehall It was falsely said that he had spoken with contumely of the theological disquisitions which had been found in the strong box of the late King and which the present King had published Compton the Bishop of London received orders from Sunderland to suspend Sharp till the royal pleasure should be further known The Bishop was in great perplexity His recent conduct in the House of Lords had given deep offence to the court Already his name had been struck out of the list of Privy Councillors Already he had been dismissed from his office in the royal chapel He was unwilling to give fresh provocation but the act which he was directed to perform was a judicial act He felt that it was unjust and he was assured by the best advisers that it was also illegal to inflict punishment without giving any opportunity for defence He accordingly in the humblest terms represented his difficulties to the King and privately requested Sharp not to appear in the pulpit for the present Reasonable as were Compton s scruples obsequious as were his apologies James was greatly incensed What insolence to plead either natural justice or positive law in opposition to an express command of the Sovereign Sharp was forgotten The Bishop became a mark for the whole vengeance of the government ninety six The King felt more painfully than ever the want of that tremendous engine which had once coerced refractory ecclesiastics He probably knew that for a few angry words uttered against his father s government Bishop Williams had been suspended by the High Commission from all ecclesiastical dignities and functions The design of reviving that formidable tribunal was pushed on more eagerly than ever In July London was alarmed by the news that the King had in direct defiance of two acts of Parliament drawn in the strongest terms entrusted the whole government of the Church to seven Commissioners ninety seven The words in which the jurisdiction of these officers was described were loose and might be stretched to almost any extent All colleges and grammar schools even those founded by the liberality of private benefactors were placed under the authority of the new board All who depended for bread on situations in the Church or in academical institutions from the Primate down to the youngest curate from the Vicechancellors of Oxford and Cambridge down to the humblest pedagogue who taught Corderius were at the royal mercy If any one of those many thousands was suspected of doing or saying anything distasteful to the government the Commissioners might cite him before them In their mode of dealing with him they were fettered by no rules They were themselves at once prosecutors and judges The accused party was furnished with no copy of the charge He was examined and crossexamined If his answers did not give satisfaction he was liable to be suspended from his office to be ejected from it to be pronounced incapable of holding any preferment in future If he were contumacious he might be excommunicated or in other words be deprived of all civil rights and imprisoned for life He might also at the discretion of the court be loaded with all the costs of the proceeding by which he had been reduced to beggary No appeal was given The Commissioners were directed to execute their office notwithstanding any law which might be or might seem to be inconsistent with these regulations Lastly lest any person should doubt that it was intended to revive that terrible court from which the Long Parliament had freed the nation the new tribunal was directed to use a seal bearing exactly the same device and the same superscription with the seal of the old High Commission ninety eight The chief Commissioner was the Chancellor His presence and assent were necessary to every proceeding All men knew how unjustly insolently and barbarously he had acted in courts where he had been to a certain extent restrained by the known laws of England It was therefore not difficult to foresee how he would conduct himself in a situation in which he was at entire liberty to make forms of procedure and rules of evidence for himself Of the other six Commissioners three were prelates and three laymen The name of Archbishop Sancroft stood first But he was fully convinced that the court was illegal that all its judgments would be null and that by sitting in it he should incur a serious responsibility He therefore determined not to comply with the royal mandate He did not however act on this occasion with that courage and sincerity which he showed when driven to extremity two years later He begged to be excused on the plea of business and ill health The other members of the board he added were men of too much ability to need his assistance These disingenuous apologies ill became the Primate of all England at such a crisis nor did they avert the royal displeasure Sancroft s name was not indeed struck out of the list of Privy Councillors but to the bitter mortification of the friends of the Church he was no longer summoned on Council days If said the King he is too sick or too busy to go to the Commission it is a kindness to relieve him from attendance at Council ninety nine The government found no similar difficulty with Nathaniel Crewe Bishop of the great and opulent see of Durham a man nobly born and raised so high in his profession that he could scarcely wish to rise higher but mean vain and cowardly He had been made Dean of the Chapel Royal when the Bishop of London was banished from the palace The honour of being an Ecclesiastical Commissioner turned Crewe s head It was to no purpose that some of his friends represented to him the risk which he ran by sitting in an illegal tribunal He was not ashamed to answer that he could not live out of the royal smile and exultingly expressed his hope that his name would appear in history a hope which has not been altogether disappointed one hundred Thomas Sprat Bishop of Rochester was the third clerical Commissioner He was a man to whose talents posterity has scarcely done justice Unhappily for his fame it has been usual to print his verses in collections of the British poets and those who judge of him by his verses must consider him as a servile imitator who without one spark of Cowley s admirable genius mimicked whatever was least commendable in Cowley s manner but those who are acquainted with Sprat s prose writings will form a very different estimate of his powers He was indeed a great master of our language and possessed at once the eloquence of the orator of the controversialist and of the historian His moral character might have passed with little censure had he belonged to a less sacred profession for the worst that can be said of him is that he was indolent luxurious and worldly but such failings though not commonly regarded as very heinous in men of secular callings are scandalous in a prelate The Archbishopric of York was vacant Sprat hoped to obtain it and therefore accepted a seat at the ecclesiastical board but he was too goodnatured a man to behave harshly and he was too sensible a man not to know that he might at some future time be called to a serious account by a Parliament He therefore though he consented to act tried to do as little mischief and to make as few enemies as possible one hundred one The three remaining Commissioners were the Lord Treasurer the Lord President and the Chief Justice of the King s Bench Rochester disapproving and murmuring consented to serve Much as he had to endure at the court he could not bear to quit it Much as he loved the Church he could not bring himself to sacrifice for her sake his white staff his patronage his salary of eight thousand pounds a year and the far larger indirect emoluments of his office He excused his conduct to others and perhaps to himself by pleading that as a Commissioner he might be able to prevent much evil and that if he refused to act some person less attached to the Protestant religion would be found to replace him Sunderland was the representative of the Jesuitical cabal Herbert s recent decision on the question of the dispensing power seemed to prove that he would not flinch from any service which the King might require As soon as the Commission had been opened the Bishop of London was cited before the new tribunal He appeared I demand of you said Jeffreys a direct and positive answer Why did not you suspend doctor Sharp The Bishop requested a copy of the Commission in order that he might know by what authority he was thus interrogated If you mean said Jeffreys to dispute our authority I shall take another course with you As to the Commission I do not doubt that you have seen it At all events you may see it in any coffeehouse for a penny The insolence of the Chancellor s reply appears to have shocked the other Commissioners and he was forced to make some awkward apologies He then returned to the point from which he had started This he said is not a court in which written charges are exhibited Our proceedings are summary and by word of mouth The question is a plain one Why did you not obey the King With some difficulty Compton obtained a brief delay and the assistance of counsel When the case had been heard it was evident to all men that the Bishop had done only what he was bound to do The Treasurer the Chief Justice and Sprat were for acquittal The King s wrath was moved It seemed that his Ecclesiastical Commission would fail him as his Tory Parliament had failed him He offered Rochester a simple choice to pronounce the Bishop guilty or to quit the Treasury Rochester was base enough to yield Compton was suspended from all spiritual functions and the charge of his great diocese was committed to his judges Sprat and Crewe He continued however to reside in his palace and to receive his revenues for it was known that had any attempt been made to deprive him of his temporalities he would have put himself under the protection of the common law and Herbert himself declared that at common law judgment must be given against the crown This consideration induced the King to pause Only a few weeks had elapsed since he had packed the courts of Westminster Hall in order to obtain a decision in favour of his dispensing power He now found that unless he packed them again he should not be able to obtain a decision in favour of the proceedings of his Ecclesiastical Commission He determined therefore to postpone for a short time the confiscation of the freehold property of refractory clergymen one hundred two The temper of the nation was indeed such as might well make him hesitate During some months discontent had been steadily and rapidly increasing The celebration of the Roman Catholic worship had long been prohibited by Act of Parliament During several generations no Roman Catholic clergyman had dared to exhibit himself in any public place with the badges of his office Against the regular clergy and against the restless and subtle Jesuits by name had been enacted a succession of rigorous statutes Every Jesuit who set foot in this country was liable to be hanged drawn and quartered A reward was offered for his detection He was not allowed to take advantage of the general rule that men are not bound to accuse themselves Whoever was suspected of being a Jesuit might be interrogated and if he refused to answer might be sent to prison for life one hundred three These laws though they had not except when there was supposed to be some peculiar danger been strictly executed and though they had never prevented Jesuits from resorting to England had made disguise necessary But all disguise was now thrown off Injudicious members of the King s Church encouraged by him took a pride in defying statutes which were still of undoubted validity and feelings which had a stronger hold of the national mind than at any former period Roman Catholic chapels rose all over the country Cowls girdles of ropes and strings of beads constantly appeared in the streets and astonished a population the oldest of whom had never seen a conventual garb except on the stage A convent rose at Clerkenwell on the site of the ancient cloister of Saint John The Franciscans occupied a mansion in Lincoln s Inn Fields The Carmelites were quartered in the City A society of Benedictine monks was lodged in Saint James s Palace In the Savoy a spacious house including a church and a school was built for the Jesuits one hundred four The skill and care with which those fathers had during several generations conducted the education of youth had drawn forth reluctant praises from the wisest Protestants Bacon had pronounced the mode of instruction followed in the Jesuit colleges to be the best yet known in the world and had warmly expressed his regret that so admirable a system of intellectual and moral discipline should be subservient to the interests of a corrupt religion one hundred five It was not improbable that the new academy in the Savoy might under royal patronage prove a formidable rival to the great foundations of Eton Westminster and Winchester Indeed soon after the school was opened the classes consisted of four hundred boys about one half of whom were Protestants The Protestant pupils were not required to attend mass but there could be no doubt that the influence of able preceptors devoted to the Roman Catholic Church and versed in all the arts which win the confidence and affection of youth would make many converts These things produced great excitement among the populace which is always more moved by what impresses the senses than by what is addressed to the reason Thousands of rude and ignorant men to whom the dispensing power and the Ecclesiastical Commission were words without a meaning saw with dismay and indignation a Jesuit college rising on the banks of the Thames friars in hoods and gowns walking in the Strand and crowds of devotees pressing in at the doors of temples where homage was paid to graven images Riots broke out in several parts of the country At Coventry and Worcester the Roman Catholic worship was violently interrupted one hundred six At Bristol the rabble countenanced it was said by the magistrates exhibited a profane and indecent pageant in which the Virgin Mary was represented by a buffoon and in which a mock host was carried in procession The garrison was called out to disperse the mob The mob then and ever since one of the fiercest in the kingdom resisted Blows were exchanged and serious hurts inflicted one hundred seven The agitation was great in the capital and greater in the City properly so called than at Westminster For the people of Westminster had been accustomed to see among them the private chapels of Roman Catholic Ambassadors but the City had not within living memory been polluted by any idolatrous exhibition Now however the resident of the Elector Palatine encouraged by the King fitted up a chapel in Lime Street The heads of the corporation though men selected for office on account of their known Toryism protested against this proceeding which as they said the ablest gentlemen of the long robe regarded as illegal The Lord Mayor was ordered to appear before the Privy Council Take heed what you do said the King Obey me and do not trouble yourself either about gentlemen of the long robe or gentlemen of the short robe The Chancellor took up the word and reprimanded the unfortunate magistrate with the genuine eloquence of the Old Bailey bar The chapel was opened All the neighbourhood was soon in commotion Great crowds assembled in Cheapside to attack the new mass house The priests were insulted A crucifix was taken out of the building and set up on the parish pump The Lord Mayor came to quell the tumult but was received with cries of No wooden gods The trainbands were ordered to disperse the crowd but they shared in the popular feeling and murmurs were heard from the ranks We cannot in conscience fight for Popery one hundred eight The Elector Palatine was like James a sincere and zealous Catholic and was like James the ruler of a Protestant people but the two princes resembled each other little in temper and understanding The Elector had promised to respect the rights of the Church which he found established in his dominions He had strictly kept his word and had not suffered himself to be provoked to any violence by the indiscretion of preachers who in their antipathy to his faith occasionally forgot the respect which they owed to his person one hundred nine He learned with concern that great offence had been given to the people of London by the injudicious act of his representative and much to his honour declared that he would forego the privilege to which as a sovereign prince he was entitled rather than endanger the peace of a great city I too he wrote to James have Protestant subjects and I know with how much caution and delicacy it is necessary that a Catholic prince so situated should act James instead of expressing gratitude for this humane and considerate conduct turned the letter into ridicule before the foreign ministers It was determined that the Elector should have a chapel in the City whether he would or not and that if the trainbands refused to do their duty their place should be supplied by the Guards one hundred ten The effect of these disturbances on trade was serious The Dutch minister informed the States General that the business of the Exchange was at a stand The Commissioners of the Customs reported to the King that during the month which followed the opening of Lime Street Chapel the receipt in the port of the Thames had fallen off by some thousands of pounds one hundred eleven Several Aldermen who though zealous royalists appointed under the new charter were deeply interested in the commercial prosperity of their city and loved neither Popery nor martial law tendered their resignations But the King was resolved not to yield He formed a camp on Hounslow Heath and collected there within a circumference of about two miles and a half fourteen battalions of foot and thirty two squadrons of horse amounting to thirteen thousand fighting men Twenty six pieces of artillery and many wains laden with arms and ammunition were dragged from the Tower through the City to Hounslow one hundred twelve The Londoners saw this great force assembled in their neighbourhood with a terror which familiarity soon diminished A visit to Hounslow became their favourite amusement on holidays The camp presented the appearance of a vast fair Mingled with the musketeers and dragoons a multitude of fine gentlemen and ladies from Soho Square sharpers and painted women from Whitefriars invalids in sedans monks in hoods and gowns lacqueys in rich liveries pedlars orange girls mischievous apprentices and gaping clowns was constantly passing and repassing through the long lanes of tents From some pavilions were heard the noises of drunken revelry from others the curses of gamblers In truth the place was merely a gay suburb of the capital The King as was amply proved two years later had greatly miscalculated He had forgotten that vicinity operates in more ways than one He had hoped that his army would overawe London but the result of his policy was that the feelings and opinions of London took complete possession of his army one hundred thirteen Scarcely indeed had the encampment been formed when there were rumours of quarrels between the Protestant and Popish soldiers one hundred fourteen A little tract entitled A humble and hearty Address to all English Protestants in the Army had been actively circulated through the ranks The writer vehemently exhorted the troops to use their arms in defence not of the mass book but of the Bible of the Great Charter and of the Petition of Right He was a man already under the frown of power His character was remarkable and his history not uninstructive His name was Samuel Johnson He was a priest of the Church of England and had been chaplain to Lord Russell Johnson was one of those persons who are mortally hated by their opponents and less loved than respected by their allies His morals were pure his religious feelings ardent his learning and abilities not contemptible his judgment weak his temper acrimonious turbulent and unconquerably stubborn His profession made him peculiarly odious to the zealous supporters of monarchy for a republican in holy orders was a strange and almost an unnatural being During the late reign Johnson had published a book entitled Julian the Apostate The object of this work was to show that the Christians of the fourth century did not hold the doctrine of nonresistance It was easy to produce passages from Chrysostom and Jerome written in a spirit very different from that of the Anglican divines who preached against the Exclusion Bill Johnson however went further He attempted to revive the odious imputation which had for very obvious reasons been thrown by Libanius on the Christian soldiers of Julian and insinuated that the dart which slew the imperial renegade came not from the enemy but from some Rumbold or Ferguson in the Roman ranks A hot controversy followed Whig and Tory disputants wrangled fiercely about an obscure passage in which Gregory of Nazianzus praises a pious Bishop who was going to bastinado somebody The Whigs maintained that the holy man was going to bastinado the Emperor the Tories that at the worst he was only going to bastinado a captain of the guard Johnson prepared a reply to his assailants in which he drew an elaborate parallel between Julian and James then Duke of York Julian had during many years pretended to abhor idolatry while in heart an idolater Julian had to serve a turn occasionally affected respect for the rights of conscience Julian had punished cities which were zealous for the true religion by taking away their municipal privileges Julian had by his flatterers been called the Just James was provoked beyond endurance Johnson was prosecuted for a libel convicted and condemned to a fine which he had no means of paying He was therefore kept in gaol and it seemed likely that his confinement would end only with his life one hundred fifteen Over the room which he occupied in the King s Bench prison lodged another offender whose character well deserves to be studied This was Hugh Speke a young man of good family but of a singularly base and depraved nature His love of mischief and of dark and crooked ways amounted almost to madness To cause confusion without being found out was his business and his pastime and he had a rare skill in using honest enthusiasts as the instruments of his coldblooded malice He had attempted by means of one of his puppets to fasten on Charles and James the crime of murdering Essex in the Tower On this occasion the agency of Speke had been traced and though he succeeded in throwing the greater part of the blame on his dupe he had not escaped with impunity He was now a prisoner but his fortune enabled him to live with comfort and he was under so little restraint that he was able to keep up regular communication with one of his confederates who managed a secret press Johnson was the very man for Speke s purposes zealous and intrepid a scholar and a practised controversialist yet as simple as a child A close intimacy sprang up between the two fellow prisoners Johnson wrote a succession of bitter and vehement treatises which Speke conveyed to the printer When the camp was formed at Hounslow Speke urged Johnson to compose an address which might excite the troops to mutiny The paper was instantly drawn up Many thousands of copies were struck off and brought to Speke s room whence they were distributed over the whole country and especially among the soldiers A milder government than that which then ruled England would have been moved to high resentment by such a provocation Strict search was made A subordinate agent who had been employed to circulate the address saved himself by giving up Johnson and Johnson was not the man to save himself by giving up Speke An information was filed and a conviction obtained without difficulty Julian Johnson as he was popularly called was sentenced to stand thrice in the pillory and to be whipped from Newgate to Tyburn The Judge Sir Francis Withins told the criminal to be thankful for the great lenity of the Attorney General who might have treated the case as one of high treason I owe him no thanks answered Johnson dauntlessly Am I whose only crime is that I have defended the Church and the laws to be grateful for being scourged like a dog while Popish scribblers are suffered daily to insult the Church and to violate the laws with impunity The energy with which he spoke was such that both the Judges and the crown lawyers thought it necessary to vindicate themselves and protested that they knew of no Popish publications such as those to which the prisoner alluded He instantly drew from his pocket some Roman Catholic books and trinkets which were then freely exposed for sale under the royal patronage read aloud the titles of the books and threw a rosary across the table to the King s counsel And now he cried with a loud voice I lay this information before God before this court and before the English people We shall soon see whether mister Attorney will do his duty It was resolved that before the punishment was inflicted Johnson should be degraded from the priesthood The prelates who had been charged by the Ecclesiastical Commission with the care of the diocese of London cited him before them in the chapter house of Saint Paul s Cathedral The manner in which he went through the ceremony made a deep impression on many minds When he was stripped of his sacred robe he exclaimed You are taking away my gown because I have tried to keep your gowns on your backs The only part of the formalities which seemed to distress him was the plucking of the Bible out of his hand He made a faint struggle to retain the sacred book kissed it and burst into tears You cannot he said deprive me of the hopes which I owe to it Some attempts were made to obtain a remission of the flogging A Roman Catholic priest offered to intercede in consideration of a bribe of two hundred pounds The money was raised and the priest did his best but in vain mister Johnson said the King has the spirit of a martyr and it is fit that he should be one William the Third said a few years later of one of the most acrimonious and intrepid Jacobites He has set his heart on being a martyr and I have set mine on disappointing him These two speeches would alone suffice to explain the widely different fates of the two princes The day appointed for the flogging came A whip of nine lashes was used Three hundred and seventeen stripes were inflicted but the sufferer never winced He afterwards said that the pain was cruel but that as he was dragged at the tail of the cart he remembered how patiently the cross had been borne up Mount Calvary and was so much supported by the thought that but for the fear of incurring the suspicion of vain glory he would have sung a psalm with as firm and cheerful a voice as if he had been worshipping God in the congregation It is impossible not to wish that so much heroism had been less alloyed by intemperance and intolerance one hundred sixteen Among the clergy of the Church of England Johnson found no sympathy He had attempted to justify rebellion he had even hinted approbation of regicide and they still in spite of much provocation clung to the doctrine of nonresistance But they saw with alarm and concern the progress of what they considered as a noxious superstition and while they abjured all thought of defending their religion by the sword betook themselves manfully to weapons of a different kind To preach against the errors of Popery was now regarded by them as a point of duty and a point of honour The London clergy who were then in abilities and influence decidedly at the head of their profession set an example which was bravely followed by their ruder brethren all over the country Had only a few bold men taken this freedom they would probably have been at once cited before the Ecclesiastical Commission but it was hardly possible to punish an offence which was committed every Sunday by thousands of divines from Berwick to Penzance The presses of the capital of Oxford and of Cambridge never rested The act which subjected literature to a censorship did not seriously impede the exertions of Protestant controversialists for it contained a proviso in favour of the two Universities and authorised the publication of theological works licensed by the Archbishop of Canterbury It was therefore out of the power of the government to silence the defenders of the established religion They were a numerous an intrepid and a well appointed band of combatants Among them were eloquent declaimers expert dialecticians scholars deeply read in the writings of the fathers and in all parts of ecclesiastical history Some of them at a later period turned against one another the formidable arms which they had wielded against the common enemy and by their fierce contentions and insolent triumphs brought reproach on the Church which they had saved But at present they formed an united phalanx In the van appeared a rank of steady and skilful veterans Tillotson Stillingfleet Sherlock Prideaux Whitby Patrick Tenison Wake The rear was brought up by the most distinguished bachelors of arts who were studying for deacon s orders Conspicuous amongst the recruits whom Cambridge sent to the field was a distinguished pupil of the great Newton Henry Wharton who had a few months before been senior wrangler of his year and whose early death was soon after deplored by men of all parties as an irreparable loss to letters one hundred seventeen Oxford was not less proud of a youth whose great powers first essayed in this conflict afterwards troubled the Church and the State during forty eventful years Francis Atterbury By such men as these every question in issue between the Papists and the Protestants was debated sometimes in a popular style which boys and women could comprehend sometimes with the utmost subtlety of logic and sometimes with an immense display of learning The pretensions of the Holy See the authority of tradition purgatory transubstantiation the sacrifice of the mass the adoration of the host the denial of the cup to the laity confession penance indulgences extreme unction the invocation of saints the adoration of images the celibacy of the clergy the monastic vows the practice of celebrating public worship in a tongue unknown to the multitude the corruptions of the court of Rome the history of the Reformation the characters of the chief reformers were copiously discussed Great numbers of absurd legends about miracles wrought by saints and relics were translated from the Italian and published as specimens of the priestcraft by which the greater part of Christendom had been fooled Of the tracts put forth on these subjects by Anglican divines during the short reign of James the Second many have probably perished Those which may still be found in our great libraries make up a mass of near twenty thousand pages one hundred eighteen The Roman Catholics did not yield the victory without a struggle One of them named Henry Hills had been appointed printer to the royal household and chapel and had been placed by the King at the head of a great office in London from which theological tracts came forth by hundreds Obadiah Walker s press was not less active at Oxford But with the exception of some bad translations of Bossuet s admirable works these establishments put forth nothing of the smallest value It was indeed impossible for any intelligent and candid Roman Catholic to deny that the champions of his Church were in every talent and acquirement completely over matched The ablest of them would not on the other side have been considered as of the third rate Many of them even when they had something to say knew not how to say it They had been excluded by their religion from English schools and universities nor had they ever till the accession of James found England an agreeable or even a safe residence They had therefore passed the greater part of their lives on the Continent and had almost unlearned their mother tongue When they preached their outlandish accent moved the derision of the audience They spelt like washerwomen Their diction was disfigured by foreign idioms and when they meant to be eloquent they imitated as well as they could what was considered as fine writing in those Italian academies where rhetoric had then reached the last stage of corruption Disputants labouring under these disadvantages would scarcely even with truth on their side have been able to make head against men whose style is eminently distinguished by simple purity and grace one hundred nineteen The situation of England in the year sixteen eighty six cannot be better described than in the words of the French Ambassador The discontent he wrote is great and general but the fear of incurring still worse evils restrains all who have anything to lose The King openly expresses his joy at finding himself in a situation to strike bold strokes He likes to be complimented on this subject He has talked to me about it and has assured me that he will not flinch one hundred twenty Meanwhile in other parts of the empire events of grave importance had taken place The situation of the episcopalian Protestants of Scotland differed widely from that in which their English brethren stood In the south of the island the religion of the state was the religion of the people and had a strength altogether independent of the strength derived from the support of the government The sincere conformists were far more numerous than the Papists and the Protestant Dissenters taken together The Established Church of Scotland was the Church of a small minority The majority of the lowland population was firmly attached to the Presbyterian discipline Prelacy was abhorred by the great body of Scottish Protestants both as an unscriptural and as a foreign institution It was regarded by the disciples of Knox as a relic of the abominations of Babylon the Great It painfully reminded a people proud of the memory of Wallace and Bruce that Scotland since her sovereigns had succeeded to a fairer inheritance had been independent in name only The episcopal polity was also closely associated in the public mind with all the evils produced by twenty five years of corrupt and cruel maladministration Nevertheless this polity stood though on a narrow basis and amidst fearful storms tottering indeed yet upheld by the civil magistrate and leaning for support whenever danger became serious on the power of England The records of the Scottish Parliament were thick set with laws denouncing vengeance on those who in any direction strayed from the prescribed pale By an Act passed in the time of Knox and breathing his spirit it was a high crime to hear mass and the third offence was capital one hundred twenty one An Act recently passed at the instance of James made it death to preach in any Presbyterian conventicle whatever and even to attend such a conventicle in the open air one hundred twenty two The Eucharist was not as in England degraded into a civil test but no person could hold any office could sit in Parliament or could even vote for a member of Parliament without subscribing under the sanction of an oath a declaration which condemned in the strongest terms the principles both of the Papists and of the Covenanters one hundred twenty three In the Privy Council of Scotland there were two parties corresponding to the two parties which were contending against each other at Whitehall William Douglas Duke of Queensberry was Lord Treasurer and had during some years been considered as first minister He was nearly connected by affinity by similarity of opinions and by similarity of temper with the Treasurer of England Both were Tories both were men of hot temper and strong prejudices both were ready to support their master in any attack on the civil liberties of his people but both were sincerely attached to the Established Church Queensberry had early notified to the court that if any innovation affecting that Church were contemplated to such innovation he could be no party But among his colleagues were several men not less unprincipled than Sunderland In truth the Council chamber at Edinburgh had been during a quarter of a century a seminary of all public and private vices and some of the politicians whose character had been formed there had a peculiar hardness of heart and forehead to which Westminster even in that bad age could hardly show anything quite equal The Chancellor James Drummond Earl of Perth and his brother the Secretary of State John Lord Melfort were bent on supplanting Queensberry The Chancellor had already an unquestionable title to the royal favour He had brought into use a little steel thumbscrew which gave such exquisite torment that it had wrung confessions even out of men on whom His Majesty s favourite boot had been tried in vain one hundred twenty four But it was well known that even barbarity was not so sure a way to the heart of James as apostasy To apostasy therefore Perth and Melfort resorted with a certain audacious baseness which no English statesman could hope to emulate They declared that the papers found in the strong box of Charles the Second had converted them both to the true faith and they began to confess and to hear mass one hundred twenty five How little conscience had to do with Perth s change of religion he amply proved by taking to wife a few weeks later in direct defiance of the laws of the Church which he had just joined a lady who was his cousin german without waiting for a dispensation When the good Pope learned this he said with scorn and indignation which well became him that this was a strange sort of conversion one hundred twenty six But James was more easily satisfied The apostates presented themselves at Whitehall and there received such assurances of his favour that they ventured to bring direct charges against the Treasurer Those charges however were so evidently frivolous that James was forced to acquit the accused minister and many thought that the Chancellor had ruined himself by his malignant eagerness to ruin his rival There were a few however who judged more correctly Halifax to whom Perth expressed some apprehensions answered with a sneer that there was no danger Be of good cheer my Lord thy faith hath made thee whole The prediction was correct Perth and Melfort went back to Edinburgh the real heads of the government of their country one hundred twenty seven Another member of the Scottish Privy Council Alexander Stuart Earl of Murray the descendant and heir of the Regent abjured the religion of which his illustrious ancestor had been the foremost champion and declared himself a member of the Church of Rome Devoted as Queensberry had always been to the cause of prerogative he could not stand his ground against competitors who were willing to pay such a price for the favour of the court He had to endure a succession of mortifications and humiliations similar to those which about the same time began to embitter the life of his friend Rochester Royal letters came down authorising Papists to hold offices without taking the test The clergy were strictly charged not to reflect on the Roman Catholic religion in their discourses The Chancellor took on himself to send the macers of the Privy Council round to the few printers and booksellers who could then be found in Edinburgh charging them not to publish any work without his license It was well understood that this order was intended to prevent the circulation of Protestant treatises One honest stationer told the messengers that he had in his shop a book which reflected in very coarse terms on Popery and begged to know whether he might sell it They asked to see it and he showed them a copy of the Bible one hundred twenty eight A cargo of images beads crosses and censers arrived at Leith directed to Lord Perth The importation of such articles had long been considered as illegal but now the officers of the customs allowed the superstitious garments and trinkets to pass one hundred twenty nine In a short time it was known that a Popish chapel had been fitted up in the Chancellor s house and that mass was regularly said there The mob rose The mansion where the idolatrous rites were celebrated was fiercely attacked The iron bars which protected the windows were wrenched off Lady Perth and some of her female friends were pelted with mud One rioter was seized and ordered by the Privy Council to be whipped His fellows rescued him and beat the hangman The city was all night in confusion The students of the University mingled with the crowd and animated the tumult Zealous burghers drank the health of the college lads and confusion to Papists and encouraged each other to face the troops The troops were already under arms They were received with a shower of stones which wounded an officer Orders were given to fire and several citizens were killed The disturbance was serious but the Drummonds inflamed by resentment and ambition exaggerated it strangely Queensberry observed that their reports would lead any person who had not been a witness of the tumult to believe that a sedition as formidable as that of Masaniello had been raging at Edinburgh They in return accused the Treasurer not only of extenuating the crime of the insurgents but of having himself prompted it and did all in their power to obtain evidence of his guilt One of the ringleaders who had been taken was offered a pardon if he would own that Queensberry had set him on but the same religious enthusiasm which had impelled the unhappy prisoner to criminal violence prevented him from purchasing his life by a calumny He and several of his accomplices were hanged A soldier who was accused of exclaiming during the affray that he should like to run his sword through a Papist was shot and Edinburgh was again quiet but the sufferers were regarded as martyrs and the Popish Chancellor became an object of mortal hatred which in no long time was largely gratified one hundred thirty The King was much incensed The news of the tumult reached him when the Queen assisted by the Jesuits had just triumphed over Lady Dorchester and her Protestant allies The malecontents should find he declared that the only effect of the resistance offered to his will was to make him more and more resolute one hundred thirty one He sent orders to the Scottish Council to punish the guilty with the utmost severity and to make unsparing use of the boot one hundred thirty two He pretended to be fully convinced of the Treasurer s innocence and wrote to that minister in gracious words but the gracious words were accompanied by ungracious acts The Scottish Treasury was put into commission in spite of the earnest remonstrances of Rochester who probably saw his own fate prefigured in that of his kinsman one hundred thirty three Queensberry was indeed named First Commissioner and was made President of the Privy Council but his fall though thus broken was still a fall He was also removed from the government of the castle of Edinburgh and was succeeded in that confidential post by the Duke of Gordon a Roman Catholic one hundred thirty four And now a letter arrived from London fully explaining to the Scottish Privy Council the intentions of the King What he wanted was that the Roman Catholics should be exempted from all laws imposing penalties and disabilities on account of nonconformity but that the persecution of the Covenanters should go on without mitigation one hundred thirty five This scheme encountered strenuous opposition in the Council Some members were unwilling to see the existing laws relaxed Others who were by no means averse to some relaxation yet felt that it would be monstrous to admit Roman Catholics to the highest honours of the state and yet to leave unrepealed the Act which made it death to attend a Presbyterian conventicle The answer of the board was therefore less obsequious than usual The King in reply sharply reprimanded his undutiful Councillors and ordered three of them the Duke of Hamilton Sir George Lockhart and General Drummond to attend him at Westminster Hamilton s abilities and knowledge though by no means such as would have sufficed to raise an obscure man to eminence appeared highly respectable in one who was premier peer of Scotland Lockhart had long been regarded as one of the first jurists logicians and orators that his country had produced and enjoyed also that sort of consideration which is derived from large possessions for his estate was such as at that time very few Scottish nobles possessed one hundred thirty six He had been lately appointed President of the Court of Session Drummond a younger brother of Perth and Melfort was commander of the forces in Scotland He was a loose and profane man but a sense of honour which his two kinsmen wanted restrained him from a public apostasy He lived and died in the significant phrase of one of his countrymen a bad Christian but a good Protestant one hundred thirty seven James was pleased by the dutiful language which the three Councillors used when first they appeared before him He spoke highly of them to Barillon and particularly extolled Lockhart as the ablest and most eloquent Scotchman living They soon proved however less tractable than had been expected and it was rumoured at court that they had been perverted by the company which they had kept in London Hamilton lived much with zealous churchmen and it might be feared that Lockhart who was related to the Wharton family had fallen into still worse society In truth it was natural that statesmen fresh from a country where opposition in any other form than that of insurrection and assassination had long been almost unknown and where all that was not lawless fury was abject submission should have been struck by the earnest and stubborn yet sober discontent which pervaded England and should have been emboldened to try the experiment of constitutional resistance to the royal will They indeed declared themselves willing to grant large relief to the Roman Catholics but on two conditions first that similar indulgence should be extended to the Calvinistic sectaries and secondly that the King should bind himself by a solemn promise not to attempt anything to the prejudice of the Protestant religion Both conditions were highly distasteful to James He reluctantly agreed however after a dispute which lasted several days that some indulgence should be granted to the Presbyterians but he would by no means consent to allow them the full liberty which he demanded for members of his own communion one hundred thirty eight To the second condition proposed by the three Scottish Councillors he positively refused to listen The Protestant religion he said was false and he would not give any guarantee that he would not use his power to the prejudice of a false religion The altercation was long and was not brought to a conclusion satisfactory to either party one hundred thirty nine The time fixed for the meeting of the Scottish Estates drew near and it was necessary that the three Councillors should leave London to attend their parliamentary duty at Edinburgh On this occasion another affront was offered to Queensberry In the late session he had held the office of Lord High Commissioner and had in that capacity represented the majesty of the absent King This dignity the greatest to which a Scottish noble could aspire was now transferred to the renegade Murray On the twenty ninth of April the Parliament met at Edinburgh A letter from the King was read He exhorted the Estates to give relief to his Roman Catholic subjects and offered in return a free trade with England and an amnesty for political offences A committee was appointed to draw up an answer That committee though named by Murray and composed of Privy Councillors and courtiers framed a reply full indeed of dutiful and respectful expressions yet clearly indicating a determination to refuse what the King demanded The Estates it was said would go as far as their consciences would allow to meet His Majesty s wishes respecting his subjects of the Roman Catholic religion These expressions were far from satisfying the Chancellor yet such as they were he was forced to content himself with them and even had some difficulty in persuading the Parliament to adopt them Objection was taken by some zealous Protestants to the mention made of the Roman Catholic religion There was no such religion There was an idolatrous apostasy which the laws punished with the halter and to which it did not become Christian men to give flattering titles To call such a superstition Catholic was to give up the whole question which was at issue between Rome and the reformed Churches The offer of a free trade with England was treated as an insult Our fathers said one orator sold their King for southern gold and we still lie under the reproach of that foul bargain Let it not be said of us that we have sold our God Sir John Lauder of Fountainhall one of the Senators of the College of Justice suggested the words the persons commonly called Roman Catholics Would you nickname His Majesty exclaimed the Chancellor The answer drawn by the committee was carried but a large and respectable minority voted against the proposed words as too courtly one hundred forty It was remarked that the representatives of the towns were almost to a man against the government Hitherto those members had been of small account in the Parliament and had generally been considered as the retainers of powerful noblemen They now showed for the first time an independence a resolution and a spirit of combination which alarmed the court one hundred forty one The answer was so unpleasing to James that he did not suffer it to be printed in the Gazette Soon he learned that a law such as he wished to see passed would not even be brought in The Lords of Articles whose business was to draw up the acts on which the Estates were afterwards to deliberate were virtually nominated by himself Yet even the Lords of Articles proved refractory When they met the three Privy Councillors who had lately returned from London took the lead in opposition to the royal will Hamilton declared plainly that he could not do what was asked He was a faithful and loyal subject but there was a limit imposed by conscience Conscience said the Chancellor conscience is a vague word which signifies any thing or nothing Lockhart who sate in Parliament as representative of the great county of Lanark struck in If conscience he said be a word without meaning we will change it for another phrase which I hope means something For conscience let us put the fundamental laws of Scotland These words raised a fierce debate General Drummond who represented Perthshire declared that he agreed with Hamilton and Lockhart Most of the Bishops present took the same side one hundred forty two It was plain that even in the Committee of Articles James could not command a majority He was mortified and irritated by the tidings He held warm and menacing language and punished some of his mutinous servants in the hope that the rest would take warning Several persons were dismissed from the Council board Several were deprived of pensions which formed an important part of their income Sir George Mackenzie of Rosehaugh was the most distinguished victim He had long held the office of Lord Advocate and had taken such a part in the persecution of the Covenanters that to this day he holds in the estimation of the austere and godly peasantry of Scotland a place not far removed from the unenviable eminence occupied by Claverhouse The legal attainments of Mackenzie were not of the highest order but as a scholar a wit and an orator he stood high in the opinion of his countrymen and his renown had spread even to the coffeehouses of London and the cloisters of Oxford The remains of his forensic speeches prove him to have been a man of parts but are somewhat disfigured by what he doubtless considered as Ciceronian graces interjections which show more art than passion and elaborate amplifications in which epithet rises above epithet in wearisome climax He had now for the first time been found scrupulous He was therefore in spite of all his claims on the gratitude of the government deprived of his office He retired into the country and soon after went up to London for the purpose of clearing himself but was refused admission to the royal presence one hundred forty three While the King was thus trying to terrify the Lords of Articles into submission the popular voice encouraged them to persist The utmost exertions of the Chancellor could not prevent the national sentiment from expressing itself through the pulpit and the press One tract written with such boldness and acrimony that no printer dared to put it in type was widely circulated in manuscript The papers which appeared on the other side of the question had much less effect though they were disseminated at the public charge and though the Scottish defenders of the government were assisted by an English auxiliary of great note Lestrange who had been sent down to Edinburgh and had apartments in Holyrood House one hundred forty four At length after three weeks of debate the Lords of Articles came to a decision They proposed merely that Roman Catholics should be permitted to worship God in private houses without incurring any penalty and it soon appeared that far as this measure was from coming up to the King s demands and expectations the Estates either would not pass it at all or would pass it with great restrictions and modifications While the contest lasted the anxiety in London was intense Every report every line from Edinburgh was eagerly devoured One day the story ran that Hamilton had given way and that the government would carry every point Then came intelligence that the opposition had rallied and was more obstinate than ever At the most critical moment orders were sent to the post office that the bags from Scotland should be transmitted to Whitehall During a whole week not a single private letter from beyond the Tweed was delivered in London In our age such an interruption of communication would throw the whole island into confusion but there was then so little trade and correspondence between England and Scotland that the inconvenience was probably much smaller than has been often occasioned in our own time by a short delay in the arrival of the Indian mail While the ordinary channels of information were thus closed the crowd in the galleries of Whitehall observed with attention the countenances of the King and his ministers It was noticed with great satisfaction that after every express from the North the enemies of the Protestant religion looked more and more gloomy At length to the general joy it was announced that the struggle was over that the government had been unable to carry its measures and that the Lord High Commissioner had adjourned the Parliament one hundred forty five If James had not been proof to all warning these events would have sufficed to warn him A few months before this time the most obsequious of English Parliaments had refused to submit to his pleasure But the most obsequious of English Parliaments might be regarded as an independent and high spirited assembly when compared with any Parliament that had ever sate in Scotland and the servile spirit of Scottish Parliaments was always to be found in the highest perfection extracted and condensed among the Lords of Articles Yet even the Lords of Articles had been refractory It was plain that all those classes all those institutions which up to this year had been considered as the strongest supports of monarchical power must if the King persisted in his insane policy be reckoned as parts of the strength of the opposition All these signs however were lost upon him To every expostulation he had one answer he would never give way for concession had ruined his father and his unconquerable firmness was loudly applauded by the French embassy and by the Jesuitical cabal He now proclaimed that he had been only too gracious when he had condescended to ask the assent of the Scottish Estates to his wishes His prerogative would enable him not only to protect those whom he favoured but to punish those who had crossed him He was confident that in Scotland his dispensing power would not be questioned by any court of law There was a Scottish Act of Supremacy which gave to the sovereign such a control over the Church as might have satisfied Henry the Eighth Accordingly Papists were admitted in crowds to offices and honours The Bishop of Dunkeld who as a Lord of Parliament had opposed the government was arbitrarily ejected from his see and a successor was appointed Queensberry was stripped of all his employments and was ordered to remain at Edinburgh till the accounts of the Treasury during his administration had been examined and approved one hundred forty six As the representatives of the towns had been found the most unmanageable part of the Parliament it was determined to make a revolution in every burgh throughout the kingdom A similar change had recently been effected in England by judicial sentences but in Scotland a simple mandate of the prince was thought sufficient All elections of magistrates and of town councils were prohibited and the King assumed to himself the right of filling up the chief municipal offices one hundred forty seven In a formal letter to the Privy Council he announced his intention to fit up a Roman Catholic chapel in his palace of Holyrood and he gave orders that the Judges should be directed to treat all the laws against Papists as null on pain of his high displeasure He however comforted the Protestant Episcopalians by assuring them that though he was determined to protect the Roman Catholic Church against them he was equally determined to protect them against any encroachment on the part of the fanatics To this communication Perth proposed an answer couched in the most servile terms The Council now contained many Papists the Protestant members who still had seats had been cowed by the King s obstinacy and severity and only a few faint murmurs were heard Hamilton threw out against the dispensing power some hints which he made haste to explain away Lockhart said that he would lose his head rather than sign such a letter as the Chancellor had drawn but took care to say this in a whisper which was heard only by friends Perth s words were adopted with inconsiderable modifications and the royal commands were obeyed but a sullen discontent spread through that minority of the Scottish nation by the aid of which the government had hitherto held the majority down one hundred forty eight When the historian of this troubled reign turns to Ireland his task becomes peculiarly difficult and delicate His steps to borrow the fine image used on a similar occasion by a Roman poet are on the thin crust of ashes beneath which the lava is still glowing The seventeenth century has in that unhappy country left to the nineteenth a fatal heritage of malignant passions No amnesty for the mutual wrongs inflicted by the Saxon defenders of Londonderry and by the Celtic defenders of Limerick has ever been granted from the heart by either race To this day a more than Spartan haughtiness alloys the many noble qualities which characterize the children of the victors while a Helot feeling compounded of awe and hatred is but too often discernible in the children of the vanquished Neither of the hostile castes can justly be absolved from blame but the chief blame is due to that shortsighted and headstrong prince who placed in a situation in which he might have reconciled them employed all his power to inflame their animosity and at length forced them to close in a grapple for life and death The grievances under which the members of his Church laboured in Ireland differed widely from those which he was attempting to remove in England and Scotland The Irish Statute Book afterwards polluted by intolerance as barbarous as that of the dark ages then contained scarce a single enactment and not a single stringent enactment imposing any penalty on Papists as such On our side of Saint George s Channel every priest who received a neophyte into the bosom of the Church of Rome was liable to be hanged drawn and quartered On the other side he incurred no such danger A Jesuit who landed at Dover took his life in his hand but he walked the streets of Dublin in security Here no man could hold office or even earn his livelihood as a barrister or a schoolmaster without previously taking the oath of supremacy but in Ireland a public functionary was not held to be under the necessity of taking that oath unless it were formally tendered to him one hundred forty nine It therefore did not exclude from employment any person whom the government wished to promote The sacramental test and the declaration against transubstantiation were unknown nor was either House of Parliament closed against any religious sect It might seem therefore that the Irish Roman Catholic was in a situation which his English and Scottish brethren in the faith might well envy In fact however his condition was more pitiable and irritating than theirs For though not persecuted as a Roman Catholic he was oppressed as an Irishman In his country the same line of demarcation which separated religions separated races and he was of the conquered the subjugated the degraded race On the same soil dwelt two populations locally intermixed morally and politically sundered The difference of religion was by no means the only difference and was perhaps not even the chief difference which existed between them They sprang from different stocks They spoke different languages They had different national characters as strongly opposed as any two national characters in Europe They were in widely different stages of civilisation Between two such populations there could be little sympathy and centuries of calamities and wrongs had generated a strong antipathy The relation in which the minority stood to the majority resembled the relation in which the followers of William the Conqueror stood to the Saxon churls or the relation in which the followers of Cortes stood to the Indians of Mexico The appellation of Irish was then given exclusively to the Celts and to those families which though not of Celtic origin had in the course of ages degenerated into Celtic manners These people probably somewhat under a million in number had with few exceptions adhered to the Church of Rome Among them resided about two hundred thousand colonists proud of their Saxon blood and of their Protestant faith one hundred fifty The great preponderance of numbers on one side was more than compensated by a great superiority of intelligence vigour and organization on the other The English settlers seem to have been in knowledge energy and perseverance rather above than below the average level of the population of the mother country The aboriginal peasantry on the contrary were in an almost savage state They never worked till they felt the sting of hunger They were content with accommodation inferior to that which in happier countries was provided for domestic cattle Already the potato a root which can be cultivated with scarcely any art industry or capital and which cannot be long stored had become the food of the common people one hundred fifty one From a people so fed diligence and forethought were not to be expected Even within a few miles of Dublin the traveller on a soil the richest and most verdant in the world saw with disgust the miserable burrows out of which squalid and half naked barbarians stared wildly at him as he passed one hundred fifty two The aboriginal aristocracy retained in no common measure the pride of birth but had lost the influence which is derived from wealth and power Their lands had been divided by Cromwell among his followers A portion indeed of the vast territory which he had confiscated had after the restoration of the House of Stuart been given back to the ancient proprietors But much the greater part was still held by English emigrants under the guarantee of an Act of Parliament This act had been in force a quarter of a century and under it mortgages settlements sales and leases without number had been made The old Irish gentry were scattered over the whole world Descendants of Milesian chieftains swarmed in all the courts and camps of the Continent Those despoiled proprietors who still remained in their native land brooded gloomily over their losses pined for the opulence and dignity of which they had been deprived and cherished wild hopes of another revolution A person of this class was described by his countrymen as a gentleman who would be rich if justice were done as a gentleman who had a fine estate if he could only get it one hundred fifty three He seldom betook himself to any peaceful calling Trade indeed he thought a far more disgraceful resource than marauding Sometimes he turned freebooter Sometimes he contrived in defiance of the law to live by coshering that is to say by quartering himself on the old tenants of his family who wretched as was their own condition could not refuse a portion of their pittance to one whom they still regarded as their rightful lord one hundred fifty four The native gentleman who had been so fortunate as to keep or to regain some of his land too often lived like the petty prince of a savage tribe and indemnified himself for the humiliations which the dominant race made him suffer by governing his vassals despotically by keeping a rude haram and by maddening or stupefying himself daily with strong drink one hundred fifty five Politically he was insignificant No statute indeed excluded him from the House of Commons but he had almost as little chance of obtaining a seat there as a man of colour has of being chosen a Senator of the United States In fact only one Papist had been returned to the Irish Parliament since the Restoration The whole legislative and executive power was in the hands of the colonists and the ascendency of the ruling caste was upheld by a standing army of seven thousand men on whose zeal for what was called the English interest full reliance could be placed one hundred fifty six On a close scrutiny it would have been found that neither the Irishry nor the Englishry formed a perfectly homogeneous body The distinction between those Irish who were of Celtic blood and those Irish who sprang from the followers of Strong bow and De Burgh was not altogether effaced The Fitzes sometimes permitted themselves to speak with scorn of the Os and Macs and the Os and Macs sometimes repaid that scorn with aversion In the preceding generation one of the most powerful of the O Neills refused to pay any mark of respect to a Roman Catholic gentleman of old Norman descent They say that the family has been here four hundred years No matter I hate the clown as if he had come yesterday one hundred fifty seven It seems however that such feelings were rare and that the feud which had long raged between the aboriginal Celts and the degenerate English had nearly given place to the fiercer feud which separated both races from the modern and Protestant colony The colony had its own internal disputes both national and religious The majority was English but a large minority came from the south of Scotland One half of the settlers belonged to the Established Church the other half were Dissenters But in Ireland Scot and Southron were strongly bound together by their common Saxon origin Churchman and Presbyterian were strongly bound together by their common Protestantism All the colonists had a common language and a common pecuniary interest They were surrounded by common enemies and could be safe only by means of common precautions and exertions The few penal laws therefore which had been made in Ireland against Protestant Nonconformists were a dead letter one hundred fifty eight The bigotry of the most sturdy churchman would not bear exportation across saint George s Channel As soon as the Cavalier arrived in Ireland and found that without the hearty and courageous assistance of his Puritan neighbours he and all his family would run imminent risk of being murdered by Popish marauders his hatred of Puritanism in spite of himself began to languish and die away It was remarked by eminent men of both parties that a Protestant who in Ireland was called a high Tory would in England have been considered as a moderate Whig one hundred fifty nine The Protestant Nonconformists on their side endured with more patience than could have been expected the sight of the most absurd ecclesiastical establishment that the world has ever seen Four Archbishops and eighteen Bishops were employed in looking after about a fifth part of the number of churchmen who inhabited the single diocese of London Of the parochial clergy a large proportion were pluralists and resided at a distance from their cures There were some who drew from their benefices incomes of little less than a thousand a year without ever performing any spiritual function Yet this monstrous institution was much less disliked by the Puritans settled in Ireland than the Church of England by the English sectaries For in Ireland religious divisions were subordinate to national divisions and the Presbyterian while as a theologian he could not but condemn the established hierarchy yet looked on that hierarchy with a sort of complacency when he considered it as a sumptuous and ostentatious trophy of the victory achieved by the great race from which he sprang one hundred sixty Thus the grievances of the Irish Roman Catholic had hardly anything in common with the grievances of the English Roman Catholic The Roman Catholic of Lancashire or Staffordshire had only to turn Protestant and he was at once in all respects on a level with his neighbours but if the Roman Catholics of Munster and Connaught had turned Protestants they would still have continued to be a subject people Whatever evils the Roman Catholic suffered in England were the effects of harsh legislation and might have been remedied by a more liberal legislation But between the two populations which inhabited Ireland there was an inequality which legislation had not caused and could not remove The dominion which one of those populations exercised over the other was the dominion of wealth over poverty of knowledge over ignorance of civilised over uncivilised man James himself seemed at the commencement of his reign to be perfectly aware of these truths The distractions of Ireland he said arose not from the differences between the Catholics and the Protestants but from the differences between the Irish and the English one hundred sixty one The consequences which he should have drawn from this just proposition were sufficiently obvious but unhappily for himself and for Ireland he failed to perceive them If only national animosity could be allayed there could be little doubt that religious animosity not being kept alive as in England by cruel penal acts and stringent test acts would of itself fade away To allay a national animosity such as that which the two races inhabiting Ireland felt for each other could not be the work of a few years Yet it was a work to which a wise and good prince might have contributed much and James would have undertaken that work with advantages such as none of his predecessors or successors possessed At once an Englishman and a Roman Catholic he belonged half to the ruling and half to the subject caste and was therefore peculiarly qualified to be a mediator between them Nor is it difficult to trace the course which he ought to have pursued He ought to have determined that the existing settlement of landed property should be inviolable and he ought to have announced that determination in such a manner as effectually to quiet the anxiety of the new proprietors and to extinguish any wild hopes which the old proprietors might entertain Whether in the great transfer of estates injustice had or had not been committed was immaterial That transfer just or unjust had taken place so long ago that to reverse it would be to unfix the foundations of society There must be a time of limitation to all rights After thirty five years of actual possession after twenty five years of possession solemnly guaranteed by statute after innumerable leases and releases mortgages and devises it was too late to search for flaws in titles Nevertheless something might have been done to heal the lacerated feelings and to raise the fallen fortunes of the Irish gentry The colonists were in a thriving condition They had greatly improved their property by building planting and fencing The rents had almost doubled within a few years trade was brisk and the revenue amounting to about three hundred thousand pounds a year more than defrayed all the charges of the local government and afforded a surplus which was remitted to England There was no doubt that the next Parliament which should meet at Dublin though representing almost exclusively the English interest would in return for the King s promise to maintain that interest in all its legal rights willingly grant to him a very considerable sum for the purpose of indemnifying at least in part such native families as had been wrongfully despoiled It was thus that in our own time the French government put an end to the disputes engendered by the most extensive confiscation that ever took place in Europe And thus if James had been guided by the advice of his most loyal Protestant counsellors he would have at least greatly mitigated one of the chief evils which afflicted Ireland one hundred sixty two Having done this he should have laboured to reconcile the hostile races to each other by impartially protecting the rights and restraining the excesses of both He should have punished with equal severity the native who indulged in the license of barbarism and the colonist who abused the strength of civilisation As far as the legitimate authority of the crown extended and in Ireland it extended far no man who was qualified for office by integrity and ability should have been considered as disqualified by extraction or by creed for any public trust It is probable that a Roman Catholic King with an ample revenue absolutely at his disposal would without much difficulty have secured the cooperation of the Roman Catholic prelates and priests in the great work of reconciliation Much however must still have been left to the healing influence of time The native race would still have had to learn from the colonists industry and forethought the arts of life and the language of England There could not be equality between men who lived in houses and men who lived in sties between men who were fed on bread and men who were fed on potatoes between men who spoke the noble tongue of great philosophers and poets and men who with a perverted pride boasted that they could not writhe their mouths into chattering such a jargon as that in which the Advancement of Learning and the Paradise Lost were written one hundred sixty three Yet it is not unreasonable to believe that if the gentle policy which has been described had been steadily followed by the government all distinctions would gradually have been effaced and that there would now have been no more trace of the hostility which has been the curse of Ireland than there is of the equally deadly hostility which once raged between the Saxons and the Normans in England Unhappily James instead of becoming a mediator became the fiercest and most reckless of partisans Instead of allaying the animosity of the two populations he inflamed it to a height before unknown He determined to reverse their relative position and to put the Protestant colonists under the feet of the Popish Celts To be of the established religion to be of the English blood was in his view a disqualification for civil and military employment He meditated the design of again confiscating and again portioning out the soil of half the island and showed his inclination so clearly that one class was soon agitated by terrors which he afterwards vainly wished to soothe and the other by hopes which he afterwards vainly wished to restrain But this was the smallest part of his guilt and madness He deliberately resolved not merely to give to the aboriginal inhabitants of Ireland the entire possession of their own country but also to use them as his instruments for setting up arbitrary government in England The event was such as might have been foreseen The colonists turned to bay with the stubborn hardihood of their race The mother country justly regarded their cause as her own Then came a desperate struggle for a tremendous stake Everything dear to nations was wagered on both sides nor can we justly blame either the Irishman or the Englishman for obeying in that extremity the law of self preservation The contest was terrible but short The weaker went down His fate was cruel and yet for the cruelty with which he was treated there was not indeed a defence but an excuse for though he suffered all that tyranny could inflict he suffered nothing that he would not himself have inflicted The effect of the insane attempt to subjugate England by means of Ireland was that the Irish became hewers of wood and drawers of water to the English The old proprietors by their effort to recover what they had lost lost the greater part of what they had retained The momentary ascendency of Popery produced such a series of barbarous laws against Popery as made the statute book of Ireland a proverb of infamy throughout Christendom Such were the bitter fruits of the policy of James We have seen that one of his first acts after he became King was to recall Ormond from Ireland Ormond was the head of the English interest in that kingdom he was firmly attached to the Protestant religion and his power far exceeded that of an ordinary Lord Lieutenant first because he was in rank and wealth the greatest of the colonists and secondly because he was not only the chief of the civil administration but also commander of the forces The King was not at that time disposed to commit the government wholly to Irish hands He had indeed been heard to say that a native viceroy would soon become an independent sovereign one hundred sixty four For the present therefore he determined to divide the power which Ormond had possessed to entrust the civil administration to an English and Protestant Lord Lieutenant and to give the command of the army to an Irish and Roman Catholic General The Lord Lieutenant was Clarendon the General was Tyrconnel Tyrconnel sprang as has already been said from one of those degenerate families of the Pale which were popularly classed with the aboriginal population of Ireland He sometimes indeed in his rants talked with Norman haughtiness of the Celtic barbarians one hundred sixty five but all his sympathies were really with the natives The Protestant colonists he hated and they returned his hatred Clarendon s inclinations were very different but he was from temper interest and principle an obsequious courtier His spirit was mean his circumstances were embarrassed and his mind had been deeply imbued with the political doctrines which the Church of England had in that age too assiduously taught His abilities however were not contemptible and under a good King he would probably have been a respectable viceroy About three quarters of a year elapsed between the recall of Ormond and the arrival of Clarendon at Dublin During that interval the King was represented by a board of Lords Justices but the military administration was in Tyrconnel s hands Already the designs of the court began gradually to unfold themselves A royal order came from Whitehall for disarming the population This order Tyrconnel strictly executed as respected the English Though the country was infested by predatory bands a Protestant gentleman could scarcely obtain permission to keep a brace of pistols The native peasantry on the other hand were suffered to retain their weapons one hundred sixty six The joy of the colonists was therefore great when at length in December sixteen eighty five Tyrconnel was summoned to London and Clarendon set out for Dublin But it soon appeared that the government was really directed not at Dublin but in London Every mail that crossed saint George s Channel brought tidings of the boundless influence which Tyrconnel exercised on Irish affairs It was said that he was to be a Marquess that he was to be a Duke that he was to have the command of the forces that he was to be entrusted with the task of remodelling the army and the courts of justice one hundred sixty seven Clarendon was bitterly mortified at finding himself a subordinate in ember of that administration of which he had expected to be the head He complained that whatever he did was misrepresented by his detractors and that the gravest resolutions touching the country which he governed were adopted at Westminster made known to the public discussed at coffee houses communicated in hundreds of private letters some weeks before one hint had been given to the Lord Lieutenant His own personal dignity he said mattered little but it was no light thing that the representative of the majesty of the throne should be made an object of contempt to the people one hundred sixty eight Panic spread fast among the English when they found that the viceroy their fellow countryman and fellow Protestant was unable to extend to them the protection which they had expected from him They began to know by bitter experience what it is to be a subject caste They were harassed by the natives with accusations of treason and sedition This Protestant had corresponded with Monmouth that Protestant had said something disrespectful of the King four or five years ago when the Exclusion Bill was under discussion and the evidence of the most infamous of mankind was ready to substantiate every charge The Lord Lieutenant expressed his apprehension that if these practices were not stopped there would soon be at Dublin a reign of terror similar to that which he had seen in London when every man held his life and honour at the mercy of Oates and Bedloe one hundred sixty nine Clarendon was soon informed by a concise despatch from Sunderland that it had been resolved to make without delay a complete change in both the civil and the military government of Ireland and to bring a large number of Roman Catholics instantly into office His Majesty it was most ungraciously added had taken counsel on these matters with persons more competent to advise him than his inexperienced Lord Lieutenant could possibly be one hundred seventy Before this letter reached the viceroy the intelligence which it contained had through many channels arrived in Ireland The terror of the colonists was extreme Outnumbered as they were by the native population their condition would be pitiable indeed if the native population were to be armed against them with the whole power of the state and nothing less than this was threatened The English inhabitants of Dublin passed each other in the streets with dejected looks On the Exchange business was suspended Landowners hastened to sell their estates for whatever could be got and to remit the purchase money to England Traders began to call in their debts and to make preparations for retiring from business The alarm soon affected the revenue one hundred seventy one Clarendon attempted to inspire the dismayed settlers with a confidence which he was himself far from feeling He assured them that their property would be held sacred and that to his certain knowledge the King was fully determined to maintain the act of settlement which guaranteed their right to the soil But his letters to England were in a very different strain He ventured even to expostulate with the King and without blaming His Majesty s intention of employing Roman Catholics expressed a strong opinion that the Roman Catholics who might be employed should be Englishmen one hundred seventy two The reply of James was dry and cold He declared that he had no intention of depriving the English colonists of their land but that he regarded a large portion of them as his enemies and that since he consented to leave so much property in the hands of his enemies it was the more necessary that the civil and military administration should be in the hands of his friends one hundred seventy three Accordingly several Roman Catholics were sworn of the Privy Council and orders were sent to corporations to admit Roman Catholics to municipal advantages one hundred seventy four Many officers of the army were arbitrarily deprived of their commissions and of their bread It was to no purpose that the Lord Lieutenant pleaded the cause of some whom he knew to be good soldiers and loyal subjects Among them were old Cavaliers who had fought bravely for monarchy and who bore the marks of honourable wounds Their places were supplied by men who had no recommendation but their religion Of the new Captains and Lieutenants it was said some had been cow herds some footmen some noted marauders some had been so used to wear brogues that they stumbled and shuffled about strangely in their military jack boots Not a few of the officers who were discarded took refuge in the Dutch service and enjoyed four years later the pleasure of driving their successors before them in ignominious rout through the waters of the Boyne one hundred seventy five The distress and alarm of Clarendon were increased by news which reached him through private channels Without his approbation without his knowledge preparations were making for arming and drilling the whole Celtic population of the country of which he was the nominal governor Tyrconnel from London directed the design and the prelates of his Church were his agents Every priest had been instructed to prepare an exact list of all his male parishioners capable of bearing arms and to forward it to his Bishop one hundred seventy six It had already been rumoured that Tyrconnel would soon return to Dublin armed with extraordinary and independent powers and the rumour gathered strength daily The Lord Lieutenant whom no insult could drive to resign the pomp and emoluments of his place declared that he should submit cheerfully to the royal pleasure and approve himself in all things a faithful and obedient subject He had never he said in his life had any difference with Tyrconnel and he trusted that no difference would now arise one hundred seventy seven Clarendon appears not to have recollected that there had once been a plot to ruin the fame of his innocent sister and that in that plot Tyrconnel had borne a chief part This is not exactly one of the injuries which high spirited men most readily pardon But in the wicked court where the Hydes had long been pushing their fortunes such injuries were easily forgiven and forgotten not from magnanimity or Christian charity but from mere baseness and want of moral sensibility In June sixteen eighty six Tyrconnel came His commission authorised him only to command the troops but he brought with him royal instructions touching all parts of the administration and at once took the real government of the island into his own hands On the day after his arrival he explicitly said that commissions must be largely given to Roman Catholic officers and that room must be made for them by dismissing more Protestants He pushed on the remodelling of the army eagerly and indefatigably It was indeed the only part of the functions of a Commander in Chief which he was competent to perform for though courageous in brawls and duels he knew nothing of military duty At the very first review which he held it was evident to all who were near to him that he did not know how to draw up a regiment one hundred seventy eight To turn Englishmen out and to put Irishmen in was in his view the beginning and the end of the administration of war He had the insolence to cashier the Captain of the Lord Lieutenant s own Body Guard nor was Clarendon aware of what had happened till he saw a Roman Catholic whose face was quite unknown to him escorting the state coach one hundred seventy nine The change was not confined to the officers alone The ranks were completely broken up and recomposed Four or five hundred soldiers were turned out of a single regiment chiefly on the ground that they were below the proper stature Yet the most unpractised eye at once perceived that they were taller and better made men than their successors whose wild and squalid appearance disgusted the beholders one hundred eighty Orders were given to the new officers that no man of the Protestant religion was to be suffered to enlist The recruiting parties instead of beating their drums for volunteers at fairs and markets as had been the old practice repaired to places to which the Roman Catholics were in the habit of making pilgrimages for purposes of devotion In a few weeks the General had introduced more than two thousand natives into the ranks and the people about him confidently affirmed that by Christmas day not a man of English race would be left in the whole army one hundred eighty one On all questions which arose in the Privy Council Tyrconnel showed similar violence and partiality John Keating Chief Justice of the Common Pleas a man distinguished by ability integrity and loyalty represented with great mildness that perfect equality was all that the General could reasonably ask for his own Church The King he said evidently meant that no man fit for public trust should be excluded because he was a Roman Catholic and that no man unfit for public trust should be admitted because he was a Protestant Tyrconnel immediately began to curse and swear I do not know what to say to that I would have all Catholics in one hundred eighty two The most judicious Irishmen of his own religious persuasion were dismayed at his rashness and ventured to remonstrate with him but he drove them from him with imprecations one hundred eighty three His brutality was such that many thought him mad Yet it was less strange than the shameless volubility with which he uttered falsehoods He had long before earned the nickname of Lying Dick Talbot and at Whitehall any wild fiction was commonly designated as one of Dick Talbot s truths He now daily proved that he was well entitled to this unenviable reputation Indeed in him mendacity was almost a disease He would after giving orders for the dismission of English officers take them into his closet assure them of his confidence and friendship and implore heaven to confound him sink him blast him if he did not take good care of their interests Sometimes those to whom he had thus perjured himself learned before the day closed that he had cashiered them one hundred eighty four On his arrival though he swore savagely at the Act of Settlement and called the English interest a foul thing a roguish thing and a damned thing he yet intended to be convinced that the distribution of property could not after the lapse of so many years be altered one hundred eighty five But when he had been a few weeks at Dublin his language changed He began to harangue vehemently at the Council board on the necessity of giving back the land to the old owners He had not however as yet obtained his master s sanction to this fatal project National feeling still struggled feebly against superstition in the mind of James He was an Englishman he was an English King and he could not without some misgivings consent to the destruction of the greatest colony that England had ever planted The English Roman Catholics with whom he was in the habit of taking counsel were almost unanimous in favour of the Act of Settlement Not only the honest and moderate Powis but the dissolute and headstrong Dover gave judicious and patriotic advice Tyrconnel could hardly hope to counteract at a distance the effect which such advice must produce on the royal mind He determined to plead the cause of his caste in person and accordingly he set out at the end of August for England His presence and his absence were equally dreaded by the Lord Lieutenant It was indeed painful to be daily browbeaten by an enemy but it was not less painful to know that an enemy was daily breathing calumny and evil counsel in the royal ear Clarendon was overwhelmed by manifold vexations He made a progress through the country and found that he was everywhere treated by the Irish population with contempt The Roman Catholic priests exhorted their congregations to withhold from him all marks of honour The native gentry instead of coming to pay their respects to him remained at their houses The native peasantry everywhere sang Erse songs in praise of Tyrconnel who would they doubted not soon reappear to complete the humiliation of their oppressors one hundred eighty six The viceroy had scarcely returned to Dublin from his unsatisfactory tour when he received letters which informed him that he had incurred the King s serious displeasure His Majesty so these letters ran expected his servants not only to do what he commanded but to do it from the heart and with a cheerful countenance The Lord Lieutenant had not indeed refused to cooperate in the reform of the army and of the civil administration but his cooperation had been reluctant and perfunctory his looks had betrayed his feelings and everybody saw that he disapproved of the policy which he was employed to carry into effect one hundred eighty seven In great anguish of mind he wrote to defend himself but he was sternly told that his defence was not satisfactory He then in the most abject terms declared that he would not attempt to justify himself that he acquiesced in the royal judgment be it what it might that he prostrated himself in the dust that he implored pardon that of all penitents he was the most sincere that he should think it glorious to die in his Sovereign s cause but found it impossible to live under his Sovereign s displeasure Nor was this mere interested hypocrisy but at least in part unaffected slavishness and poverty of spirit for in confidential letters not meant for the royal eye he bemoaned himself to his family in the same strain He was miserable he was crushed the wrath of the King was insupportable if that wrath could not be mitigated life would not be worth having one hundred eighty eight The poor man s terror increased when he learned that it had been determined at Whitehall to recall him and to appoint as his successor his rival and calumniator Tyrconnel one hundred eighty nine Then for a time the prospect seemed to clear the King was in better humour and during a few days Clarendon flattered himself that his brother s intercession had prevailed and that the crisis was passed one hundred ninety In truth the crisis was only beginning While Clarendon was trying to lean on Rochester Rochester was unable longer to support himself As in Ireland the elder brother though retaining the guard of honour the sword of state and the title of Excellency had really been superseded by the Commander of the Forces so in England the younger brother though holding the white staff and walking by virtue of his high office before the greatest hereditary nobles was fast sinking into a mere financial clerk The Parliament was again prorogued to a distant day in opposition to the Treasurer s known wishes He was not even told that there was to be another prorogation but was left to learn the news from the Gazette The real direction of affairs had passed to the cabal which dined with Sunderland on Fridays The cabinet met only to hear the despatches from foreign courts read nor did those despatches contain anything which was not known on the Royal Exchange for all the English Envoys had received orders to put into the official letters only the common talk of antechambers and to reserve important secrets for private communications which were addressed to James himself to Sunderland or to Petre one hundred ninety one Yet the victorious faction was not content The King was assured by those whom he most trusted that the obstinacy with which the nation opposed his designs was really to be imputed to Rochester How could the people believe that their Sovereign was unalterably resolved to persevere in the course on which he had entered when they saw at his right hand ostensibly first in power and trust among his counsellors a man who notoriously regarded that course with strong disapprobation Every step which had been taken with the object of humbling the Church of England and of elevating the Church of Rome had been opposed by the Treasurer True it was that when he had found opposition vain he had gloomily submitted nay that he had sometimes even assisted in carrying into effect the very plans against which he had most earnestly contended True it was that though he disliked the Ecclesiastical Commission he had consented to be a Commissioner True it was that he had while declaring that he could see nothing blamable in the conduct of the Bishop of London voted sullenly and reluctantly for the sentence of deprivation But this was not enough A prince engaged in an enterprise so important and arduous as that on which James was bent had a right to expect from his first minister not unwilling and ungracious acquiescence but zealous and strenuous cooperation While such advice was daily given to James by those in whom he reposed confidence he received by the penny post many anonymous letters filled with calumnies against the Lord Treasurer This mode of attack had been contrived by Tyrconnel and was in perfect harmony with every part of his infamous life one hundred ninety two The King hesitated He seems indeed to have really regarded his brother in law with personal kindness the effect of near affinity of long and familiar intercourse and of many mutual good offices It seemed probable that as long as Rochester continued to submit himself though tardily and with murmurs to the royal pleasure he would continue to be in name prime minister Sunderland therefore with exquisite cunning suggested to his master the propriety of asking the only proof of obedience which it was quite certain that Rochester never would give At present such was the language of the artful Secretary it was impossible to consult with the first of the King s servants respecting the object nearest to the King s heart It was lamentable to think that religious prejudices should at such a conjuncture deprive the government of such valuable assistance Perhaps those prejudices might not prove insurmountable Then the deceiver whispered that to his knowledge Rochester had of late had some misgivings about the points in dispute between the Protestants and Catholics one hundred ninety three This was enough The King eagerly caught at the hint He began to flatter himself that he might at once escape from the disagreeable necessity of removing a friend and secure an able coadjutor for the great work which was in progress He was also elated by the hope that he might have the merit and the glory of saving a fellow creature from perdition He seems indeed about this time to have been seized with an unusually violent fit of zeal for his religion and this is the more remarkable because he had just relapsed after a short interval of selfrestraint into debauchery which all Christian divines condemn as sinful and which in an elderly man married to an agreeable young wife is regarded even by people of the world as disreputable Lady Dorchester had returned from Dublin and was again the King s mistress Her return was politically of no importance She had learned by experience the folly of attempting to save her lover from the destruction to which he was running headlong She therefore suffered the Jesuits to guide his political conduct and they in return suffered her to wheedle him out of money She was however only one of several abandoned women who at this time shared with his beloved Church the dominion over his mind one hundred ninety four He seems to have determined to make some amends for neglecting the welfare of his own soul by taking care of the souls of others He set himself therefore to labour with real good will but with the good will of a coarse stern and arbitrary mind for the conversion of his kinsman Every audience which the Treasurer obtained was spent in arguments about the authority of the Church and the worship of images Rochester was firmly resolved not to abjure his religion but he had no scruple about employing in selfdefence artifices as discreditable as those which had been used against him He affected to speak like a man whose mind was not made up professed himself desirous to be enlightened if he was in error borrowed Popish books and listened with civility to Popish divines He had several interviews with Leyburn the Vicar Apostolic with Godden the chaplain and almoner of the Queen Dowager and with Bonaventure Giffard a theologian trained to polemics in the schools of Douay It was agreed that there should be a formal disputation between these doctors and some Protestant clergymen The King told Rochester to choose any ministers of the Established Church with two exceptions The proscribed persons were Tillotson and Stillingfleet Tillotson the most popular preacher of that age and in manners the most inoffensive of men had been much connected with some leading Whigs and Stillingfleet who was renowned as a consummate master of all the weapons of controversy had given still deeper offence by publishing an answer to the papers which had been found in the strong box of Charles the Second Rochester took the two royal chaplains who happened to be in waiting One of them was Simon Patrick whose commentaries on the Bible still form a part of theological libraries the other was Jane a vehement Tory who had assisted in drawing up that decree by which the University of Oxford had solemnly adopted the worst follies of Filmer The conference took place at Whitehall on the thirtieth of November Rochester who did not wish it to be known that he had even consented to hear the arguments of Popish priests stipulated for secrecy No auditor was suffered to be present except the King The subject discussed was the real presence The Roman Catholic divines took on themselves the burden of the proof Patrick and Jane said little nor was it necessary that they should say much for the Earl himself undertook to defend the doctrine of his Church and as was his habit soon warmed with conflict lost his temper and asked with great vehemence whether it was expected that he should change his religion on such frivolous grounds Then he remembered how much he was risking began again to dissemble complimented the disputants on their skill and learning and asked time to consider what had been said one hundred ninety five Slow as James was he could not but see that this was mere trifling He told Barillon that Rochester s language was not that of a man honestly desirous of arriving at the truth Still the King did not like to propose directly to his brother in law the simple choice apostasy or dismissal but three days after the conference Barillon waited on the Treasurer and with much circumlocution and many expressions of friendly concern broke the unpleasant truth Do you mean said Rochester bewildered by the involved and ceremonious phrases in which the intimation was made that if I do not turn Catholic the consequence will be that I shall lose my place I say nothing about consequences answered the wary diplomatist I only come as a friend to express a hope that you will take care to keep your place But surely said Rochester the plain meaning of all this is that I must turn Catholic or go out He put many questions for the purpose of ascertaining whether the communication was made by authority but could extort only vague and mysterious replies At last affecting a confidence which he was far from feeling he declared that Barillon must have been imposed upon by idle or malicious reports I tell you he said that the King will not dismiss me and I will not resign I know him he knows me and I fear nobody The Frenchman answered that he was charmed that he was ravished to hear it and that his only motive for interfering was a sincere anxiety for the prosperity and dignity of his excellent friend the Treasurer And thus the two statesmen parted each flattering himself that he had duped the other one hundred ninety six Meanwhile in spite of all injunctions of secrecy the news that the Lord Treasurer had consented to be instructed in the doctrines of Popery had spread fast through London Patrick and Jane had been seen going in at that mysterious door which led to Chiffinch s apartments Some Roman Catholics about the court had indiscreetly or artfully told all and more than all that they knew The Tory churchmen waited anxiously for fuller information They were mortified to think that their leader should even have pretended to waver in his opinion but they could not believe that he would stoop to be a renegade The unfortunate minister tortured at once by his fierce passions and his low desires annoyed by the censures of the public annoyed by the hints which he had received from Barillon afraid of losing character afraid of losing office repaired to the royal closet He was determined to keep his place if it could be kept by any villany but one He would pretend to be shaken in his religious opinions and to be half a convert he would promise to give strenuous support to that policy which he had hitherto opposed but if he were driven to extremity he would refuse to change his religion He began therefore by telling the King that the business in which His Majesty took so much interest was not sleeping that Jane and Giffard were engaged in consulting books on the points in dispute between the Churches and that when these researches were over it would be desirable to have another conference Then he complained bitterly that all the town was apprised of what ought to have been carefully concealed and that some persons who from their station might be supposed to be well informed reported strange things as to the royal intentions It is whispered he said that if I do not do as your Majesty would have me I shall not be suffered to continue in my present station The King said with some general expressions of kindness that it was difficult to prevent people from talking and that loose reports were not to be regarded These vague phrases were not likely to quiet the perturbed mind of the minister His agitation became violent and he began to plead for his place as if he had been pleading for his life Your Majesty sees that I do all in my power to obey you Indeed I will do all that I can to obey you in every thing I will serve you in your own way Nay he cried in an agony of baseness I will do what I can to believe as you would have me But do not let me be told while I am trying to bring my mind to this that if I find it impossible to comply I must lose all For I must needs tell your Majesty that there are other considerations Oh you must needs exclaimed the King with an oath For a single word of honest and manly sound escaping in the midst of all this abject supplication was sufficient to move his anger I hope sir said poor Rochester that I do not offend you Surely your Majesty could not think well of me if I did not say so The King recollected himself protested that he was not offended and advised the Treasurer to disregard idle rumours and to confer again with Jane and Giffard one hundred ninety seven After this conversation a fortnight elapsed before the decisive blow fell That fortnight Rochester passed in intriguing and imploring He attempted to interest in his favour those Roman Catholics who had the greatest influence at court He could not he said renounce his own religion but with that single reservation he would do all that they could desire Indeed if he might only keep his place they should find that he could be more useful to them as a Protestant than as one of their own communion one hundred ninety eight His wife who was on a sick bed had already it was said solicited the honour of a visit from the much injured Queen and had attempted to work on Her Majesty s feelings of compassion one hundred ninety nine But the Hydes abased themselves in vain Petre regarded them with peculiar malevolence and was bent on their ruin two hundred On the evening of the seventeenth of December the Earl was called into the royal closet James was unusually discomposed and even shed tears The occasion indeed could not but call up some recollections which might well soften even a hard heart He expressed his regret that his duty made it impossible for him to indulge his private partialities It was absolutely necessary he said that those who had the chief direction of his affairs should partake his opinions and feelings He owned that he had very great personal obligations to Rochester and that no fault could be found with the way in which the financial business had lately been done but the office of Lord Treasurer was of such high importance that in general it ought not to be entrusted to a single person and could not safely be entrusted by a Roman Catholic King to a person zealous for the Church of England Think better of it my Lord he continued Read again the papers from my brother s box I will give you a little more time for consideration if you desire it Rochester saw that all was over and that the wisest course left to him was to make his retreat with as much money and as much credit as possible He succeeded in both objects He obtained a pension of four thousand pounds a year for two lives on the post office He had made great sums out of the estates of traitors and carried with him in particular Grey s bond for forty thousand pounds and a grant of all the estate which the crown had in Grey s extensive property two hundred one No person had ever quitted office on terms so advantageous To the applause of the sincere friends of the Established Church Rochester had indeed very slender claims To save his place he had sate in that tribunal which had been illegally created for the purpose of persecuting her To save his place he had given a dishonest vote for degrading one of her most eminent ministers had affected to doubt her orthodoxy had listened with the outward show of docility to teachers who called her schismatical and heretical and had offered to cooperate strenuously with her deadliest enemies in their designs against her The highest praise to which he was entitled was this that he had shrunk from the exceeding wickedness and baseness of publicly abjuring for lucre the religion in which he had been brought up which he believed to be true and of which he had long made an ostentatious profession Yet he was extolled by the great body of Churchmen as if he had been the bravest and purest of martyrs The Old and New Testaments the Martyrologies of Eusebius and of Fox were ransacked to find parallels for his heroic piety He was Daniel in the den of lions Shadrach in the fiery furnace Peter in the dungeon of Herod Paul at the bar of Nero Ignatius in the amphitheatre Latimer at the stake Among the many facts which prove that the standard of honour and virtue among the public men of that age was low the admiration excited by Rochester s constancy is perhaps the most decisive In his fall he dragged down Clarendon On the seventh of January sixteen eighty seven the Gazette announced to the people of London that the Treasury was put into commission On the eighth arrived at Dublin a despatch formally signifying that in a month Tyrconnel would assume the government of Ireland It was not without great difficulty that this man had surmounted the numerous impediments which stood in the way of his ambition It was well known that the extermination of the English colony in Ireland was the object on which his heart was set He had therefore to overcome some scruples in the royal mind He had to surmount the opposition not merely of all the Protestant members of the government not merely of the moderate and respectable heads of the Roman Catholic body but even of several members of the jesuitical cabal two hundred two Sunderland shrank from the thought of an Irish revolution religious political and social To the Queen Tyrconnel was personally an object of aversion Powis was therefore suggested as the man best qualified for the viceroyalty He was of illustrious birth he was a sincere Roman Catholic and yet he was generally allowed by candid Protestants to be an honest man and a good Englishman All opposition however yielded to Tyrconnel s energy and cunning He fawned bullied and bribed indefatigably Petre s help was secured by flattery Sunderland was plied at once with promises and menaces An immense price was offered for his support no less than an annuity of five thousand pounds a year from Ireland redeemable by payment of fifty thousand pounds down If this proposal were rejected Tyrconnel threatened to let the King know that the Lord President had at the Friday dinners described His Majesty as a fool who must be governed either by a woman or by a priest Sunderland pale and trembling offered to procure for Tyrconnel supreme military command enormous appointments anything but the viceroyalty but all compromise was rejected and it was necessary to yield Mary of Modena herself was not free from suspicion of corruption There was in London a renowned chain of pearls which was valued at ten thousand pounds It had belonged to Prince Rupert and by him it had been left to Margaret Hughes a courtesan who towards the close of his life had exercised a boundless empire over him Tyrconnel loudly boasted that with this chain he had purchased the support of the Queen There were those however who suspected that this story was one of Dick Talbot s truths and that it had no more foundation than the calumnies which twenty six years before he had invented to blacken the fame of Anne Hyde To the Roman Catholic courtiers generally he spoke of the uncertain tenure by which they held offices honours and emoluments The King might die tomorrow and might leave them at the mercy of a hostile government and a hostile rabble But if the old faith could be made dominant in Ireland if the Protestant interest in that country could be destroyed there would still be in the worst event an asylum at hand to which they might retreat and where they might either negotiate or defend themselves with advantage A Popish priest was hired with the promise of the mitre of Waterford to preach at Saint James s against the Act of Settlement and his sermon though heard with deep disgust by the English part of the auditory was not without its effect The struggle which patriotism had for a time maintained against bigotry in the royal mind was at an end There is work to be done in Ireland said James which no Englishman will do two hundred three All obstacles were at length removed and in February sixteen eighty seven Tyrconnel began to rule his native country with the power and appointments of Lord Lieutenant but with the humbler title of Lord Deputy His arrival spread dismay through the whole English population Clarendon was accompanied or speedily followed across saint George s Channel by a large proportion of the most respectable inhabitants of Dublin gentlemen tradesmen and artificers It was said that fifteen hundred families emigrated in a few days The panic was not unreasonable The work of putting the colonists down under the feet of the natives went rapidly on In a short time almost every Privy Councillor Judge Sheriff Mayor Alderman and Justice of the Peace was a Celt and a Roman Catholic It seemed that things would soon be ripe for a general election and that a House of Commons bent on abrogating the Act of Settlement would easily be assembled two hundred four Those who had lately been the lords of the island now cried out in the bitterness of their souls that they had become a prey and a laughingstock to their own serfs and menials that houses were burnt and cattle stolen with impunity that the new soldiers roamed the country pillaging insulting ravishing maiming tossing one Protestant in a blanket tying up another by the hair and scourging him that to appeal to the law was vain that Irish Judges Sheriffs juries and witnesses were all in a league to save Irish criminals and that even without an Act of Parliament the whole soil would soon change hands for that in every action of ejectment tried under the administration of Tyrconnel judgment had been given for the native against the Englishman two hundred five While Clarendon was at Dublin the Privy Seal had been in the hands of Commissioners His friends hoped that it would on his return to London be again delivered to him But the King and the Jesuitical cabal had determined that the disgrace of the Hydes should be complete Lord Arundell of Wardour a Roman Catholic received the Privy Seal Bellasyse a Roman Catholic was made First Lord of the Treasury and Dover another Roman Catholic had a seat at the board The appointment of a ruined gambler to such a trust would alone have sufficed to disgust the public The dissolute Etherege who then resided at Ratisbon as English envoy could not refrain from expressing with a sneer his hope that his old boon companion Dover would keep the King s money better than his own In order that the finances might not be ruined by incapable and inexperienced Papists the obsequious diligent and silent Godolphin was named a Commissioner of the Treasury but continued to be Chamberlain to the Queen two hundred six The dismission of the two brothers is a great epoch in the reign of James From that time it was clear that what he really wanted was not liberty of conscience for the members of his own church but liberty to persecute the members of other churches Pretending to abhor tests he had himself imposed a test He thought it hard he thought it monstrous that able and loyal men should be excluded from the public service solely for being Roman Catholics Yet he had himself turned out of office a Treasurer whom he admitted to be both loyal and able solely for being a Protestant The cry was that a general proscription was at hand and that every public functionary must make up his mind to lose his soul or to lose his place two hundred seven Who indeed could hope to stand where the Hydes had fallen They were the brothers in law of the King the uncles and natural guardians of his children his friends from early youth his steady adherents in adversity and peril his obsequious servants since he had been on the throne Their sole crime was their religion and for this crime they had been discarded In great perturbation men began to look round for help and soon all eyes were fixed on one whom a rare concurrence both of personal qualities and of fortuitous circumstances pointed out as the deliverer CHAPTER VII William Prince of Orange his

to Rome THE place which William Henry Prince of Orange Nassau occupies in the history of England and of mankind is so great that it may be desirable to portray with some minuteness the strong lineaments of his character two hundred eight He was now in his thirty seventh year But both in body and in mind he was older than other men of the same age Indeed it might be said that he had never been young His external appearance is almost as well known to us as to his own captains and counsellors Sculptors painters and medallists exerted their utmost skill in the work of transmitting his features to posterity and his features were such as no artist could fail to seize and such as once seen could never be forgotten His name at once calls up before us a slender and feeble frame a lofty and ample forehead a nose curved like the beak of an eagle an eye rivalling that of an eagle in brightness and keenness a thoughtful and somewhat sullen brow a firm and somewhat peevish mouth a cheek pale thin and deeply furrowed by sickness and by care That pensive severe and solemn aspect could scarcely have belonged to a happy or a goodhumoured man But it indicates in a manner not to be mistaken capacity equal to the most arduous enterprises and fortitude not to be shaken by reverses or dangers Nature had largely endowed William with the qualities of a great ruler and education had developed those qualities in no common degree With strong natural sense and rare force of will he found himself when first his mind began to open a fatherless and motherless child the chief of a great but depressed and disheartened party and the heir to vast and indefinite pretensions which excited the dread and aversion of the oligarchy then supreme in the United Provinces The common people fondly attached during a century to his house indicated whenever they saw him in a manner not to be mistaken that they regarded him as their rightful head The able and experienced ministers of the republic mortal enemies of his name came every day to pay their feigned civilities to him and to observe the progress of his mind The first movements of his ambition were carefully watched every unguarded word uttered by him was noted down nor had he near him any adviser on whose judgment reliance could be placed He was scarcely fifteen years old when all the domestics who were attached to his interest or who enjoyed any share of his confidence were removed from under his roof by the jealous government He remonstrated with energy beyond his years but in vain Vigilant observers saw the tears more than once rise in the eyes of the young state prisoner His health naturally delicate sank for a time under the emotions which his desolate situation had produced Such situations bewilder and unnerve the weak but call forth all the strength of the strong Surrounded by snares in which an ordinary youth would have perished William learned to tread at once warily and firmly Long before he reached manhood he knew how to keep secrets how to baffle curiosity by dry and guarded answers how to conceal all passions under the same show of grave tranquillity Meanwhile he made little proficiency in fashionable or literary accomplishments The manners of the Dutch nobility of that age wanted the grace which was found in the highest perfection among the gentlemen of France and which in an inferior degree embellished the Court of England and his manners were altogether Dutch Even his countrymen thought him blunt To foreigners he often seemed churlish In his intercourse with the world in general he appeared ignorant or negligent of those arts which double the value of a favour and take away the sting of a refusal He was little interested in letters or science The discoveries of Newton and Leibnitz the poems of Dryden and Boileau were unknown to him Dramatic performances tired him and he was glad to turn away from the stage and to talk about public affairs while Orestes was raving or while Tartuffe was pressing Elmira s hand He had indeed some talent for sarcasm and not seldom employed quite unconsciously a natural rhetoric quaint indeed but vigorous and original He did not however in the least affect the character of a wit or of an orator His attention had been confined to those studies which form strenuous and sagacious men of business From a child he listened with interest when high questions of alliance finance and war were discussed Of geometry he learned as much as was necessary for the construction of a ravelin or a hornwork Of languages by the help of a memory singularly powerful he learned as much as was necessary to enable him to comprehend and answer without assistance everything that was said to him and every letter which he received The Dutch was his own tongue He understood Latin Italian and Spanish He spoke and wrote French English and German inelegantly it is true and inexactly but fluently and intelligibly No qualification could be more important to a man whose life was to be passed in organizing great alliances and in commanding armies assembled from different countries One class of philosophical questions had been forced on his attention by circumstances and seems to have interested him more than might have been expected from his general character Among the Protestants of the United Provinces as among the Protestants of our island there were two great religious parties which almost exactly coincided with two great political parties The chiefs of the municipal oligarchy were Arminians and were commonly regarded by the multitude as little better than Papists The princes of Orange had generally been the patrons of the Calvinistic divinity and owed no small part of their popularity to their zeal for the doctrines of election and final perseverance a zeal not always enlightened by knowledge or tempered by humanity William had been carefully instructed from a child in the theological system to which his family was attached and regarded that system with even more than the partiality which men generally feel for a hereditary faith He had ruminated on the great enigmas which had been discussed in the Synod of Dort and had found in the austere and inflexible logic of the Genevese school something which suited his intellect and his temper That example of intolerance indeed which some of his predecessors had set he never imitated For all persecution he felt a fixed aversion which he avowed not only where the avowal was obviously politic but on occasions where it seemed that his interest would have been promoted by dissimulation or by silence His theological opinions however were even more decided than those of his ancestors The tenet of predestination was the keystone of his religion He often declared that if he were to abandon that tenet he must abandon with it all belief in a superintending Providence and must become a mere Epicurean Except in this single instance all the sap of his vigorous mind was early drawn away from the speculative to the practical The faculties which are necessary for the conduct of important business ripened in him at a time of life when they have scarcely begun to blossom in ordinary men Since Octavius the world had seen no such instance of precocious statesmanship Skilful diplomatists were surprised to hear the weighty observations which at seventeen the Prince made on public affairs and still more surprised to see a lad in situations in which he might have been expected to betray strong passion preserve a composure as imperturbable as their own At eighteen he sate among the fathers of the commonwealth grave discreet and judicious as the oldest among them At twenty one in a day of gloom and terror he was placed at the head of the administration At twenty three he was renowned throughout Europe as a soldier and a politician He had put domestic factions under his feet he was the soul of a mighty coalition and he had contended with honour in the field against some of the greatest generals of the age His personal tastes were those rather of a warrior than of a statesman but he like his greatgrandfather the silent prince who founded the Batavian commonwealth occupies a far higher place among statesmen than among warriors The event of battles indeed is not an unfailing test of the abilities of a commander and it would be peculiarly unjust to apply this test to William for it was his fortune to be almost always opposed to captains who were consummate masters of their art and to troops far superior in discipline to his own Yet there is reason to believe that he was by no means equal as a general in the field to some who ranked far below him in intellectual powers To those whom he trusted he spoke on this subject with the magnanimous frankness of a man who had done great things and who could well afford to acknowledge some deficiencies He had never he said served an apprenticeship to the military profession He had been placed while still a boy at the head of an army Among his officers there had been none competent to instruct him His own blunders and their consequences had been his only lessons I would give he once exclaimed a good part of my estates to have served a few campaigns under the Prince of Conde before I had to command against him It is not improbable that the circumstance which prevented William from attaining any eminent dexterity in strategy may have been favourable to the general vigour of his intellect If his battles were not those of a great tactician they entitled him to be called a great man No disaster could for one moment deprive him of his firmness or of the entire possession of all his faculties His defeats were repaired with such marvellous celerity that before his enemies had sung the Te Deum he was again ready for conflict nor did his adverse fortune ever deprive him of the respect and confidence of his soldiers That respect and confidence he owed in no small measure to his personal courage Courage in the degree which is necessary to carry a soldier without disgrace through a campaign is possessed or might under proper training be acquired by the great majority of men But courage like that of William is rare indeed He was proved by every test by war by wounds by painful and depressing maladies by raging seas by the imminent and constant risk of assassination a risk which has shaken very strong nerves a risk which severely tried even the adamantine fortitude of Cromwell Yet none could ever discover what that thing was which the Prince of Orange feared His advisers could with difficulty induce him to take any precaution against the pistols and daggers of conspirators two hundred nine Old sailors were amazed at the composure which he preserved amidst roaring breakers on a perilous coast In battle his bravery made him conspicuous even among tens of thousands of brave warriors drew forth the generous applause of hostile armies and was never questioned even by the injustice of hostile factions During his first campaigns he exposed himself like a man who sought for death was always foremost in the charge and last in the retreat fought sword in hand in the thickest press and with a musket ball in his arm and the blood streaming over his cuirass still stood his ground and waved his hat under the hottest fire His friends adjured him to take more care of a life invaluable to his country and his most illustrious antagonist the great Conde remarked after the bloody day of Seneff that the Prince of Orange had in all things borne himself like an old general except in exposing himself like a young soldier William denied that he was guilty of temerity It was he said from a sense of duty and on a cool calculation of what the public interest required that he was always at the post of danger The troops which he commanded had been little used to war and shrank from a close encounter with the veteran soldiery of France It was necessary that their leader should show them how battles were to be won And in truth more than one day which had seemed hopelessly lost was retrieved by the hardihood with which he rallied his broken battalions and cut down with his own hand the cowards who set the example of flight Sometimes however it seemed that he had a strange pleasure in venturing his person It was remarked that his spirits were never so high and his manners never so gracious and easy as amidst the tumult and carnage of a battle Even in his pastimes he liked the excitement of danger Cards chess and billiards gave him no pleasure The chase was his favourite recreation and he loved it most when it was most hazardous His leaps were sometimes such that his boldest companions did not like to follow him He seems even to have thought the most hardy field sports of England effeminate and to have pined in the Great Park of Windsor for the game which he had been used to drive to bay in the forests of Guelders wolves and wild boars and huge stags with sixteen antlers two hundred ten The audacity of his spirit was the more remarkable because his physical organization was unusually delicate From a child he had been weak and sickly In the prime of manhood his complaints had been aggravated by a severe attack of small pox He was asthmatic and consumptive His slender frame was shaken by a constant hoarse cough He could not sleep unless his head was propped by several pillows and could scarcely draw his breath in any but the purest air Cruel headaches frequently tortured him Exertion soon fatigued him The physicians constantly kept up the hopes of his enemies by fixing some date beyond which if there were anything certain in medical science it was impossible that his broken constitution could hold out Yet through a life which was one long disease the force of his mind never failed on any great occasion to bear up his suffering and languid body He was born with violent passions and quick sensibilities but the strength of his emotions was not suspected by the world From the multitude his joy and his grief his affection and his resentment were hidden by a phlegmatic serenity which made him pass for the most coldblooded of mankind Those who brought him good news could seldom detect any sign of pleasure Those who saw him after a defeat looked in vain for any trace of vexation He praised and reprimanded rewarded and punished with the stern tranquillity of a Mohawk chief but those who knew him well and saw him near were aware that under all this ice a fierce fire was constantly burning It was seldom that anger deprived him of power over himself But when he was really enraged the first outbreak of his passion was terrible It was indeed scarcely safe to approach him On these rare occasions however as soon as he regained his self command he made such ample reparation to those whom he had wronged as tempted them to wish that he would go into a fury again His affection was as impetuous as his wrath Where he loved he loved with the whole energy of his strong mind When death separated him from what he loved the few who witnessed his agonies trembled for his reason and his life To a very small circle of intimate friends on whose fidelity and secrecy he could absolutely depend he was a different man from the reserved and stoical William whom the multitude supposed to be destitute of human feelings He was kind cordial open even convivial and jocose would sit at table many hours and would bear his full share in festive conversation Highest in his favour stood a gentleman of his household named Bentinck sprung from a noble Batavian race and destined to be the founder of one of the great patrician houses of England The fidelity of Bentinck had been tried by no common test It was while the United Provinces were struggling for existence against the French power that the young Prince on whom all their hopes were fixed was seized by the small pox That disease had been fatal to many members of his family and at first wore in his case a peculiarly malignant aspect The public consternation was great The streets of the Hague were crowded from daybreak to sunset by persons anxiously asking how his Highness was At length his complaint took a favourable turn His escape was attributed partly to his own singular equanimity and partly to the intrepid and indefatigable friendship of Bentinck From the hands of Bentinck alone William took food and medicine By Bentinck alone William was lifted from his bed and laid down in it Whether Bentinck slept or not while I was ill said William to Temple with great tenderness I know not But this I know that through sixteen days and nights I never once called for anything but that Bentinck was instantly at my side Before the faithful servant had entirely performed his task he had himself caught the contagion Still however he bore up against drowsiness and fever till his master was pronounced convalescent Then at length Bentinck asked leave to go home It was time for his limbs would no longer support him He was in great danger but recovered and as soon as he left his bed hastened to the army where during many sharp campaigns he was ever found as he had been in peril of a different kind close to William s side Such was the origin of a friendship as warm and pure as any that ancient or modern history records The descendants of Bentinck still preserve many letters written by William to their ancestor and it is not too much to say that no person who has not studied those letters can form a correct notion of the Prince s character He whom even his admirers generally accounted the most distant and frigid of men here forgets all distinctions of rank and pours out all his thoughts with the ingenuousness of a schoolboy He imparts without reserve secrets of the highest moment He explains with perfect simplicity vast designs affecting all the governments of Europe Mingled with his communications on such subjects are other communications of a very different but perhaps not of a less interesting kind All his adventures all his personal feelings his long runs after enormous stags his carousals on saint Hubert s day the growth of his plantations the failure of his melons the state of his stud his wish to procure an easy pad nag for his wife his vexation at learning that one of his household after ruining a girl of good family refused to marry her his fits of sea sickness his coughs his headaches his devotional moods his gratitude for the divine protection after a great escape his struggles to submit himself to the divine will after a disaster are described with an amiable garrulity hardly to have been expected from the most discreet and sedate statesman of the age Still more remarkable is the careless effusion of his tenderness and the brotherly interest which he takes in his friend s domestic felicity When an heir is born to Bentinck he will live I hope says William to be as good a fellow as you are and if I should have a son our children will love each other I hope as we have done two hundred eleven Through life he continues to regard the little Bentincks with paternal kindness He calls them by endearing diminutives he takes charge of them in their father s absence and though vexed at being forced to refuse them any pleasure will not suffer them to go on a hunting party where there would be risk of a push from a stag s horn or to sit up late at a riotous supper two hundred twelve When their mother is taken ill during her husband s absence William in the midst of business of the highest moment finds time to send off several expresses in one day with short notes containing intelligence of her state two hundred thirteen On one occasion when she is pronounced out of danger after a severe attack the Prince breaks forth into fervent expressions of gratitude to God I write he says with tears of joy in my eyes two hundred fourteen There is a singular charm in such letters penned by a man whose irresistible energy and inflexible firmness extorted the respect of his enemies whose cold and ungracious demeanour repelled the attachment of almost all his partisans and whose mind was occupied by gigantic schemes which have changed the face of the world His kindness was not misplaced Bentinck was early pronounced by Temple to be the best and truest servant that ever prince had the good fortune to possess and continued through life to merit that honourable character The friends were indeed made for each other William wanted neither a guide nor a flatterer Having a firm and just reliance on his own judgment he was not partial to counsellors who dealt much in suggestions and objections At the same time he had too much discernment and too much elevation of mind to be gratified by sycophancy The confidant of such a prince ought to be a man not of inventive genius or commanding spirit but brave and faithful capable of executing orders punctually of keeping secrets inviolably of observing facts vigilantly and of reporting them truly and such a man was Bentinck William was not less fortunate in marriage than in friendship Yet his marriage had not at first promised much domestic happiness His choice had been determined chiefly by political considerations nor did it seem likely that any strong affection would grow up between a handsome girl of sixteen well disposed indeed and naturally intelligent but ignorant and simple and a bridegroom who though he had not completed his twenty eighth year was in constitution older than her father whose manner was chilling and whose head was constantly occupied by public business or by field sports For a time William was a negligent husband He was indeed drawn away from his wife by other women particularly by one of her ladies Elizabeth Villiers who though destitute of personal attractions and disfigured by a hideous squint possessed talents which well fitted her to partake his cares two hundred fifteen He was indeed ashamed of his errors and spared no pains to conceal them but in spite of all his precautions Mary well knew that he was not strictly faithful to her Spies and talebearers encouraged by her father did their best to inflame her resentment A man of a very different character the excellent Ken who was her chaplain at the Hague during some months was so much incensed by her wrongs that he with more zeal than discretion threatened to reprimand her husband severely two hundred sixteen She however bore her injuries with a meekness and patience which deserved and gradually obtained William s esteem and gratitude Yet there still remained one cause of estrangement A time would probably come when the Princess who had been educated only to work embroidery to play on the spinet and to read the Bible and the Whole Duty of Man would be the chief of a great monarchy and would hold the balance of Europe while her lord ambitious versed in affairs and bent on great enterprises would find in the British government no place marked out for him and would hold power only from her bounty and during her pleasure It is not strange that a man so fond of authority as William and so conscious of a genius for command should have strongly felt that jealousy which during a few hours of royalty put dissension between Guildford Dudley and the Lady Jane and which produced a rupture still more tragical between Darnley and the Queen of Scots The Princess of Orange had not the faintest suspicion of her husband s feelings Her preceptor Bishop Compton had instructed her carefully in religion and had especially guarded her mind against the arts of Roman Catholic divines but had left her profoundly ignorant of the English constitution and of her own position She knew that her marriage vow bound her to obey her husband and it had never occurred to her that the relation in which they stood to each other might one day be inverted She had been nine years married before she discovered the cause of William s discontent nor would she ever have learned it from himself In general his temper inclined him rather to brood over his griefs than to give utterance to them and in this particular case his lips were sealed by a very natural delicacy At length a complete explanation and reconciliation were brought about by the agency of Gilbert Burnet The fame of Burnet has been attacked with singular malice and pertinacity The attack began early in his life and is still carried on with undiminished vigour though he has now been more than a century and a quarter in his grave He is indeed as fair a mark as factious animosity and petulant wit could desire The faults of his understanding and temper lie on the surface and cannot be missed They were not the faults which are ordinarily considered as belonging to his country Alone among the many Scotchmen who have raised themselves to distinction and prosperity in England he had that character which satirists novelists and dramatists have agreed to ascribe to Irish adventurers His high animal spirits his boastfulness his undissembled vanity his propensity to blunder his provoking indiscretion his unabashed audacity afforded inexhaustible subjects of ridicule to the Tories Nor did his enemies omit to compliment him sometimes with more pleasantry than delicacy on the breadth of his shoulders the thickness of his calves and his success in matrimonial projects on amorous and opulent widows Yet Burnet though open in many respects to ridicule and even to serious censure was no contemptible man His parts were quick his industry unwearied his reading various and most extensive He was at once a historian an antiquary a theologian a preacher a pamphleteer a debater and an active political leader and in every one of these characters made himself conspicuous among able competitors The many spirited tracts which he wrote on passing events are now known only to the curious but his History of his own Times his History of the Reformation his Exposition of the Articles his Discourse of Pastoral Care his Life of Hale his Life of Wilmot are still reprinted nor is any good private library without them Against such a fact as this all the efforts of detractors are vain A writer whose voluminous works in several branches of literature find numerous readers a hundred and thirty years after his death may have had great faults but must also have had great merits and Burnet had great merits a fertile and vigorous mind and a style far indeed removed from faultless purity but always clear often lively and sometimes rising to solemn and fervid eloquence In the pulpit the effect of his discourses which were delivered without any note was heightened by a noble figure and by pathetic action He was often interrupted by the deep hum of his audience and when after preaching out the hour glass which in those days was part of the furniture of the pulpit he held it up in his hand the congregation clamorously encouraged him to go on till the sand had run off once more two hundred seventeen In his moral character as in his intellect great blemishes were more than compensated by great excellence Though often misled by prejudice and passion he was emphatically an honest man Though he was not secure from the seductions of vanity his spirit was raised high above the influence either of cupidity or of fear His nature was kind generous grateful forgiving two hundred eighteen His religious zeal though steady and ardent was in general restrained by humanity and by a respect for the rights of conscience Strongly attached to what he regarded as the spirit of Christianity he looked with indifference on rites names and forms of ecclesiastical polity and was by no means disposed to be severe even on infidels and heretics whose lives were pure and whose errors appeared to be the effect rather of some perversion of the understanding than of the depravity of the heart But like many other good men of that age he regarded the case of the Church of Rome as an exception to all ordinary rules Burnet had during some years had an European reputation His History of the Reformation had been received with loud applause by all Protestants and had been felt by the Roman Catholics as a severe blow The greatest Doctor that the Church of Rome has produced since the schism of the sixteenth century Bossuet Bishop of Meaux was engaged in framing an elaborate reply Burnet had been honoured by a vote of thanks from one of the zealous Parliaments which had sate during the excitement of the Popish plot and had been exhorted in the name of the Commons of England to continue his historical researches He had been admitted to familiar conversation both with Charles and James had lived on terms of close intimacy with several distinguished statesmen particularly with Halifax and had been the spiritual guide of some persons of the highest note He had reclaimed from atheism and from licentiousness one of the most brilliant libertines of the age John Wilmot Earl of Rochester Lord Stafford the victim of Oates had though a Roman Catholic been edified in his last hours by Burnet s exhortations touching those points on which all Christians agree A few years later a more illustrious sufferer Lord Russell had been accompanied by Burnet from the Tower to the scaffold in Lincoln s Inn Fields The court had neglected no means of gaining so active and able a divine Neither royal blandishments nor promises of valuable preferment had been spared But Burnet though infected in early youth by those servile doctrines which were commonly held by the clergy of that age had become on conviction a Whig and he firmly adhered through all vicissitudes to his principles He had however no part in that conspiracy which brought so much disgrace and calamity on the Whig party and not only abhorred the murderous designs of Goodenough and Ferguson but was of opinion that even his beloved and honoured friend Russell had gone to unjustifiable lengths against the government A time at length arrived when innocence was not a sufficient protection Burnet though not guilty of any legal offence was pursued by the vengeance of the court He retired to the Continent and after passing about a year in those wanderings through Switzerland Italy and Germany of which he has left us an agreeable narrative reached the Hague in the summer of sixteen eighty six and was received there with kindness and respect He had many free conversations with the Princess on politics and religion and soon became her spiritual director and confidential adviser William proved a much more gracious host than could have been expected For of all faults officiousness and indiscretion were the most offensive to him and Burnet was allowed even by friends and admirers to be the most officious and indiscreet of mankind But the sagacious Prince perceived that this pushing talkative divine who was always blabbing secrets asking impertinent questions obtruding unasked advice was nevertheless an upright courageous and able man well acquainted with the temper and the views of British sects and factions The fame of Burnet s eloquence and erudition was also widely spread William was not himself a reading man But he had now been many years at the head of the Dutch administration in an age when the Dutch press was one of the most formidable engines by which the public mind of Europe was moved and though he had no taste for literary pleasures was far too wise and too observant to be ignorant of the value of literary assistance He was aware that a popular pamphlet might sometimes be of as much service as a victory in the field He also felt the importance of having always near him some person well informed as to the civil and ecclesiastical polity of our island and Burnet was eminently qualified to be of use as a living dictionary of British affairs For his knowledge though not always accurate was of immense extent and there were in England and Scotland few eminent men of any political or religious party with whom he had not conversed He was therefore admitted to as large a share of favour and confidence as was granted to any but those who composed the very small inmost knot of the Prince s private friends When the Doctor took liberties which was not seldom the case his patron became more than usually cold and sullen and sometimes uttered a short dry sarcasm which would have struck dumb any person of ordinary assurance In spite of such occurrences however the amity between this singular pair continued with some temporary interruptions till it was dissolved by death Indeed it was not easy to wound Burnet s feelings His selfcomplacency his animal spirits and his want of tact were such that though he frequently gave offence he never took it All the peculiarities of his character fitted him to be the peacemaker between William and Mary When persons who ought to esteem and love each other are kept asunder as often happens by some cause which three words of frank explanation would remove they are fortunate if they possess an indiscreet friend who blurts out the whole truth Burnet plainly told the Princess what the feeling was which preyed upon her husband s mind She learned for the first time with no small astonishment that when she became Queen of England William would not share her throne She warmly declared that there was no proof of conjugal submission and affection which she was not ready to give Burnet with many apologies and with solemn protestations that no human being had put words into his mouth informed her that the remedy was in her own hands She might easily when the crown devolved on her induce her Parliament not only to give the regal title to her husband but even to transfer to him by a legislative act the administration of the government But he added your Royal Highness ought to consider well before you announce any such resolution For it is a resolution which having once been announced cannot safely or easily be retracted I want no time for consideration answered Mary It is enough that I have an opportunity of showing my regard for the Prince Tell him what I say and bring him to me that he may hear it from my own lips Burnet went in quest of William but William was many miles off after a stag It was not till the next day that the decisive interview took place I did not know till yesterday said Mary that there was such a difference between the laws of England and the laws of God But I now promise you that you shall always bear rule and in return I ask only this that as I shall observe the precept which enjoins wives to obey their husbands you will observe that which enjoins husbands to love their wives Her generous affection completely gained the heart of William From that time till the sad day when he was carried away in fits from her dying bed there was entire friendship and confidence between them Many of her letters to him are extant and they contain abundant evidence that this man unamiable as he was in the eyes of the multitude had succeeded in inspiring a beautiful and virtuous woman born his superior with a passion fond even to idolatry The service which Burnet had rendered to his country was of high moment 
348-132751-0000	train-other-500	A time had arrived at which it was important to the public safety that there should be entire concord between the Prince and Princess Till after the suppression of the Western insurrection grave causes of dissension had separated William
348-132751-0001	train-other-500	both from Whigs and Tories He had seen with displeasure the attempts of the Whigs to strip the executive government of some powers which he thought necessary to its efficiency and dignity
348-132751-0002	train-other-500	He had seen with still deeper displeasure the countenance given by a large section of that party to the pretensions of Monmouth The opposition it seemed wished first to make the crown of England not worth the wearing
348-132751-0003	train-other-500	and then to place it on the head of a bastard and impostor At the same time the Prince s religious system differed widely from that which was the badge of the Tories They were Arminians and Prelatists
348-132751-0004	train-other-500	They looked down on the Protestant Churches of the Continent and regarded every line of their own liturgy and rubric as scarcely less sacred than the gospels His opinions touching the metaphysics of theology were Calvinistic
348-132751-0005	train-other-500	His opinions respecting ecclesiastical polity and modes of worship were latitudinarian He owned that episcopacy was a lawful and convenient form of church government but he spoke with sharpness and scorn of the bigotry of those
348-132751-0006	train-other-500	who thought episcopal ordination essential to a Christian society He had no scruple about the vestments and gestures prescribed by the Book of Common Prayer But he avowed that he should like the rites of the Church of England better
348-132751-0007	train-other-500	if they reminded him less of the rites of the Church of Rome He had been heard to utter an ominous growl when first he saw in his wife s private chapel an altar decked after the Anglican fashion
none	none	 and had not seemed well pleased at finding her with Hooker s Ecclesiastical Polity in her hands two hundred nineteen He therefore long observed the contest between the English factions attentively 
348-132751-0008	train-other-500	but without feeling a strong predilection for either side Nor in truth did he ever to the end of his life become either a Whig or a Tory He wanted that which is the common groundwork of both characters
348-132751-0009	train-other-500	for he never became an Englishman He saved England it is true but he never loved her and he never obtained her love To him she was always a land of exile visited with reluctance and quitted with delight
348-132751-0010	train-other-500	Even when he rendered to her those services of which at this day we feel the happy effects her welfare was not his chief object Whatever patriotic feeling he had was for Holland

348-132751-0015	train-other-500	it was his consolation to create round him by building planting and digging a scene which might remind him of the formal piles of red brick of the long canals and of the symmetrical flower beds amidst which his early life had been passed
348-132751-0016	train-other-500	Yet even his affection for the land of his birth was subordinate to another feeling which early became supreme in his soul which mixed itself with all his passions which impelled him to marvellous enterprises which supported him
348-132751-0017	train-other-500	when sinking under mortification pain sickness and sorrow which towards the close of his career seemed during a short time to languish but which soon broke forth again fiercer than ever and continued to animate him
348-132751-0018	train-other-500	even while the prayer for the departing was read at his bedside That feeling was enmity to France and to the magnificent King who in more than one sense
348-132751-0019	train-other-500	represented France and who to virtues and accomplishments eminently French joined in large measure that unquiet unscrupulous and vainglorious ambition which has repeatedly drawn on France the resentment of Europe
348-132751-0020	train-other-500	It is not difficult to trace the progress of the sentiment which gradually possessed itself of William s whole soul When he was little more than a boy his country had been attacked by Lewis in ostentatious defiance of justice and public law

348-132751-0023	train-other-500	and the loud weeping of ancient senators who could not bear the thought of surviving the freedom and glory of their native land that William had been called to the head of affairs For a time it seemed to him that resistance was hopeless

348-132751-0035	train-other-500	to think very lightly of the bloodshed and devastation inseparable from great martial exploits and the heart of William was steeled not only by professional insensibility but by that sterner insensibility
348-132751-0036	train-other-500	which is the effect of a sense of duty Three great coalitions three long and bloody wars in which all Europe from the Vistula to the Western Ocean was in arms are to be ascribed to his unconquerable energy

348-132751-0040	train-other-500	His contest with Lewis transferred from the field to the cabinet was soon exasperated by a private feud In talents temper manners and opinions the rivals were diametrically opposed to each other

348-132751-0042	train-other-500	presented a remarkable contrast to William simple in tastes ungracious in demeanour indefatigable and intrepid in war regardless of all the ornamental branches of knowledge
348-132751-0043	train-other-500	and firmly attached to the theology of Geneva The enemies did not long observe those courtesies which men of their rank even when opposed to each other at the head of armies seldom neglect William indeed
348-132751-0044	train-other-500	went through the form of tendering his best services to Lewis But this civility was rated at its true value and requited with a dry reprimand The great King affected contempt for the petty Prince
348-132751-0045	train-other-500	who was the servant of a confederacy of trading towns and to every mark of contempt the dauntless Stadtholder replied by a fresh defiance William took his title
348-132751-0046	train-other-500	a title which the events of the preceding century had made one of the most illustrious in Europe from a city which lies on the banks of the Rhone not far from Avignon and which like Avignon
348-132751-0047	train-other-500	though inclosed on every side by the French territory was properly a fief not of the French but of the Imperial Crown Lewis with that ostentatious contempt of public law which was characteristic of him

348-132751-0049	train-other-500	and when questioned about these words by the Count of Avaux positively refused either to retract them or to explain them away
none	none	 The quarrel was carried so far that the French minister could not venture to present himself at the drawing room of the Princess for fear of receiving some affront two hundred twenty The feeling with which William regarded France explains the whole of his policy towards England His public spirit was an European public spirit The chief object of his care was not our island not even his native Holland but the great community of nations threatened with subjugation by one too powerful member Those who commit the error of considering him as an English statesman must necessarily see his whole life in a false light and will be unable to discover any principle good or bad Whig or Tory to which his most important acts can be referred But when we consider him as a man whose especial task was to join a crowd of feeble divided and dispirited states in firm and energetic union against a common enemy when we consider him as a man in whose eyes England was important chiefly because without her the great coalition which he projected must be incomplete we shall be forced to admit that no long career recorded in history has been more uniform from the beginning to the close than that of this great Prince two hundred twenty one The clue of which we are now possessed will enable us to track without difficulty the course in reality consistent though in appearance sometimes tortuous which he pursued towards our domestic factions He clearly saw what had not escaped persons far inferior to him in sagacity that the enterprise on which his whole soul was intent would probably be successful if England were on his side would be of uncertain issue if England were neutral and would be hopeless if England acted as she had acted in the days of the Cabal He saw not less clearly that between the foreign policy and the domestic policy of the English government there was a close connection that the sovereign of this country acting in harmony with the legislature must always have a great sway in the affairs of Christendom and must also have an obvious interest in opposing the undue aggrandisement of any continental potentate that on the other hand the sovereign distrusted and thwarted by the legislature could be of little weight in European politics and that the whole of that little weight would be thrown into the wrong scale The Prince s first wish therefore was that there should be concord between the throne and the Parliament How that concord should be established and on which side concessions should be made were in his view questions of secondary importance He would have been best pleased no doubt to see a complete reconciliation effected without the sacrifice of one tittle of the prerogative For in the integrity of that prerogative he had a reversionary interest and he was by nature at least as covetous of power and as impatient of restraint as any of the Stuarts But there was no flower of the crown which he was not prepared to sacrifice even after the crown had been placed on his own head if he could only be convinced that such a sacrifice was indispensably necessary to his great design In the days of the Popish plot therefore though he disapproved of the violence with which the opposition attacked the royal authority he exhorted the government to give way The conduct of the Commons he said as respected domestic affairs was most unreasonable but while the Commons were discontented the liberties of Europe could never be safe and to that paramount consideration every other consideration ought to yield On these principles he acted when the Exclusion Bill had thrown the nation into convulsions There is no reason to believe that he encouraged the opposition to bring forward that bill or to reject the offers of compromise which were repeatedly made from the throne But when it became clear that unless that bill were carried there would be a serious breach between the Commons and the court he indicated very intelligibly though with decorous reserve his opinion that the representatives of the people ought to be conciliated at any price When a violent and rapid reflux of public feeling had left the Whig party for a time utterly helpless he attempted to attain his grand object by a new road perhaps more agreeable to his temper than that which he had previously tried In the altered temper of the nation there was little chance that any Parliament disposed to cross the wishes of the sovereign would be elected Charles was for a time master To gain Charles therefore was the Prince s first wish In the summer of sixteen eighty three almost at the moment at which the detection of the Rye House Plot made the discomfiture of the Whigs and the triumph of the King complete events took place elsewhere which William could not behold without extreme anxiety and alarm The Turkish armies advanced to the suburbs of Vienna The great Austrian monarchy on the support of which the Prince had reckoned seemed to be on the point of destruction Bentinck was therefore sent in haste from the Hague to London was charged to omit nothing which might be necessary to conciliate the English court and was particularly instructed to express in the strongest terms the horror with which his master regarded the Whig conspiracy During the eighteen months which followed there was some hope that the influence of Halifax would prevail and that the court of Whitehall would return to the policy of the Triple Alliance To that hope William fondly clung He spared no effort to propitiate Charles The hospitality which Monmouth found at the Hague is chiefly to be ascribed to the Prince s anxiety to gratify the real wishes of Monmouth s father As soon as Charles died William still adhering unchangeably to his object again changed his course He had sheltered Monmouth to please the late King That the present King might have no reason to complain Monmouth was dismissed We have seen that when the Western insurrection broke out the British regiments in the Dutch service were by the active exertions of the Prince sent over to their own country on the first requisition Indeed William even offered to command in person against the rebels and that the offer was made in perfect sincerity cannot be doubted by those who have perused his confidential letters to Bentinck two hundred twenty two The Prince was evidently at this time inclined to hope that the great plan to which in his mind everything else was subordinate might obtain the approbation and support of his father in law The high tone which James was then holding towards France the readiness with which he consented to a defensive alliance with the United Provinces the inclination which he showed to connect himself with the House of Austria encouraged this expectation But in a short time the prospect was darkened The disgrace of Halifax the breach between James and the Parliament the prorogation the announcement distinctly made by the King to the foreign ministers that continental politics should no longer divert his attention from internal measures tending to strengthen his prerogative and to promote the interest of his Church put an end to the delusion It was plain that when the European crisis came England would if James were her master either remain inactive or act in conjunction with France And the European crisis was drawing near The House of Austria had by a succession of victories been secured from danger on the side of Turkey and was no longer under the necessity of submitting patiently to the encroachments and insults of Lewis Accordingly in July sixteen eighty six a treaty was signed at Augsburg by which the Princes of the Empire bound themselves closely together for the purpose of mutual defence The Kings of Spain and Sweden were parties to this compact the King of Spain as sovereign of the provinces contained in the circle of Burgundy and the King of Sweden as Duke of Pomerania The confederates declared that they had no intention to attack and no wish to offend any power but that they were determined to tolerate no infraction of those rights which the Germanic body held under the sanction of public law and public faith They pledged themselves to stand by each other in case of need and fixed the amount of force which each member of the league was to furnish if it should be necessary to repel aggression two hundred twenty three The name of William did not appear in this instrument but all men knew that it was his work and foresaw that he would in no long time be again the captain of a coalition against France Between him and the vassal of France there could in such circumstances be no cordial good will There was no open rupture no interchange of menaces or reproaches But the father in law and the son in law were separated completely and for ever At the very time at which the Prince was thus estranged from the English court the causes which had hitherto produced a coolness between him and the two great sections of the English people disappeared A large portion perhaps a numerical majority of the Whigs had favoured the pretensions of Monmouth but Monmouth was now no more The Tories on the other hand had entertained apprehensions that the interests of the Anglican Church might not be safe under the rule of a man bred among Dutch Presbyterians and well known to hold latitudinarian opinions about robes ceremonies and Bishops but since that beloved Church had been threatened by far more formidable dangers from a very different quarter these apprehensions had lost almost all their power Thus at the same moment both the great parties began to fix their hopes and their affections on the same leader Old republicans could not refuse their confidence to one who had worthily filled during many years the highest magistracy of a republic Old royalists conceived that they acted according to their principles in paying profound respect to a prince so near to the throne At this conjuncture it was of the highest moment that there should be entire union between William and Mary A misunderstanding between the presumptive heiress of the crown and her husband must have produced a schism in that vast mass which was from all quarters gathering round one common rallying point Happily all risk of such misunderstanding was averted in the critical instant by the interposition of Burnet and the Prince became the unquestioned chief of the whole of that party which was opposed to the government a party almost coextensive with the nation There is not the least reason to believe that he at this time meditated the great enterprise to which a stern necessity afterwards drove him He was aware that the public mind of England though heated by grievances was by no means ripe for revolution He would doubtless gladly have avoided the scandal which must be the effect of a mortal quarrel between persons bound together by the closest ties of consanguinity and affinity Even his ambition made him unwilling to owe to violence that greatness which might be his in the ordinary course of nature and of law For he well knew that if the crown descended to his wife regularly all its prerogatives would descend unimpaired with it and that if it were obtained by election it must be taken subject to such conditions as the electors might think fit to impose He meant therefore as it appears to wait with patience for the day when he might govern by an undisputed title and to content himself in the meantime with exercising a great influence on English affairs as first Prince of the blood and as head of the party which was decidedly preponderant in the nation and which was certain whenever a Parliament should meet to be decidedly preponderant in both Houses Already it is true he had been urged by an adviser less sagacious and more impetuous than himself to try a bolder course This adviser was the young Lord Mordaunt That age had produced no more inventive genius and no more daring spirit But if a design was splendid Mordaunt seldom inquired whether it were practicable His life was a wild romance made up of mysterious intrigues both political and amorous of violent and rapid changes of scene and fortune and of victories resembling those of Amadis and Launcelot rather than those of Luxemburg and Eugene The episodes interspersed in this strange story were of a piece with the main plot Among them were midnight encounters with generous robbers and rescues of noble and beautiful ladies from ravishers Mordaunt having distinguished himself by the eloquence and audacity with which in the House of Lords he had opposed the court repaired soon after the prorogation to the Hague and strongly recommended an immediate descent on England He had persuaded himself that it would be as easy to surprise three great kingdoms as he long afterwards found it to surprise Barcelona William listened meditated and replied in general terms that he took a great interest in English affairs and would keep his attention fixed on them two hundred twenty four Whatever his purpose had been it is not likely that he would have chosen a rash and vainglorious knight errant for his confidant Between the two men there was nothing in common except personal courage which rose in both to the height of fabulous heroism Mordaunt wanted merely to enjoy the excitement of conflict and to make men stare William had one great end ever before him Towards that end he was impelled by a strong passion which appeared to him under the guise of a sacred duty Towards that end he toiled with a patience resembling as he once said the patience with which he had seen a boatman on a canal strain against an adverse eddy often swept back but never ceasing to pull and content if by the labour of hours a few yards could be gained two hundred twenty five Exploits which brought the Prince no nearer to his object however glorious they might be in the estimation of the vulgar were in his judgment boyish vanities and no part of the real business of life He determined to reject Mordaunt s advice and there can be no doubt that the determination was wise Had William in sixteen eighty six or even in sixteen eighty seven attempted to do what he did with such signal success in sixteen eighty eight it is probable that many Whigs would have risen in arms at his call But he would have found that the nation was not yet prepared to welcome an armed deliverer from a foreign country and that the Church had not yet been provoked and insulted into forgetfulness of the tenet which had long been her peculiar boast The old Cavaliers would have flocked to the royal standard There would probably have been in all the three kingdoms a civil war as long and fierce as that of the preceding generation While that war was raging in the British Isles what might not Lewis attempt on the Continent And what hope would there be for Holland drained of her troops and abandoned by her Stadtholder William therefore contented himself for the present with taking measures to unite and animate that mighty opposition of which he had become the head This was not difficult The fall of the Hydes had excited throughout England strange alarm and indignation Men felt that the question now was not whether Protestantism should be dominant but whether it should be tolerated The Treasurer had been succeeded by a board of which a Papist was the head The Privy Seal had been entrusted to a Papist The Lord Lieutenant of Ireland had been succeeded by a man who had absolutely no claim to high place except that he was a Papist The last person whom a government having in view the general interests of the empire would have sent to Dublin as Deputy was Tyrconnel His brutal manners made him unfit to represent the majesty of the crown The feebleness of his understanding and the violence of his temper made him unfit to conduct grave business of state The deadly animosity which he felt towards the possessors of the greater part of the soil of Ireland made him especially unfit to rule that kingdom But the intemperance of his bigotry was thought amply to atone for the intemperance of all his other passions and in consideration of the hatred which he bore to the reformed faith he was suffered to indulge without restraint his hatred of the English name This then was the real meaning of his Majesty s respect for the rights of conscience He wished his Parliament to remove all the disabilities which had been imposed on Papists merely in order that he might himself impose disabilities equally galling on Protestants It was plain that under such a prince apostasy was the only road to greatness It was a road however which few ventured to take For the spirit of the nation was thoroughly roused and every renegade had to endure such an amount of public scorn and detestation as cannot be altogether unfelt even by the most callous natures It is true that several remarkable conversions had recently taken place but they were such as did little credit to the Church of Rome Two men of high rank had joined her communion Henry Mordaunt Earl of Peterborough and James Cecil Earl of Salisbury But Peterborough who had been an active soldier courtier and negotiator was now broken down by years and infirmities and those who saw him totter about the galleries of Whitehall leaning on a stick and swathed up in flannels and plasters comforted themselves for his defection by remarking that he had not changed his religion till he had outlived his faculties two hundred twenty six Salisbury was foolish to a proverb His figure was so bloated by sensual indulgence as to be almost incapable of moving and this sluggish body was the abode of an equally sluggish mind

1595-132753-0002	train-other-500	but was soon dismissed for misconduct If any credit is due to a tradition which was long preserved in the green room Haines had the impudence to affirm that the Virgin Mary had appeared to him and called him to repentance
1595-132753-0003	train-other-500	After the Revolution he attempted to make his peace with the town by a penance more scandalous than his offence One night before he acted in a farce he appeared on the stage in a white sheet with a torch in his hand

1595-132753-0005	train-other-500	the first place among living English poets His claims on the gratitude of James were superior to those of any man of letters in the kingdom But James cared little for verses and much for money
1595-132753-0006	train-other-500	From the day of his accession he set himself to make small economical reforms such as bring on a government the reproach of meanness

1595-132753-0007	train-other-500	and impatient of poverty He knew little and cared little about religion If any sentiment was deeply fixed in him that sentiment was an aversion to priests of all persuasions Levites Augurs Muftis Roman Catholic divines

none	none	 Finding that if he continued to call himself a Protestant his services would be overlooked he declared himself a Papist The King s parsimony instantly relaxed Dryden was gratified with a pension of a hundred pounds a year and was employed to defend his new religion both in prose and verse Two eminent men Samuel Johnson and Walter Scott have done their best to persuade themselves and others that this memorable conversion was sincere It was natural that they should be desirous to remove a disgraceful stain from the memory of one whose genius they justly admired and with whose political feelings they strongly sympathized but the impartial historian must with regret pronounce a very different judgment 
1595-132753-0010	train-other-500	There will always be a strong presumption against the sincerity of a conversion by which the convert is directly a gainer In the case of Dryden there is nothing to countervail this presumption His theological writings abundantly prove
1595-132753-0011	train-other-500	that he had never sought with diligence and anxiety to learn the truth and that his knowledge both of the Church which he quitted and of the Church which he entered was of the most superficial kind Nor was his subsequent conduct
1595-132753-0012	train-other-500	that of a man whom a strong sense of duty had constrained to take a step of awful importance Had he been such a man the same conviction which had led him to join the Church of Rome would surely have prevented him from violating grossly and habitually
1595-132753-0013	train-other-500	rules which that Church in common with every other Christian society recognises as binding There would have been a marked distinction between his earlier and his later compositions
none	none	 He would have looked back with remorse on a literary life of near thirty years during which his rare powers of diction and versification had been systematically employed in spreading moral corruption Not a line tending to make virtue contemptible or to inflame licentious desire would thenceforward have proceeded from his pen The truth unhappily is that the dramas which he wrote after his pretended conversion are in no respect less impure or profane than those of his youth 
1595-132753-0014	train-other-500	Even when he professed to translate he constantly wandered from his originals in search of images which if he had found them in his originals he ought to have shunned What was bad became worse in his versions
1595-132753-0015	train-other-500	What was innocent contracted a taint from passing through his mind He made the grossest satires of Juvenal more gross interpolated loose descriptions in the tales of Boccaccio and polluted the sweet and limpid poetry of the Georgics
none	none	 with filth which would have moved the loathing of Virgil The help of Dryden was welcome to those Roman Catholic divines who were painfully sustaining a conflict against all that was most illustrious in the Established Church

1595-132753-0017	train-other-500	The first service which he was required to perform in return for his pension was to defend his Church in prose against Stillingfleet But the art of saying things well is useless to a man who has nothing to say and this was Dryden s case

none	none	 No art of execution could redeem the faults of such a design Yet the Fable of the Hind and Panther is undoubtedly the most valuable addition which was made to English literature during the short and troubled reign of James the Second In none of Dryden s works can be found passages more pathetic and magnificent greater ductility and energy of language or a more pleasing and various music 
1595-132753-0025	train-other-500	The poem appeared with every advantage which royal patronage could give A superb edition was printed for Scotland at the Roman Catholic press established in Holyrood House But men were in no humour to be charmed by the transparent style

1595-132753-0034	train-other-500	must have perceived that while that work was in progress a great alteration took place in the views of those who used Dryden as their interpreter At first the Church of England is mentioned with tenderness and respect and is exhorted
1595-132753-0035	train-other-500	to ally herself with the Roman Catholics against the Puritan sects but at the close of the poem

1595-132753-0036	train-other-500	with the Roman Catholics against the Church of England This change in the language of the court poet was indicative of a great change in the policy of the court The original purpose of James had been to obtain for the Church of which he was a member
1595-132753-0037	train-other-500	not only complete immunity from all penalties and from all civil disabilities but also an ample share of ecclesiastical and academical endowments and at the same time to enforce with rigour the laws against the Puritan sects

1595-132753-0042	train-other-500	he in violation of every law of hospitality and good faith required them to renounce the Calvinistic ritual to which they were strongly attached and to conform to the Church of England before he would dole out to them any portion of the alms

1595-132753-0046	train-other-500	His Parliament withstood him He tried the effects of frowns and menaces Frowns and menaces failed He tried the effect of prorogation From the day of the prorogation the opposition to his designs had been growing stronger and stronger
none	none	 It seemed clear that if he effected his purpose 
1595-132753-0047	train-other-500	he must effect it in defiance of that great party which had given such signal proofs of fidelity to his office to his family and to his person The whole Anglican priesthood the whole Cavalier gentry were against him
1595-132753-0048	train-other-500	In vain had he by virtue of his ecclesiastical supremacy enjoined the clergy to abstain from discussing controverted points Every parish in the nation
1595-132753-0049	train-other-500	was warned every Sunday against the errors of Rome and these warnings were only the more effective because they were accompanied by professions of reverence for the Sovereign

1595-132753-0050	train-other-500	now expressed in no measured phrase their resolution to stand as manfully by the Church Dull as was the intellect of James despotic as was his temper he felt that he must change his course
1595-132753-0051	train-other-500	He could not safely venture to outrage all his Protestant subjects at once If he could bring himself to make concessions to the party which predominated in both Houses if he could bring himself

1595-132753-0053	train-other-500	He could overpower the Anglican Church only by forming against her an extensive coalition including sects which though they differed in doctrine and government far more widely from each other than from her
1595-132753-0054	train-other-500	might yet be induced by their common jealousy of her greatness and by their common dread of her intolerance to suspend their animosities till she was no longer able to oppress them This plan seemed to him to have one strong recommendation
1595-132753-0055	train-other-500	If he could only succeed in conciliating the Protestant Nonconformists he might flatter himself that he was secure against all chance of rebellion According to the Anglican divines no subject could by any provocation be justified

1595-132753-0059	train-other-500	Influenced by such considerations as these James from the time at which he parted in anger with his Parliament began to meditate a general league of all Nonconformists Catholic and Protestant against the established religion
none	none	 So early as Christmas sixteen eighty five the agents of the United Provinces informed the States General that the plan of a general toleration had been arranged and would soon be disclosed two hundred thirty two The reports which had reached the Dutch embassy proved to be premature The separatists appear however to have been treated with more lenity during the year sixteen eighty six than during the year sixteen eighty five But it was only by slow degrees and after many struggles that the King could prevail on himself to form an alliance 
1595-132753-0060	train-other-500	with all that he most abhorred He had to overcome an animosity not slight or capricious not of recent origin or hasty growth

none	none	 Such had been even in England the relations between the King and the Puritans and in Scotland the tyranny of the King and the fury of the Puritans had been such as Englishmen could hardly conceive To forget an enmity so long and so deadly was no light task for a nature singularly harsh and implacable The conflict in the royal mind did not escape the eye of Barillon At the end of January sixteen eighty seven he sent a remarkable letter to Versailles The King such was the substance of this document had almost convinced himself that he could not obtain entire liberty for Roman Catholics and yet maintain the laws against Protestant Dissenters He leaned therefore to the plan of a general indulgence but at heart he would be far better pleased if he could even now divide his protection and favour between the Church of Rome and the Church of England to the exclusion of all other religious persuasions two hundred thirty three A very few days after this despatch had been written James made his first hesitating and ungracious advances towards the Puritans He had determined to begin with Scotland where his power to dispense with acts of parliament had been admitted by the obsequious Estates On the twelfth of February accordingly was published at Edinburgh a proclamation granting relief to scrupulous consciences two hundred thirty four This proclamation fully proves the correctness of Barillon s judgment Even in the very act of making concessions to the Presbyterians James could not conceal the loathing with which he regarded them The toleration given to the Catholics was complete The Quakers had little reason to complain But the indulgence vouchsafed to the Presbyterians who constituted the great body of the Scottish people was clogged by conditions which made it almost worthless For the old test which excluded Catholics and Presbyterians alike from office was substituted a new test which admitted the Catholics but excluded most of the Presbyterians The Catholics were allowed to build chapels and even to carry the host in procession anywhere except in the high streets of royal burghs the Quakers were suffered to assemble in public edifices but the Presbyterians were interdicted from worshipping God anywhere but in private dwellings they were not to presume to build meeting houses they were not even to use a barn or an outhouse for religious exercises and it was distinctly notified to them that if they dared to hold conventicles in the open air the law which denounced death against both preachers and hearers should be enforced without mercy Any Catholic priest might say mass any Quaker might harangue his brethren but the Privy Council was directed to see that no Presbyterian minister presumed to preach without a special license from the government Every line of this instrument and of the letters by which it was accompanied shows how much it cost the King to relax in the smallest degree the rigour with which he had ever treated the old enemies of his house two hundred thirty five There is reason indeed to believe that when he published this proclamation he had by no means fully made up his mind to a coalition with the Puritans and that his object was to grant just so much favour to them as might suffice to frighten the Churchmen into submission He therefore waited a month in order to see what effect the edict put forth at Edinburgh would produce in England That month he employed assiduously by Petre s advice in what was called closeting London was very full It was expected that the Parliament would shortly meet for the dispatch of business and many members were in town The King set himself to canvass them man by man He flattered himself that zealous Tories and of such with few exceptions the House of Commons consisted would find it difficult to resist his earnest request addressed to them not collectively but separately not from the throne but in the familiarity of conversation The members therefore who came to pay their duty at Whitehall were taken aside and honoured with long private interviews The King pressed them as they were loyal gentlemen to gratify him in the one thing on which his heart was fixed The question he said touched his personal honour The laws enacted in the late reign by factious Parliaments against the Roman Catholics had really been aimed at himself Those laws had put a stigma on him had driven him from the Admiralty had driven him from the Council Board He had a right to expect that in the repeal of those laws all who loved and reverenced him would concur When he found his hearers obdurate to exhortation he resorted to intimidation and corruption Those who refused to pleasure him in this matter were plainly told that they must not expect any mark of his favour Penurious as he was he opened and distributed his hoards Several of those who had been invited to confer with him left his bedchamber carrying with them money received from the royal hand The Judges who were at this time on their spring circuits were directed by the King to see those members who remained in the country and to ascertain the intentions of each The result of this investigation was that a great majority of the House of Commons seemed fully determined to oppose the measures of the court two hundred thirty six Among those whose firmness excited general admiration was Arthur Herbert brother of the Chief Justice member for Dover Master of the Robes and Rear Admiral of England Arthur Herbert was much loved by the sailors and was reputed one of the best of the aristocratical class of naval officers It had been generally supposed that he would readily comply with the royal wishes for he was heedless of religion he was fond of pleasure and expense he had no private estate his places brought him in four thousand pounds a year and he had long been reckoned among the most devoted personal adherents of James When however the Rear Admiral was closeted and required to promise that he would vote for the repeal of the Test Act his answer was that his honour and conscience would not permit him to give any such pledge Nobody doubts your honour said the King but a man who lives as you do ought not to talk about his conscience To this reproach a reproach which came with a bad grace from the lover of Catharine Sedley Herbert manfully replied I have my faults sir but I could name people who talk much more about conscience than I am in the habit of doing and yet lead lives as loose as mine He was dismissed from all his places and the account of what he had disbursed and received as Master of the Robes was scrutinised with great and as he complained with unjust severity two hundred thirty seven It was now evident that all hope of an alliance between the Churches of England and of Rome for the purpose of sharing offices and emoluments and of crushing the Puritan sects must be abandoned Nothing remained but to try a coalition between the Church of Rome and the Puritan sects against the Church of England On the eighteenth of March the King informed the Privy Council that he had determined to prorogue the Parliament till the end of November and to grant by his own authority entire liberty of conscience to all his subjects two hundred thirty eight On the fourth of April appeared the memorable Declaration of Indulgence In this Declaration the King avowed that it was his earnest wish to see his people members of that Church to which he himself belonged But since that could not be he announced his intention to protect them in the free exercise of their religion He repeated all those phrases which eight years before when he was himself an oppressed man had been familiar to his lips but which he had ceased to use from the day on which a turn of fortune had put it into his power to be an oppressor He had long been convinced he said that conscience was not to be forced that persecution was unfavourable to population and to trade and that it never attained the ends which persecutors had in view He repeated his promise already often repeated and often violated that he would protect the Established Church in the enjoyment of her legal rights He then proceeded to annul by his own sole authority a long series of statutes He suspended all penal laws against all classes of Nonconformists He authorised both Roman Catholics and Protestant Dissenters to perform their worship publicly He forbade his subjects on pain of his highest displeasure to molest any religious assembly He also abrogated all those acts which imposed any religious test as a qualification for any civil or military office two hundred thirty nine That the Declaration of Indulgence was unconstitutional is a point on which both the great English parties have always been entirely agreed Every person capable of reasoning on a political question must perceive that a monarch who is competent to issue such a declaration is nothing less than an absolute monarch Nor is it possible to urge in defence of this act of James those pleas by which many arbitrary acts of the Stuarts have been vindicated or excused It cannot be said that he mistook the bounds of his prerogative because they had not been accurately ascertained For the truth is that he trespassed with a recent landmark full in his view Fifteen years before that time a Declaration of Indulgence had been put forth by his brother with the advice of the Cabal That Declaration when compared with the Declaration of James might be called modest and cautious The Declaration of Charles dispensed only with penal laws The Declaration of James dispensed also with all religious tests The Declaration of Charles permitted the Roman Catholics to celebrate their worship in private dwellings only Under the Declaration of James they might build and decorate temples and even walk in procession along Fleet Street with crosses images and censers Yet the Declaration of Charles had been pronounced illegal in the most formal manner The Commons had resolved that the King had no power to dispense with statutes in matters ecclesiastical Charles had ordered the obnoxious instrument to be cancelled in his presence had torn off the seal with his own hand and had both by message under his sign manual and with his own lips from his throne in full Parliament distinctly promised the two Houses that the step which had given so much offence should never be drawn into precedent The two Houses had then without one dissentient voice joined in thanking him for this compliance with their wishes No constitutional question had ever been decided more deliberately more clearly or with more harmonious consent The defenders of James have frequently pleaded in his excuse the judgment of the Court of King s Bench on the information collusively laid against Sir Edward Hales but the plea is of no value That judgment James had notoriously obtained by solicitation by threats by dismissing scrupulous magistrates and by placing on the bench other magistrates more courtly And yet that judgment though generally regarded by the bar and by the nation as unconstitutional went only to this extent that the Sovereign might for special reasons of state grant to individuals by name exemptions from disabling statutes That he could by one sweeping edict authorise all his subjects to disobey whole volumes of laws no tribunal had ventured in the face of the solemn parliamentary decision of sixteen seventy three to affirm Such however was the position of parties that James s Declaration of Indulgence though the most audacious of all the attacks made by the Stuarts on public freedom was well calculated to please that very portion of the community by which all the other attacks of the Stuarts on public freedom had been most strenuously resisted It could scarcely be hoped that the Protestant Nonconformist separated from his countrymen by a harsh code harshly enforced would be inclined to dispute the validity of a decree which relieved him from intolerable grievances A cool and philosophical observer would undoubtedly have pronounced that all the evil arising from all the intolerant laws which Parliaments had framed was not to be compared to the evil which would be produced by a transfer of the legislative power from the Parliament to the Sovereign But such coolness and philosophy are not to be expected from men who are smarting under present pain and who are tempted by the offer of immediate ease A Puritan divine could not indeed deny that the dispensing power now claimed by the crown was inconsistent with the fundamental principles of the constitution But he might perhaps be excused if he asked What was the constitution to him The Act of Uniformity had ejected him in spite of royal promises from a benefice which was his freehold and had reduced him to beggary and dependence The Five Mile Act had banished him from his dwelling from his relations from his friends from almost all places of public resort Under the Conventicle Act his goods had been distrained and he had been flung into one noisome gaol after another among highwaymen and housebreakers Out of prison he had constantly had the officers of justice on his track he had been forced to pay hushmoney to informers he had stolen in ignominious disguises through windows and trapdoors to meet his flock and had while pouring the baptismal water or distributing the eucharistic bread been anxiously listening for the signal that the tipstaves were approaching Was it not mockery to call on a man thus plundered and oppressed to suffer martyrdom for the property and liberty of his plunderers and oppressors The Declaration despotic as it might seem to his prosperous neighbours brought deliverance to him He was called upon to make his choice not between freedom and slavery but between two yokes and he might not unnaturally think the yoke of the King lighter than that of the Church While thoughts like these were working in the minds of many Dissenters the Anglican party was in amazement and terror This new turn in affairs was indeed alarming The House of Stuart leagued with republican and regicide sects against the old Cavaliers of England Popery leagued with Puritanism against an ecclesiastical system with which the Puritans had no quarrel except that it had retained too much that was Popish these were portents which confounded all the calculations of statesmen The Church was then to be attacked at once on every side and the attack was to be under the direction of him who by her constitution was her head She might well be struck with surprise and dismay And mingled with surprise and dismay came other bitter feelings resentment against the perjured Prince whom she had served too well and remorse for the cruelties in which he had been her accomplice and for which he was now as it seemed about to be her punisher Her chastisement was just She reaped that which she had sown After the Restoration when her power was at the height she had breathed nothing hut vengeance She had encouraged urged almost compelled the Stuarts to requite with perfidious ingratitude the recent services of the Presbyterians Had she in that season of her prosperity pleaded as became her for her enemies she might now in her distress have found them her friends Perhaps it was not yet too late Perhaps she might still be able to turn the tactics of her faithless oppressor against himself There was among the Anglican clergy a moderate party which had always felt kindly towards the Protestant Dissenters That party was not large but the abilities acquirements and virtues of those who belonged to it made it respectable It had been regarded with little favour by the highest ecclesiastical dignitaries and had been mercilessly reviled by bigots of the school of Laud but from the day on which the Declaration of Indulgence appeared to the day on which the power of James ceased to inspire terror the whole Church seemed to be animated by the spirit and guided by the counsels of the calumniated Latitudinarians Then followed an auction the strangest that history has recorded On one side the King on the other the Church began to bid eagerly against each other for the favour of those whom tip to that time King and Church had combined to oppress The Protestant Dissenters who a few months before had been a despised and proscribed class now held the balance of power The harshness with which they had been treated was universally condemned The court tried to throw all the blame on the hierarchy The hierarchy flung it back on the court The King declared that he had unwillingly persecuted the separatists only because his affairs had been in such a state that he could not venture to disoblige the established clergy The established clergy protested that they had borne a part in severity uncongenial to their feelings only from deference to the authority of the King The King got together a collection of stories about rectors and vicars who had by threats of prosecution wrung money out of Protestant Dissenters He talked on this subject much and publicly threatened to institute an inquiry which would exhibit the parsons in their true character to the whole world and actually issued several commissions empowering agents on whom he thought that he could depend to ascertain the amount of the sums extorted in different parts of the country by professors of the dominant religion from sectaries The advocates of the Church on the other hand cited instances of honest parish priests who had been reprimanded and menaced by the court for recommending toleration in the pulpit and for refusing to spy out and hunt down little congregations of Nonconformists The King asserted that some of the Churchmen whom he had closeted had offered to make large concessions to the Catholics on condition that the persecution of the Puritans might go on The accused Churchmen vehemently denied the truth of this charge and alleged that if they would have complied with what he demanded for his own religion he would most gladly have suffered them to indemnify themselves by harassing and pillaging Protestant Dissenters two hundred forty The court had changed its face The scarf and cassock could hardly appear there without calling forth sneers and malicious whispers Maids of honour forbore to giggle and Lords of the Bedchamber bowed low when the Puritanical visage and the Puritanical garb so long the favourite subjects of mockery in fashionable circles were seen in the galleries Taunton which had been during two generations the stronghold of the Roundhead party in the West which had twice resolutely repelled the armies of Charles the First which had risen as one man to support Monmouth and which had been turned into a shambles by Kirke and Jeffreys seemed to have suddenly succeeded to the place which Oxford had once occupied in the royal favour two hundred forty one The King constrained himself to show even fawning courtesy to eminent Dissenters To some he offered money to some municipal honours to some pardons for their relations and friends who having been implicated in the Rye House Plot or having joined the standard of Monmouth were now wandering on the Continent or toiling among the sugar canes of Barbadoes He affected even to sympathize with the kindness which the English Puritans felt for their foreign brethren A second and a third proclamation were published at Edinburgh which greatly extended the nugatory toleration granted to the Presbyterians by the edict of February two hundred forty two The banished Huguenots on whom the King had frowned during many months and whom he had defrauded of the alms contributed by the nation were now relieved and caressed An Order in Council was issued appealing again in their behalf to the public liberality The rule which required them to qualify themselves for the receipt of charity by conforming to the Anglican worship seems to have been at this time silently abrogated and the defenders of the King s policy had the effrontery to affirm that this rule which as we know from the best evidence was really devised by himself in concert with Barillon had been adopted at the instance of the prelates of the Established Church two hundred forty three While the King was thus courting his old adversaries the friends of the Church were not less active Of the acrimony and scorn with which prelates and priests had since the Restoration been in the habit of treating the sectaries scarcely a trace was discernible Those who had lately been designated as schismatics and fanatics were now dear fellow Protestants weak brethren it might be but still brethren whose scruples were entitled to tender regard If they would but be true at this crisis to the cause of the English constitution and of the reformed religion their generosity should be speedily and largely rewarded They should have instead of an indulgence which was of no legal validity a real indulgence secured by Act of Parliament Nay many Churchmen who had hitherto been distinguished by their inflexible attachment to every gesture and every word prescribed in the Book of Common Prayer now declared themselves favourable not only to toleration but even to comprehension The dispute they said about surplices and attitudes had too long divided those who were agreed as to the essentials of religion When the struggle for life and death against the common enemy was over it would be found that the Anglican clergy would be ready to make every fair concession If the Dissenters would demand only what was reasonable not only civil but ecclesiastical dignities would be open to them and Baxter and Howe would be able without any stain on their honour or their conscience to sit on the episcopal bench Of the numerous pamphlets in which the cause of the Court and the cause of the Church were at this time eagerly and anxiously pleaded before the Puritan now by a strange turn of fortune the arbiter of the fate of his persecutors one only is still remembered the Letter to a Dissenter In this masterly little tract all the arguments which could convince a Nonconformist that it was his duty and his interest to prefer an alliance with the Church to an alliance with the Court were condensed into the smallest compass arranged in the most perspicuous order illustrated with lively wit and enforced by an eloquence earnest indeed yet never in its utmost vehemence transgressing the limits of exact good sense and good breeding The effect of this paper was immense for as it was only a single sheet more than twenty thousand copies were circulated by the post and there was no corner of the kingdom in which the effect was not felt Twenty four answers were published but the town pronounced that they were all bad and that Lestrange s was the worst of the twenty four two hundred forty four The government was greatly irritated and spared no pains to discover the author of the Letter but it was found impossible to procure legal evidence against him Some imagined that they recognised the sentiments and diction of Temple two hundred forty five But in truth that amplitude and acuteness of intellect that vivacity of fancy that terse and energetic style that placid dignity half courtly half philosophical which the utmost excitement of conflict could not for a moment derange belonged to Halifax and to Halifax alone The Dissenters wavered nor is it any reproach to them that they did so They were suffering and the King had given them relief Some eminent pastors had emerged from confinement others had ventured to return from exile Congregations which had hitherto met only by stealth and in darkness now assembled at noonday and sang psalms aloud in the hearing of magistrates churchwardens and constables Modest buildings for the worship of God after the Puritan fashion began to rise all over England An observant traveller will still remark the date of sixteen eighty seven on some of the oldest meeting houses Nevertheless the offers of the Church were to a prudent Dissenter far more attractive than those of the King The Declaration was in the eye of the law a nullity It suspended the penal statutes against nonconformity only for so long a time as the fundamental principles of the constitution and the rightful authority of the legislature should remain suspended What was the value of privileges which must be held by a tenure at once so ignominious and so insecure There might soon be a demise of the crown A sovereign attached to the established religion might sit on the throne A Parliament composed of Churchmen might be assembled How deplorable would then be the situation of Dissenters who had been in league with Jesuits against the constitution The Church offered an indulgence very different from that granted by James an indulgence as valid and as sacred as the Great Charter Both the contending parties promised religious liberty to the separatist but one party required him to purchase it by sacrificing civil liberty the other party invited him to enjoy civil and religious liberty together For these reasons even if it could be believed that the Court was sincere a Dissenter might reasonably have determined to cast in his lot with the Church But what guarantee was there for the sincerity of the Court All men knew what the conduct of James had been tip to that very time It was not impossible indeed that a persecutor might be convinced by argument and by experience of the advantages of toleration But James did not pretend to have been recently convinced On the contrary he omitted no opportunity of protesting that he had during many years been on principle adverse to all intolerance Yet within a few months he had persecuted men women young girls to the death for their religion Had he been acting against light and against the convictions of his conscience then Or was he uttering a deliberate falsehood now From this dilemma there was no escape and either of the two suppositions was fatal to the King s character for honesty It was notorious also that he had been completely subjugated by the Jesuits Only a few days before the publication of the Indulgence that Order had been honoured in spite of the well known wishes of the Holy See with a new mark of his confidence and approbation His confessor Father Mansuete a Franciscan whose mild temper and irreproachable life commanded general respect but who had long been hated by Tyrconnel and Petre had been discarded The vacant place had been filled by an Englishman named Warner who had apostatized from the religion of his country and had turned Jesuit To the moderate Roman Catholics and to the Nuncio this change was far from agreeable By every Protestant it was regarded as a proof that the dominion of the Jesuits over the royal mind was absolute two hundred forty six Whatever praises those fathers might justly claim flattery itself could not ascribe to them either wide liberality or strict veracity That they had never scrupled when the interest of their Order was at stake to call in the aid of the civil sword or to violate the laws of truth and of good faith had been proclaimed to the world not only by Protestant accusers but by men whose virtue and genius were the glory of the Church of Rome It was incredible that a devoted disciple of the Jesuits should be on principle zealous for freedom of conscience but it was neither incredible nor improbable that he might think himself justified in disguising his real sentiments in order to render a service to his religion It was certain that the King at heart preferred the Churchmen to the Puritans It was certain that while he had any hope of gaining the Churchmen he had never shown the smallest kindness to the Puritans Could it then be doubted that if the Churchmen would even now comply with his wishes he would willingly sacrifice the Puritans His word repeatedly pledged had not restrained him from invading the legal rights of that clergy which had given such signal proofs of affection and fidelity to his house What security then could his word afford to sects divided from him by the recollection of a thousand inexpiable wounds inflicted and endured When the first agitation produced by the publication of the Indulgence had subsided it appeared that a breach had taken place in the Puritan party The minority headed by a few busy men whose judgment was defective or was biassed by interest supported the King Henry Care who had long been the bitterest and most active pamphleteer among the Nonconformists and who had in the days of the Popish plot assailed James with the utmost fury in a weekly journal entitled the Packet of Advice from Rome was now as loud in adulation as he had formerly been in calumny and insult two hundred forty seven The chief agent who was employed by the government to manage the Presbyterians was Vincent Alsop a divine of some note both as a preacher and as a writer His son who had incurred the penalties of treason received a pardon and the whole influence of the father was thus engaged on the side of the Court two hundred forty eight With Alsop was joined Thomas Rosewell Rosewell had during that persecution of the Dissenters which followed the detection of the Rye House Plot been falsely accused of preaching against the government had been tried for his life by Jeffreys and had in defiance of the clearest evidence been convicted by a packed jury The injustice of the verdict was so gross that the very courtiers cried shame One Tory gentleman who had heard the trial went instantly to Charles and declared that the neck of the most loyal subject in England would not be safe if Rosewell suffered The jurymen themselves were stung by remorse when they thought over what they had done and exerted themselves to save the life of the prisoner At length a pardon was granted but Rosewell remained bound under heavy recognisances to good behaviour during life and to periodical appearance in the Court of King s Bench His recognisances were now discharged by the royal command and in this way his services were secured two hundred forty nine The business of gaining the Independents was principally intrusted to one of their ministers named Stephen Lobb Lobb was a weak violent and ambitious man He had gone such lengths in opposition to the government that he had been by name proscribed in several proclamations He now made his peace and went as far in servility as he had ever done in faction He joined the Jesuitical cabal and eagerly recommended measures from which the wisest and most honest Roman Catholics recoiled It was remarked that he was constantly at the palace and frequently in the closet that he lived with a splendour to which the Puritan divines were little accustomed and that he was perpetually surrounded by suitors imploring his interest to procure them offices or pardons two hundred fifty With Lobb was closely connected William Penn Penn had never been a strongheaded man the life which he had been leading during two years had not a little impaired his moral sensibility and if his conscience ever reproached him he comforted himself by repeating that he had a good and noble end in view and that he was not paid for his services in money By the influence of these men and of others less conspicuous addresses of thanks to the King were procured from several bodies of Dissenters Tory writers have with justice remarked that the language of these compositions was as fulsomely servile as anything that could be found in the most florid eulogies pronounced by Bishops on the Stuarts But on close inquiry it will appear that the disgrace belongs to but a small part of the Puritan party There was scarcely a market town in England without at least a knot of separatists No exertion was spared to induce them to express their gratitude for the Indulgence Circular letters imploring them to sign were sent to every corner of the kingdom in such numbers that the mail bags it was sportively said were too heavy for the posthorses Yet all the addresses which could be obtained from all the Presbyterians Independents and Baptists scattered over England did not in six months amount to sixty nor is there any reason to believe that these addresses were numerously signed two hundred fifty one The great body of Protestant Nonconformists firmly attached to civil liberty and distrusting the promises of the King and of the Jesuits steadily refused to return thanks for a favour which it might well be suspected concealed a snare This was the temper of all the most illustrious chiefs of the party One of these was Baxter He had as we have seen been brought to trial soon after the accession of James had been brutally insulted by Jeffreys and had been convicted by a jury such as the courtly Sheriffs of those times were in the habit of selecting Baxter had been about a year and a half in prison when the court began to think seriously of gaining the Nonconformists He was not only set at liberty but was informed that if he chose to reside in London he might do so without fearing that the Five Mile Act would be enforced against him The government probably hoped that the recollection of past sufferings and the sense of present ease would produce the same effect on him as on Rosewell and Lobb The hope was disappointed Baxter was neither to be corrupted nor to be deceived He refused to join in an address of thanks for the Indulgence and exerted all his influence to promote good feeling between the Church and the Presbyterians two hundred fifty two If any man stood higher than Baxter in the estimation of the Protestant Dissenters that man was John Howe Howe had like Baxter been personally a gainer by the recent change of policy The same tyranny which had flung Baxter into gaol had driven Howe into banishment and soon after Baxter had been let out of the King s Bench prison Howe returned from Utrecht to England It was expected at Whitehall that Howe would exert in favour of the court all the authority which he possessed over his brethren The King himself condescended to ask the help of the subject whom he had oppressed Howe appears to have hesitated but the influence of the Hampdens with whom he was on terms of close intimacy kept him steady to the cause of the constitution A meeting of Presbyterian ministers was held at his house to consider the state of affairs and to determine on the course to be adopted There was great anxiety at the palace to know the result Two royal messengers were in attendance during the discussion They carried back the unwelcome news that Howe had declared himself decidedly adverse to the dispensing power and that he had after long debate carried with him the majority of the assembly two hundred fifty three To the names of Baxter and Howe must be added the name of a man far below them in station and in acquired knowledge but in virtue their equal and in genius their superior John Bunyan Bunyan had been bred a tinker and had served as a private soldier in the parliamentary army Early in his life he had been fearfully tortured by remorse for his youthful sins the worst of which seem however to have been such as the world thinks venial His keen sensibility and his powerful imagination made his internal conflicts singularly terrible He fancied that he was under sentence of reprobation that he had committed blasphemy against the Holy Ghost that he had sold Christ that he was actually possessed by a demon Sometimes loud voices from heaven cried out to warn him Sometimes fiends whispered impious suggestions in his ear He saw visions of distant mountain tops on which the sun shone brightly but from which he was separated by a waste of snow He felt the Devil behind him pulling his clothes He thought that the brand of Cain had been set upon him He feared that he was about to burst asunder like Judas His mental agony disordered his health One day he shook like a man in the palsy On another day he felt a fire within his breast It is difficult to understand how he survived sufferings so intense and so long continued At length the clouds broke From the depths of despair the penitent passed to a state of serene felicity An irresistible impulse now urged him to impart to others the blessing of which he was himself possessed two hundred fifty four He joined the Baptists and became a preacher and writer His education had been that of a mechanic He knew no language but the English as it was spoken by the common people He had studied no great model of composition with the exception an important exception undoubtedly of our noble translation of the Bible His spelling was bad He frequently transgressed the rules of grammar Yet his native force of genius and his experimental knowledge of all the religious passions from despair to ecstasy amply supplied in him the want of learning His rude oratory roused and melted hearers who listened without interest to the laboured discourses of great logicians and Hebraists His works were widely circulated among the humbler classes One of them the Pilgrim s Progress was in his own lifetime translated into several foreign languages It was however scarcely known to the learned and polite and had been during near a century the delight of pious cottagers and artisans before it was publicly commended by any man of high literary eminence At length critics condescended to inquire where the secret of so wide and so durable a popularity lay They were compelled to own that the ignorant multitude had judged more correctly than the learned and that the despised little book was really a masterpiece Bunyan is indeed as decidedly the first of allegorists as Demosthenes is the first of orators or Shakspeare the first of dramatists Other allegorists have shown equal ingenuity but no other allegorist has ever been able to touch the heart and to make abstractions objects of terror of pity and of love two hundred fifty five It may be doubted whether any English Dissenter had suffered more severely under the penal laws than John Bunyan Of the twenty seven years which had elapsed since the Restoration he had passed twelve in confinement He still persisted in preaching but that he might preach he was under the necessity of disguising himself like a carter He was often introduced into meetings through back doors with a smock frock on his back and a whip in his hand If he had thought only of his own ease and safety he would have hailed the Indulgence with delight He was now at length free to pray and exhort in open day His congregation rapidly increased thousands hung upon his words and at Bedford where he ordinarily resided money was plentifully contributed to build a meeting house for him His influence among the common people was such that the government would willingly have bestowed on him some municipal office but his vigorous understanding and his stout English heart were proof against all delusion and all temptation He felt assured that the proffered toleration was merely a bait intended to lure the Puritan party to destruction nor would he by accepting a place for which he was not legally qualified recognise the validity of the dispensing power One of the last acts of his virtuous life was to decline an interview to which he was invited by an agent of the government two hundred fifty six Great as was the authority of Bunyan with the Baptists that of William Kiffin was still greater Kiffin was the first man among them in wealth and station He was in the habit of exercising his spiritual gifts at their meetings but he did not live by preaching He traded largely his credit on the Exchange of London stood high and he had accumulated an ample fortune Perhaps no man could at that conjuncture have rendered more valuable services to the Court But between him and the Court was interposed the remembrance of one terrible event He was the grandfather of the two Hewlings those gallant youths who of all the victims of the Bloody Assizes had been the most generally lamented For the sad fate of one of them James was in a peculiar manner responsible Jeffreys had respited the younger brother The poor lad s sister had been ushered by Churchill into the royal presence and had begged for mercy but the King s heart had been obdurate The misery of the whole family had been great but Kiffin was most to be pitied He was seventy years old when he was left desolate the survivor of those who should have survived him The heartless and venal sycophants of Whitehall judging by themselves thought that the old man would be easily propitiated by an Alderman s gown and by some compensation in money for the property which his grandsons had forfeited Penn was employed in the work of seduction but to no purpose The King determined to try what effect his own civilities would produce Kiffin was ordered to attend at the palace He found a brilliant circle of noblemen and gentlemen assembled James immediately came to him spoke to him very graciously and concluded by saying I have put you down mister Kiffin for an Alderman of London The old man looked fixedly at the King burst into tears and made answer Sir I am worn out I am unfit to serve your Majesty or the City And sir the death of my poor boys broke my heart That wound is as fresh as ever I shall carry it to my grave The King stood silent for a minute in some confusion and then said mister Kiffin I will find a balsam for that sore Assuredly James did not mean to say anything cruel or insolent on the contrary he seems to have been in an unusually gentle mood Yet no speech that is recorded of him gives so unfavourable a notion of his character as these few words They are the words of a hardhearted and lowminded man unable to conceive any laceration of the affections for which a place or a pension would not be a full compensation two hundred fifty seven That section of the dissenting body which was favourable to the King s new policy had from the first been a minority and soon began to diminish For the Nonconformists perceived in no long time that their spiritual privileges had been abridged rather than extended by the Indulgence The chief characteristic of the Puritan was abhorrence of the peculiarities of the Church of Rome He had quitted the Church of England only because he conceived that she too much resembled her superb and voluptuous sister the sorceress of the golden cup and of the scarlet robe He now found that one of the implied conditions of that alliance which some of his pastors had formed with the Court was that the religion of the Court should be respectfully and tenderly treated He soon began to regret the days of persecution While the penal laws were enforced he had heard the words of life in secret and at his peril but still he had heard them When the brethren were assembled in the inner chamber when the sentinels had been posted when the doors had been locked when the preacher in the garb of a butcher or a drayman had come in over the tiles then at least God was truly worshipped No portion of divine truth was suppressed or softened down for any worldly object All the distinctive doctrines of the Puritan theology were fully and even coarsely set forth To the Church of Rome no quarter was given The Beast the Antichrist the Man of Sin the mystical Jezebel the mystical Babylon were the phrases ordinarily employed to describe that august and fascinating superstition Such had been once the style of Alsop of Lobb of Rosewell and of other ministers who had of late been well received at the palace but such was now their style no longer Divines who aspired to a high place in the King s favour and confidence could not venture to speak with asperity of the King s religion Congregations therefore complained loudly that since the appearance of the Declaration which purported to give them entire freedom of conscience they had never once heard the Gospel boldly and faithfully preached Formerly they had been forced to snatch their spiritual nutriment by stealth but when they had snatched it they had found it seasoned exactly to their taste They were now at liberty to feed but their food had lost all its savour They met by daylight and in commodious edifices but they heard discourses far less to their taste than they would have heard from the rector At the parish church the will worship and idolatry of Rome were every Sunday attacked with energy but at the meeting house the pastor who had a few months before reviled the established clergy as little better than Papists now carefully abstained from censuring Popery or conveyed his censures in language too delicate to shock even the ears of Father Petre Nor was it possible to assign any creditable reason for this change The Roman Catholic doctrines had undergone no alteration Within living memory never had Roman Catholic priests been so active in the work of making proselytes never had so many Roman Catholic publications issued from the press never had the attention of all who cared about religion been so closely fixed on the dispute between the Roman Catholics and the Protestants What could be thought of the sincerity of theologians who had never been weary of railing at Popery when Popery was comparatively harmless and helpless and who now when a time of real danger to the reformed faith had arrived studiously avoided tittering one word which could give offence to a Jesuit Their conduct was indeed easily explained It was known that some of them had obtained pardons It was suspected that others had obtained money Their prototype might be found in that weak apostle who from fear denied the Master to whom he had boastfully professed the firmest attachment or in that baser apostle who sold his Lord for a handful of silver two hundred fifty eight Thus the dissenting ministers who had been gained by the Court were rapidly losing the influence which they had once possessed over their brethren On the other hand the sectaries found themselves attracted by a strong religious sympathy towards those prelates and priests of the Church of England who spite of royal mandates of threats and of promises were waging vigorous war with the Church of Rome The Anglican body and the Puritan body so long separated by a mortal enmity were daily drawing nearer to each other and every step which they made towards union increased the influence of him who was their common head William was in all things fitted to be a mediator between these two great sections of the English nation He could not be said to be a member of either Yet neither when in a reasonable mood could refuse to regard him as a friend His system of theology agreed with that of the Puritans At the same time he regarded episcopacy not indeed as a divine institution but as a perfectly lawful and an eminently useful form of church government Questions respecting postures robes festivals and liturgies he considered as of no vital importance A simple worship such as that to which he had been early accustomed would have been most to his personal taste But he was prepared to conform to any ritual which might be acceptable to the nation and insisted only that he should not be required to persecute his brother Protestants whose consciences did not permit them to follow his example Two years earlier he would have been pronounced by numerous bigots on both sides a mere Laodicean neither cold nor hot and fit only to be spewed out But the zeal which had inflamed Churchmen against Dissenters and Dissenters against Churchmen had been so tempered by common adversity and danger that the lukewarmness which had once been imputed to him as a crime was now reckoned among his chief virtues All men were anxious to know what he thought of the Declaration of Indulgence For a time hopes were entertained at Whitehall that his known respect for the rights of conscience would at least prevent him from publicly expressing disapprobation of a policy which had a specious show of liberality Penn sent copious disquisitions to the Hague and even went thither in the hope that his eloquence of which he had a high opinion would prove irresistible But though he harangued on his favourite theme with a copiousness which tired his hearers out and though he assured them that the approach of a golden age of religious liberty had been revealed to him by a man who was permitted to converse with angels no impression was made on the Prince two hundred fifty nine You ask me said William to one of the King s agents to countenance an attack on my own religion I cannot with a safe conscience do it and I will not no not for the crown of England nor for the empire of the world These words were reported to the King and disturbed him greatly two hundred sixty He wrote urgent letters with his own hand Sometimes he took the tone of an injured man He was the head of the royal family he was as such entitled to expect the obedience of the younger branches and it was very hard that he was to be crossed in a matter on which his heart was set At other times a bait which was thought irresistible was offered If William would but give way on this one point the English government would in return cooperate with him strenuously against France He was not to be so deluded He knew that James without the support of a Parliament would even if not unwilling be unable to render effectual service to the common cause of Europe and there could be no doubt that if a Parliament were assembled the first demand of both Houses would be that the Declaration should he cancelled The Princess assented to all that was suggested by her husband Their joint opinion was conveyed to the King in firm but temperate terms They declared that they deeply regretted the course which His Majesty had adopted They were convinced that he had usurped a prerogative which did not by law belong to him Against that usurpation they protested not only as friends to civil liberty but as members of the royal house who had a deep interest in maintaining the rights of that crown which they might one day wear For experience had shown that in England arbitrary government could not fail to produce a reaction even more pernicious than itself and it might reasonably be feared that the nation alarmed and incensed by the prospect of despotism might conceive a disgust even for constitutional monarchy The advice therefore which they tendered to the King was that he would in all things govern according to law They readily admitted that the law might with advantage be altered by competent authority and that some part of his Declaration well deserved to be embodied in an Act of Parliament They were not persecutors They should with pleasure see Roman Catholics as well as Protestant Dissenters relieved in a proper manner from all penal statutes They should with pleasure see Protestant Dissenters admitted in a proper manner to civil office At that point their Highnesses must stop They could not but entertain grave apprehensions that if Roman Catholics were made capable of public trust great evil would ensue and it was intimated not obscurely that these apprehensions arose chiefly from the conduct of James two hundred sixty one The opinion expressed by the Prince and Princess respecting the disabilities to which the Roman Catholics were subject was that of almost all the statesmen and philosophers who were then zealous for political and religious freedom In our age on the contrary enlightened men have often pronounced with regret that on this one point William appears to disadvantage when compared with his father in law The truth is that some considerations which are necessary to the forming of a correct judgment seem to have escaped the notice of many writers of the nineteenth century There are two opposite errors into which those who study the annals of our country are in constant danger of falling the error of judging the present by the past and the error of judging the past by the present The former is the error of minds prone to reverence whatever is old the latter of minds readily attracted by whatever is new The former error may perpetually be observed in the reasonings of conservative politicians on the questions of their own day The latter error perpetually infects the speculations of writers of the liberal school when they discuss the transactions of an earlier age The former error is the more pernicious in a statesman and the latter in a historian It is not easy for any person who in our time undertakes to treat of the revolution which overthrew the Stuarts to preserve with steadiness the happy mean between these two extremes The question whether members of the Roman Catholic Church could be safely admitted to Parliament and to office convulsed our country during the reign of James the Second was set at rest by his downfall and having slept during more than a century was revived by that great stirring of the human mind which followed the meeting of the National Assembly of France During thirty years the contest went on in both Houses of Parliament in every constituent body in every social circle It destroyed administrations broke up parties made all government in one part of the empire impossible and at length brought us to the verge of civil war Even when the struggle had terminated the passions to which it had given birth still continued to rage It was scarcely possible for any man whose mind was under the influence of those passions to see the events of the years sixteen eighty seven and sixteen eighty eight in a perfectly correct light One class of politicians starting from the true proposition that the Revolution had been a great blessing to our country arrived at the false conclusion that no test which the statesmen of the Revolution had thought necessary for the protection of our religion and our freedom could be safely abolished Another class starting from the true proposition that the disabilities imposed on the Roman Catholics had long been productive of nothing but mischief arrived at the false conclusion that there never could have been a time when those disabilities could have been useful and necessary The former fallacy pervaded the speeches of the acute and learned Eldon The latter was not altogether without influence even on an intellect so calm and philosophical as that of Mackintosh Perhaps however it will be found on examination that we may vindicate the course which was unanimously approved by all the great English statesmen of the seventeenth century without questioning the wisdom of the course which was as unanimously approved by all the great English statesmen of our own time Undoubtedly it is an evil that any citizen should be excluded from civil employment on account of his religious opinions but a choice between evils is sometimes all that is left to human wisdom A nation may be placed in such a situation that the majority must either impose disabilities or submit to them and that what would under ordinary circumstances be justly condemned as persecution may fall within the bounds of legitimate selfdefence and such was in the year sixteen eighty seven the situation of England According to the constitution of the realm James possessed the right of naming almost all public functionaries political judicial ecclesiastical military and naval In the exercise of this right he was not as our sovereigns now are under the necessity of acting in conformity with the advice of ministers approved by the House of Commons It was evident therefore that unless he were strictly bound by law to bestow office on none but Protestants it would be in his power to bestow office on none but Roman Catholics The Roman Catholics were few in number and among them was not a single man whose services could be seriously missed by the commonwealth The proportion which they bore to the population of England was very much smaller than at present For at present a constant stream of emigration runs from Ireland to our great towns but in the seventeenth century there was not even in London an Irish colony Forty nine fiftieths of the inhabitants of the kingdom forty nine fiftieths of the property of the kingdom almost all the political legal and military ability and knowledge to be found in the kingdom were Protestant Nevertheless the King under a strong infatuation had determined to use his vast patronage as a means of making proselytes To be of his Church was in his view the first of all qualifications for office To be of the national Church was a positive disqualification He reprobated it is true in language which has been applauded by some credulous friends of religious liberty the monstrous injustice of that test which excluded a small minority of the nation from public trust but he was at the same time instituting a test which excluded the majority He thought it hard that a man who was a good financier and a loyal subject should be excluded from the post of Lord Treasurer merely for being a Papist But he had himself turned out a Lord Treasurer whom he admitted to be a good financier and a loyal subject merely for being a Protestant He had repeatedly and distinctly declared his resolution never to put the white staff in the hands of any heretic With many other great offices of state he had dealt in the same way Already the Lord President the Lord Privy Seal the Lord Chamberlain the Groom of the Stole the First Lord of the Treasury a Secretary of State the Lord High Commissioner of Scotland the Chancellor of Scotland the Secretary of Scotland were or pretended to be Roman Catholics Most of these functionaries had been bred Churchmen and had been guilty of apostasy open or secret in order to obtain or to keep their high places Every Protestant who still held an important post in the government held it in constant uncertainty and fear It would be endless to recount the situations of a lower rank which were filled by the favoured class Roman Catholics already swarmed in every department of the public service They were Lords Lieutenants Deputy Lieutenants judges justices of the Peace Commissioners of the Customs Envoys to foreign courts Colonels of regiments Governors of fortresses The share which in a few months they had obtained of the temporal patronage of the crown was much more than ten times as great as they would have had under an impartial system Yet this was not the worst They were made rulers of the Church of England Men who had assured the King that they held his faith sate in the High Commission and exercised supreme jurisdiction in spiritual things over all the prelates and priests of the established religion Ecclesiastical benefices of great dignity had been bestowed some on avowed Papists and some on half concealed Papists And all this had been done while the laws against Popery were still unrepealed and while James had still a strong interest in affecting respect for the rights of conscience What then was his conduct likely to be if his subjects consented to free him by a legislative act from even the shadow of restraint Is it possible to doubt that Protestants would have been as effectually excluded from employment by a strictly legal use of the royal prerogative as ever Roman Catholics had been by Act of Parliament How obstinately James was determined to bestow on the members of his own Church a share of patronage altogether out of proportion to their numbers and importance is proved by the instructions which in exile and old age he drew up for the guidance of his son It is impossible to read without mingled pity and derision those effusions of a mind on which all the discipline of experience and adversity had been exhausted in vain The Pretender is advised if ever he should reign in England to make a partition of offices and carefully to reserve for the members of the Church of Rome a portion which might have sufficed for them if they had been one half instead of one fiftieth part of the nation One Secretary of State one Commissioner of the Treasury the Secretary at War the majority of the great dignitaries of the household the majority of the officers of the army are always to be Catholics Such were the designs of James after his perverse bigotry had drawn on him a punishment which had appalled the whole world Is it then possible to doubt what his conduct would have been if his people deluded by the empty name of religious liberty had suffered him to proceed without any check Even Penn intemperate and undiscerning as was his zeal for the Declaration seems to have felt that the partiality with which honours and emoluments were heaped on Roman Catholics might not unnaturally excite the jealousy of the nation He owned that if the Test Act were repealed the Protestants were entitled to an equivalent and went so far as to suggest several equivalents During some weeks the word equivalent then lately imported from France was in the mouths of all the coffee house orators but at length a few pages of keen logic and polished sarcasm written by Halifax put an end to these idle projects One of Penn s schemes was that a law should be passed dividing the patronage of the crown into three equal parts and that to one only of those parts members of the Church of Rome should be admitted Even under such an arrangement the members of the Church of Rome would have obtained near twenty times their fair portion of official appointments and yet there is no reason to believe that even to such an arrangement the King would have consented But had he consented what guarantee could he give that he would adhere to his bargain The dilemma propounded by Halifax was unanswerable If laws are binding on you observe the law which now exists If laws are not binding on you it is idle to offer us a law as a security two hundred sixty two It is clear therefore that the point at issue was not whether secular offices should be thrown open to all sects indifferently While James was King it was inevitable that there should be exclusion and the only question was who should be excluded Papists or Protestants the few or the many a hundred thousand Englishmen or five millions Such are the weighty arguments by which the conduct of the Prince of Orange towards the English Roman Catholics may be reconciled with the principles of religious liberty These arguments it will be observed have no reference to any part of the Roman Catholic theology It will also be observed that they ceased to have any force when the crown had been settled on a race of Protestant sovereigns and when the power of the House of Commons in the state had become so decidedly preponderant that no sovereign whatever might have been his opinions or his inclinations could have imitated the example of James The nation however after its terrors its struggles its narrow escape was in a suspicious and vindictive mood Means of defence therefore which necessity had once justified and which necessity alone could justify were obstinately used long after the necessity had ceased to exist and were not abandoned till vulgar prejudice had maintained a contest of many years against reason But in the time of James reason and vulgar prejudice were on the same side The fanatical and ignorant wished to exclude the Roman Catholic from office because he worshipped stocks and stones because he had the mark of the Beast because he had burned down London because he had strangled Sir Edmondsbury Godfrey and the most judicious and tolerant statesman while smiling at the delusions which imposed on the populace was led by a very different road to the same conclusion The great object of William now was to unite in one body the numerous sections of the community which regarded him as their common head In this work he had several able and trusty coadjutors among whom two were preeminently useful Burnet and Dykvelt The services of Burnet indeed it was necessary to employ with some caution The kindness with which he had been welcomed at the Hague had excited the rage of James Mary received from her father two letters filled with invectives against the insolent and seditious divine whom she protected But these accusations had so little effect on her that she sent back answers dictated by Burnet himself At length in January sixteen eighty seven the King had recourse to stronger measures Skelton who had represented the English government in the United Provinces was removed to Paris and was succeeded by Albeville the weakest and basest of all the members of the Jesuitical cabal Money was Albeville s one object and he took it from all who offered it He was paid at once by France and by Holland Nay he stooped below even the miserable dignity of corruption and accepted bribes so small that they seemed better suited to a porter or a lacquey than to an Envoy who had been honoured with an English baronetcy and a foreign marquisate On one occasion he pocketed very complacently a gratuity of fifty pistoles as the price of a service which he had rendered to the States General This man had it in charge to demand that Burnet should no longer be countenanced at the Hague William who was not inclined to part with a valuable friend answered at first with his usual coldness I am not aware sir that since the Doctor has been here he has done or said anything of which His Majesty can justly complain But James was peremptory the time for an open rupture had not arrived and it was necessary to give way During more than eighteen months Burnet never came into the presence of either the Prince or the Princess but he resided near them he was fully informed of all that was passing his advice was constantly asked his pen was employed on all important occasions and many of the sharpest and most effective tracts which about that time appeared in London were justly attributed to him The rage of James flamed high He had always been more than sufficiently prone to the angry passions But none of his enemies not even those who had conspired against his life not even those who had attempted by perjury to load him with the guilt of treason and assassination had ever been regarded by him with such animosity as he now felt for Burnet His Majesty railed daily at the Doctor in unkingly language and meditated plans of unlawful revenge Even blood would not slake that frantic hatred The insolent divine must be tortured before he was permitted to die Fortunately he was by birth a Scot and in Scotland before he was gibbeted in the Grassmarket his legs might be dislocated in the boot Proceedings were accordingly instituted against him at Edinburgh but he had been naturalised in Holland he had married a woman of fortune who was a native of that province and it was certain that his adopted country would not deliver him up It was therefore determined to kidnap him Ruffians were hired with great sums of money for this perilous and infamous service An order for three thousand pounds on this account was actually drawn up for signature in the office of the Secretary of State Lewis was apprised of the design and took a warm interest in it He would lend he said his best assistance to convey the villain to England and would undertake that the ministers of the vengeance of James should find a secure asylum in France Burnet was well aware of his danger but timidity was not among his faults He published a courageous answer to the charges which had been brought against him at Edinburgh He knew he said that it was intended to execute him without a trial but his trust was in the King of Kings to whom innocent blood would not cry in vain even against the mightiest princes of the earth He gave a farewell dinner to some friends and after the meal took solemn leave of them as a man who was doomed to death and with whom they could no longer safely converse Nevertheless he continued to show himself in all the public places of the Hague so boldly that his friends reproached him bitterly with his foolhardiness two hundred sixty three While Burnet was William s secretary for English affairs in Holland Dykvelt had been not less usefully employed in London Dykvelt was one of a remarkable class of public men who having been bred to politics in the noble school of John De Witt had after the fall of that great minister thought that they should best discharge their duty to the commonwealth by rallying round the Prince of Orange Of the diplomatists in the service of the United Provinces none was in dexterity temper and manners superior to Dykvelt In knowledge of English affairs none seems to have been his equal A pretence was found for despatching him early in the year sixteen eighty seven to England on a special mission with credentials from the States General But in truth his embassy was not to the government but to the opposition and his conduct was guided by private instructions which had been drawn by Burnet and approved by William two hundred sixty four Dykvelt reported that James was bitterly mortified by the conduct of the Prince and Princess My nephew s duty said the King is to strengthen my hands But he has always taken a pleasure in crossing me Dykvelt answered that in matters of private concern His Highness had shown and was ready to show the greatest deference to the King s wishes but that it was scarcely reasonable to expect the aid of a Protestant prince against the Protestant religion two hundred sixty five The King was silenced but not appeased He saw with ill humour which he could not disguise that Dykvelt was mustering and drilling all the various divisions of the opposition with a skill which would have been creditable to the ablest English statesman and which was marvellous in a foreigner The clergy were told that they would find the Prince a friend to episcopacy and to the Book of Common Prayer The Nonconformists were encouraged to expect from him not only toleration but also comprehension Even the Roman Catholics were conciliated and some of the most respectable among them declared to the King s face that they were satisfied with what Dykvelt proposed and that they would rather have a toleration secured by statute than an illegal and precarious ascendency two hundred sixty six The chiefs of all the important sections of the nation had frequent conferences in the presence of the dexterous Envoy At these meetings the sense of the Tory party was chiefly spoken by the Earls of Danby and Nottingham Though more than eight years had elapsed since Danby had fallen from power his name was still great among the old Cavaliers of England and many even of those Whigs who had formerly persecuted him were now disposed to admit that he had suffered for faults not his own and that his zeal for the prerogative though it had often misled him had been tempered by two feelings which did him honour zeal for the established religion and zeal for the dignity and independence of his country He was also highly esteemed at the Hague where it was never forgotten that he was the person who in spite of the influence of France and of the Papists had induced Charles to bestow the hand of the Lady Mary on her cousin Daniel Finch Earl of Nottingham a nobleman whose name will frequently recur in the history of three eventful reigns sprang from a family of unrivalled forensic eminence One of his kinsmen had borne the seal of Charles the First had prostituted eminent parts and learning to evil purposes and had been pursued by the vengeance of the Commons of England with Falkland at their head A more honourable renown had in the succeeding generation been obtained by Heneage Finch He had immediately after the Restoration been appointed Solicitor General He had subsequently risen to be Attorney General Lord Keeper Lord Chancellor Baron Finch and Earl of Nottingham Through this prosperous career he had always held the prerogative as high as he honestly or decently could but he had never been concerned in any machinations against the fundamental laws of the realm In the midst of a corrupt court he had kept his personal integrity unsullied He had enjoyed high fame as an orator though his diction formed on models anterior to the civil wars was towards the close of his life pronounced stiff and pedantic by the wits of the rising generation In Westminster Hall he is still mentioned with respect as the man who first educed out of the chaos anciently called by the name of equity a new system of jurisprudence as regular and complete as that which is administered by the judges of the Common Law two hundred sixty seven A considerable part of the moral and intellectual character of this great magistrate had descended with the title of Nottingham to his eldest son This son Earl Daniel was an honourable and virtuous man Though enslaved by some absurd prejudices and though liable to strange fits of caprice he cannot be accused of having deviated from the path of right in search either of unlawful gain or of unlawful pleasure Like his father he was a distinguished speaker impressive but prolix and too monotonously solemn The person of the orator was in perfect harmony with his oratory His attitude was rigidly erect his complexion so dark that he might have passed for a native of a warmer climate than ours and his harsh features were composed to an expression resembling that of a chief mourner at a funeral It was commonly said that he looked rather like a Spanish grandee than like an English gentleman The nicknames of Dismal Don Dismallo and Don Diego were fastened on him by jesters and are not yet forgotten He had paid much attention to the science by which his family had been raised to greatness and was for a man born to rank and wealth wonderfully well read in the laws of his country He was a devoted son of the Church and showed his respect for her in two ways not usual among those Lords who in his time boasted that they were her especial friends by writing tracts in defence of her dogmas and by shaping his private life according to her precepts Like other zealous churchmen he had till recently been a strenuous supporter of monarchical authority But to the policy which had been pursued since the suppression of the Western insurrection he was bitterly hostile and not the less so because his younger brother Heneage had been turned out of the office of Solicitor General for refusing to defend the King s dispensing power two hundred sixty eight With these two great Tory Earls was now united Halifax the accomplished chief of the Trimmers Over the mind of Nottingham indeed Halifax appears to have had at this time a great ascendency Between Halifax and Danby there was an enmity which began in the court of Charles and which at a later period disturbed the court of William but which like many other enmities remained suspended during the tyranny of James The foes frequently met in the councils held by Dykvelt and agreed in expressing dislike of the policy of the government and reverence for the Prince of Orange The different characters of the two statesmen appeared strongly in their dealings with the Dutch envoy Halifax showed an admirable talent for disquisition but shrank from coming to any bold and irrevocable decision Danby far less subtle and eloquent displayed more energy resolution and practical sagacity Several eminent Whigs were in constant communication with Dykvelt but the heads of the great houses of Cavendish and Russell could not take quite so active and prominent a part as might have been expected from their station and their opinions The fame and fortunes of Devonshire were at that moment under a cloud He had an unfortunate quarrel with the court arising not from a public and honourable cause but from a private brawl in which even his warmest friends could not pronounce him altogether blameless He had gone to Whitehall to pay his duty and had there been insulted by a man named Colepepper one of a set of bravoes who invested the perlieus of the court and who attempted to curry favour with the government by affronting members of the opposition The King himself expressed great indignation at the manner in which one of his most distinguished peers had been treated under the royal roof and Devonshire was pacified by an intimation that the offender should never again be admitted into the palace The interdict however was soon taken off The Earl s resentment revived His servants took up his cause Hostilities such as seemed to belong to a ruder age disturbed the streets of Westminster The time of the Privy Council was occupied by the criminations and recriminations of the adverse parties Colepepper s wife declared that she and her husband went in danger of their lives and that their house had been assaulted by ruffians in the Cavendish livery Devonshire replied that he had been fired at from Colepepper s windows This was vehemently denied A pistol it was owned loaded with gunpowder had been discharged But this had been done in a moment of terror merely for the purpose of alarming the Guards While this feud was at the height the Earl met Colepepper in the drawingroom at Whitehall and fancied that he saw triumph and defiance in the bully s countenance Nothing unseemly passed in the royal sight but as soon as the enemies had left the presence chamber Devonshire proposed that they should instantly decide their dispute with their swords The challenge was refused Then the high spirited peer forgot the respect which he owed to the place where he stood and to his own character and struck Colepepper in the face with a cane All classes agreed in condemning this act as most indiscreet and indecent nor could Devonshire himself when he had cooled think of it without vexation and shame The government however with its usual folly treated him so severely that in a short time the public sympathy was all on his side A criminal information was filed in the King s Bench The defendant took his stand on the privileges of the peerage but on this point a decision was promptly given against him nor is it possible to deny that the decision whether it were or were not according to the technical rules of English law was in strict conformity with the great principles on which all laws ought to be framed Nothing was then left to him but to plead guilty The tribunal had by successive dismissions been reduced to such complete subjection that the government which had instituted the prosecution was allowed to prescribe the punishment The judges waited in a body on Jeffreys who insisted that they should impose a fine of not less than thirty thousand pounds Thirty thousand pounds when compared with the revenues of the English grandees of that age may be considered as equivalent to a hundred and fifty thousand pounds in the nineteenth century In the presence of the Chancellor not a word of disapprobation was tittered but when the judges had retired Sir John Powell in whom all the little honesty of the bench was concentrated muttered that the proposed penalty was enormous and that one tenth part would be amply sufficient His brethren did not agree with him nor did he on this occasion show the courage by which on a memorable day some months later he signally retrieved his fame The Earl was accordingly condemned to a fine of thirty thousand pounds and to imprisonment till payment should be made Such a sum could not then be raised at a day s notice even by the greatest of the nobility The sentence of imprisonment however was more easily pronounced than executed Devonshire had retired to Chatsworth where he was employed in turning the old Gothic mansion of his family into an edifice worthy of Palladio The Peak was in those days almost as rude a district as Connemara now is and the Sheriff found or pretended that it was difficult to arrest the lord of so wild a region in the midst of a devoted household and tenantry Some days were thus gained but at last both the Earl and the Sheriff were lodged in prison Meanwhile a crowd of intercessors exerted their influence The story ran that the Countess Dowager of Devonshire had obtained admittance to the royal closet that she had reminded James how her brother in law the gallant Charles Cavendish had fallen at Gainsborough fighting for the crown and that she had produced notes written by Charles the First and Charles the Second in acknowledgment of great sums lent by her Lord during the civil troubles Those loans had never been repaid and with the interest amounted it was said to more even than the immense fine which the Court of King s Bench had imposed There was another consideration which seems to have had more weight with the King than the memory of former services It might be necessary to call a Parliament Whenever that event took place it was believed that Devonshire would bring a writ of error The point on which he meant to appeal from the judgment of the King s Bench related to the privileges of peerage The tribunal before which the appeal must come was the House of Peers On such an occasion the court could not be certain of the support even of the most courtly nobles There was little doubt that the sentence would be annulled and that by grasping at too much the government would lose all James was therefore disposed to a compromise Devonshire was informed that if he would give a bond for the whole fine and thus preclude himself from the advantage which he might derive from a writ of error he should be set at liberty Whether the bond should be enforced or not would depend on his subsequent conduct If he would support the dispensing power nothing would be exacted from him If he was bent on popularity he must pay thirty thousand pounds for it He refused during some time to consent to these terms but confinement was insupportable to him He signed the bond and was let out of prison but though he consented to lay this heavy burden on his estate nothing could induce him to promise that he would abandon his principles and his party He was still entrusted with all the secrets of the opposition but during some months his political friends thought it best for himself and for the cause that he should remain in the background two hundred sixty nine The Earl of Bedford had never recovered from the effects of the great calamity which four years before had almost broken his heart From private as well as from public feelings he was adverse to the court but he was not active in concerting measures against it His place in the meetings of the malecontents was supplied by his nephew This was the celebrated Edward Russell a man of undoubted courage and capacity but of loose principles and turbulent temper He was a sailor had distinguished himself in his profession and had in the late reign held an office in the palace But all the ties which bound him to the royal family had been sundered by the death of his cousin William The daring unquiet and vindictive seaman now sate in the councils called by the Dutch envoy as the representative of the boldest and most eager section of the opposition of those men who under the names of Roundheads Exclusionists and Whigs had maintained with various fortune a contest of five and forty years against three successive Kings This party lately prostrate and almost extinct but now again full of life and rapidly rising to ascendency was troubled by none of the scruples which still impeded the movements of Tories and Trimmers and was prepared to draw the sword against the tyrant on the first day on which the sword could be drawn with reasonable hope of success Three men are yet to be mentioned with whom Dykvelt was in confidential communication and by whose help he hoped to secure the good will of three great professions Bishop Compton was the agent employed to manage the clergy Admiral Herbert undertook to exert all his influence over the navy and an interest was established in the army by the instrumentality of Churchill The conduct of Compton and Herbert requires no explanation Having in all things secular served the crown with zeal and fidelity they had incurred the royal displeasure by refusing to be employed as tools for the destruction of their own religion Both of them had learned by experience how soon James forgot obligations and how bitterly he remembered what it pleased him to consider as wrongs The Bishop had by an illegal sentence been suspended from his episcopal functions The Admiral had in one hour been reduced from opulence to penury The situation of Churchill was widely different He had been raised by the royal bounty from obscurity to eminence and from poverty to wealth Having started in life a needy ensign he was now in his thirty seventh year a Major General a peer of Scotland a peer of England he commanded a troop of Life Guards he had been appointed to several honourable and lucrative offices and as yet there was no sign that he had lost any part of the favour to which he owed so much He was bound to James not only by the common obligations of allegiance but by military honour by personal gratitude and as appeared to superficial observers by the strongest ties of interest But Churchill himself was no superficial observer He knew exactly what his interest really was If his master were once at full liberty to employ Papists not a single Protestant would be employed For a time a few highly favoured servants of the crown might possibly be exempted from the general proscription in the hope that they would be induced to change their religion But even these would after a short respite fall one by one as Rochester had already fallen Churchill might indeed secure himself from this danger and might raise himself still higher in the royal favour by conforming to the Church of Rome and it might seem that one who was not less distinguished by avarice and baseness than by capacity and valour was not likely to be shocked at the thought of hearing amass But so inconsistent is human nature that there are tender spots even in seared consciences And thus this man who had owed his rise to his sister s dishonour who had been kept by the most profuse imperious and shameless of harlots and whose public life to those who can look steadily through the dazzling blaze of genius and glory will appear a prodigy of turpitude believed implicitly in the religion which he had learned as a boy and shuddered at the thought of formally abjuring it A terrible alternative was before him The earthly evil which he most dreaded was poverty The one crime from which his heart recoiled was apostasy And if the designs of the court succeeded he could not doubt that between poverty and apostasy he must soon make his choice He therefore determined to cross those designs and it soon appeared that there was no guilt and no disgrace which he was not ready to incur in order to escape from the necessity of parting either with his places or with his religion two hundred seventy It was not only as a military commander high in rank and distinguished by skill and courage that Churchill was able to render services to the opposition It was if not absolutely essential yet most important to the success of William s plans that his sister in law who in the order of succession to the English throne stood between his wife and himself should act in cordial union with him All his difficulties would have been greatly augmented if Anne had declared herself favourable to the Indulgence Which side she might take depended on the will of others For her understanding was sluggish and though there was latent in her character a hereditary wilfulness and stubbornness which many years later great power and great provocations developed she was as yet a willing slave to a nature far more vivacious and imperious than her own The person by whom she was absolutely governed was the wife of Churchill a woman who afterwards exercised a great influence on the fate of England and of Europe The name of this celebrated favourite was Sarah Jennings Her elder sister Frances had been distinguished by beauty and levity even among the crowd of beautiful faces and light characters which adorned and disgraced Whitehall during the wild carnival of the Restoration On one occasion Frances dressed herself like an orange girl and cried fruit about the streets two hundred seventy one Sober people predicted that a girl of so little discretion and delicacy would not easily find a husband She was however twice married and was now the wife of Tyrconnel Baron less regularly beautiful was perhaps more attractive Her face was expressive her form wanted no feminine charm and the profusion of her fine hair not yet disguised by powder according to that barbarous fashion which she lived to see introduced was the delight of numerous admirers Among the gallants who sued for her favour Colonel Churchill young handsome graceful insinuating eloquent and brave obtained the preference He must have been enamoured indeed For he had little property except the annuity which he had bought with the infamous wages bestowed on him by the Duchess of Cleveland he was insatiable of riches Sarah was poor and a plain girl with a large fortune was proposed to him His love after a struggle prevailed over his avarice marriage only strengthened his passion and to the last hour of his life Sarah enjoyed the pleasure and distinction of being the one human being who was able to mislead that farsighted and surefooted judgment who was fervently loved by that cold heart and who was servilely feared by that intrepid spirit In a worldly sense the fidelity of Churchill s love was amply rewarded His bride though slenderly portioned brought with her a dowry which judiciously employed made him at length a Duke of England a Prince of the Empire the captain general of a great coalition the arbiter between mighty princes and what he valued more the wealthiest subject in Europe She had been brought up from childhood with the Princess Anne and a close friendship had arisen between the girls In character they resembled each other very little Anne was slow and taciturn To those whom she loved she was meek The form which her anger assumed was sullenness She had a strong sense of religion and was attached even with bigotry to the rites and government of the Church of England Sarah was lively and voluble domineered over those whom she regarded with most kindness and when she was offended vented her rage in tears and tempestuous reproaches To sanctity she made no pretence and indeed narrowly escaped the imputation of irreligion She was not yet what she became when one class of vices had been fully developed in her by prosperity and another by adversity when her brain had been turned by success and flattery when her heart had been ulcerated by disasters and mortifications She lived to be that most odious and miserable of human beings an ancient crone at war with her whole kind at war with her own children and grandchildren great indeed and rich but valuing greatness and riches chiefly because they enabled her to brave public opinion and to indulge without restraint her hatred to the living and the dead In the reign of James she was regarded as nothing worse than a fine highspirited young woman who could now and then be cross and arbitrary but whose flaws of temper might well be pardoned in consideration of her charms It is a common observation that differences of taste understanding and disposition are no impediments to friendship and that the closest intimacies often exist between minds each of which supplies what is wanting to the other Lady Churchill was loved and even worshipped by Anne The Princess could not live apart from the object of her romantic fondness She married and was a faithful and even an affectionate wife But Prince George a dull man whose chief pleasures were derived from his dinner and his bottle acquired over her no influence comparable to that exercised by her female friend and soon gave himself up with stupid patience to the dominion of that vehement and commanding spirit by which his wife was governed Children were born to the royal pair and Anne was by no means without the feelings of a mother But the tenderness which she felt for her offspring was languid when compared with her devotion to the companion of her early years At length the Princess became impatient of the restraint which etiquette imposed on her She could not bear to hear the words Madam and Royal Highness from the lips of one who was more to her than a sister Such words were indeed necessary in the gallery or the drawingroom but they were disused in the closet Anne was missus Morley Lady Churchill was missus Freeman and under these childish names was carried on during twenty years a correspondence on which at last the fate of administrations and dynasties depended But as yet Anne had no political power and little patronage Her friend attended her as first Lady of the Bedchamber with a salary of only four hundred pounds a year There is reason however to believe that even at this time Churchill was able to gratify his ruling passion by means of his wife s influence The Princess though her income was large and her tastes simple contracted debts which her father not without some murmurs discharged and it was rumoured that her embarrassments had been caused by her prodigal bounty to her favourite two hundred seventy two At length the time had arrived when this singular friendship was to exercise a great influence on public affairs What part Anne would take in the contest which distracted England was matter of deep anxiety Filial duty was on one side The interests of the religion to which she was sincerely attached were on the other A less inert nature might well have remained long in suspense when drawn in opposite directions by motives so strong and so respectable But the influence of the Churchills decided the question and their patroness became an important member of that extensive league of which the Prince of Orange was the head In June sixteen eighty seven Dykvelt returned to the Hague He presented to the States General a royal epistle filled with eulogies of his conduct during his residence in London These eulogies however were merely formal James in private communications written with his own hand bitterly complained that the Envoy had lived in close intimacy with the most factious men in the realm and had encouraged them in all their evil purposes Dykvelt carried with him also a packet of letters from the most eminent of those with whom he had conferred during his stay in England The writers generally expressed unbounded reverence and affection for William and referred him to the bearer for fuller information as to their views Halifax discussed the state and prospects of the country with his usual subtlety and vivacity but took care not to pledge himself to any perilous line of conduct Danby wrote in a bolder and more determined tone and could not refrain from slily sneering at the fears and scruples of his accomplished rival But the most remarkable letter was from Churchill It was written with that natural eloquence which illiterate as he was he never wanted on great occasions and with an air of magnanimity which perfidious as he was he could with singular dexterity assume The Princess Anne he said had commanded him to assure her illustrious relatives at the Hague that she was fully resolved by God s help rather to lose her life than to be guilty of apostasy As for himself his places and the royal favour were as nothing to him in comparison with his religion He concluded by declaring in lofty language that though he could not pretend to have lived the life of a saint he should be found ready on occasion to die the death of a martyr two hundred seventy three Dykvelt s mission had succeeded so well that a pretence was soon found for sending another agent to continue the work which had been so auspiciously commenced The new Envoy afterwards the founder of a noble English house which became extinct in our own time was an illegitimate cousin german of William and bore a title taken from the lordship of Zulestein Zulestein s relationship to the House of Orange gave him importance in the public eye His bearing was that of a gallant soldier He was indeed in diplomatic talents and knowledge far inferior to Dykvelt but even this inferiority had its advantages A military man who had never appeared to trouble himself about political affairs could without exciting any suspicion hold with the English aristocracy an intercourse which if he had been a noted master of state craft would have been jealously watched Zulestein after a short absence returned to his country charged with letters and verbal messages not less important than those which had been entrusted to his predecessor A regular correspondence was from this time established between the Prince and the opposition Agents of various ranks passed and repassed between the Thames and the Hague Among these a Scotchman of some parts and great activity named Johnstone was the most useful He was cousin of Burnet and son of an eminent covenanter who had soon after the Restoration been put to death for treason and who was honoured by his party as a martyr The estrangement between the King of England and the Prince of Orange became daily more complete A serious dispute had arisen concerning the six British regiments which were in the pay of the United Provinces The King wished to put these regiments under the command of Roman Catholic officers The Prince resolutely opposed this design The King had recourse to his favourite commonplaces about toleration The Prince replied that he only followed his Majesty s example It was notorious that loyal and able men had been turned out of office in England merely for being Protestants It was then surely competent to the Stadtholder and the States General to withhold high public trusts from Papists This answer provoked James to such a degree that in his rage he lost sight of veracity and common sense It was false he vehemently said that he had ever turned out any body on religious grounds And if he had what was that to the Prince or to the States Were they his masters Were they to sit in judgment on the conduct of foreign sovereigns From that time he became desirous to recall his subjects who were in the Dutch service By bringing them over to England he should he conceived at once strengthen himself and weaken his worst enemies But there were financial difficulties which it was impossible for him to overlook The number of troops already in his service was as great as his revenue though large beyond all precedent and though parsimoniously administered would support If the battalions now in Holland were added to the existing establishment the Treasury would be bankrupt Perhaps Lewis might be induced to take them into his service They would in that case be removed from a country where they were exposed to the corrupting influence of a republican government and a Calvinistic worship and would be placed in a country where none ventured to dispute the mandates of the sovereign or the doctrines of the true Church The soldiers would soon unlearn every political and religious heresy Their native prince might always at short notice command their help and would on any emergency be able to rely on their fidelity A negotiation on this subject was opened between Whitehall and Versailles Lewis had as many soldiers as he wanted and had it been otherwise he would not have been disposed to take Englishmen into his service for the pay of England low as it must seem to our generation was much higher than the pay of France At the same time it was a great object to deprive William of so fine a brigade After some weeks of correspondence Barillon was authorised to promise that if James would recall the British troops from Holland Lewis would bear the charge of supporting two thousand of them in England This offer was accepted by James with warm expressions of gratitude Having made these arrangements he requested the States General to send back the six regiments The States General completely governed by William answered that such a demand in such circumstances was not authorised by the existing treaties and positively refused to comply It is remarkable that Amsterdam which had voted for keeping these troops in Holland when James needed their help against the Western insurgents now contended vehemently that his request ought to be granted On both occasions the sole object of those who ruled that great city was to cross the Prince of Orange two hundred seventy four The Dutch arms however were scarcely so formidable to James as the Dutch presses English books and pamphlets against his government were daily printed at the Hague nor could any vigilance prevent copies from being smuggled by tens of thousands into the counties bordering on the German Ocean Among these publications one was distinguished by its importance and by the immense effect which it produced The opinion which the Prince and Princess of Orange held respecting the Indulgence was well known to all who were conversant with public affairs But as no official announcement of that opinion had appeared many persons who had not access to good private sources of information were deceived or perplexed by the confidence with which the partisans of the Court asserted that their Highnesses approved of the King s late acts To contradict those assertions publicly would have been a simple and obvious course if the sole object of William had been to strengthen his interest in England But he considered England chiefly as an instrument necessary to the execution of his great European design Towards that design he hoped to obtain the cooperation of both branches of the House of Austria of the Italian princes and even of the Sovereign Pontiff There was reason to fear that any declaration which was satisfactory to British Protestants would excite alarm and disgust at Madrid Vienna Turin and Rome For this reason the Prince long abstained from formally expressing his sentiments At length it was represented to him that his continued silence had excited much uneasiness and distrust among his wellwishers and that it was time to speak out He therefore determined to explain himself A Scotch Whig named James Stewart had fled some years before to Holland in order to avoid the boot and the gallows and had become intimate with the Grand Pensionary Fagel who enjoyed a large share of the Stadtholder s confidence and favour By Stewart had been drawn up the violent and acrimonious manifesto of Argyle When the Indulgence appeared Stewart conceived that he had an opportunity of obtaining not only pardon but reward He offered his services to the government of which he had been the enemy they were accepted and he addressed to Fagel a letter purporting to have been written by the direction of James In that letter the Pensionary was exhorted to use all his influence with the Prince and Princess for the purpose of inducing them to support their father s policy After some delay Fagel transmitted a reply deeply meditated and drawn up with exquisite art No person who studies that remarkable document can fail to perceive that though it is framed in a manner well calculated to reassure and delight English Protestants it contains not a word which could give offence even at the Vatican It was announced that William and Mary would with pleasure assist in abolishing every law which made any Englishman liable to punishment for his religious opinions But between punishments and disabilities a distinction was taken To admit Roman Catholics to office would in the judgment of their Highnesses be neither for the general interest of England nor even for the interest of the Roman Catholics themselves This manifesto was translated into several languages and circulated widely on the Continent Of the English version carefully prepared by Burnet near fifty thousand copies were introduced into the eastern shires and rapidly distributed over the whole kingdom No state paper was ever more completely successful The Protestants of our island applauded the manly firmness with which William declared that he could not consent to entrust Papists with any share in the government The Roman Catholic princes on the other hand were pleased by the mild and temperate style in which his resolution was expressed and by the hope which he held out that under his administration no member of their Church would be molested on account of religion It is probable that the Pope himself was among those who read this celebrated letter with pleasure He had some months before dismissed Castelmaine in a manner which showed little regard for the feelings of Castelmaine s master Innocent thoroughly disliked the whole domestic and foreign policy of the English government He saw that the unjust and impolitic measures of the Jesuitical cabal were far more likely to make the penal laws perpetual than to bring about an abolition of the test His quarrel with the court of Versailles was every day becoming more and more serious nor could he either in his character of temporal prince or in his character of Sovereign Pontiff feel cordial friendship for a vassal of that court Castelmaine was ill qualified to remove these disgusts He was indeed well acquainted with Rome and was for a layman deeply read in theological controversy two hundred seventy five But he had none of the address which his post required and even had he been a diplomatist of the greatest ability there was a circumstance which would have disqualified him for the particular mission on which he had been sent He was known all over Europe as the husband of the most shameless of women and he was known in no other way It was impossible to speak to him or of him without remembering in what manner the very title by which he was called had been acquired This circumstance would have mattered little if he had been accredited to some dissolute court such as that in which the Marchioness of Montespan had lately been dominant But there was an obvious impropriety in sending him on an embassy rather of a spiritual than of a secular nature to a pontiff of primitive austerity The Protestants all over Europe sneered and Innocent already unfavourably disposed to the English government considered the compliment which had been paid him at so much risk and at so heavy a cost as little better than an affront The salary of the Ambassador was fixed at a hundred pounds a week Castelmaine complained that this was too little Thrice the sum he said would hardly suffice For at Rome the ministers of all the great continental powers exerted themselves to surpass one another in splendour under the eyes of a people whom the habit of seeing magnificent buildings decorations and ceremonies had made fastidious He always declared that he had been a loser by his mission He was accompanied by several young gentlemen of the best Roman Catholic families in England Ratcliffes Arundells and Tichbornes At Rome he was lodged in the palace of the house of Pamfili on the south of the stately Place of Navona He was early admitted to a private interview with Innocent but the public audience was long delayed Indeed Castelmaine s preparations for that great occasion were so sumptuous that though commenced at Easter sixteen eighty six they were not complete till the following November and in November the Pope had or pretended to have an attack of gout which caused another postponement In January sixteen eighty seven at length the solemn introduction and homage were performed with unusual pomp The state coaches which had been built at Rome for the pageant were so superb that they were thought worthy to be transmitted to posterity in fine engravings and to be celebrated by poets in several languages two hundred seventy six The front of the Ambassador s palace was decorated on this great day with absurd allegorical paintings of gigantic size There was Saint George with his foot on the neck of Titus Cares and Hercules with his club crushing College the Protestant joiner who in vain attempted to defend himself with his flail After this public appearance Castelmaine invited all the persons of note then assembled at Rome to a banquet in that gay and splendid gallery which is adorned with paintings of subjects from the Aeneid by Peter of Cortona The whole city crowded to the show and it was with difficulty that a company of Swiss guards could keep order among the spectators The nobles of the Pontifical state in return gave costly entertainments to the Ambassador and poets and wits were employed to lavish on him and on his master insipid and hyperbolical adulation such as flourishes most when genius and taste are in the deepest decay Foremost among the flatterers was a crowned head More than thirty years had elapsed since Christina the daughter of the great Gustavus had voluntarily descended from the Swedish throne After long wanderings in the course of which she had committed many follies and crimes she had finally taken up her abode at Rome where she busied herself with astrological calculations and with the intrigues of the conclave and amused herself with pictures gems manuscripts and medals She now composed some Italian stanzas in honour of the English prince who sprung like herself from a race of Kings heretofore regarded as the champions of the Reformation had like herself been reconciled to the ancient Church A splendid assembly met in her palace Her verses set to music were sung with universal applause and one of her literary dependents pronounced an oration on the same subject in a style so florid that it seems to have offended the taste of the English hearers The Jesuits hostile to the Pope devoted to the interests of France and disposed to pay every honour to James received the English embassy with the utmost pomp in that princely house where the remains of Ignatius Loyola lie enshrined in lazulite and gold Sculpture painting poetry and eloquence were employed to compliment the strangers but all these arts had sunk into deep degeneracy There was a great display of turgid and impure Latinity unworthy of so erudite an order and some of the inscriptions which adorned the walls had a fault more serious than even a bad style It was said in one place that James had sent his brother as his messenger to heaven and in another that James had furnished the wings with which his brother had soared to a higher region There was a still more unfortunate distich which at the time attracted little notice but which a few months later was remembered and malignantly interpreted O King said the poet cease to sigh for a son Though nature may refuse your wish the stars will find a way to grant it In the midst of these festivities Castelmaine had to suffer cruel mortifications and humiliations The Pope treated him with extreme coldness and reserve As often as the Ambassador pressed for an answer to the request which he had been instructed to make in favour of Petre Innocent was taken with a violent fit of coughing which put an end to the conversation The fame of these singular audiences spread over Rome Pasquin was not silent All the curious and tattling population of the idlest of cities the Jesuits and the prelates of the French faction only excepted laughed at Castelmaine s discomfiture His temper naturally unamiable was soon exasperated to violence and he circulated a memorial reflecting on the Pope He had now put himself in the wrong The sagacious Italian had got the advantage and took care to keep it He positively declared that the rule which excluded Jesuits from ecclesiastical preferment should not be relaxed in favour of Father Petre Castelmaine much provoked threatened to leave Rome Innocent replied with a meek impertinence which was the more provoking because it could scarcely be distinguished from simplicity that his Excellency might go if he liked But if we must lose him added the venerable Pontiff I hope that he will take care of his health on the road English people do not know how dangerous it is in this country to travel in the heat of the day The best way is to start before dawn and to take some rest at noon With this salutary advice and with a string of beads the unfortunate Ambassador was dismissed In a few months appeared both in the Italian and in the English tongue a pompous history of the mission magnificently printed in folio and illustrated with plates The frontispiece to the great scandal of all Protestants represented Castelmaine in the robes of a Peer with his coronet in his hand kissing

himself a Roman Catholic Trial of the Bishops The Verdict Joy of the People Peculiar State of Public Feeling at this Time THE marked discourtesy of the Pope might well have irritated the meekest of princes But the only effect which it produced on James was to make him more lavish of caresses and compliments While Castelmaine his whole soul festered with angry passions was on his road back to England the Nuncio was loaded with honours which his own judgment would have led him to reject He had by a fiction often used in the Church of Rome been lately raised to the episcopal dignity without having the charge of any see He was called Archbishop of Amasia a city of Pontus the birthplace of Strabo and Mithridates James insisted that the ceremony of consecration should be performed in the chapel of Saint James s Palace The Vicar Apostolic Leyburn and two Irish prelates officiated The doors were thrown open to the public and it was remarked that some of those Puritans who had recently turned courtiers were among the spectators In the evening Adda wearing the robes of his new office joined the circle in the Queen s apartments James fell on his knees in the presence of the whole court and implored a blessing In spite of the restraint imposed by etiquette the astonishment and disgust of the bystanders could not be concealed two hundred seventy eight It was long indeed since an English sovereign had knelt to mortal man and those who saw the strange sight could not but think of that day of shame when John did homage for his crown between the hands of Pandolph In a short time a still more ostentatious pageant was performed in honour of the Holy See It was determined that the Nuncio should go to court in solemn procession Some persons on whose obedience the King had counted showed on this occasion for the first time signs of a mutinous spirit Among these the most conspicuous was the second temporal peer of the realm Charles Seymour commonly called the proud Duke of Somerset He was in truth a man in whom the pride of birth and rank amounted almost to a disease The fortune which he had inherited was not adequate to the high place which he held among the English aristocracy but he had become possessed of the greatest estate in England by his marriage with the daughter and heiress of the last Percy who wore the ancient coronet of Northumberland Somerset was only in his twenty fifth year and was very little known to the public He was a Lord of the King s Bedchamber and colonel of one of the regiments which had been raised at the time of the Western insurrection He had not scrupled to carry the sword of state into the royal chapel on days of festival but he now resolutely refused to swell the pomp of the Nuncio Some members of his family implored him not to draw on himself the royal displeasure but their intreaties produced no effect The King himself expostulated I thought my Lord said he that I was doing you a great honour in appointing you to escort the minister of the first of all crowned heads Sir said the Duke I am advised that I cannot obey your Majesty without breaking the law I will make you fear me as well as the law answered the King insolently Do you not know that I am above the law Your Majesty may be above the law replied Somerset but I am not and while I obey the law I fear nothing The King turned away in high displeasure and Somerset was instantly dismissed from his posts in the household and in the army two hundred seventy nine On one point however James showed some prudence He did not venture to parade the Papal Envoy in state before the vast population of the capital The ceremony was performed on the third of July sixteen eighty seven at Windsor Great multitudes flocked to the little town The visitors were so numerous that there was neither food nor lodging for them and many persons of quality sate the whole day in their carriages waiting for the exhibition At length late in the afternoon the Knight Marshal s men appeared on horseback Then came a long train of running footmen and then in a royal coach appeared Adda robed in purple with a brilliant cross on his breast He was followed by the equipages of the principal courtiers and ministers of state In his train the crowd recognised with disgust the arms and liveries of Crewe Bishop of Durham and of Cartwright Bishop of Chester two hundred eighty On the following day appeared in the Gazette a proclamation dissolving that Parliament which of all the fifteen Parliaments held by the Stuarts had been the most obsequious two hundred eighty one Meanwhile new difficulties had arisen in Westminster Hall Only a few months had elapsed since some Judges had been turned out and others put in for the purpose of obtaining a decision favourable to the crown in the case of Sir Edward Hales and already fresh changes were necessary The King had scarcely formed that army on which he chiefly depended for the accomplishing of his designs when he found that he could not himself control it When war was actually raging in the kingdom a mutineer or a deserter might be tried by a military tribunal and executed by the Provost Marshal But there was now profound peace The common law of England having sprung up in an age when all men bore arms occasionally and none constantly recognised no distinction in time of peace between a soldier and any other subject nor was there any Act resembling that by which the authority necessary for the government of regular troops is now annually confided to the Sovereign Some old statutes indeed made desertion felony in certain specified cases But those statutes were applicable only to soldiers serving the King in actual war and could not without the grossest disingenuousness be so strained as to include the case of a man who in a time of profound tranquillity at home and abroad should become tired of the camp at Hounslow and should go back to his native village The government appears to have had no hold on such a man except the hold which master bakers and master tailors have on their journeymen He and his officers were in the eye of the law on a level If he swore at them he might be fined for an oath If he struck them he might be prosecuted for assault and battery In truth the regular army was under less restraint than the militia For the militia was a body established by an Act of Parliament and it had been provided by that Act that slight punishments might be summarily inflicted for breaches of discipline It does not appear that during the reign of Charles the Second the practical inconvenience arising from this state of the law had been much felt The explanation may perhaps be that till the last year of his reign the force which he maintained in England consisted chiefly of household troops whose pay was so high that dismission from the service would have been felt by most of them as a great calamity The stipend of a private in the Life Guards was a provision for the younger son of a gentleman Even the Foot Guards were paid about as high as manufacturers in a prosperous season and were therefore in a situation which the great body of the labouring population might regard with envy The return of the garrison of Tangier and the raising of the new regiments had made a great change There were now in England many thousands of soldiers each of whom received only eightpence a day The dread of dismission was not sufficient to keep them to their duty and corporal punishment their officers could not legally inflict James had therefore one plain choice before him to let his army dissolve itself or to induce the judges to pronounce that the law was what every barrister in the Temple knew that it was not It was peculiarly important to secure the cooperation of two courts the court of King s Bench which was the first criminal tribunal in the realm and the court of gaol delivery which sate at the Old Bailey and which had jurisdiction over offences committed in the capital In both these courts there were great difficulties Herbert Chief Justice of the King s Bench servile as he had hitherto been would go no further Resistance still more sturdy was to be expected from Sir John Holt who as Recorder of the City of London occupied the bench at the Old Bailey Holt was an eminently learned and clear headed lawyer he was an upright and courageous man and though he had never been factious his political opinions had a tinge of Whiggism All obstacles however disappeared before the royal will Holt was turned out of the recordership Herbert and another Judge were removed from the King s Bench and the vacant places were filled by persons in whom the government could confide It was indeed necessary to go very low down in the legal profession before men could be found willing to render such services as were now required The new Chief justice Sir Robert Wright was ignorant to a proverb yet ignorance was not his worst fault His vices had ruined him He had resorted to infamous ways of raising money and had on one occasion made a false affidavit in order to obtain possession of five hundred pounds Poor dissolute and shameless he had become one of the parasites of Jeffreys who promoted him and insulted him Such was the man who was now selected by James to be Lord Chief justice of England One Richard Allibone who was even more ignorant of the law than Wright and who as a Roman Catholic was incapable of holding office was appointed a puisne judge of the King s Bench Sir Bartholomew Shower equally notorious as a servile Tory and a tedious orator became Recorder of London When these changes had been made several deserters were brought to trial They were convicted in the face of the letter and of the spirit of the law Some received sentence of death at the bar of the King s Bench some at the Old Bailey They were hanged in sight of the regiments to which they had belonged and care was taken that the executions should be announced in the London Gazette which very seldom noticed such events two hundred eighty two It may well be believed that the law so grossly insulted by courts which derived from it all their authority and which were in the habit of looking to it as their guide would be little respected by a tribunal which had originated in tyrannical caprice The new High Commission had during the first months of its existence merely inhibited clergymen from exercising spiritual functions The rights of property had remained untouched But early in the year sixteen eighty seven it was determined to strike at freehold interests and to impress on every Anglican priest and prelate the conviction that if he refused to lend his aid for the purpose of destroying the Church of which he was a minister he would in an hour be reduced to beggary It would have been prudent to try the first experiment on some obscure individual But the government was under an infatuation such as in a more simple age would have been called judicial War was therefore at once declared against the two most venerable corporations of the realm the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge The power of those bodies has during many ages been great but it was at the height during the latter part of the seventeenth century None of the neighbouring countries could boast of such splendid and opulent seats of learning The schools of Edinburgh and Glasgow of Leyden and Utrecht of Louvain and Leipzig of Padua and Bologna seemed mean to scholars who had been educated in the magnificent foundations of Wykeham and Wolsey of Henry the Sixth and Henry the Eighth Literature and science were in the academical system of England surrounded with pomp armed with magistracy and closely allied with all the most august institutions of the state To be the Chancellor of an University was a distinction eagerly sought by the magnates of the realm To represent an University in Parliament was a favourite object of the ambition of statesmen Nobles and even princes were proud to receive from an University the privilege of wearing the doctoral scarlet The curious were attracted to the Universities by ancient buildings rich with the tracery of the middle ages by modern buildings which exhibited the highest skill of Jones and Wren by noble halls and chapels by museums by botanical gardens and by the only great public libraries which the kingdom then contained The state which Oxford especially displayed on solemn occasions rivalled that of sovereign princes When her Chancellor the venerable Duke of Ormond sate in his embroidered mantle on his throne under the painted ceiling of the Sheldonian theatre surrounded by hundreds of graduates robed according to their rank while the noblest youths of England were solemnly presented to him as candidates for academical honours he made an appearance scarcely less regal than that which his master made in the Banqueting House of Whitehall At the Universities had been formed the minds of almost all the eminent clergymen lawyers physicians wits poets and orators of the land and of a large proportion of the nobility and of the opulent gentry It is also to be observed that the connection between the scholar and the school did not terminate with his residence He often continued to be through life a member of the academical body and to vote as such at all important elections He therefore regarded his old haunts by the Cam and the Isis with even more than the affection which educated men ordinarily feel for the place of their education There was no corner of England in which both Universities had not grateful and zealous sons Any attack on the honour or interests of either Cambridge or Oxford was certain to excite the resentment of a powerful active and intelligent class scattered over every county from Northumberland to Cornwall The resident graduates as a body were perhaps not superior positively to the resident graduates of our time but they occupied a far higher position as compared with the rest of the community For Cambridge and Oxford were then the only two provincial towns in the kingdom in which could be found a large number of men whose understandings had been highly cultivated Even the capital felt great respect for the authority of the Universities not only on questions of divinity of natural philosophy and of classical antiquity but also on points on which capitals generally claim the right of deciding in the last resort From Will s coffee house and from the pit of the theatre royal in Drury Lane an appeal lay to the two great national seats of taste and learning Plays which had been enthusiastically applauded in London were not thought out of danger till they had undergone the more severe judgment of audiences familiar with Sophocles and Terence two hundred eighty three The great moral and intellectual influence of the English Universities had been strenuously exerted on the side of the crown The head quarters of Charles the First had been at Oxford and the silver tankards and salvers of all the colleges had been melted down to supply his military chest Cambridge was not less loyally disposed She had sent a large part of her plate to the royal camp and the rest would have followed had not the town been seized by the troops of the Parliament Both Universities had been treated with extreme severity by the victorious Puritans Both had hailed the restoration with delight Both had steadily opposed the Exclusion Bill Both had expressed the deepest horror at the Rye House Plot Cambridge had not only deposed her Chancellor Monmouth but had marked her abhorrence of his treason in a manner unworthy of a scat of learning by committing to the flames the canvass on which his pleasing face and figure had been portrayed by the utmost skill of Kneller two hundred eighty four Oxford which lay nearer to the Western insurgents had given still stronger proofs of loyalty The students under the sanction of their preceptors had taken arms by hundreds in defence of hereditary right Such were the bodies which James now determined to insult and plunder in direct defiance of the laws and of his plighted faith Several Acts of Parliament as clear as any that were to be found in the statute book had provided that no person should be admitted to any degree in either University without taking the oath of supremacy and another oath of similar character called the oath of obedience Nevertheless in February sixteen eighty seven a royal letter was sent to Cambridge directing that a Benedictine monk named Alban Francis should be admitted a Master of Arts The academical functionaries divided between reverence for the King and reverence for the law were in great distress Messengers were despatched in all haste to the Duke of Albemarle who had succeeded Monmouth as Chancellor of the University He was requested to represent the matter properly to the King Meanwhile the Registrar and Bedells waited on Francis and informed him that if he would take the oaths according to law he should be instantly admitted He refused to be sworn remonstrated with the officers of the University on their disregard of the royal mandate and finding them resolute took horse and hastened to relate his grievances at Whitehall The heads of the colleges now assembled in council The best legal opinions were taken and were decidedly in favour of the course which had been pursued But a second letter from Sunderland in high and menacing terms was already on the road Albemarle informed the University with many expressions of concern that he had done his best but that he had been coldly and ungraciously received by the King The academical body alarmed by the royal displeasure and conscientiously desirous to meet the royal wishes but determined not to violate the clear law of the land submitted the humblest and most respectful explanations but to no purpose In a short time came down a summons citing the Vicechancellor and the Senate to appear before the new High Commission at Westminster on the twenty first of April The Vicechancellor was to attend in person the Senate which consists of all the Doctors and Masters of the University was to send deputies When the appointed day arrived a great concourse filled the Council chamber Jeffreys sate at the head of the board Rochester since the white staff had been taken from him was no longer a member In his stead appeared the Lord Chamberlain John Sheffield Earl of Mulgrave The fate of this nobleman has in one respect resembled the fate of his colleague Sprat Mulgrave wrote verses which scarcely ever rose above absolute mediocrity but as he was a man of high note in the political and fashionable world these verses found admirers Time dissolved the charm but unfortunately for him not until his lines had acquired a prescriptive right to a place in all collections of the works of English poets To this day accordingly his insipid essays in rhyme and his paltry songs to Amoretta and Gloriana are reprinted in company with Comus and Alexander s Feast The consequence is that our generation knows Mulgrave chiefly as a poetaster and despises him as such In truth however he was by the acknowledgment of those who neither loved nor esteemed him a man distinguished by fine parts and in parliamentary eloquence inferior to scarcely any orator of his time His moral character was entitled to no respect He was a libertine without that openness of heart and hand which sometimes makes libertinism amiable and a haughty aristocrat without that elevation of sentiment which sometimes makes aristocratical haughtiness respectable The satirists of the age nicknamed him Lord Allpride Yet was his pride compatible with all ignoble vices Many wondered that a man who had so exalted a sense of his dignity could be so hard and niggardly in all pecuniary dealings He had given deep offence to the royal family by venturing to entertain the hope that he might win the heart and hand of the Princess Anne Disappointed in this attempt he had exerted himself to regain by meanness the favour which he had forfeited by presumption His epitaph written by himself still informs all who pass through Westminster Abbey that he lived and died a sceptic in religion and we learn from the memoirs which he wrote that one of his favourite subjects of mirth was the Romish superstition Yet he began as soon as James was on the throne to express a strong inclination towards Popery and at length in private affected to be a convert This abject hypocrisy had been rewarded by a place in the Ecclesiastical Commission two hundred eighty five Before that formidable tribunal now appeared the Vicechancellor of the University of Cambridge Doctor John Pechell He was a man of no great ability or vigour but he was accompanied by eight distinguished academicians elected by the Senate One of these was Isaac Newton Fellow of Trinity College and Professor of mathematics His genius was then in the fullest vigour The great work which entitles him to the highest place among the geometricians and natural philosophers of all ages and of all nations had been some time printing under the sanction of the Royal Society and was almost ready for publication He was the steady friend of civil liberty and of the Protestant religion but his habits by no means fitted him for the conflicts of active life He therefore stood modestly silent among the delegates and left to men more versed in practical business the task of pleading the cause of his beloved University Never was there a clearer case The law was express The practice had been almost invariably in conformity with the law It might perhaps have happened that on a day of great solemnity when many honorary degrees were conferred a person who had not taken the oaths might have passed in the crowd But such an irregularity the effect of mere haste and inadvertence could not be cited as a precedent Foreign ambassadors of various religions and in particular one Mussulman had been admitted without the oaths But it might well be doubted whether such cases fell within the reason and spirit of the Acts of Parliament It was not even pretended that any person to whom the oaths had been tendered and who had refused them had ever taken a degree and this was the situation in which Francis stood The delegates offered to prove that in the late reign several royal mandates had been treated as nullities because the persons recommended had not chosen to qualify according to law and that on such occasions the government had always acquiesced in the propriety of the course taken by the University But Jeffreys would hear nothing He soon found out that the Vice chancellor was weak ignorant and timid and therefore gave a loose to all that insolence which had long been the terror of the Old Bailey The unfortunate Doctor unaccustomed to such a presence and to such treatment was soon harassed and scared into helpless agitation When other academicians who were more capable of defending their cause attempted to speak they were rudely silenced You are not Vicechancellor When you are you may talk Till then it will become you to hold your peace The defendants were thrust out of the court without a hearing In a short time they were called in again and informed that the Commissioners had determined to deprive Pechell of the Vicechancellorship and to suspend him from all the emoluments to which he was entitled as Master of a college emoluments which were strictly of the nature of freehold property As for you said Jeffreys to the delegates most of you are divines I will therefore send you home with a text of scripture Go your way and sin no more lest a worse thing happen to you two hundred eighty six These proceedings might seem sufficiently unjust and violent But the King had already begun to treat Oxford with such rigour that the rigour shown towards Cambridge might by comparison be called lenity Already University College had been turned by Obadiah Walker into a Roman Catholic seminary Already Christ Church was governed by a Roman Catholic Dean Mass was already said daily in both those colleges The tranquil and majestic city so long the stronghold of monarchical principles was agitated by passions which it had never before known The undergraduates with the connivance of those who were in authority over them hooted the members of Walker s congregation and chanted satirical ditties under his windows Some fragments of the serenades which then disturbed the High Street have been preserved The burden of one ballad was this Old Obadiah Sings Ave Maria When the actors came down to Oxford the public feeling was expressed still more strongly Howard s Committee was performed This play written soon after the Restoration exhibited the Puritans in an odious and contemptible light and had therefore been during a quarter of a century a favourite with Oxonian audiences It was now a greater favourite than ever for by a lucky coincidence one of the most conspicuous characters was an old hypocrite named Obadiah The audience shouted with delight when in the last scene Obadiah was dragged in with a halter round his neck and the acclamations redoubled when one of the players departing from the written text of the comedy proclaimed that Obadiah should be hanged because he had changed his religion The King was much provoked by this insult So mutinous indeed was the temper of the University that one of the newly raised regiments the same which is now called the Second Dragoon Guards was quartered at Oxford for the purpose of preventing an outbreak two hundred eighty seven These events ought to have convinced James that he had entered on a course which must lead him to his ruin To the clamours of London he had been long accustomed They had been raised against him sometimes unjustly and sometimes vainly He had repeatedly braved them and might brave them still But that Oxford the scat of loyalty the head quarters of the Cavalier army the place where his father and brother had held their court when they thought themselves insecure in their stormy capital the place where the writings of the great republican teachers had recently been committed to the flames should now be in a ferment of discontent that those highspirited youths who a few months before had eagerly volunteered to march against the Western insurgents should now be with difficulty kept down by sword and carbine these were signs full of evil omen to the House of Stuart The warning however was lost on the dull stubborn self willed tyrant He was resolved to transfer to his own Church all the wealthiest and most splendid foundations of England It was to no purpose that the best and wisest of his Roman Catholic counsellors remonstrated They represented to him that he had it in his power to render a great service to the cause of his religion without violating the rights of property A grant of two thousand pounds a year from his privy purse would support a Jesuit college at Oxford Such a sum he might easily spare Such a college provided with able learned and zealous teachers would be a formidable rival to the old academical institutions which exhibited but too many symptoms of the languor almost inseparable from opulence and security King James s College would soon be by the confession even of Protestants the first place of education in the island as respected both science and moral discipline This would be the most effectual and the least invidious method by which the Church of England could be humbled and the Church of Rome exalted The Earl of Ailesbury one of the most devoted servants of the royal family declared that though a Protestant and by no means rich he would himself contribute a thousand pounds towards this design rather than that his master should violate the rights of property and break faith with the Established Church two hundred eighty eight The scheme however found no favour in the sight of the King It was indeed ill suited in more ways than one to his ungentle nature For to bend and break the spirits of men gave him pleasure and to part with his money gave him pain What he had not the generosity to do at his own expense he determined to do at the expense of others When once he was engaged pride and obstinacy prevented him from receding and he was at length led step by step to acts of Turkish tyranny to acts which impressed the nation with a conviction that the estate of a Protestant English freeholder under a Roman Catholic King must be as insecure as that of a Greek under Moslem domination Magdalene College at Oxford founded in the fifteenth century by William of Waynflete Bishop of Winchester and Lord High Chancellor was one of the most remarkable of our academical institutions A graceful tower on the summit of which a Latin hymn was annually chanted by choristers at the dawn of May day caught far off the eye of the traveller who came from London As he approached he found that this tower rose from an embattled pile low and irregular yet singularly venerable which embowered in verdure overhung the slugish waters of the Cherwell He passed through a gateway overhung by a noble orie two hundred eighty nine and found himself in a spacious cloister adorned with emblems of virtues and vices rudely carved in grey stone by the masons of the fifteenth century The table of the society was plentifully spread in a stately refectory hung with paintings and rich with fantastic carving The service of the Church was performed morning and evening in a chapel which had suffered much violence from the Reformers and much from the Puritans but which was under every disadvantage a building of eminent beauty and which has in our own time been restored with rare taste and skill The spacious gardens along the river side were remarkable for the size of the trees among which towered conspicuous one of the vegetable wonders of the island a gigantic oak older by a century men said than the oldest college in the University The statutes of the society ordained that the Kings of England and Princes of Wales should be lodged in Magdalene Edward the Fourth had inhabited the building while it was still unfinished Richard the Third had held his court there had heard disputations in the hall had feasted there royally and had mended the cheer of his hosts by a present of fat bucks from his forests Two heirs apparent of the crown who had been prematurely snatched away Arthur the elder brother of Henry the Eighth and Henry the elder brother of Charles the First had been members of the college Another prince of the blood the last and best of the Roman Catholic Archbishops of Canterbury the gentle Reginald Pole had studied there In the time of the civil war Magdalene had been true to the cause of the crown There Rupert had fixed his quarters and before some of his most daring enterprises his trumpets had been heard sounding to horse through those quiet cloisters Most of the Fellows were divines and could aid the King only by their prayers and their pecuniary contributions But one member of the body a Doctor of Civil Law raised a troop of undergraduates and fell fighting bravely at their head against the soldiers of Essex When hostilities had terminated and the Roundheads were masters of England six sevenths of the members of the foundation refused to make any submission to usurped authority They were consequently ejected from their dwellings and deprived of their revenues After the Restoration the survivors returned to their pleasant abode They had now been succeeded by a new generation which inherited their opinions and their spirit During the Western rebellion such Magdalene men as were not disqualified by their age or profession for the use of arms had eagerly volunteered to fight for the crown It would be difficult to name any corporation in the kingdom which had higher claims to the gratitude of the House of Stuart two hundred ninety The society consisted of a President of forty Fellows of thirty scholars called Demies and of a train of chaplains clerks and choristers At the time of the general visitation in the reign of Henry the Eighth the revenues were far greater than those of any similar institution in the realm greater by nearly one half than those of the magnificent foundation of Henry the Sixth at Cambridge and considerably more than double those which William of Wykeham had settled on his college at Oxford In the days of James the Second the riches of Magdalene were immense and were exaggerated by report The college was popularly said to be wealthier than the wealthiest abbeys of the Continent When the leases fell in so ran the vulgar rumour the rents would be raised to the prodigious sum of forty thousand pounds a year two hundred ninety one The Fellows were by the statutes which their founder had drawn up empowered to select their own President from among persons who were or had been Fellows either of their society or of New College This power had generally been exercised with freedom But in some instances royal letters had been received recommending to the choice of the corporation qualified persons who were in favour at court and on such occasions it had been the practice to show respect to the wishes of the sovereign In March sixteen eighty seven the President of the college died One of the Fellows Doctor Thomas Smith popularly nicknamed Rabbi Smith a distinguished traveller book collector antiquary and orientalist who had been chaplain to the embassy at Constantinople and had been employed to collate the Alexandrian manuscript aspired to the vacant post He conceived that he had some claims on the favour of the government as a man of learning and as a zealous Tory His loyalty was in truth as fervent and as steadfast as was to be found in the whole Church of England He had long been intimately acquainted with Parker Bishop of Oxford and hoped to obtain by the interest of that prelate a royal letter to the college Parker promised to do his best but soon reported that he had found difficulties The King he said will recommend no person who is not a friend to His Majesty s religion What can you do to pleasure him as to that matter Smith answered that if he became President he would exert himself to promote learning true Christianity and loyalty That will not do said the Bishop If so said Smith manfully let who will be President I can promise nothing more The election had been fixed for the thirteenth of April and the Fellows were summoned to attend It was rumoured that a royal letter would come down recommending one Anthony Farmer to the vacant place This man s life had been a series of shameful acts He had been a member of the University of Cambridge and had escaped expulsion only by a timely retreat He had then joined the Dissenters Then he had gone to Oxford had entered himself at Magdalene and had soon become notorious there for every kind of vice He generally reeled into his college at night speechless with liquor He was celebrated for having headed a disgraceful riot at Abingdon He had been a constant frequenter of noted haunts of libertines At length he had turned pandar had exceeded even the ordinary vileness of his vile calling and had received money from dissolute young gentlemen commoners for services such as it is not good that history should record This wretch however had pretended to turn Papist His apostasy atoned for all his vices and though still a youth he was selected to rule a grave and religious society in which the scandal given by his depravity was still fresh As a Roman Catholic he was disqualified for academical office by the general law of the land Never having been a Fellow of Magdalene College or of New College he was disqualified for the vacant presidency by a special ordinance of William of Waynflete William of Waynflete had also enjoined those who partook of his bounty to have a particular regard to moral character in choosing their head and even if he had left no such injunction a body chiefly composed of divines could not with decency entrust such a man as Farmer with the government of a place of education The Fellows respectfully represented to the King the difficulty in which they should be placed if as was rumoured Farmer should be recommended to them and begged that if it were His Majesty s pleasure to interfere in the election some person for whom they could legally and conscientiously vote might be proposed Of this dutiful request no notice was taken The royal letter arrived It was brought down by one of the Fellows who had lately turned Papist Robert Charnock a man of parts and spirit but of a violent and restless temper which impelled him a few years later to an atrocious crime and to a terrible fate On the thirteenth of April the society met in the chapel Some hope was still entertained that the King might be moved by the remonstrance which had been addressed to him The assembly therefore adjourned till the fifteenth which was the last day on which by the constitution of the college the election could take place The fifteenth of April came Again the Fellows repaired to their chapel No answer had arrived from Whitehall Two or three of the Seniors among whom was Smith were inclined to postpone the election once more rather than take a step which might give offence to the King But the language of the statutes was clear Those statutes the members of the foundation had sworn to observe The general opinion was that there ought to be no further delay A hot debate followed The electors were too much excited to take their seats and the whole choir was in a tumult Those who were for proceeding appealed to their oaths and to the rules laid down by the founder whose bread they had eaten The King they truly said had no right to force on them even a qualified candidate Some expressions unpleasing to Tory ears were dropped in the course of the dispute and Smith was provoked into exclaiming that the spirit of Ferguson had possessed his brethren It was at length resolved by a great majority that it was necessary to proceed immediately to the election Charnock left the chapel The other Fellows having first received the sacrament proceeded to give their voices The choice fell on John Hough a man of eminent virtue and prudence who having borne persecution with fortitude and prosperity with meekness having risen to high honours and having modestly declined honours higher still died in extreme old age yet in full vigour of mind more than fifty six years after this eventful day The society hastened to acquaint the King with the circumstances which had made it necessary to elect a President without further delay and requested the Duke of Ormond as patron of the whole University and the Bishop of Winchester as visitor of Magdalene College to undertake the office of intercessors but the King was far too angry and too dull to listen to explanations Early in June the Fellows were cited to appear before the High Commission at Whitehall Five of them deputed by the rest obeyed the summons Jeffreys treated them after his usual fashion When one of them a grave Doctor named Fairfax hinted some doubt as to the validity of the Commission the Chancellor began to roar like a wild beast Who is this man What commission has he to be impudent here Seize him Put him into a dark room What does he do without a keeper He is under my care as a lunatic I wonder that nobody has applied to me for the custody of him But when this storm had spent its force and the depositions concerning the moral character of the King s nominee had been read none of the Commissioners had the front to pronounce that such a man could properly be made the head of a great college Obadiah Walker and the other Oxonian Papists who were in attendance to support their proselyte were utterly confounded The Commission pronounced Hough s election void and suspended Fairfax from his fellowship but about Farmer no more was said and in the month of August arrived a royal letter recommending Parker Bishop of Oxford to the Fellows Parker was not an avowed Papist Still there was an objection to him which even if the presidency had been vacant would have been decisive for he had never been a Fellow of either New College or Magdalene But the presidency was not vacant Hough had been duly elected and all the members of the college were bound by oath to support him in his office They therefore with many expressions of loyalty and concern excused themselves from complying with the King s mandate While Oxford was thus opposing a firm resistance to tyranny a stand not less resolute was made in another quarter James had some time before commanded the trustees of the Charterhouse men of the first rank and consideration in the kingdom to admit a Roman Catholic named Popham into the hospital which was under their care The Master of the house Thomas Burnet a clergyman of distinguished genius learning and virtue had the courage to represent to them though the ferocious Jeffreys sate at the board that what was required of them was contrary both to the will of the founder and to an Act of Parliament What is that to the purpose said a courtier who was one of the governors It is very much to the purpose I think answered a voice feeble with age and sorrow yet not to be heard without respect by any assembly the voice of the venerable Ormond An Act of Parliament continued the patriarch of the Cavalier party is in my judgment no light thing The question was put whether Popham should be admitted and it was determined to reject him The Chancellor who could not well case himself by cursing and swearing at Ormond flung away in a rage and was followed by some of the minority The consequence was that there was not a quorum left and that no formal reply could be made to the royal mandate The next meeting took place only two days after the High Commission had pronounced sentence of deprivation against Hough and of suspension against Fairfax A second mandate under the Great Seal was laid before the trustees but the tyrannical manner in which Magdalene College had been treated had roused instead of subduing their spirit They drew up a letter to Sunderland in which they requested him to inform the King that they could not in this matter obey His Majesty without breaking the law and betraying their trust There can be little doubt that had ordinary signatures been appended to this document the King would have taken some violent course But even he was daunted by the great names of Ormond Halifax Danby and Nottingham the chiefs of all the sections of that great party to which he owed his crown He therefore contented himself with directing Jeffreys to consider what course ought to be taken It was announced at one time that a proceeding would be instituted in the King s Bench at another that the Ecclesiastical Commission would take up the case but these threats gradually died away two hundred ninety two The summer was now far advanced and the King set out on a progress the longest and the most splendid that had been known for many years From Windsor he went on the sixteenth of August to Portsmouth walked round the fortifications touched some scrofulous people and then proceeded in one of his yachts to Southampton From Southampton he travelled to Bath where he remained a few days and where he left the Queen When he departed he was attended by the High Sheriff of Somersetshire and by a large body of gentlemen to the frontier of the county where the High Sheriff of Gloucestershire with a not less splendid retinue was in attendance The Duke of Beaufort soon met the royal coaches and conducted them to Badminton where a banquet worthy of the fame which his splendid housekeeping had won for him was prepared In the afternoon the cavalcade proceeded to Gloucester It was greeted two miles from the city by the Bishop and clergy At the South Gate the Mayor waited with the keys The bells rang and the conduits flowed with wine as the King passed through the streets to the close which encircles the venerable Cathedral He lay that night at the deanery and on the following morning set out for Worcester From Worcester he went to Ludlow Shrewsbury and Chester and was everywhere received with outward signs of joy and respect which he was weak enough to consider as proofs that the discontent excited by his measures had subsided and that an easy Victory was before him Barillon more sagacious informed Lewis that the King of England was under a delusion that the progress had done no real good and that those very gentlemen of Worcestershire and Shropshire who had thought it their duty to receive their Sovereign and their guest with every mark of honour would be found as refractory as ever when the question of the test should come on two hundred ninety three On the road the royal train was joined by two courtiers who in temper and opinions differed widely from each other Penn was at Chester on a pastoral tour His popularity and authority among his brethren had greatly declined since he had become a tool of the King and of the Jesuits two hundred ninety four He was however most graciously received by James and on the Sunday was permitted to harangue in the tennis court while Cartwright preached in the Cathedral and while the King heard mass at an altar which had been decked in the Shire Hall It is said indeed that His Majesty deigned to look into the tennis court and to listen with decency to his friend s melodious eloquence two hundred ninety five The furious Tyrconnel had crossed the sea from Dublin to give an account of his administration All the most respectable English Catholics looked coldly on him as on an enemy of their race and a scandal to their religion But he was cordially welcomed by his master and dismissed with assurances of undiminished confidence and steady support James expressed his delight at learning that in a short time the whole government of Ireland would be in Roman Catholic hands The English colonists had already been stripped of all political power Nothing remained but to strip them of their property and this last outrage was deferred only till the cooperation of an Irish Parliament should have been secured two hundred ninety six From Cheshire the King turned southward and in the full belief that the Fellows of Magdalene College however mutinous they might be would not dare to disobey a command uttered by his own lips directed his course towards Oxford By the way he made some little excursions to places which peculiarly interested him as a King a brother and a son He visited the hospitable roof of Boscobel and the remains of the oak so conspicuous in the history of his house He rode over the field of Edgehill where the Cavaliers first crossed swords with the soldiers of the Parliament On the third of September he dined in great state at the palace of Woodstock an ancient and renowned mansion of which not a stone is now to be seen but of which the site is still marked on the turf of Blenheim Park by two sycamores which grow near the stately bridge In the evening he reached Oxford He was received there with the wonted honours The students in their academical garb were ranged to welcome him on the right hand and on the left from the entrance of the city to the great gate of Christ Church He lodged at the deanery where among other accommodations he found a chapel fitted up for the celebration of the Mass two hundred ninety seven On the day after his arrival the Fellows of Magdalene College were ordered to attend him When they appeared before him he treated them with an insolence such as had never been shown to their predecessors by the Puritan visitors You have not dealt with me like gentlemen he exclaimed You have been unmannerly as well as undutiful They fell on their knees and tendered a petition He would not look at it Is this your Church of England loyalty I could not have believed that so many clergymen of the Church of England would have been concerned in such a business Go home Get you gone I am King I will be obeyed Go to your chapel this instant and admit the Bishop of Oxford Let those who refuse look to it They shall feel the whole weight of my hand They shall know what it is to incur the displeasure of their Sovereign The Fellows still kneeling before him again offered him their petition He angrily flung it down Get you gone I tell you I will receive nothing from you till you have admitted the Bishop They retired and instantly assembled in their chapel The question was propounded whether they would comply with His Majesty s command Smith was absent Charnock alone answered in the affirmative The other Fellows who were at the meeting declared that in all things lawful they were ready to obey the King but that they would not violate their statutes and their oaths The King greatly incensed and mortified by his defeat quitted Oxford and rejoined the Queen at Bath His obstinacy and violence had brought him into an embarrassing position He had trusted too much to the effect of his frowns and angry tones and had rashly staked not merely the credit of his administration but his personal dignity on the issue of the contest Could he yield to subjects whom he had menaced with raised voice and furious gestures Yet could he venture to eject in one day a crowd of respectable clergymen from their homes because they had discharged what the whole nation regarded as a sacred duty Perhaps there might be an escape from this dilemma Perhaps the college might still be terrified caressed or bribed into submission The agency of Penn was employed He had too much good feeling to approve of the violent and unjust proceedings of the government and even ventured to express part of what he thought James was as usual obstinate in the wrong The courtly Quaker therefore did his best to seduce the college from the path of right He first tried intimidation Ruin he said impended over the society The King was highly incensed The case might be a hard one Most people thought it so But every child knew that His Majesty loved to have his own way and could not bear to be thwarted Penn therefore exhorted the Fellows not to rely on the goodness of their cause but to submit or at least to temporise Such counsel came strangely from one who had himself been expelled from the University for raising a riot about the surplice who had run the risk of being disinherited rather than take off his hat to the princes of the blood and who had been more than once sent to prison for haranguing in conventicles He did not succeed in frightening the Magdalene men In answer to his alarming hints he was reminded that in the last generation thirty four out of the forty Fellows had cheerfully left their beloved cloisters and gardens their hall and their chapel and had gone forth not knowing where they should find a meal or a bed rather than violate the oath of allegiance The King now wished them to violate another oath He should find that the old spirit was not extinct Then Penn tried a gentler tone He had an interview with Hough and with some of the Fellows and after many professions of sympathy and friendship began to hint at a compromise The King could not bear to be crossed The college must give way Parker must be admitted But he was in very bad health All his preferments would soon be vacant Doctor Hough said Penn may then be Bishop of Oxford How should you like that gentlemen Penn had passed his life in declaiming against a hireling ministry He held that he was bound to refuse the payment of tithes and this even when he had bought land chargeable with tithes and hallowed the value of the tithes in the purchase money According to his own principles he would have committed a great sin if he had interfered for the purpose of obtaining a benefice on the most honourable terms for the most pious divine Yet to such a degree had his manners been corrupted by evil communications and his understanding obscured by inordinate zeal for a single object that he did not scruple to become a broker in simony of a peculiarly discreditable kind and to use a bishopric as a bait to tempt a divine to perjury Hough replied with civil contempt that he wanted nothing from the crown but common justice We stand he said on our statutes and our oaths but even setting aside our statutes and oaths we feel that we have our religion to defend The Papists have robbed us of University College They have robbed us of Christ Church The fight is now for Magdalene They will soon have all the rest Penn was foolish enough to answer that he really believed that the Papists would now be content University he said is a pleasant college Christ Church is a noble place Magdalene is a fine building The situation is convenient The walks by the river are delightful If the Roman Catholics are reasonable they will be satisfied with these This absurd avowal would alone have made it impossible for Hough and his brethren to yield The negotiation was broken off and the King hastened to make the disobedient know as he had threatened what it was to incur his displeasure A special commission was directed to Cartwright Bishop of Chester to Wright Chief justice of the King s Bench and to Sir Thomas Jenner a Baron of the Exchequer appointing them to exercise visitatorial jurisdiction over the college On the twentieth of October they arrived at Oxford escorted by three troops of cavalry with drawn swords On the following morning the Commissioners took their seats in the hall of Magdalene Cartwright pronounced a loyal oration which a few years before would have called forth the acclamations of an Oxonian audience but which was now heard with sullen indignation A long dispute followed The President defended his rights with skill temper and resolution He professed great respect for the royal authority But he steadily maintained that he had by the laws of England a freehold interest in the house and revenues annexed to the presidency Of that interest he could not be deprived by an arbitrary mandate of the Sovereign Will you submit said the Bishop to our visitation I submit to it said Hough with great dexterity so far as it is consistent with the laws and no farther Will you deliver up the key of your lodgings said Cartwright Hough remained silent The question was repeated and Hough returned a mild but resolute refusal The Commissioners pronounced him an intruder and charged the Fellows no longer to recognise his authority and to assist at the admission of the Bishop of Oxford Charneck eagerly promised obedience Smith returned an evasive answer but the great body of the members of the college firmly declared that they still regarded Hough as their rightful head And now Hough himself craved permission to address a few words to the Commissioners They consented with much civility perhaps expecting from the calmness and suavity of his manner that he would make some concession My Lords said he you have this day deprived me of my freehold I hereby protest against all your proceedings as illegal unjust and null and I appeal from you to our sovereign Lord the King in his courts of justice A loud murmur of applause arose from the gownsmen who filled the hall The Commissioners were furious Search was made for the offenders but in vain Then the rage of the whole board was turned against Hough Do not think to huff us sir cried Jenner punning on the President s name I will uphold His Majesty s authority said Wright while I have breath in my body All this comes of your popular protest You have broken the peace You shall answer it in the King s Bench I bind you over in one thousand pounds to appear there next term I will see whether the civil power cannot manage you If that is not enough you shall have the military too In truth Oxford was in a state which made the Commissioners not a little uneasy The soldiers were ordered to have their carbines loaded It was said that an express was sent to London for the purpose of hastening the arrival of more troops No disturbance however took place The Bishop of Oxford was quietly installed by proxy but only two members of Magdalene College attended the ceremony Many signs showed that the spirit of resistance had spread to the common people The porter of the college threw down his keys The butler refused to scratch Hough s name out of the buttery book and was instantly dismissed No blacksmith could be found in the whole city who would force the lock of the President s lodgings It was necessary for the Commissioners to employ their own servants who broke open the door with iron bars The sermons which on the following Sunday were preached in the University church were full of reflections such as stung Cartwright to the quick though such as he could not discreetly resent And here if James had not been infatuated the matter might have stopped The Fellows in general were not inclined to carry their resistance further They were of opinion that by refusing to assist in the admission of the intruder they had sufficiently proved their respect for their statutes and oaths and that since he was now in actual possession they might justifiably submit to him as their head till he should be removed by sentence of a competent court Only one Fellow Doctor Fairfax refused to yield even to this extent The Commissioners would gladly have compromised the dispute on these terms and during a few hours there was a truce which many thought likely to end in an amicable arrangement but soon all was again in confusion The Fellows found that the popular voice loudly accused them of pusillanimity The townsmen already talked ironically of a Magdalene conscience and exclaimed that the brave Hough and the honest Fairfax had been betrayed and abandoned Still more annoying were the sneers of Obadiah Walker and his brother renegades This then said those apostates was the end of all the big words in which the society had declared itself resolved to stand by its lawful President and by its Protestant faith While the Fellows bitterly annoyed by the public censure were regretting the modified submission which they had consented to make they learned that this submission was by no means satisfactory to the King It was not enough he said that they offered to obey the Bishop of Oxford as President in fact They must distinctly admit the Commission and all that had been done under it to be legal They must acknowledge that they had acted undutifully they must declare themselves penitent they must promise to behave better in future must implore His Majesty s pardon and lay themselves at his feet Two Fellows of whom the King had no complaint to make Charnock and Smith were excused from the obligation of making these degrading apologies Even James never committed a grosser error The Fellows already angry with themselves for having conceded so much and galled by the censure of the world eagerly caught at the opportunity which was now offered them of regaining the public esteem With one voice they declared that they would never ask pardon for being in the right or admit that the visitation of their college and the deprivation of their President had been legal Then the King as he had threatened laid on them the whole weight of his hand They were by one sweeping edict condemned to expulsion Yet this punishment was not deemed sufficient It was known that many noblemen and gentlemen who possessed church patronage would be disposed to provide for men who had suffered so much for the laws of England or men and for the Protestant religion The High Commission therefore pronounced the ejected Fellows incapable of ever holding any church preferment Such of them as were not yet in holy orders were pronounced incapable of receiving the clerical character James might enjoy the thought that he had reduced many of them from a situation in which they were surrounded by comforts and had before them the fairest professional prospects to hopeless indigence But all these severities produced an effect directly the opposite of that which he had anticipated The spirit of Englishmen that sturdy spirit which no King of the House of Stuart could ever be taught by experience to understand swelled up high and strong against injustice Oxford the quiet scat of learning and loyalty was in a state resembling that of the City of London on the morning after the attempt of Charles the First to seize the five members The Vicechancellor had been asked to dine with the Commissioners on the day of the expulsion He refused My taste he said differs from that of Colonel Kirke I cannot eat my meals with appetite under a gallows The scholars refused to pull off their caps to the new rulers of Magdalene College Smith was nicknamed Doctor Roguery and was publicly insulted in a coffeehouse When Charnock summoned the Demies to perform their academical exercises before him they answered that they were deprived of their lawful governors and would submit to no usurped authority They assembled apart both for study and for divine service Attempts were made to corrupt them by offers of the lucrative fellowships which had just been declared vacant but one undergraduate after another manfully answered that his conscience would not suffer him to profit by injustice One lad who was induced to take a fellowship was turned out of the hall by the rest Youths were invited from other colleges but with small success The richest foundation in the kingdom seemed to have lost all attractions for needy students Meanwhile in London and all over the country money was collected for the support of the ejected Fellows The Princess of Orange to the great joy of all Protestants subscribed two hundred pounds Still however the King held on his course The expulsion of the Fellows was soon followed by the expulsion of a crowd of Demies All this time the new President was fast sinking under bodily and mental disease He had made a last feeble effort to serve the government by publishing at the very time when the college was in a state of open rebellion against his authority a defence of the Declaration of Indulgence or rather a defence of the doctrine of transubstantiation This piece called forth many answers and particularly one from Burnet written with extraordinary vigour and acrimony A few weeks after the expulsion of the Demies Parker died in the house of which he had violently taken possession Men said that his heart was broken by remorse and shame He lies in the beautiful antechapel of the college but no monument marks his grave Then the King s whole plan was carried into full effect The college was turned into a Popish seminary Bonaventure Giffard the Roman Catholic Bishop of Madura was appointed President The Roman Catholic service was performed in the chapel In one day twelve Roman Catholics were admitted Fellows Some servile Protestants applied for fellowships but met with refusals Smith an enthusiast in loyalty but still a sincere member of the Anglican Church could not bear to see the altered aspect of the house He absented himself he was ordered to return into residence he disobeyed he was expelled and the work of spoliation was complete two hundred ninety eight The nature of the academical system of England is such that no event which seriously affects the interests and honour of either University can fail to excite a strong feeling throughout the country Every successive blow therefore which fell on Magdalene College was felt to the extremities of the kingdom In the coffeehouses of London in the Inns of Court in the closes of all the Cathedral towns in parsonages and manor houses scattered over the remotest shires pity for the sufferers and indignation against the government went on growing The protest of Hough was everywhere applauded the forcing of his door was everywhere mentioned with abhorrence and at length the sentence of deprivation fulminated against the Fellows dissolved those ties once so close and dear which had bound the Church of England to the House of Stuart Bitter resentment and cruel apprehension took the place of love and confidence There was no prebendary no rector no vicar whose mind was not haunted by the thought that however quiet his temper however obscure his situation he might in a few months be driven from his dwelling by an arbitrary edict to beg in a ragged cassock with his wife and children while his freehold secured to him by laws of immemorial antiquity and by the royal word was occupied by some apostate This then was the reward of that heroic loyalty never once found wanting through the vicissitudes of fifty tempestuous years It was for this that the clergy had endured spoliation and persecution in the cause of Charles the First It was for this that they had supported Charles the Second in his hard contest with the Whig opposition It was for this that they had stood in the front of the battle against those who sought to despoil James of his birthright To their fidelity alone their oppressor owed the power which he was now employing to their ruin They had long been in the habit of recounting in acrimonious language all that they had suffered at the hand of the Puritan in the day of his power Yet for the Puritan there was some excuse He was an avowed enemy he had wrongs to avenge and even he while remodelling the ecclesiastical constitution of the country and ejecting all who would not subscribe his Covenant had not been altogether without compassion He had at least granted to those whose benefices he seized a pittance sufficient to support life But the hatred felt by the King towards that Church which had saved him from exile and placed him on a throne was not to be so easily satiated Nothing but the utter ruin of his victims would content him It was not enough that they were expelled from their homes and stripped of their revenues They found every walk of life towards which men of their habits could look for a subsistence closed against them with malignant care and nothing left to them but the precarious and degrading resource of alms The Anglican clergy therefore and that portion of the laity which was strongly attached to Protestant episcopacy now regarded the King with those feelings which injustice aggravated by ingratitude naturally excites Yet had the Churchman still many scruples of conscience and honour to surmount before he could bring himself to oppose the government by force He had been taught that passive obedience was enjoined without restriction or exception by the divine law He had professed this opinion ostentatiously He had treated with contempt the suggestion that an extreme case might possibly arise which would justify a people in drawing the sword against regal tyranny Both principle and shame therefore restrained him from imitating the example of the rebellious Roundheads while any hope of a peaceful and legal deliverance remained and such a hope might reasonably be cherished as long as the Princess of Orange stood next in succession to the crown If he would but endure with patience this trial of his faith the laws of nature would soon do for him what he could not without sin and dishonour do for himself The wrongs of the Church would be redressed her property and dignity would be fenced by new guarantees and those wicked ministers who had injured and insulted her in the day of her adversity would be signally punished The event to which the Church of England looked forward as to an honourable and peaceful termination of her troubles was one of which even the most reckless members of the Jesuitical cabal could not think without painful apprehensions If their master should die leaving them no better security against the penal laws than a Declaration which the general voice of the nation pronounced to be a nullity if a Parliament animated by the same spirit which had prevailed in the Parliament of Charles the Second should assemble round the throne of a Protestant sovereign was it not probable that a terrible retribution would be exacted that the old laws against Popery would be rigidly enforced and that new laws still more severe would be added to the statute book The evil counsellors had long been tormented by these gloomy apprehensions and some of them had contemplated strange and desperate remedies James had scarcely mounted the throne when it began to be whispered about Whitehall that if the Lady Anne would turn Roman Catholic it might not be impossible with the help of Lewis to transfer to her the birthright of her elder sister At the French embassy this scheme was warmly approved and Bonrepaux gave it as his opinion that the assent of James would be easily obtained two hundred ninety nine Soon however it became manifest that Anne was unalterably attached to the Established Church All thought of making her Queen was therefore relinquished Nevertheless a small knot of fanatics still continued to cherish a wild hope that they might be able to change the order of succession The plan formed by these men was set forth in a minute of which a rude French translation has been preserved It was to be hoped they said that the King might be able to establish the true faith without resorting to extremities but in the worst event he might leave his crown at the disposal of Lewis It was better for Englishmen to be the vassals of France than the slaves of the Devil three hundred This extraordinary document was handed about from Jesuit to Jesuit and from courtier to courtier till some eminent Roman Catholics in whom bigotry had not extinguished patriotism furnished the Dutch Ambassador with a copy He put the paper into the hands of James James greatly agitated pronounced it a vile forgery contrived by some pamphleteer in Holland The Dutch minister resolutely answered that he could prove the contrary by the testimony of several distinguished members of His Majesty s own Church nay that there would be no difficulty in pointing out the writer who after all had written only what many priests and many busy politicians said every day in the galleries of the palace The King did not think it expedient to ask who the writer was but abandoning the charge of forgery protested with great vehemence and solemnity that no thought of disinheriting his eldest daughter had ever crossed his mind Nobody he said ever dared to hint such a thing to me I never would listen to it God does not command us to propagate the true religion by injustice and this would be the foulest the most unnatural injustice three hundred one Notwithstanding all these professions Barillon a few days later reported to his court that James had begun to listen to suggestions respecting a change in the order of succession that the question was doubtless a delicate one but that there was reason to hope that with time and management a way might be found to settle the crown on some Roman Catholic to the exclusion of the two Princesses three hundred two During many months this subject continued to be discussed by the fiercest and most extravagant Papists about the court and candidates for the regal office were actually named three hundred three It is not probable however that James ever meant to take a course so insane He must have known that England would never bear for a single day the yoke of an usurper who was also a Papist and that any attempt to set aside the Lady Mary would have been withstood to the death both by all those who had supported the Exclusion Bill and by all those who had opposed it There is however no doubt that the King was an accomplice in a plot less absurd but not less unjustifiable against the rights of his children Tyrconnel had with his master s approbation made arrangements for separating Ireland from the empire and for placing her under the protection of Lewis as soon as the crown should devolve on a Protestant sovereign Bonrepaux had been consulted had imparted the design to his court and had been instructed to assure Tyrconnel that France would lend effectual aid to the accomplishment of this great project three hundred four These transactions which though perhaps not in all parts accurately known at the Hague were strongly suspected there must not be left out of the account if we would pass a just judgment on the course taken a few months later by the Princess of Orange Those who pronounce her guilty of a breach of filial duty must admit that her fault was at least greatly extenuated by her wrongs If to serve the cause of her religion she broke through the most sacred ties of consanguinity she only followed her father s example She did not assist to depose him till he had conspired to disinherit her Scarcely had Bonrepaux been informed that Lewis had resolved to assist the enterprise of Tyrconnel when all thoughts of that enterprise were abandoned James had caught the first glimpse of a hope which delighted and elated him The Queen was with child Before the end of October sixteen eighty seven the great news began to be whispered It was observed that Her Majesty had absented herself from some public ceremonies on the plea of indisposition It was said that many relics supposed to possess extraordinary virtue had been hung about her Soon the story made its way from the palace to the coffeehouses of the capital and spread fast over the country By a very small minority the rumour was welcomed with joy The great body of the nation listened with mingled derision and fear There was indeed nothing very extraordinary in what had happened The King had but just completed his fifty fourth year The Queen was in the summer of life She had already borne four children who had died young and long afterwards she was delivered of another child whom nobody had any interest in treating as supposititious and who was therefore never said to be so As however five years had elapsed since her last pregnancy the people under the influence of that delusion which leads men to believe what they wish had ceased to entertain any apprehension that she would give an heir to the throne On the other hand nothing seemed more natural and probable than that the Jesuits should have contrived a pious fraud It was certain that they must consider the accession of the Princess of Orange as one of the greatest calamities which could befall their Church It was equally certain that they would not be very scrupulous about doing whatever might be necessary to save their Church from a great calamity In books written by eminent members of the Society and licensed by its rulers it was distinctly laid down that means even more shocking to all notions of justice and humanity than the introduction of a spurious heir into a family might lawfully be employed for ends less important than the conversion of a heretical kingdom It had got abroad that some of the King s advisers and even the King himself had meditated schemes for defrauding the Lady Mary either wholly or in part of her rightful inheritance A suspicion not indeed well founded but by no means so absurd as is commonly supposed took possession of the public mind The folly of some Roman Catholics confirmed the vulgar prejudice They spoke of the auspicious event as strange as miraculous as an exertion of the same Divine power which had made Sarah proud and happy in Isaac and had given Samuel to the prayers of Hannah Mary s mother the Duchess of Modena had lately died A short time before her death she had it was said implored the Virgin of Loretto with fervent vows and rich offerings to bestow a son on James The King himself had in the preceding August turned aside from his progress to visit the Holy Well and had there besought Saint Winifred to obtain for him that boon without which his great designs for the propagation of the true faith could be but imperfectly executed The imprudent zealots who dwelt on these tales foretold with confidence that the unborn infant would be a boy and offered to back their opinion by laying twenty guineas to one Heaven they affirmed would not have interfered but for a great end One fanatic announced that the Queen would give birth to twins of whom the elder would be King of England and the younger Pope of Rome Mary could not conceal the delight with which she heard this prophecy and her ladies found that they could not gratify her more than by talking of it The Roman Catholics would have acted more wisely if they had spoken of the pregnancy as of a natural event and if they had borne with moderation their unexpected good fortune Their insolent triumph excited the popular indignation Their predictions strengthened the popular suspicions From the Prince and Princess of Denmark down to porters and laundresses nobody alluded to the promised birth without a sneer The wits of London described the new miracle in rhymes which it may well be supposed were not the most delicate The rough country squires roared with laughter if they met with any person simple enough to believe that the Queen was really likely to be again a mother A royal proclamation appeared commanding the clergy to read a form of prayer and thanksgiving which had been prepared for this joyful occasion by Crewe and Sprat The clergy obeyed but it was observed that the congregations made no responses and showed no signs of reverence Soon in all the coffeehouses was handed about a brutal lampoon on the courtly prelates whose pens the King had employed Mother East had also her full share of abuse Into that homely monosyllable our ancestors had degraded the name of the great house of Este which reigned at Modena three hundred five The new hope which elated the King s spirits was mingled with many fears Something more than the birth of a Prince of Wales was necessary to the success of the plans formed by the Jesuitical party It was not very likely that James would live till his son should be of age to exercise the regal functions The law had made no provision for the case of a minority The reigning sovereign was not competent to make provision for such a case by will The legislature only could supply the defect If James should die before the defect had been supplied leaving a successor of tender years the supreme power would undoubtedly devolve on Protestants Those Tories who held most firmly the doctrine that nothing could justify them in resisting their liege lord would have no scruple about drawing their swords against a Popish woman who should dare to usurp the guardianship of the realm and of the infant sovereign The result of a contest could scarcely be matter of doubt The Prince of Orange or his wife would be Regent The young King would be placed in the hands of heretical instructors whose arts might speedily efface from his mind the impressions which might have been made on it in the nursery He might prove another Edward the Sixth and the blessing granted to the intercession of the Virgin Mother and of Saint Winifred might be turned into a curse three hundred six This was a danger against which nothing but an Act of Parliament could be a security and to obtain such an Act was not easy Everything seemed to indicate that if the Houses were convoked they would come up to Westminster animated by the spirit of sixteen forty The event of the county elections could hardly be doubted The whole body of freeholders high and low clerical and lay was strongly excited against the government In the great majority of those towns where the right of voting depended on the payment of local taxes or on the occupation of a tenement no courtly candidate could dare to show his face A very large part of the House of Commons was returned by members of municipal corporations These corporations had recently been remodelled for the purpose of destroying the influence of the Whigs and Dissenters More than a hundred constituent bodies had been deprived of their charters by tribunals devoted to the crown or had been induced to avert compulsory disfranchisement by voluntary surrender Every Mayor every Alderman every Town Clerk from Berwick to Helstone was a Tory and a Churchman but Tories and Churchmen were now no longer devoted to the sovereign The new municipalities were more unmanageable than the old municipalities had ever been and would undoubtedly return representatives whose first act would be to impeach all the Popish Privy Councillors and all the members of the High Commission In the Lords the prospect was scarcely less gloomy than in the Commons Among the temporal peers it was certain that an immense majority would be against the King s measures and on that episcopal bench which seven years before had unanimously supported him against those who had attempted to deprive him of his birthright he could now look for support only to four or five sycophants despised by their profession and by their country three hundred seven To all men not utterly blinded by passion these difficulties appeared insuperable The most unscrupulous slaves of power showed signs of uneasiness Dryden muttered that the King would only make matters worse by trying to mend them and sighed for the golden days of the careless and goodnatured Charles three hundred eight Even Jeffreys wavered As long as he was poor he was perfectly ready to face obloquy and public hatred for lucre But he had now by corruption and extortion accumulated great riches and he was more anxious to secure them than to increase them His slackness drew on him a sharp reprimand from the royal lips In dread of being deprived of the Great Seal he promised whatever was required of him but Barillon in reporting this circumstance to Lewis remarked that the King of England could place little reliance on any man who had any thing to lose three hundred nine Nevertheless James determined to persevere The sanction of a Parliament was necessary to his system The sanction of a free and lawful Parliament it was evidently impossible to obtain but it might not be altogether impossible to bring together by corruption by intimidation by violent exertions of prerogative by fraudulent distortions of law an assembly which might call itself a Parliament and might be willing to register any edict of the Sovereign Returning officers must be appointed who would avail themselves of the slightest pretence to declare the King s friends duly elected Every placeman from the highest to the lowest must be made to understand that if he wished to retain his office he must at this conjuncture support the throne by his vote and interest The High Commission meanwhile would keep its eye on the clergy The boroughs which had just been remodelled to serve one turn might be remodelled again to serve another By such means the King hoped to obtain a majority in the House of Commons The Upper House would then be at his mercy He had undoubtedly by law the power of creating peers without limit and this power he was fully determined to use He did not wish and indeed no sovereign can wish to make the highest honour which is in the gift of the crown worthless He cherished the hope that by calling up some heirs apparent to the assembly in which they must ultimately sit and by conferring English titles on some Scotch and Irish Lords he might be able to secure a majority without ennobling new men in such numbers as to bring ridicule on the coronet and the ermine But there was no extremity to which he was not prepared to go in case of necessity When in a large company an opinion was expressed that the peers would prove intractable Oh silly cried Sunderland turning to Churchill your troop of guards shall be called up to the House of Lords three hundred ten Having determined to pack a Parliament James set himself energetically and methodically to the work A proclamation appeared in the Gazette announcing that the King had determined to revise the Commissions of Peace and of Lieutenancy and to retain in public employment only such gentlemen as should be disposed to support his policy three hundred eleven A committee of seven Privy Councillors sate at Whitehall for the purpose of regulating such was the phrase the municipal corporations In this committee Jeffreys alone represented the Protestant interest Powis alone represented the moderate Roman Catholics All the other members belonged to the Jesuitical faction Among them was Petre who had just been sworn of the Council Till he took his seat at the board his elevation had been kept a profound secret from everybody but Sunderland The public indignation at this new violation of the law was clamorously expressed and it was remarked that the Roman Catholics were even louder in censure than the Protestants The vain and ambitious Jesuit was now charged with the business of destroying and reconstructing half the constituent bodies in the kingdom Under the committee of Privy Councillors a subcommittee consisting of bustling agents less eminent in rank was entrusted with the management of details Local subcommittees of regulators all over the country corresponded with the central board at Westminster three hundred twelve The persons on whom James chiefly relied for assistance in his new and arduous enterprise were the Lords Lieutenants Every Lord Lieutenant received written orders directing him to go down immediately into his county There he was to summon before him all his deputies and all the justices of the Peace and to put to them a series of interrogatories framed for the purpose of ascertaining how they would act at a general election He was to take down the answers in writing and to transmit them to the government He was to furnish a list of such Roman Catholics and such Protestant Dissenters as might be best qualified for the bench and for commands in the militia He was also to examine into the state of all the boroughs in his county and to make such reports as might be necessary to guide the operations of the board of regulators It was intimated to him that he must himself perform these duties and that he could not be permitted to delegate them to any other person three hundred thirteen The first effect produced by these orders would have at once sobered a prince less infatuated than James Half the Lords Lieutenants of England peremptorily refused to stoop to the odious service which was required of them They were immediately dismissed All those who incurred this glorious disgrace were peers of high consideration and all had hitherto been regarded as firm supporters of monarchy Some names in the list deserve especial notice The noblest subject in England and indeed as Englishmen loved to say the noblest subject in Europe was Aubrey de Vere twentieth and last of the old Earls of Oxford He derived his title through an uninterrupted male descent from a time when the families of Howard and Seymour were still obscure when the Nevilles and Percies enjoyed only a provincial celebrity and when even the great name of Plantagenet had not yet been heard in England One chief of the house of De Vere had held high command at Hastings another had marched with Godfrey and Tancred over heaps of slaughtered Moslem to the sepulchre of Christ The first Earl of Oxford had been minister of Henry Beauclerc The third Earl had been conspicuous among the Lords who extorted the Great Charter from John The seventh Earl had fought bravely at Cressy and Pointiers The thirteenth Earl had through many vicissitudes of fortune been the chief of the party of the Red Rose and had led the van on the decisive day of Bosworth The seventeenth Earl had shone at the court of Elizabeth and had won for himself an honourable place among the early masters of English poetry The nineteenth Earl had fallen in arms for the Protestant religion and for the liberties of Europe under the walls of Maastricht His son Aubrey in whom closed the longest and most illustrious line of nobles that England has seen a man of loose morals but of inoffensive temper and of courtly manners was Lord Lieutenant of Essex and Colonel of the Blues His nature was not factious and his interest inclined him to avoid a rupture with the court for his estate was encumbered and his military command lucrative He was summoned to the royal closet and an explicit declaration of his intentions was demanded from him Sir answered Oxford I will stand by your Majesty against all enemies to the last drop of my blood But this is matter of conscience and I cannot comply He was instantly deprived of his lieutenancy and of his regiment three hundred fourteen Inferior in antiquity and splendour to the house of De Vere but to the house of De Vere alone was the house of Talbot Ever since the reign of Edward the Third the Talbots had sate among the peers of the realm The earldom of Shrewsbury had been bestowed in the fifteenth century on John Talbot the antagonist of the Maid of Orleans He had been long remembered by his countrymen with tenderness and reverence as one of the most illustrious of those warriors who had striven to erect a great English empire on the Continent of Europe The stubborn courage which he had shown in the midst of disasters had made him an object of interest greater than more fortunate captains had inspired and his death had furnished a singularly touching scene to our early stage His posterity had during two centuries flourished in great honour The head of the family at the time of the Restoration was Francis the eleventh Earl a Roman Catholic His death had been attended by circumstances such as even in those licentious times which immediately followed the downfall of the Puritan tyranny had moved men to horror and pity The Duke of Buckingham in the course of his vagrant amours was for a moment attracted by the Countess of Shrewsbury She was easily won Her lord challenged the gallant and fell Some said that the abandoned woman witnessed the combat in man s attire and others that she clasped her victorious lover to her bosom while his shirt was still dripping with the blood of her husband The honours of the murdered man descended to his infant son Charles As the orphan grew up to man s estate it was generally acknowledged that of the young nobility of England none had been so richly gifted by nature His person was pleasing his temper singularly sweet his parts such as if he had been born in a humble rank might well have raised him to the height of civil greatness All these advantages he had so improved that before he was of age he was allowed to be one of the finest gentlemen and finest scholars of his time His learning is proved by notes which are still extant in his handwriting on books in almost every department of literature He spoke French like a gentleman of Lewis s bedchamber and Italian like a citizen of Florence It was impossible that a youth of such parts should not be anxious to understand the grounds on which his family had refused to conform to the religion of the state He studied the disputed points closely submitted his doubts to priests of his own faith laid their answers before Tillotson weighed the arguments on both sides long and attentively and after an investigation which occupied two years declared himself a Protestant The Church of England welcomed the illustrious convert with delight His popularity was great and became greater when it was known that royal solicitations and promises had been vainly employed to seduce him back to the superstition which he had abjured The character of the young Earl did not however develop itself in a manner quite satisfactory to those who had borne the chief part in his conversion His morals by no means escaped the contagion of fashionable libertinism In truth the shock which had overturned his early prejudices had at the same time unfixed all his opinions and left him to the unchecked guidance of his feelings But though his principles were unsteady his impulses were so generous his temper so bland his manners so gracious and easy that it was impossible not to love him He was early called the King of Hearts and never through a long eventful and chequered life lost his right to that name three hundred fifteen Shrewsbury was Lord Lieutenant of Staffordshire and Colonel of one of the regiments of horse which had been raised in consequence of the Western insurrection He now refused to act under the board of regulators and was deprived of both his commissions None of the English nobles enjoyed a larger measure of public favour than Charles Sackville Earl of Dorset He was indeed a remarkable man In his youth he had been one of the most notorious libertines of the wild time which followed the Restoration He had been the terror of the City watch had passed many nights in the round house and had at least once occupied a cell in Newgate His passion for Betty Morrice and for Nell Gwynn who called him her Charles the First had given no small amusement and scandal to the town three hundred sixteen Yet in the midst of follies and vices his courageous spirit his fine understanding and his natural goodness of heart had been conspicuous Men said that the excesses in which he indulged were common between him and the whole race of gay young Cavaliers but that his sympathy with human suffering and the generosity with which he made reparation to those whom his freaks had injured were all his own His associates were astonished by the distinction which the public made between him and them He may do what he chooses said Wilmot he is never in the wrong The judgment of the world became still more favourable to Dorset when he had been sobered by time and marriage His graceful manners his brilliant conversation his soft heart his open hand were universally praised No day passed it was said in which some distressed family had not reason to bless his name And yet with all his goodnature such was the keenness of his wit that scoffers whose sarcasm all the town feared stood in craven fear of the sarcasm of Dorset All political parties esteemed and caressed him but politics were not much to his taste Had he been driven by necessity to exert himself he would probably have risen to the highest posts in the state but he was born to rank so high and wealth so ample that many of the motives which impel men to engage in public affairs were wanting to him He took just so much part in parliamentary and diplomatic business as sufficed to show that he wanted nothing but inclination to rival Danby and Sunderland and turned away to pursuits which pleased him better Like many other men who with great natural abilities are constitutionally and habitually indolent he became an intellectual voluptuary and a master of all those pleasing branches of knowledge which can be acquired without severe application He was allowed to be the best judge of painting of sculpture of architecture of acting that the court could show On questions of polite learning his decisions were regarded at all the coffeehouses as without appeal More than one clever play which had failed on the first representation was supported by his single authority against the whole clamour of the pit and came forth successful from the second trial The delicacy of his taste in French composition was extolled by Saint Evremond and La Fontaine Such a patron of letters England had never seen His bounty was bestowed with equal judgment and liberality and was confined to no sect or faction Men of genius estranged from each other by literary jealousy or by difference of political opinion joined in acknowledging his impartial kindness Dryden owned that he had been saved from ruin by Dorset s princely generosity Yet Montague and Prior who had keenly satirised Dryden were introduced by Dorset into public life and the best comedy of Dryden s mortal enemy Shadwell was written at Dorset s country seat The munificent Earl might if such had been his wish have been the rival of those of whom he was content to be the benefactor For the verses which he occasionally composed unstudied as they are exhibit the traces of a genius which assiduously cultivated would have produced something great In the small volume of his works may be found songs which have the easy vigour of Suckling and little satires which sparkle with wit as splendid as that of Butler three hundred seventeen Dorset was Lord Lieutenant of Sussex and to Sussex the board of regulators looked with great anxiety for in no other county Cornwall and Wiltshire excepted were there so many small boroughs He was ordered to repair to his post No person who knew him expected that he would obey He gave such an answer as became him and was informed that his services were no longer needed The interest which his many noble and amiable qualities inspired was heightened when it was known that he had received by the post an anonymous billet telling him that if he did not promptly comply with the King s wishes all his wit and popularity should not save him from assassination A similar warning was sent to Shrewsbury Threatening letters were then much more rare than they afterwards became It is therefore not strange that the people excited as they were should have been disposed to believe that the best and noblest Englishmen were really marked out for Popish daggers three hundred eighteen Just when these letters were the talk of all London the mutilated corpse of a noted Puritan was found in the streets It was soon discovered that the murderer had acted from no religious or political motive But the first suspicions of the populace fell on the Papists The mangled remains were carried in procession to the house of the Jesuits in the Savoy and during a few hours the fear and rage of the populace were scarcely less violent than on the day when Godfrey was borne to his grave three hundred nineteen The other dismissions must be more concisely related The Duke of Somerset whose regiment had been taken from him some months before was now turned out of the lord lieutenancy of the East Riding of Yorkshire The North Riding was taken from Viscount Fauconberg Shropshire from Viscount Newport and Lancashire from the Earl of Derby grandson of that gallant Cavalier who had faced death so bravely both on the field of battle and on the scaffold for the House of Stuart The Earl of Pembroke who had recently served the crown with fidelity and spirit against Monmouth was displaced in Wiltshire the Earl of Husband in Leicestershire the Earl of Bridgewater in Buckinghamshire the Earl of Thanet in Cumberland the Earl of Northampton in Warwickshire the Earl of Abingdon in Oxfordshire and the Earl of Scarsdale in Derbyshire Scarsdale was also deprived of a regiment of cavalry and of an office in the household of the Princess of Denmark She made a struggle to retain his services and yielded only to a peremptory command of her father The Earl of Gainsborough was rejected not only from the lieutenancy of Hampshire but also from the government of Portsmouth and the rangership of the New Forest two places for which he had only a few months before given five thousand pounds three hundred twenty The King could not find Lords of great note or indeed Protestant Lords of any sort who would accept the vacant offices It was necessary to assign two shires to Jeffreys a new man whose landed property was small and two to Preston who was not even an English peer The other counties which had been left without governors were entrusted with scarcely an exception to known Roman Catholics or to courtiers who had secretly promised the King to declare themselves Roman Catholics as soon as they could do so with prudence At length the new machinery was put in action and soon from every corner of the realm arrived the news of complete and hopeless failure The catechism by which the Lords Lieutenants had been directed to test the sentiments of the country gentlemen consisted of three questions Every magistrate and Deputy Lieutenant was to be asked first whether if he should be chosen to serve in Parliament he would vote for a bill framed on the principles of the Declaration of Indulgence secondly whether as an elector he would support candidates who would engage to vote for such a bill and thirdly whether in his private capacity he would aid the King s benevolent designs by living in friendship with people of all religious persuasions three hundred twenty one As soon as the questions got abroad a form of answer drawn up with admirable skill was circulated all over the kingdom and was generally adopted It was to the following effect As a member of the House of Commons should I have the honour of a seat there I shall think it my duty carefully to weigh such reasons as may be adduced in debate for and against a Bill of Indulgence and then to vote according to my conscientious conviction As an elector I shall give my support to candidates whose notions of the duty of a representative agree with my own As a private man it is my wish to live in peace and charity with every body This answer far more provoking than a direct refusal because slightly tinged with a sober and decorous irony which could not well be resented was all that the emissaries of the court could extract from most of the country gentlemen Arguments promises threats were tried in vain The Duke of Norfolk though a Protestant and though dissatisfied with the proceedings of the government had consented to become its agent in two counties He went first to Surrey where he soon found that nothing could be done three hundred twenty two He then repaired to Norfolk and returned to inform the King that of seventy gentlemen of note who bore office in that great province only six had held out hopes that they should support the policy of the court three hundred twenty three The Duke of Beaufort whose authority extended over four English shires and over the whole principality of Wales came up to Whitehall with an account not less discouraging three hundred twenty four Rochester was Lord Lieutenant of Hertfordshire All his little stock of virtue had been expended in his struggle against the strong temptation to sell his religion for lucre He was still bound to the court by a pension of four thousand pounds a year and in return for this pension he was willing to perform any service however illegal or degrading provided only that he were not required to go through the forms of a reconciliation with Rome He had readily undertaken to manage his county and he exerted himself as usual with indiscreet heat and violence But his anger was thrown away on the sturdy squires to whom he addressed himself They told him with one voice that they would send up no man to Parliament who would vote for taking away the safeguards of the Protestant religion three hundred twenty five The same answer was given to the Chancellor in Buckinghamshire three hundred twenty six The gentry of Shropshire assembled at Ludlow unanimously refused to fetter themselves by the pledge which the King demanded of them three hundred twenty seven The Earl of Yarmouth reported from Wiltshire that of sixty magistrates and Deputy Lieutenants with whom he had conferred only seven had given favourable answers and that even those seven could not be trusted three hundred twenty eight The renegade Peterborough made no progress in Northamptonshire three hundred twenty nine His brother renegade Dover was equally unsuccessful in Cambridgeshire three hundred thirty Preston brought cold news from Cumberland and Westmoreland Dorsetshire and Huntingdonshire were animated by the same spirit The Earl of Bath after a long canvass returned from the West with gloomy tidings He had been authorised to make the most tempting offers to the inhabitants of that region In particular he had promised that if proper respect were shown to the royal wishes the trade in tin should be freed from the oppressive restrictions under which it lay But this lure which at another time would have proved irresistible was now slighted All the justices and Deputy Lieutenants of Devonshire and Cornwall without a single dissenting voice declared that they would put life and property in jeopardy for the King but that the Protestant religion was dearer to them than either life or property And sir said Bath if your Majesty should dismiss all these gentlemen their successors would give exactly the same answer three hundred thirty one If there was any district in which the government might have hoped for success that district was Lancashire Considerable doubts had been felt as to the result of what was passing there In no part of the realm had so many opulent and honourable families adhered to the old religion The heads of many of those families had already by virtue of the dispensing power been made justices of the Peace and entrusted with commands in the militia Yet from Lancashire the new Lord Lieutenant himself a Roman Catholic reported that two thirds of his deputies and of the magistrates were opposed to the court three hundred thirty two But the proceedings in Hampshire wounded the King s pride still more deeply Arabella Churchill had more than twenty years before borne him a son widely renowned at a later period as one of the most skilful captains of Europe The youth named James Fitzjames had as yet given no promise of the eminence which he afterwards attained but his manners were so gentle and inoffensive that he had no enemy except Mary of Modena who had long hated the child of the concubine with the bitter hatred of a childless wife A small part of the Jesuitical faction had before the pregnancy of the Queen was announced seriously thought of setting him up as a competitor of the Princess of Orange three hundred thirty three When it is remembered how signally Monmouth though believed by the populace to be legitimate and though the champion of the national religion had failed in a similar competition it must seem extraordinary that any man should have been so much blinded by fanaticism as to think of placing on the throne one who was universally known to be a Popish bastard It does not appear that this absurd design was ever countenanced by the King The boy however was acknowledged and whatever distinctions a subject not of the royal blood could hope to attain were bestowed on him He had been created Duke of Berwick and he was now loaded with honourable and lucrative employments taken from those noblemen who had refused to comply with the royal commands He succeeded the Earl of Oxford as Colonel of the Blues and the Earl of Gainsborough as Lord Lieutenant of Hampshire Ranger of the New Forest and Governor of Portsmouth On the frontier of Hampshire Berwick expected to have been met according to custom by a long cavalcade of baronets knights and squires but not a single person of note appeared to welcome him He sent out letters commanding the attendance of the gentry but only five or six paid the smallest attention to his summons The rest did not wait to be dismissed They declared that they would take no part in the civil or military government of their county while the King was represented there by a Papist and voluntarily laid down their commissions three hundred thirty four Sunderland who had been named Lord Lieutenant of Warwickshire in the room of the Earl of Northampton found some excuse for not going down to face the indignation and contempt of the gentry of that shire and his plea was the more readily admitted because the King had by that time begun to feel that the spirit of the rustic gentry was not to be bent three hundred thirty five It is to be observed that those who displayed this spirit were not the old enemies of the House of Stuart The Commissions of Peace and Lieutenancy had long been carefully purged of all republican names The persons from whom the court had in vain attempted to extract any promise of support were with scarcely an exception Tories The elder among them could still show scars given by the swords of Roundheads and receipts for plate sent to Charles the First in his distress The younger had adhered firmly to James against Shaftesury and Monmouth Such were the men who were now turned out of office in a mass by the very prince to whom they had given such signal proofs of fidelity Dismission however only made them more resolute It had become a sacred point of honour among them to stand stoutly by one another in this crisis There could be no doubt that if the suffrage of the freeholders were fairly taken not a single knight of the shire favourable to the policy of the government would be returned Men therefore asked one another with no small anxiety whether the suffrages were likely to be fairly taken The list of the Sheriffs for the new year was impatiently expected It appeared while the Lords Lieutenants were still engaged in their canvass and was received with a general cry of alarm and indignation Most of the functionaries who were to preside at the county elections were either Roman Catholics or Protestant Dissenters who had expressed their approbation of the Indulgence three hundred thirty six For a time the most gloomy apprehensions prevailed but soon they began to subside There was good reason to believe that there was a point beyond which the King could not reckon on the support even of those Sheriffs who were members of his own Church Between the Roman Catholic courtier and the Roman Catholic country gentleman there was very little sympathy That cabal which domineered at Whitehall consisted partly of fanatics who were ready to break through all rules of morality and to throw the world into confusion for the purpose of propagating their religion and partly of hypocrites who for lucre had apostatized from the faith in which they had been brought up and who now over acted the zeal characteristic of neophytes Both the fanatical and the hypocritical courtiers were generally destitute of all English feeling In some of them devotion to their Church had extinguished every national sentiment Some were Irishmen whose patriotism consisted in mortal hatred of the Saxon conquerors of Ireland Some again were traitors who received regular hire from a foreign power Some had passed a great part of their lives abroad and either were mere cosmopolites or felt a positive distaste for the manners and institutions of the country which was now subjected to their rule Between such men and the lord of a Cheshire or Staffordshire manor who adhered to the old Church there was scarcely anything in common He was neither a fanatic nor a hypocrite He was a Roman Catholic because his father and grandfather had been so and he held his hereditary faith as men generally hold a hereditary faith sincerely but with little enthusiasm In all other points he was a mere English squire and if he differed from the neighbouring squires differed from them by being somewhat more simple and clownish than they The disabilities under which he lay had prevented his mind from expanding to the standard moderate as that standard was which the minds of Protestant country gentlemen then ordinarily attained Excluded when a boy from Eton and Westminster when a youth from Oxford and Cambridge when a man from Parliament and from the bench of justice he generally vegetated as quietly as the elms of the avenue which led to his ancestral grange His cornfields his dairy and his cider press his greyhounds his fishing rod and his gun his ale and his tobacco occupied almost all his thoughts With his neighbours in spite of his religion he was generally on good terms They knew him to be unambitious and inoffensive He was almost always of a good old family He was always a Cavalier His peculiar notions were not obtruded and caused no annoyance He did not like a Puritan torment himself and others with scruples about everything that was pleasant On the contrary he was as keen a sportsman and as jolly a boon companion as any man who had taken the oath of supremacy and the declaration against transubstantiation He met his brother squires at the cover was in with them at the death and when the sport was over took them home with him to a venison pasty and to October four years in bottle The oppressions which he had undergone had not been such as to impel him to any desperate resolution Even when his Church was barbarously persecuted his life and property were in little danger The most impudent false witnesses could hardly venture to shock the common sense of mankind by accusing him of being a conspirator The Papists whom Oates selected for attack were peers prelates Jesuits Benedictines a busy political agent a lawyer in high practice a court physician The Roman Catholic country gentleman protected by his obscurity by his peaceable demeanour and by the good will of those among whom he lived carted his hay or filled his bag with game unmolested while Coleman and Langhorne Whitbread and Pickering Archbishop Plunkett and Lord Stafford died by the halter or the axe An attempt was indeed made by a knot of villains to bring home a charge of treason to Sir Thomas Gascoigne an aged Roman Catholic baronet of Yorkshire but twelve of the best gentlemen of the West Riding who knew his way of life could not be convinced that their honest old acquaintance had hired cutthroats to murder the King and in spite of charges which did very little honour to the bench found a verdict of Not Guilty Sometimes indeed the head of an old and respectable provincial family might reflect with bitterness that he was excluded on account of his religion from places of honour and authority which men of humbler descent and less ample estate were thought competent to fill but he was little disposed to risk land and life in a struggle against overwhelming odds and his honest English spirit would have shrunk with horror from means such as were contemplated by the Petres and Tyrconnels Indeed he would have been as ready as any of his Protestant neighbours to gird on his sword and to put pistols in his holsters for the defence of his native land against an invasion of French or Irish Papists Such was the general character of the men to whom James now looked as to his most trustworthy instruments for the conduct of county elections He soon found that they were not inclined to throw away the esteem of their neighbours and to endanger their beads and their estates by rendering him an infamous and criminal service Several of them refused to be Sheriffs Of those who accepted the shrievalty many declared that they would discharge their duty as fairly as if they were members of the Established Church and would return no candidate who had not a real majority three hundred thirty seven If the King could place little confidence even in his Roman Catholic Sheriffs still less could he rely on the Puritans Since the publication of the Declaration several months had elapsed months crowded with important events months of unintermitted controversy Discussion had opened the eyes of many Dissenters but the acts of the government and especially the severity with which Magdalene College had been treated had done more than even the pen of Halifax to alarm and to unite all classes of Protestants Most of those sectaries who had been induced to express gratitude for the Indulgence were now ashamed of their error and were desirous of making atonement by casting in their lot with the great body of their countrymen The consequence of this change in the feeling of the Nonconformists was that the government found almost as great difficulty in the towns as in the counties When the regulators began their work they had taken it for granted that every Dissenter who had been induced to express gratitude for the Indulgence would be favourable to the king s policy They were therefore confident that they should be able to fill all the municipal offices in the kingdom with staunch friends In the new charters a power had been reserved to the crown of dismissing magistrates at pleasure This power was now exercised without limit It was by no means equally clear that James had the power of appointing new magistrates but whether it belonged to him or not he determined to assume it Everywhere from the Tweed to the Land s End Tory functionaries were ejected and the vacant places were filled with Presbyterians Independents and Baptists In the new charter of the City of London the crown had reserved the power of displacing the masters wardens and assistants of all the companies Accordingly more than eight hundred citizens of the first consideration all of them members of that party which had opposed the Exclusion Bill were turned out of office by a single edict In a short time appeared a supplement to this long list three hundred thirty eight But scarcely had the new officebearers been sworn in when it was discovered that they were as unmanageable as their predecessors At Newcastle on Tyne the regulators appointed a Roman Catholic Mayor and Puritan Alderman No doubt was entertained that the municipal body thus remodelled would vote an address promising to support the king s measures The address however was negatived The mayor went up to London in a fury and told the king that the Dissenters were all knaves and rebels and that in the whole corporation the government could not reckon on more than four votes three hundred thirty nine At Reading twenty four Tory aldermen were dismissed Twenty four new aldermen were appointed Twenty three of these immediately declared against the Indulgence and were dismissed in their turn three hundred forty In the course of a few days the borough of Yarmouth was governed by three different sets of magistrates all equally hostile to the court three hundred forty one These are mere examples of what was passing all over the kingdom The Dutch Ambassador informed the States that at many towns the public functionaries had within one month been changed twice and even thrice and yet changed in vain three hundred forty two From the records of the Privy Council it appears that the number of regulations as they were called exceeded two hundred three hundred forty three The regulators indeed found that in not a few places the change had been for the worse The discontented Tories even while murmuring against the king s policy had constantly expressed respect for his person and his office and had disclaimed all thoughts of resistance Very different was the language of some of the new members of corporations It was said that old soldiers of the Commonwealth who to their own astonishment and that of the public had been made aldermen gave the agents of the court very distinctly to understand that blood should flow before Popery and arbitrary power were established in England three hundred forty four The regulators found that little or nothing had been gained by what had as yet been done There was one way and one way only in which they could hope to effect their object The charters of the boroughs must be resumed and other charters must be granted confining the elective franchise to very small constituent bodies appointed by the sovereign three hundred forty five But how was this plan to be carried into effect In a few of the new charters indeed a right of revocation had been reserved to the crown but the rest James could get into his hands only by voluntary surrender on the part of corporations or by judgment of the King s Bench Few corporations were now disposed to surrender their charters voluntarily and such judgments as would suit the purposes of the government were hardly to be expected even from such a slave as Wright The writs of Quo Warranto which had been brought a few years before for the purpose of crushing the Whig party had been condemned by every impartial man Yet those writs had at least the semblance of justice for they were brought against ancient municipal bodies and there were few ancient municipal bodies in which some abuse sufficient to afford a pretext for a penal proceeding had not grown up in the course of ages But the corporations now to be attacked were still in the innocence of infancy The oldest among them had not completed its fifth year It was impossible that many of them should have committed offences meriting disfranchisement The Judges themselves were uneasy They represented that what they were required to do was in direct opposition to the plainest principles of law and justice but all remonstrance was vain The boroughs were commanded to surrender their charters Few complied and the course which the King took with those few did not encourage others to trust him In several towns the right of voting was taken away from the commonalty and given to a very small number of persons who were required to bind themselves by oath to support the candidates recommended by the government At Tewkesbury for example the franchise was confined to thirteen persons Yet even this number was too large Hatred and fear had spread so widely through the community that it was scarcely possible to bring together in any town by any process of packing thirteen men on whom the court could absolutely depend It was rumoured that the majority of the new constituent body of Tewkesbury was animated by the same sentiment which was general throughout the nation and would when the decisive day should arrive send true Protestants to Parliament The regulators in great wrath threatened to reduce the number of electors to three three hundred forty six Meanwhile the great majority of the boroughs firmly refused to give up their privileges Barnstaple Winchester and Buckingham distinguished themselves by the boldness of their opposition At Oxford the motion that the city should resign its franchises to the King was negatived by eighty votes to two three hundred forty seven The Temple and Westminster Hall were in a ferment with the sudden rush of business from all corners of the kingdom Every lawyer in high practice was overwhelmed with the briefs from corporations Ordinary litigants complained that their business was neglected three hundred forty eight It was evident that a considerable time must elapse before judgment could be given in so great a number of important cases Tyranny could ill brook this delay Nothing was omitted which could terrify the refractory boroughs into submission At Buckingham some of the municipal officers had spoken of Jeffreys in language which was not laudatory They were prosecuted and were given to understand that no mercy should be shown to them unless they would ransom themselves by surrendering their charter three hundred forty nine At Winchester still more violent measures were adopted A large body of troops was marched into the town for the sole purpose of burdening and harassing the inhabitants three hundred fifty The town continued resolute and the public voice loudly accused the King of imitating the worst crimes of his brother of France The dragonades it was said had begun There was indeed reason for alarm It had occurred to James that he could not more effectually break the spirit of an obstinate town than by quartering soldiers on the inhabitants He must have known that this practice had sixty years before excited formidable discontents and had been solemnly pronounced illegal by the Petition of Right a statute scarcely less venerated by Englishmen than the Great Charter But he hoped to obtain from the courts of law a declaration that even the Petition of Right could not control the prerogative He actually consulted the Chief justice of the King s Bench on this subject three hundred fifty one but the result of the consultation remained secret and in a very few weeks the aspect of affairs became such that a fear stronger than even the fear of the royal displeasure began to impose some restraint even on a man so servile as Wright While the Lords Lieutenants were questioning the justices of the Peace while the regulators were remodelling the boroughs all the public departments were subjected to a strict inquisition The palace was first purified Every battered old Cavalier who in return for blood and lands lost in the royal cause had obtained some small place under the Keeper of the Wardrobe or the Master of the Harriers was called upon to choose between the King and the Church The Commissioners of Customs and Excise were ordered to attend His Majesty at the Treasury There he demanded from them a promise to support his policy and directed them to require a similar promise from all their subordinates three hundred fifty two One Customhouse officer notified his submission to the royal will in a way which excited both merriment and compassion I have he said fourteen reasons for obeying His Majesty s commands a wife and thirteen young children three hundred fifty three Such reasons were indeed cogent yet there were not a few instances in which even against such reasons religious and patriotic feelings prevailed There is reason to believe that the government at this time seriously meditated a blow which would have reduced many thousands of families to beggary and would have disturbed the whole social system of every part of the country No wine beer or coffee could be sold without a license It was rumoured that every person holding such a license would shortly be required to enter into the same engagements which had been imposed on public functionaries or to relinquish his trade three hundred fifty four It seems certain that if such a step had been taken the houses of entertainment and of public resort all over the kingdom would have been at once shut up by hundreds What effect such an interference with the comfort of all ranks would have produced must be left to conjecture The resentment produced by grievances is not always proportioned to their dignity and it is by no means improbable that the resumption of licenses might have done what the resumption of charters had failed to do Men of fashion would have missed the chocolate house in Saint James s Street and men of business the coffee pot round which they were accustomed to smoke and talk politics in Change Alley Half the clubs would have been wandering in search of shelter The traveller at nightfall would have found the inn where he had expected to sup and lodge deserted The clown would have regretted the hedge alehouse where he had been accustomed to take his pot on the bench before the door in summer and at the chimney corner in winter The nation might perhaps under such provocation have risen in general rebellion without waiting for the help of foreign allies It was not to be expected that a prince who required all the humblest servants of the government to support his policy on pain of dismission would continue to employ an Attorney General whose aversion to that policy was no secret Sawyer had been suffered to retain his situation more than a year and a half after he had declared against the dispensing power This extraordinary indulgence he owed to the extreme difficulty which the government found in supplying his place It was necessary for the protection of the pecuniary interests of the crown that at least one of the two chief law officers should be a man of ability and knowledge and it was by no means easy to induce any barrister of ability and knowledge to put himself in peril by committing every day acts which the next Parliament would probably treat as high crimes and misdemeanours It had been impossible to procure a better Solicitor General than Powis a man who indeed stuck at nothing but who was incompetent to perform the ordinary duties of his post In these circumstances it was thought desirable that there should be a division of labour An Attorney the value of whose professional talents was much diminished by his conscientious scruples was coupled with a Solicitor whose want of scruples made some amends for his want of talents When the government wished to enforce the law recourse was had to Sawyer When the government wished to break the law recourse was had to Powis This arrangement lasted till the king obtained the services of an advocate who was at once baser than Powis and abler than Sawyer No barrister living had opposed the court with more virulence than William Williams He had distinguished himself in the late reign as a Whig and an Exclusionist When faction was at the height he had been chosen Speaker of the House of Commons After the prorogation of the Oxford Parliament he had commonly been counsel for the most noisy demagogues who had been accused of sedition He was allowed to possess considerable quickness and knowledge His chief faults were supposed to be rashness and party spirit It was not yet suspected that he had faults compared with which rashness and party spirit might well pass for virtues The government sought occasion against him and easily found it He had published by order of the House of Commons a narrative which Dangerfield had written This narrative if published by a private man would undoubtedly have been a seditious libel A criminal information was filed in the King s Bench against Williams he pleaded the privileges of Parliament in vain he was convicted and sentenced to a fine of ten thousand pounds A large part of this sum he actually paid for the rest he gave a bond The Earl of Peterborough who had been injuriously mentioned in Dangerfield s narrative was encouraged by the success of the criminal information to bring a civil action and to demand large damages Williams was driven to extremity At this juncture a way of escape presented itself It was indeed a way which to a man of strong principles or high spirit would have been more dreadful than beggary imprisonment or death He might sell himself to that government of which he had been the enemy and the victim He might offer to go on the forlorn hope in every assault on those liberties and on that religion for which he had professed an inordinate zeal He might expiate his Whiggism by performing services from which bigoted Tories stained with the blood of Russell and Sidney shrank in horror The bargain was struck The debt still due to the crown was remitted Peterborough was induced by royal mediation to compromise his action Sawyer was dismissed Powis became Attorney General Williams was made Solicitor received the honour of knighthood and was soon a favourite Though in rank he was only the second law officer of the crown his abilities learning and energy were such that he completely threw his superior into the shade three hundred fifty five Williams had not been long in office when he was required to bear a chief part in the most memorable state trial recorded in the British annals On the twenty seventh of April sixteen eighty eight the King put forth a second Declaration of Indulgence In this paper he recited at length the Declaration of the preceding April His past life he said ought to have convinced his people that he was not a person who could easily be induced to depart from any resolution which he had formed But as designing men had attempted to persuade the world that he might be prevailed on to give way in this matter he thought it necessary to proclaim that his purpose was immutably fixed that he was resolved to employ those only who were prepared to concur in his design and that he had in pursuance of that resolution dismissed many of his disobedient servants from civil and military employments He announced that he meant to hold a Parliament in November at the latest and he exhorted his subjects to choose representatives who would assist him in the great work which he had undertaken three hundred fifty six This Declaration at first produced little sensation It contained nothing new and men wondered that the King should think it worth while to publish a solemn manifesto merely for the purpose of telling them that he had not changed his mind three hundred fifty seven Perhaps James was nettled by the indifference with which the announcement of his fixed resolution was received by the public and thought that his dignity and authority would suffer unless he without delay did something novel and striking On the fourth of May accordingly he made an Order in Council that his Declaration of the preceding week should be read on two successive Sundays at the time of divine service by the officiating ministers of all the churches and chapels of the kingdom In London and in the suburbs the reading was to take place on the twentieth and twenty seventh of May in other parts of England on the third and tenth of June The Bishops were directed to distribute copies of the Declaration through their respective dioceses three hundred fifty eight When it is considered that the clergy of the Established Church with scarcely an exception regarded the Indulgence as a violation of the laws of the realm as a breach of the plighted faith of the King and as a fatal blow levelled at the interest and dignity of their own profession it will scarcely admit of doubt that the Order in Council was intended to be felt by them as a cruel affront It was popularly believed that Petre had avowed this intention in a coarse metaphor borrowed from the rhetoric of the East He would he said make them eat dirt the vilest and most loathsome of all dirt But tyrannical and malignant as the mandate was would the Anglican priesthood refuse to obey The King s temper was arbitrary and severe The proceedings of the Ecclesiastical Commission were as summary as those of a court martial Whoever ventured to resist might in a week be ejected from his parsonage deprived of his whole income pronounced incapable of holding any other spiritual preferment and left to beg from door to door If indeed the whole body offered an united opposition to the royal will it was probable that even James would scarcely venture to punish ten thousand delinquents at once But there was not time to form an extensive combination The Order in Council was gazetted on the seventh of May On the twentieth the Declaration was to be read in all the pulpits of London and the neighbourhood By no exertion was it possible in that age to ascertain within a fortnight the intentions of one tenth part of the parochial ministers who were scattered over the kingdom It was not easy to collect in so short a time the sense even of the episcopal order It might also well be apprehended that if the clergy refused to read the Declaration the Protestant Dissenters would misinterpret the refusal would despair of obtaining any toleration from the members of the Church of England and would throw their whole weight into the scale of the court The clergy therefore hesitated and this hesitation may well be excused for some eminent laymen who possessed a large share of the public confidence were disposed to recommend submission They thought that a general opposition could hardly be expected and that a partial opposition would be ruinous to individuals and of little advantage to the Church and to the nation Such was the opinion given at this time by Halifax and Nottingham The day drew near and still there was no concert and no formed resolution three hundred fifty nine At this conjuncture the Protestant Dissenters of London won for themselves a title to the lasting gratitude of their country They had hitherto been reckoned by the government as part of its strength A few of their most active and noisy preachers corrupted by the favours of the court had got up addresses in favour of the King s policy Others estranged by the recollection of many cruel wrongs both from the Church of England and from the House of Stuart had seen with resentful pleasure the tyrannical prince and the tyrannical hierarchy separated by a bitter enmity and bidding against each other for the help of sects lately persecuted and despised But this feeling however natural had been indulged long enough The time had come when it was necessary to make a choice and the Nonconformists of the City with a noble spirit arrayed themselves side by side with the members of the Church in defence of the fundamental laws of the realm Baxter Bates and Howe distinguished themselves by their efforts to bring about this coalition but the generous enthusiasm which pervaded the whole Puritan body made the task easy The zeal of the flocks outran that of the pastors Those Presbyterian and Independent teachers who showed an inclination to take part with the King against the ecclesiastical establishment received distinct notice that unless they changed their conduct their congregations would neither hear them nor pay them Alsop who had flattered himself that he should be able to bring over a great body of his disciples to the royal side found himself on a sudden an object of contempt and abhorrence to those who had lately revered him as their spiritual guide sank into a deep melancholy and hid himself from the public eye Deputations waited on several of the London clergy imploring them not to judge of the dissenting body from the servile adulation which had lately filled the London Gazette and exhorting them placed as they were in the van of this great fight to play the men for the liberties of England and for the faith delivered to the Saints These assurances were received with joy and gratitude Yet there was still much anxiety and much difference of opinion among those who had to decide whether on Sunday the twentieth they would or would not obey the King s command The London clergy then universally acknowledged to be the flower of their profession held a meeting Fifteen Doctors of Divinity were present Tillotson Dean of Canterbury the most celebrated preacher of the age came thither from a sick bed Sherlock Master of the Temple Patrick Dean of Peterborough and Rector of the important parish of saint Paul s Covent Garden and Stillingfleet Archdeacon of London and Dean of saint Paul s Cathedral attended The general feeling of the assembly seemed to be that it was on the whole advisable to obey the Order in Council The dispute began to wax warm and might have produced fatal consequences if it had not been brought to a close by the firmness and wisdom of Doctor Edward Fowler Vicar of saint Giles s Cripplegate one of a small but remarkable class of divines who united that love of civil liberty which belonged to the school of Calvin with the theology of the school of Arminius three hundred sixty Standing up Fowler spoke thus I must be plain The question is so simple that argument can throw no new light on it and can only beget heat Let every man say Yes or No But I cannot consent to be bound by the vote of the majority I shall be sorry to cause a breach of unity But this Declaration I cannot in conscience read Tillotson Patrick Sherlock and Stillingfleet declared that they were of the same mind The majority yielded to the authority of a minority so respectable A resolution by which all present pledged themselves to one another not to read the Declaration was then drawn up Patrick was the first who set his hand to it Fowler was the second The paper was sent round the city and was speedily subscribed by eighty five incumbents three hundred sixty one Meanwhile several of the Bishops were anxiously deliberating as to the course which they should take On the twelfth of May a grave and learned company was assembled round the table of the Primate at Lambeth Compton Bishop of London Turner Bishop of Ely White Bishop of Peterborough and Tenison Rector of saint Martin s parish were among the guests The Earl of Clarendon a zealous and uncompromising friend of the Church had been invited Cartwright Bishop of Chester intruded himself on the meeting probably as a spy While he remained no confidential communication could take place but after his departure the great question of which all minds were full was propounded and discussed The general opinion was that the Declaration ought not to be read Letters were forthwith written to several of the most respectable prelates of the province of Canterbury entreating them to come up without delay to London and to strengthen the hands of their metropolitan at this conjuncture three hundred sixty two As there was little doubt that these letters would be opened if they passed through the office in Lombard Street they were sent by horsemen to the nearest country post towns on the different roads The Bishop of Winchester whose loyalty had been so signally proved at Sedgemoor though suffering from indisposition resolved to set out in obedience to the summons but found himself unable to bear the motion of a coach The letter addressed to William Lloyd Bishop of Norwich was in spite of all precautions detained by a postmaster and that prelate inferior to none of his brethren in courage and in zeal for the common cause of his order did not reach London in time three hundred sixty three His namesake William Lloyd Bishop of saint Asaph a pious honest and learned man but of slender judgment and half crazed by his persevering endeavours to extract from Daniel and the Revelations some information about the Pope and the King of France hastened to the capital and arrived on the sixteenth three hundred sixty four On the following day came the excellent Ken Bishop of Bath and Wells Lake Bishop of Chichester and Sir John Trelawney Bishop of Bristol a baronet of an old and honourable Cornish family On the eighteenth a meeting of prelates and of other eminent divines was held at Lambeth Tillotson Tenison Stillingfleet Patrick and Sherlock were present Prayers were solemnly read before the consultation began After long deliberation a petition embodying the general sense was written by the Archbishop with his own hand It was not drawn up with much felicity of style Indeed the cumbrous and inelegant structure of the sentences brought on Sancroft some raillery which he bore with less patience than he showed under much heavier trials But in substance nothing could be more skilfully framed than this memorable document All disloyalty all intolerance was earnestly disclaimed The King was assured that the Church still was as she had ever been faithful to the throne He was assured also that the Bishops would in proper place and time as Lords of Parliament and members of the Upper House of Convocation show that they by no means wanted tenderness for the conscientious scruples of Dissenters But Parliament had both in the late and in the present reign pronounced that the sovereign was not constitutionally competent to dispense with statutes in matters ecclesiastical The Declaration was therefore illegal and the petitioners could not in prudence honour or conscience be parties to the solemn publication of an illegal Declaration in the house of God and during the time of divine service This paper was signed by the Archbishop and by six of his suffragans Lloyd of saint Asaph Turner of Ely Lake of Chichester Ken of Bath and Wells White of Peterborough and Trelawney of Bristol The Bishop of London being under suspension did not sign It was now late on Friday evening and on Sunday morning the Declaration was to be read in the churches of London It was necessary to put the paper into the King s hands without delay The six Bishops set off for Whitehall The Archbishop who had long been forbidden the court did not accompany them Lloyd leaving his five brethren at the house of Lord Dartmouth in the vicinity of the palace went to Sunderland and begged that minister to read the petition and to ascertain when the King would be willing to receive it Sunderland afraid of compromising himself refused to look at the paper but went immediately to the royal closet James directed that the Bishops should be admitted He had heard from his tool Cartwright that they were disposed to obey the royal mandate but that they wished for some little modifications in form and that they meant to present a humble request to that effect His Majesty was therefore in very good humour When they knelt before him he graciously told them to rise took the paper from Lloyd and said This is my Lord of Canterbury s hand Yes sir his own hand was the answer James read the petition he folded it up and his countenance grew dark This he said is a great surprise to me I did not expect this from your Church especially from some of you This is a standard of rebellion The Bishops broke out into passionate professions of loyalty but the King as usual repeated the same words over and over I tell you this is a standard of rebellion Rebellion cried Trelawney falling on his knees For God s sake sir do not say so hard a thing of us No Trelawney can be a rebel Remember that my family has fought for the crown Remember how I served your Majesty when Monmouth was in the West We put down the last rebellion said Lake we shall not raise another We rebel exclaimed Turner we are ready to die at your Majesty s feet Sir said Ken in a more manly tone I hope that you will grant to us that liberty of conscience which you grant to all mankind Still James went on This is rebellion This is a standard of rebellion Did ever a good Churchman question the dispensing power before Have not some of you preached for it and written for it It is a standard of rebellion I will have my Declaration published We have two duties to perform answered Ken our duty to God and our duty to your Majesty We honour you but we fear God Have I deserved this said the King more and more angry I who have been such a friend to your Church I did not expect this from some of you I will be obeyed My Declaration shall be published You are trumpeters of sedition What do you do here Go to your dioceses and see that I am obeyed I will keep this paper I will not part with it I will remember you that have signed it God s will be done said Ken God has given me the dispensing power said the King and I will maintain it I tell you that there are still seven thousand of your Church who have not bowed the knee to Baal The Bishops respectfully retired three hundred sixty five That very evening the document which they had put into the hands of the King appeared word for word in print was laid on the tables of all the coffeehouses and was cried about the streets Everywhere the people rose from their beds and came out to stop the hawkers It was said that the printer cleared a thousand pounds in a few hours by this penny broadside This is probably an exaggeration but it is an exaggeration which proves that the sale was enormous How the petition got abroad is still a mystery Sancroft declared that he had taken every precaution against publication and that he knew of no copy except that which he had himself written and which James had taken out of Lloyd s hand The veracity of the Archbishop is beyond all suspicion It is however by no means improbable that some of the divines who assisted in framing the petition may have remembered so short a composition accurately and may have sent it to the press The prevailing opinion however was that some person about the King had been indiscreet or treacherous three hundred sixty six Scarcely less sensation was produced by a short letter which was written with great power of argument and language printed secretly and largely circulated on the same day by the post and by the common carriers A copy was sent to every clergyman in the kingdom The writer did not attempt to disguise the danger which those who disobeyed the royal mandate would incur but he set forth in a lively manner the still greater danger of submission If we read the Declaration said he we fall to rise no more We fall unpitied and despised We fall amidst the curses of a nation whom our compliance will have ruined Some thought that this paper came from Holland Others attributed it to Sherlock But Prideaux Dean of Norwich who was a principal agent in distributing it believed it to be the work of Halifax The conduct of the prelates was rapturously extolled by the general voice but some murmurs were heard It was said that such grave men if they thought themselves bound in conscience to remonstrate with the King ought to have remonstrated earlier Was it fair to him to leave him in the dark till within thirty six hours of the time fixed for the reading of the Declaration Even if he wished to revoke the Order in Council it was too late to do so The inference seemed to be that the petition was intended not to move the royal mind but merely to inflame the discontents of the people three hundred sixty seven These complaints were utterly groundless The King had laid on the Bishops a command new surprising and embarrassing It was their duty to communicate with each other and to ascertain as far as possible the sense of the profession of which they were the heads before they took any step They were dispersed over the whole kingdom Some of them were distant from others a full week s journey James allowed them only a fortnight to inform themselves to meet to deliberate and to decide and he surely had no right to think himself aggrieved because that fortnight was drawing to a close before he learned their decision Nor is it true that they did not leave him time to revoke his order if he had been wise enough to do so He might have called together his Council on Saturday morning and before night it might have been known throughout London and the suburbs that he had yielded to the intreaties of the fathers of the Church The Saturday however passed over without any sign of relenting on the part of the government and the Sunday arrived a day long remembered In the City and Liberties of London were about a hundred parish churches In only four of these was the Order in Council obeyed At Saint Gregory s the Declaration was read by a divine of the name of Martin As soon as he uttered the first words the whole congregation rose and withdrew At Saint Matthew s in Friday Street a wretch named Timothy Hall who had disgraced his gown by acting as broker for the Duchess of Portsmouth in the sale of pardons and who now had hopes of obtaining the vacant bishopric of Oxford was in like manner left alone in his church At Serjeant s Inn in Chancery Lane the clerk pretended that he had forgotten to bring a copy and the Chief justice of the King s Bench who had attended in order to see that the royal mandate was obeyed was forced to content himself with this excuse Samuel Wesley the father of John and Charles Wesley a curate in London took for his text that day the noble answer of the three Jews to the Chaldean tyrant Be it known unto thee O King that we will not serve thy gods nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up Even in the chapel of Saint James s Palace the officiating minister had the courage to disobey the order The Westminster boys long remembered what took place that day in the Abbey Sprat Bishop of Rochester officiated there as Dean As soon as he began to read the Declaration murmurs and the noise of people crowding out of the choir drowned his voice He trembled so violently that men saw the paper shake in his hand Long before he had finished the place was deserted by all but those whose situation made it necessary for them to remain three hundred sixty eight Never had the Church been so dear to the nation as on the afternoon of that day The spirit of dissent seemed to be extinct Baxter from his pulpit pronounced an eulogium on the Bishops and parochial clergy The Dutch minister a few hours later wrote to inform the States General that the Anglican priesthood had risen in the estimation of the public to an incredible degree The universal cry of the Nonconformists he said was that they would rather continue to lie under the penal statutes than separate their cause from that of the prelates three hundred sixty nine Another week of anxiety and agitation passed away Sunday came again Again the churches of the capital were thronged by hundreds of thousands The Declaration was read nowhere except at the very few places where it had been read the week before The minister who had officiated at the chapel in Saint James s Palace had been turned out of his situation and a more obsequious divine appeared with the paper in his hand but his agitation was so great that he could not articulate In truth the feeling of the whole nation had now become such as none but the very best and noblest or the very worst and basest of mankind could without much discomposure encounter three hundred seventy Even the King stood aghast for a moment at the violence of the tempest which he had raised What step was he next to take He must either advance or recede and it was impossible to advance without peril or to recede without humiliation At one moment he determined to put forth a second order enjoining the clergy in high and angry terms to publish his Declaration and menacing every one who should be refractory with instant suspension This order was drawn up and sent to the press then recalled then a second time sent to the press then recalled a second time three hundred seventy one A different plan was suggested by some of those who were for rigorous measures The prelates who had signed the petition might be cited before the Ecclesiastical Commission and deprived of their sees But to this course strong objections were urged in Council It had been announced that the Houses would be convoked before the end of the year The Lords would assuredly treat the sentence of deprivation as a nullity would insist that Sancroft and his fellow petitioners should be summoned to Parliament and would refuse to acknowledge a new Archbishop of Canterbury or a new Bishop of Bath and Wells Thus the session which at best was likely to be sufficiently stormy would commence with a deadly quarrel between the crown and the peers If therefore it were thought necessary to punish the Bishops the punishment ought to be inflicted according to the known course of English law Sunderland had from the beginning objected as far as he dared to the Order in Council He now suggested a course which though not free from inconveniences was the most prudent and the most dignified that a series of errors had left open to the government The King might with grace and majesty announce to the world that he was deeply hurt by the undutiful conduct of the Church of England but that he could not forget all the services rendered by that Church in trying times to his father to his brother and to himself that as a friend to the liberty of conscience he was unwilling to deal severely by men whom conscience ill informed indeed and unreasonably scrupulous might have prevented from obeying his commands and that he would therefore leave the offenders to that punishment which their own reflections would inflict whenever they should calmly compare their recent acts with the loyal doctrines of which they had so loudly boasted Not only Powis and Bellasyse who had always been for moderate counsels but even Dover and Arundell leaned towards this proposition Jeffreys on the other hand maintained that the government would be disgraced if such transgressors as the seven Bishops were suffered to escape with a mere reprimand He did not however wish them to be cited before the Ecclesiastical Commission in which he sate as chief or rather as sole judge For the load of public hatred under which he already lay was too much even for his shameless forehead and obdurate heart and he shrank from the responsibility which he would have incurred by pronouncing an illegal sentence on the rulers of the Church and the favourites of the nation He therefore recommended a criminal information It was accordingly resolved that the Archbishop and the six other petititioners should be brought before the Court of King s Bench on a charge of seditious libel That they would be convicted it was scarcely possible to doubt The judges and their officers were tools of the court Since the old charter of the City of London had been forfeited scarcely one prisoner whom the government was bent on bringing to punishment had been absolved by a jury The refractory prelates would probably be condemned to ruinous fines and to long imprisonment and would be glad to ransom themselves by serving both in and out of Parliament the designs of the Sovereign three hundred seventy two On the twenty seventh of May it was notified to the Bishops that on the eighth of June they must appear before the King in Council Why so long an interval was allowed we are not informed Perhaps James hoped that some of the offenders terrified by his displeasure might submit before the day fixed for the reading of the Declaration in their dioceses and might in order to make their peace with him persuade their clergy to obey his order If such was his hope it was signally disappointed Sunday the third of June came and all parts of England followed the example of the capital Already the Bishops of Norwich Gloucester Salisbury Winchester and Exeter had signed copies of the petition in token of their approbation The Bishop of Worcester had refused to distribute the Declaration among his clergy The Bishop of Hereford had distributed it but it was generally understood that he was overwhelmed by remorse and shame for having done so Not one parish priest in fifty complied with the Order in Council In the great diocese of Chester including the county of Lancaster only three clergymen could be prevailed on by Cartwright to obey the King In the diocese of Norwich are many hundreds of parishes In only four of these was the Declaration read The courtly Bishop of Rochester could not overcome the scruples of the minister of the ordinary of Chatham who depended on the government for bread There is still extant a pathetic letter which this honest priest sent to the Secretary of the Admiralty I cannot he wrote reasonably expect your Honour s protection God s will be done I must choose suffering rather than sin three hundred seventy three On the evening of the eighth of June the seven prelates furnished by the ablest lawyers in England with full advice repaired to the palace and were called into the Council chamber Their petition was lying on the table The Chancellor took the paper up showed it to the Archbishop and said Is this the paper which your Grace wrote and which the six Bishops present delivered to his Majesty Sancroft looked at the paper turned to the King and spoke thus Sir I stand here a culprit I never was so before Once I little thought that I ever should be so Least of all could I think that I should be charged with any offence against my King but since I am so unhappy as to be in this situation your Majesty will not be offended if I avail myself of my lawful right to decline saying anything which may criminate me This is mere chicanery said the King I hope that your Grace will not do so ill a thing as to deny your own hand Sir said Lloyd whose studies had been much among the casuists all divines agree that a person situated as we are may refuse to answer such a question The King as slow of understanding as quick of temper could not comprehend what the prelates meant He persisted and was evidently becoming very angry Sir said the Archbishop I am not bound to accuse myself Nevertheless if your Majesty positively commands me to answer I will do so in the confidence that a just and generous prince will not suffer what I say in obedience to his orders to be brought in evidence against me You must not capitulate with your Sovereign said the Chancellor No said the King I will not give any such command If you choose to deny your own hands I have nothing more to say to you The Bishops were repeatedly sent out into the antechamber and repeatedly called back into the Council room At length James positively commanded them to answer the question He did not expressly engage that their confession should not be used against them But they not unnaturally supposed that after what had passed such an engagement was implied in his command Sancroft acknowledged his handwriting and his brethren followed his example They were then interrogated about the meaning of some words in the petition and about the letter which had been circulated with so much effect all over the kingdom but their language was so guarded that nothing was gained by the examination The Chancellor then told them that a criminal information would be exhibited against them in the Court of King s Bench and called upon them to enter into recognisances They refused They were peers of the realm they said They were advised by the best lawyers in Westminster Hall that no peer could be required to enter into a recognisance in a case of libel and they should not think themselves justified in relinquishing the privilege of their order The King was so absurd as to think himself personally affronted because they chose on a legal question to be guided by legal advice You believe everybody he said rather than me He was indeed mortified and alarmed For he had gone so far that if they persisted he had no choice left but to send them to prison and though he by no means foresaw all the consequences of such a step he foresaw probably enough to disturb him They were resolute A warrant was therefore made out directing the Lieutenant of the Tower to keep them in safe custody and a barge was manned to convey them down the river three hundred seventy four It was known all over London that the Bishops were before the Council The public anxiety was intense A great multitude filled the courts of Whitehall and all the neighbouring streets Many people were in the habit of refreshing themselves at the close of a summer day with the cool air of the Thames But on this evening the whole river was alive with wherries When the Seven came forth under a guard the emotions of the people broke through all restraint Thousands fell on their knees and prayed aloud for the men who had with the Christian courage of Ridley and Latimer confronted a tyrant inflamed by all the bigotry of Mary Many dashed into the stream and up to their waists in ooze and water cried to the holy fathers to bless them All down the river from Whitehall to London Bridge the royal barge passed between lines of boats from which arose a shout of God bless your Lordships The King in great alarm gave orders that the garrison of the Tower should be doubled that the Guards should be held ready for action and that two companies should be detached from every regiment in the kingdom and sent up instantly to London But the force on which he relied as the means of coercing the people shared all the feelings of the people The very sentinels who were under arms at the Traitors Gate reverently asked for a blessing from the martyrs whom they were to guard Sir Edward Hales was Lieutenant of the Tower He was little inclined to treat his prisoners with kindness For he was an apostate from that Church for which they suffered and he held several lucrative posts by virtue of that dispensing power against which they had protested He learned with indignation that his soldiers were drinking the health of the Bishops He ordered his officers to see that it was done no more But the officers came back with a report that the thing could not be prevented and that no other health was drunk in the garrison Nor was it only by carousing that the troops showed their reverence for the fathers of the Church There was such a show of devotion throughout the Tower that pious divines thanked God for bringing good out of evil and for making the persecution of His faithful servants the means of saving many souls All day the coaches and liveries of the first nobles of England were seen round the prison gates Thousands of humbler spectators constantly covered Tower Hill three hundred seventy five But among the marks of public respect and sympathy which the prelates received there was one which more than all the rest enraged and alarmed the King He learned that a deputation of ten Nonconformist ministers had visited the Tower He sent for four of these persons and himself upbraided them They courageously answered that they thought it their duty to forget past quarrels and to stand by the men who stood by the Protestant religion three hundred seventy six Scarcely had the gates of the Tower been closed on the prisoners when an event took place which increased the public excitement It had been announced that the Queen did not expect to be delivered till July But on the day after the Bishops had appeared before the Council it was observed that the King seemed to be anxious about her state In the evening however she sate playing cards at Whitehall till near midnight Then she was carried in a sedan to Saint James s Palace where apartments had been very hastily fitted up for her reception Soon messengers were running about in all directions to summon physicians and priests Lords of the Council and Ladies of the Bedchamber In a few hours many public functionaries and women of rank were assembled in the Queen s room There on the morning of Sunday the tenth of June a day long kept sacred by the too faithful adherents of a bad cause was born the most unfortunate of princes destined to seventy seven years of exile and wandering of vain projects of honours more galling than insults and of hopes such as make the heart sick The calamities of the poor child had begun before his birth The nation over which according to the ordinary course of succession he would have reigned was fully persuaded that his mother was not really pregnant By whatever evidence the fact of his birth had been proved a considerable number of people would probably have persisted in maintaining that the Jesuits had practised some skilful sleight of hand and the evidence partly from accident partly from gross mismanagement was open to some objections Many persons of both sexes were in the royal bedchamber when the child first saw the light but none of them enjoyed any large measure of public confidence Of the Privy Councillors present half were Roman Catholics and those who called themselves Protestants were generally regarded as traitors to their country and their God Many of the women in attendance were French Italian and Portuguese Of the English ladies some were Papists and some were the wives of Papists Some persons who were peculiarly entitled to be present and whose testimony would have satisfied all minds accessible to reason were absent and for their absence the King was held responsible The Princess Anne was of all the inhabitants of the island the most deeply interested in the event Her sex and her experience qualified her to act as the guardian of her sister s birthright and her own She had conceived strong suspicions which were daily confirmed by circumstances trifling or imaginary She fancied that the Queen carefully shunned her scrutiny and ascribed to guilt a reserve which was perhaps the effect of delicacy three hundred seventy seven In this temper Anne had determined to be present and vigilant when the critical day should arrive But she had not thought it necessary to be at her post a month before that day and had in compliance it was said with her father s advice gone to drink the Bath waters Sancroft whose great place made it his duty to attend and on whose probity the nation placed entire reliance had a few hours before been sent to the Tower by James The Hydes were the proper protectors of the rights of the two Princesses The Dutch Ambassador might be regarded as the representative of William who as first prince of the blood and consort of the King s eldest daughter had a deep interest in what was passing James never thought of summoning any member male or female of the family of Hyde nor was the Dutch Ambassador invited to be present Posterity has fully acquitted the King of the fraud which his people imputed to him But it is impossible to acquit him of folly and perverseness such as explain and excuse the error of his contemporaries He was perfectly aware of the suspicions which were abroad three hundred seventy eight He ought to have known that those suspicions would not be dispelled by the evidence of members of the Church of Rome or of persons who though they might call themselves members of the Church of England had shown themselves ready to sacrifice the interests of the Church of England in order to obtain his favour That he was taken by surprise is true But he had twelve hours to make his arrangements He found no difficulty in crowding saint James s Palace with bigots and sycophants on whose word the nation placed no reliance It would have been quite as easy to procure the attendance of some eminent persons whose attachment to the Princesses and to the established religion was unquestionable At a later period when he had paid dearly for his foolhardy contempt of public opinion it was the fashion at Saint Germains to excuse him by throwing the blame on others Some Jacobites charged Anne with having purposely kept out of the way Nay they were not ashamed to say that Sancroft had provoked the King to send him to the Tower in order that the evidence which was to confound the calumnies of the malecontents might be defective three hundred seventy nine The absurdity of these imputations is palpable Could Anne or Sancroft possibly have foreseen that the Queen s calculations would turn out to be erroneous by a whole month Had those calculations been correct Anne would have been back from Bath and Sancroft would have been out of the Tower in ample time for the birth At all events the maternal uncles of the King s daughters were neither at a distance nor in a prison The same messenger who summoned the whole bevy of renegades Dover Peterborough Murray Sunderland and Mulgrave could just as easily have summoned Clarendon If they were Privy Councillors so was he His house was in Jermyn Street not two hundred yards from the chamber of the Queen Yet he was left to learn at saint James s Church from the agitation and whispers of the congregation that his niece had ceased to be heiress presumptive of the crown three hundred eighty Was it a disqualification that he was the near kinsman of the Princesses of Orange and Denmark Or was it a disqualification that he was unalterably attached to the Church of England The cry of the whole nation was that an imposture bad been practised Papists had during some months been predicting from the pulpit and through the press in prose and verse in English and Latin that a Prince of Wales would be given to the prayers of the Church and they had now accomplished their own prophecy Every witness who could not be corrupted or deceived had been studiously excluded Anne had been tricked into visiting Bath The Primate had on the very day preceding that which had been fixed for the villainy been sent to prison in defiance of the rules of law and of the privileges of peerage Not a single man or woman who had the smallest interest in detecting the fraud had been suffered to be present The Queen had been removed suddenly and at the dead of night to saint James s Palace because that building less commodious for honest purposes than Whitehall had some rooms and passages well suited for the purpose of the Jesuits There amidst a circle of zealots who thought nothing a crime that tended to promote the interests of their Church and of courtiers who thought nothing a crime that tended to enrich and aggrandise themselves a new born child had been introduced into the royal bed and then handed round in triumph as heir of the three kingdoms Heated by such suspicions suspicions unjust it is true but not altogether unnatural men thronged more eagerly than ever to pay their homage to the saintly victims of the tyrant who having long foully injured his people had now filled up the measure of his iniquities by more foully injuring his children three hundred eighty one The Prince of Orange not himself suspecting any trick and not aware of the state of public feeling in England ordered prayers to be said under his own roof for his little brother in law and sent Zulestein to London with a formal message of congratulation Zulestein to his amazement found all the people whom he met open mouthed about the infamous fraud just committed by the Jesuits and saw every hour some fresh pasquinade on the pregnancy and the delivery He soon wrote to the Hague that not one person in ten believed the child to have been born of the Queen three hundred eighty two The demeanour of the seven prelates meanwhile strengthened the interest which their situation excited On the evening of the Black Friday as it was called on which they were committed they reached their prison just at the hour of divine service They instantly hastened to the chapel It chanced that in the second lesson were these words In all things approving ourselves as the ministers of God in much patience in afflictions in distresses in stripes in imprisonments All zealous Churchmen were delighted by this coincidence and remembered how much comfort a similar coincidence had given near forty years before to Charles the First at the time of his death On the evening of the next day Saturday the ninth a letter came from Sunderland enjoining the chaplain of the Tower to read the Declaration during divine service on the following morning As the time fixed by the Order in Council for the reading in London had long expired this proceeding of the government could be considered only as a personal insult of the meanest and most childish kind to the venerable prisoners The chaplain refused to comply he was dismissed from his situation and the chapel was shut up three hundred eighty three The Bishops edified all who approached them by the firmness and cheerfulness with which they endured confinement by the modesty and meekness with which they received the applauses and blessings of the whole nation and by the loyal attachment which they professed for the persecutor who sought their destruction They remained only a week in custody On Friday the fifteenth of June the first day of term they were brought before the King s Bench An immense throng awaited their coming From the landingplace to the Court of Requests they passed through a lane of spectators who blessed and applauded them Friends said the prisoners as they passed honour the King and remember us in your prayers These humble and pious expressions moved the hearers even to tears When at length the procession had made its way through the crowd into the presence of the judges the Attorney General exhibited the information which he had been commanded to prepare and moved that the defendants might be ordered to plead The counsel on the other side objected that the Bishops had been unlawfully committed and were therefore not regularly before the Court The question whether a peer could be required to enter into recognisances on a charge of libel was argued at great length and decided by a majority of judges in favour of the crown The prisoners then pleaded Not Guilty That day fortnight the twenty ninth of June was fixed for their trial In the meantime they were allowed to be at large on their own recognisances The crown lawyers acted prudently in not requiring sureties For Halifax had arranged that twenty one temporal peers of the highest consideration should be ready to put in bail three for each defendant and such a manifestation of the feeling of the nobility would have been no slight blow to the government It was also known that one of the most opulent Dissenters of the City had begged that he might have the honour of giving security for Ken The Bishops were now permitted to depart to their own homes The common people who did not understand the nature of the legal proceedings which had taken place in the King s Bench and who saw that their favourites had been brought to Westminster Hall in custody and were suffered to go away in freedom imagined that the good cause was prospering Loud acclamations were raised The steeples of the churches sent forth joyous peals Sprat was amazed to hear the bells of his own Abbey ringing merrily He promptly silenced them but his interference caused much angry muttering The Bishops found it difficult to escape from the importunate crowd of their wellwishers Lloyd was detained in Palace Yard by admirers who struggled to touch his hands and to kiss the skirt of his robe till Clarendon with some difficulty rescued him and conveyed him home by a bye path Cartwright it is said was so unwise as to mingle with the crowd Some person who saw his episcopal habit asked and received his blessing A bystander cried out Do you know who blessed you Surely said he who had just been honoured by the benediction it was one of the Seven No said the other it is the Popish Bishop of Chester Popish dog cried the enraged Protestant take your blessing back again Such was the concourse and such the agitation that the Dutch Ambassador was surprised to see the day close without an insurrection The King had been by no means at ease In order that he might be ready to suppress any disturbance he had passed the morning in reviewing several battalions of infantry in Hyde Park It is however by no means certain that his troops would have stood by him if he had needed their services When Sancroft reached Lambeth in the afternoon he found the grenadier guards who were quartered in that suburb assembled before the gate of his palace They formed in two lines on his right and left and asked his benediction as he went through them He with difficulty prevented them from lighting a bonfire in honour of his return to his dwelling There were however many bonfires that evening in the City Two Roman Catholics who were so indiscreet as to beat some boys for joining in these rejoicings were seized by the mob stripped naked and ignominiously branded three hundred eighty four Sir Edward Hales now came to demand fees from those who had lately been his prisoners They refused to pay anything for the detention which they regarded as illegal to an officer whose commission was on their principles a nullity The Lieutenant hinted very intelligibly that if they came into his hands again they should be put into heavy irons and should lie on bare stones We are under our King s displeasure was the answer and most deeply do we feel it but a fellow subject who threatens us does but lose his breath It is easy to imagine with what indignation the people excited as they were must have learned that a renegade from the Protestant faith who held a command in defiance of the fundamental laws of England had dared to menace divines of venerable age and dignity with all the barbarities of Lollard s Tower three hundred eighty five Before the day of trial the agitation had spread to the farthest corners of the island From Scotland the Bishops received letters assuring them of the sympathy of the Presbyterians of that country so long and so bitterly hostile to prelacy three hundred eighty six The people of Cornwall a fierce bold and athletic race among whom there was a stronger provincial feeling than in any other part of the realm were greatly moved by the danger of Trelawney whom they reverenced less as a ruler of the Church than as the head of an honourable house and the heir through twenty descents of ancestors who had been of great note before the Normans had set foot on English ground All over the county the peasants chanted a ballad of which the burden is still remembered And shall Trelawney die and shall Trelawney die Then thirty thousand Cornish boys will know the reason why The miners from their caverns reechoed the song with a variation Then twenty thousand under ground will know the reason why three hundred eighty seven The rustics in many parts of the country loudly expressed a strange hope which had never ceased to live in their hearts Their Protestant Duke their beloved Monmouth would suddenly appear would lead them to victory and would tread down the King and the Jesuits under his feet three hundred eighty eight The ministers were appalled Even Jeffreys would gladly have retraced his steps He charged Clarendon with friendly messages to the Bishops and threw on others the blame of the prosecution which he had himself recommended Sunderland again ventured to recommend concession The late auspicious birth he said had furnished the King with an excellent opportunity of withdrawing from a position full of danger and inconvenience without incurring the reproach of timidity or of caprice On such happy occasions it had been usual for sovereigns to make the hearts of subjects glad by acts of clemency and nothing could be more advantageous to the Prince of Wales than that he should while still in his cradle be the peacemaker between his father and the agitated nation But the King s resolution was fixed I will go on he said I have been only too indulgent Indulgence ruined my father three hundred eighty nine The artful minister found that his advice had been formerly taken only because it had been shaped to suit the royal temper and that from the moment at which he began to counsel well he began to counsel in vain He had shown some signs of slackness in the proceeding against Magdalene College He had recently attempted to convince the King that Tyrconnel s scheme of confiscating the property of the English colonists in Ireland was full of danger and had with the help of Powis and Bellasyse so far succeeded that the execution of the design had been postponed for another year But this timidity and scrupulosity had excited disgust and suspicion in the royal mind three hundred ninety The day of retribution had arrived Sunderland was in the same situation in which his rival Rochester had been some months before Each of the two statesmen in turn experienced the misery of clutching with an agonizing grasp power which was perceptibly slipping away Each in turn saw his suggestions scornfully rejected Both endured the pain of reading displeasure and distrust in the countenance and demeanour of their master yet both were by their country held responsible for those crimes and errors from which they had vainly endeavoured to dissuade him While he suspected them of trying to win popularity at the expense of his authority and dignity the public voice loudly accused them of trying to win his favour at the expense of their own honour and of the general weal Yet in spite of mortifications and humiliations they both clung to office with the gripe of drowning men Both attempted to propitiate the King by affecting a willingness to be reconciled to his Church But there was a point at which Rochester was determined to stop He went to the verge of apostasy but there he recoiled and the world in consideration of the firmness with which he refused to take the final step granted him a liberal amnesty for all former compliances Sunderland less scrupulous and less sensible of shame resolved to atone for his late moderation and to recover the royal confidence by an act which to a mind impressed with the importance of religious truth must have appeared to be one of the most flagitious of crimes and which even men of the world regard as the last excess of baseness About a week before the day fixed for the great trial it was publicly announced that he was a Papist The King talked with delight of this triumph of divine grace Courtiers and envoys kept their countenances as well as they could while the renegade protested that he had been long convinced of the impossibility of finding salvation out of the communion of Rome and that his conscience would not let him rest till he had renounced the heresies in which he had been brought up The news spread fast At all the coffeehouses it was told how the prime minister of England his feet bare and a taper in his hand had repaired to the royal chapel and knocked humbly for admittance how a priestly voice from within had demanded who was there how Sunderland had made answer that a poor sinner who had long wandered from the true Church implored her to receive and to absolve him how the doors were opened and how the neophyte partook of the holy mysteries three hundred ninety one This scandalous apostasy could not but heighten the interest with which the nation looked forward to the day when the fate of the seven brave confessors of the English Church was to be decided To pack a jury was now the great object of the King The crown lawyers were ordered to make strict inquiry as to the sentiments of the persons who were registered in the freeholders book Sir Samuel Astry Clerk of the Crown whose duty it was in cases of this description to select the names was summoned to the palace and had an interview with James in the presence of the Chancellor three hundred ninety two Sir Samuel seems to have done his best For among the forty eight persons whom he nominated were said to be several servants of the King and several Roman Catholics three hundred ninety three But as the counsel for the Bishops had a right to strike off twelve these persons were removed The crown lawyers also struck off twelve The list was thus reduced to twenty four The first twelve who answered to their names were to try the issue On the twenty ninth of June Westminster Hall Old and New Palace Yard and all the neighbouring streets to a great distance were thronged with people Such an auditory had never before and has never since been assembled in the Court of King s Bench Thirty five temporal peers of the realm were counted in the crowd three hundred ninety four All the four judges of the Court were on the bench Wright who presided had been raised to his high place over the heads of many abler and more learned men solely on account of his unscrupulous servility Allybone was a Papist and owed his situation to that dispensing power the legality of which was now in question Holloway had hitherto been a serviceable tool of the government Even Powell whose character for honesty stood high had borne a part in some proceedings which it is impossible to defend He had in the great case of Sir Edward Hales with some hesitation it is true and after some delay concurred with the majority of the bench and had thus brought on his character a stain which his honourable conduct on this day completely effaced The counsel were by no means fairly matched The government had required from its law officers services so odious and disgraceful that all the ablest jurists and advocates of the Tory party had one after another refused to comply and had been dismissed from their employments Sir Thomas Powis the Attorney General was scarcely of the third rank in his profession Sir William Williams the Solicitor General had quick parts and dauntless courage but he wanted discretion he loved wrangling he had no command over his temper and he was hated and despised by all political parties The most conspicuous assistants of the Attorney and Solicitor were Serjeant Trinder a Roman Catholic and Sir Bartholomew Shower Recorder of London who had some legal learning but whose fulsome apologies and endless repetitions were the jest of Westminster Hall The government had wished to secure the services of Maynard but he had plainly declared that he could not in conscience do what was asked of him three hundred ninety five On the other side were arrayed almost all the eminent forensic talents of the age Sawyer and Finch who at the time of the accession of James had been Attorney and Solicitor General and who during the persecution of the Whigs in the late reign had served the crown with but too much vehemence and success were of counsel for the defendants With them were joined two persons who since age had diminished the activity of Maynard were reputed the two best lawyers that could be found in the Inns of Court Pemberton who had in the time of Charles the Second been Chief justice of the King s Bench who had been removed from his high place on account of his humanity and moderation and who had resumed his practice at the bar and Pollexfen who had long been at the head of the Western circuit and who though he had incurred much unpopularity by holding briefs for the crown at the Bloody Assizes and particularly by appearing against Alice Lisle was known to be at heart a Whig if not a republican Sir Creswell Levinz was also there a man of great knowledge and experience but of singularly timid nature He had been removed from the bench some years before because he was afraid to serve the purposes of the government He was now afraid to appear as the advocate of the Bishops and had at first refused to receive their retainer but it had been intimated to him by the whole body of attorneys who employed him that if he declined this brief he should never have another three hundred ninety six Sir George Treby an able and zealous Whig who had been Recorder of London under the old charter was on the same side Sir John Holt a still more eminent Whig lawyer was not retained for the defence in consequence it should seem of some prejudice conceived against him by Sancroft but was privately consulted on the case by the Bishop of London three hundred ninety seven The junior counsel for the Bishops was a young barrister named John Somers He had no advantages of birth or fortune nor had he yet had any opportunity of distinguishing himself before the eyes of the public but his genius his industry his great and various accomplishments were well known to a small circle of friends and in spite of his Whig opinions his pertinent and lucid mode of arguing and the constant propriety of his demeanour had already secured to him the ear of the Court of King s Bench The importance of obtaining his services had been strongly represented to the Bishops by Johnstone and Pollexfen it is said had declared that no man in Westminster Hall was so well qualified to treat a historical and constitutional question as Somers The jury was sworn it consisted of persons of highly respectable station The foreman was Sir Roger Langley a baronet of old and honourable family With him were joined a knight and ten esquires several of whom are known to have been men of large possessions There were some Nonconformists in the number for the Bishops had wisely resolved not to show any distrust of the Protestant Dissenters One name excited considerable alarm that of Michael Arnold He was brewer to the palace and it was apprehended that the government counted on his voice The story goes that he complained bitterly of the position in which he found himself Whatever I do he said I am sure to be half ruined If I say Not Guilty I shall brew no more for the King and if I say Guilty I shall brew no more for anybody else three hundred ninety eight The trial then commenced a trial which even when coolly perused after the lapse of more than a century and a half has all the interest of a drama The advocates contended on both sides with far more than professional keenness and vehemence the audience listened with as much anxiety as if the fate of every one of them was to be decided by the verdict and the turns of fortune were so sudden and amazing that the multitude repeatedly passed in a single minute from anxiety to exultation and back again from exultation to still deeper anxiety The information charged the Bishops with having written or published in the county of Middlesex a false malicious and seditious libel The Attorney and Solicitor first tried to prove the writing For this purpose several persons were called to speak to the hands of the Bishops But the witnesses were so unwilling that hardly a single plain answer could be extracted from any of them Pemberton Pollexfen and Levinz contended that there was no evidence to go to the jury Two of the judges Holloway and Powell declared themselves of the same opinion and the hopes of the spectators rose high All at once the crown lawyers announced their intention to take another line Powis with shame and reluctance which he could not dissemble put into the witness box Blathwayt a Clerk of the Privy Council who had been present when the King interrogated the Bishops Blathwayt swore that he had heard them own their signatures His testimony was decisive Why said judge Holloway to the Attorney when you had such evidence did you not produce it at first without all this waste of time It soon appeared why the counsel for the crown had been unwilling without absolute necessity to resort to this mode of proof Pemberton stopped Blathwayt subjected him to a searching cross examination and insisted upon having all that had passed between the King and the defendants fully related That is a pretty thing indeed cried Williams Do you think said Powis that you are at liberty to ask our witnesses any impertinent question that comes into your heads The advocates of the Bishops were not men to be so put down He is sworn said Pollexfen to tell the truth and the whole truth and an answer we must and will have The witness shuffled equivocated pretended to misunderstand the questions implored the protection of the Court But he was in hands from which it was not easy to escape At length the Attorney again interposed If he said you persist in asking such a question tell us at least what use you mean to make of it Pemberton who through the whole trial did his duty manfully and ably replied without hesitation My Lords I will answer mister Attorney I will deal plainly with the Court If the Bishops owned this paper under a promise from His Majesty that their confession should not be used against them I hope that no unfair advantage will be taken of them You put on His Majesty what I dare hardly name said Williams since you will be so pressing I demand for the King that the question may be recorded What do you mean mister Solicitor said Sawyer interposing I know what I mean said the apostate I desire that the question may be recorded in Court Record what you will I am not afraid of you mister Solicitor said Pemberton Then came a loud and fierce altercation which the Chief Justice could with difficulty quiet In other circumstances he would probably have ordered the question to be recorded and Pemberton to be committed But on this great day he was overawed He often cast a side glance towards the thick rows of Earls and Barons by whom he was watched and who in the next Parliament might be his judges He looked a bystander said as if all the peers present had halters in their pockets three hundred ninety nine At length Blathwayt was forced to give a full account of what had passed It appeared that the King had entered into no express covenant with the Bishops But it appeared also that the Bishops might not unreasonably think that there was an implied engagement Indeed from the unwillingness of the crown lawyers to put the Clerk of the Council into the witness box and from the vehemence with which they objected to Pemberton s cross examination it is plain that they were themselves of this opinion However the handwriting was now proved But a new and serious objection was raised It was not sufficient to prove that the Bishops had written the alleged libel It was necessary to prove also that they had written it in the county of Middlesex And not only was it out of the power of the Attorney and Solicitor to prove this but it was in the power of the defendants to prove the contrary For it so happened that Sancroft had never once left the palace at Lambeth from the time when the Order in Council appeared till after the petition was in the King s hands The whole case for the prosecution had therefore completely broken down and the audience with great glee expected a speedy acquittal The crown lawyers then changed their ground again abandoned altogether the charge of writing a libel and undertook to prove that the Bishops had published a libel in the county of Middlesex The difficulties were great The delivery of the petition to the King was undoubtedly in the eye of the law a publication But how was this delivery to be proved No person had been present at the audience in the royal closet except the King and the defendants The King could not well be sworn It was therefore only by the admissions of the defendants that the fact of publication could be established Blathwayt was again examined but in vain He well remembered he said that the Bishops owned their hands but he did not remember that they owned the paper which lay on the table of the Privy Council to be the same paper which they had delivered to the King or that they were even interrogated on that point Several other official men who had been in attendance on the Council were called and among them Samuel Pepys Secretary of the Admiralty but none of them could remember that anything was said about the delivery It was to no purpose that Williams put leading questions till the counsel on the other side declared that such twisting such wiredrawing was never seen in a court of justice and till Wright himself was forced to admit that the Solicitor s mode of examination was contrary to all rule As witness after witness answered in the negative roars of laughter and shouts of triumph which the judges did not even attempt to silence shook the hall It seemed that at length this hard fight had been won The case for the crown was closed Had the counsel for the Bishops remained silent an acquittal was certain for nothing which the most corrupt and shameless judge could venture to call legal evidence of publication had been given The Chief justice was beginning to charge the jury and would undoubtedly have directed them to acquit the defendants but Finch too anxious to be perfectly discreet interfered and begged to be heard If you will be heard said Wright you shall be heard but you do not understand your own interests The other counsel for the defence made Finch sit down and begged the Chief justice to proceed He was about to do so when a messenger came to the Solicitor General with news that Lord Sunderland could prove the publication and would come down to the court immediately Wright maliciously told the counsel for the defence that they had only themselves to thank for the turn which things had taken The countenances of the great multitude fell Finch was during some hours the most unpopular man in the country Why could he not sit still as his betters Sawyer Pemberton and Pollexfen had done His love of meddling his ambition to make a fine speech had ruined everything Meanwhile the Lord President was brought in a sedan chair through the hall Not a hat moved as he passed and many voices cried out Popish dog He came into Court pale and trembling with eyes fixed on the ground and gave his evidence in a faltering voice He swore that the Bishops had informed him of their intention to present a petition to the King and that they had been admitted into the royal closet for that purpose This circumstance coupled with the circumstance that after they left the closet there was in the King s hands a petition signed by them was such proof as might reasonably satisfy a jury of the fact of the publication Publication in Middlesex was then proved But was the paper thus published a false malicious and seditious libel Hitherto the matter in dispute had been whether a fact which everybody well knew to be true could be proved according to technical rules of evidence but now the contest became one of deeper interest It was necessary to inquire into the limits of prerogative and liberty into the right of the King to dispense with statutes into the right of the subject to petition for the redress of grievances During three hours the counsel for the petitioners argued with great force in defence of the fundamental principles of the constitution and proved from the journals of the House of Commons that the Bishops had affirmed no more than the truth when they represented to the King that the dispensing power which he claimed had been repeatedly declared illegal by Parliament Somers rose last He spoke little more than five minutes but every word was full of weighty matter and when he sate down his reputation as an orator and a constitutional lawyer was established He went through the expressions which were used in the information to describe the offence imputed to the Bishops and showed that every word whether adjective or substantive was altogether inappropriate The offence imputed was a false a malicious a seditious libel False the paper was not for every fact which it set forth had been proved from the journals of Parliament to be true Malicious the paper was not for the defendants had not sought an occasion of strife but had been placed by the government in such a situation that they must either oppose themselves to the royal will or violate the most sacred obligations of conscience and honour Seditious the paper was not for it had not been scattered by the writers among the rabble but delivered privately into the hands of the King alone and a libel it was not but a decent petition such as by the laws of England nay by the laws of imperial Rome by the laws of all civilised states a subject who thinks himself aggrieved may with propriety present to the sovereign The Attorney replied shortly and feebly The Solicitor spoke at great length and with great acrimony and was often interrupted by the clamours and hisses of the audience He went so far as to lay it down that no subject or body of subjects except the Houses of Parliament had a right to petition the King The galleries were furious and the Chief justice himself stood aghast at the effrontery of this venal turncoat At length Wright proceeded to sum up the evidence His language showed that the awe in which he stood of the government was tempered by the awe with which the audience so numerous so splendid and so strongly excited had impressed him He said that he would give no opinion on the question of the dispensing power that it was not necessary for him to do so that he could not agree with much of the Solicitor s speech that it was the right of the subject to petition but that the particular petition before the Court was improperly worded and was in the contemplation of law a libel Allybone was of the same mind but in giving his opinion showed such gross ignorance of law and history as brought on him the contempt of all who heard him Holloway evaded the question of the dispensing power but said that the petition seemed to him to be such as subjects who think themselves aggrieved are entitled to present and therefore no libel Powell took a bolder course He avowed that in his judgment the Declaration of Indulgence was a nullity and that the dispensing power as lately exercised was utterly inconsistent with all law If these encroachments of prerogative were allowed there was an end of Parliaments The whole legislative authority would be in the King That issue gentlemen he said I leave to God and to your consciences four hundred It was dark before the jury retired to consider of their verdict The night was a night of intense anxiety Some letters are extant which were despatched during that period of suspense and which have therefore an interest of a peculiar kind It is very late wrote the Papal Nuncio and the decision is not yet known The judges and the culprits have gone to their own homes The jury remain together Tomorrow we shall learn the event of this great struggle The solicitor for the Bishops sate up all night with a body of servants on the stairs leading to the room where the jury was consulting It was absolutely necessary to watch the officers who watched the doors for those officers were supposed to be in the interest of the crown and might if not carefully observed have furnished a courtly juryman with food which would have enabled him to starve out the other eleven Strict guard was therefore kept Not even a candle to light a pipe was permitted to enter Some basins of water for washing were suffered to pass at about four in the morning The jurymen raging with thirst soon lapped up the whole Great numbers of people walked the neighbouring streets till dawn Every hour a messenger came from Whitehall to know what was passing Voices high in altercation were repeatedly heard within the room but nothing certain was known four hundred one At first nine were for acquitting and three for convicting Two of the minority soon gave way but Arnold was obstinate Thomas Austin a country gentleman of great estate who had paid close attention to the evidence and speeches and had taken full notes wished to argue the question Arnold declined He was not used he doggedly said to reasoning and debating His conscience was not satisfied and he should not acquit the Bishops If you come to that said Austin look at me I am the largest and strongest of the twelve and before I find such a petition as this a libel here I will stay till I am no bigger than a tobacco pipe It was six in the morning before Arnold yielded It was soon known that the jury were agreed but what the verdict would be was still a secret four hundred two At ten the Court again met The crowd was greater than ever The jury appeared in their box and there was a breathless stillness Sir Samuel Astry spoke Do you find the defendants or any of them guilty of the misdemeanour whereof they are impeached or not guilty Sir Roger Langley answered Not guilty As the words passed his lips Halifax sprang up and waved his hat At that signal benches and galleries raised a shout In a moment ten thousand persons who crowded the great hall replied with a still louder shout which made the old oaken roof crack and in another moment the innumerable throng without set up a third huzza which was heard at Temple Bar The boats which covered the Thames gave an answering cheer A peal of gunpowder was heard on the water and another and another and so in a few moments the glad tidings went flying past the Savoy and the Friars to London Bridge and to the forest of masts below As the news spread streets and squares market places and coffeehouses broke forth into acclamations Yet were the acclamations less strange than the weeping For the feelings of men had been wound up to such a point that at length the stern English nature so little used to outward signs of emotion gave way and thousands sobbed aloud for very joy Meanwhile from the outskirts of the multitude horsemen were spurring off to bear along all the great roads intelligence of the victory of our Church and nation Yet not even that astounding explosion could awe the bitter and intrepid spirit of the Solicitor Striving to make himself heard above the din he called on the judges to commit those who had violated by clamour the dignity of a court of justice One of the rejoicing populace was seized But the tribunal felt that it would be absurd to punish a single individual for an offence common to hundreds of thousands and dismissed him with a gentle reprimand four hundred three It was vain to think of passing at that moment to any other business Indeed the roar of the multitude was such that for half an hour scarcely a word could be heard in court Williams got to his coach amidst a tempest of hisses and curses Cartwright whose curiosity was ungovernable had been guilty of the folly and indecency of coming to Westminster in order to hear the decision He was recognised by his sacerdotal garb and by his corpulent figure and was hooted through the hall Take care said one of the wolf in sheep s clothing Make room cried another for the man with the Pope in his belly four hundred four The acquitted prelates took refuge from the crowd which implored their blessing in the nearest chapel where divine service was performing Many churches were open on that morning throughout the capital and many pious persons repaired thither The bells of all the parishes of the City and liberties were ringing The jury meanwhile could scarcely make their way out of the hall They were forced to shake hands with hundreds God bless you cried the people God prosper your families you have done like honest goodnatured gentlemen you have saved us all today As the noblemen who had appeared to support the good cause drove off they flung from their carriage windows handfuls of money and bade the crowd drink to the health of the King the Bishops and the jury four hundred five The Attorney went with the tidings to Sunderland who happened to be conversing with the Nuncio Never said Powis within man s memory have there been such shouts and such tears of joy as today four hundred six The King had that morning visited the camp on Hounslow Heath Sunderland instantly sent a courier thither with the news James was in Lord Feversham s tent when the express arrived He was greatly disturbed and exclaimed in French So much the worse for them He soon set out for London While he was present respect prevented the soldiers from giving a loose to their feelings but he had scarcely quitted the camp when he heard a great shouting behind him He was surprised and asked what that uproar meant Nothing was the answer the soldiers are glad that the Bishops are acquitted Do you call that nothing said James And then he repeated So much the worse for them four hundred seven He might well be out of temper His defeat had been complete and most humiliating Had the prelates escaped on account of some technical defect in the case for the crown had they escaped because they had not written the petition in Middlesex or because it was impossible to prove according to the strict rules of law that they had delivered to the King the paper for which they were called in question the prerogative would have suffered no shock Happily for the country the fact of publication had been fully established The counsel for the defence had therefore been forced to attack the dispensing power They had attacked it with great learning eloquence and boldness The advocates of the government had been by universal acknowledgment overmatched in the contest Not a single judge had ventured to declare that the Declaration of Indulgence was legal One Judge had in the strongest terms pronounced it illegal The language of the whole town was that the dispensing power had received a fatal blow Finch who had the day before been universally reviled was now universally applauded He had been unwilling it was said to let the case be decided in a way which would have left the great constitutional question still doubtful He had felt that a verdict which should acquit his clients without condemning the Declaration of Indulgence would be but half a victory It is certain that Finch deserved neither the reproaches which had been cast on him while the event was doubtful nor the praises which he received when it had proved happy It was absurd to blame him because during the short delay which he occasioned the crown lawyers unexpectedly discovered new evidence It was equally absurd to suppose that he deliberately exposed his clients to risk in order to establish a general principle and still more absurd was it to praise him for what would have been a gross violation of professional duty That joyful day was followed by a not less joyful night The Bishops and some of their most respectable friends in vain exerted themselves to prevent tumultuous demonstrations of joy Never within the memory of the oldest not even on that evening on which it was known through London that the army of Scotland had declared for a free Parliament had the streets been in such a glare with bonfires Round every bonfire crowds were drinking good health to the Bishops and confusion to the Papists The windows were lighted with rows of candles Each row consisted of seven and the taper in the centre which was taller than the rest represented the Primate The noise of rockets squibs and firearms was incessant One huge pile of faggots blazed right in front of the great gate of Whitehall Others were lighted before the doors of Roman Catholic Peers Lord Arundell of Wardour wisely quieted the mob with a little money but at Salisbury House in the Strand an attempt at resistance was made Lord Salisbury s servants sallied out and fired but they killed only the unfortunate beadle of the parish who had come thither to put out the fire and they were soon routed and driven back into the house None of the spectacles of that night interested the common people so much as one with which they had a few years before been familiar and which they now after a long interval enjoyed once more the burning of the Pope This once familiar pageant is known to our generation only by descriptions and engravings A figure by no means resembling those rude representations of Guy Faux which are still paraded on the fifth of November but made of wax with some skill and adorned at no small expense with robes and a tiara was mounted on a chair resembling that in which the Bishops of Rome are still on some great festivals borne through Saint Peter s Church to the high altar His Holiness was generally accompanied by a train of Cardinals and Jesuits At his ear stood a buffoon disguised as a devil with horns and tail No rich and zealous Protestant grudged his guinea on such an occasion and if rumour could be trusted the cost of the procession was sometimes not less than a thousand pounds After the Pope had been borne some time in state over the heads of the multitude he was committed to the flames with loud acclamations In the time of the popularity of Oates and Shaftesbury this show was exhibited annually in Fleet Street before the windows of the Whig Club on the anniversary of the birth of Queen Elizabeth Such was the celebrity of these grotesque rites that Barillon once risked his life in order to peep at them from a hiding place four hundred eight But from the day when the Rye House Plot was discovered till the day of the acquittal of the Bishops the ceremony had been disused Now however several Popes made their appearance in different parts of London The Nuncio was much shocked and the King was more hurt by this insult to his Church than by all the other affronts which he had received The magistrates however could do nothing The Sunday had dawned and the bells of the parish churches were ringing for early prayers before the fires began to languish and the crowds to disperse A proclamation was speedily put forth against the rioters Many of them mostly young apprentices were apprehended but the bills were thrown out at the Middlesex sessions The magistrates many of whom were Roman Catholics expostulated with the grand jury and sent them three or four times back but to no purpose four hundred nine Meanwhile the glad tidings were flying to every part of the kingdom and were everywhere received with rapture Gloucester Bedford and Lichfield were among the places which were distinguished by peculiar zeal but Bristol and Norwich which stood nearest to London in population and wealth approached nearest to London in enthusiasm on this joyful occasion The prosecution of the Bishops is an event which stands by itself in our history It was the first and the last occasion on which two feelings of tremendous potency two feelings which have generally been opposed to each other and either of which when strongly excited has sufficed to convulse the state were united in perfect harmony Those feelings were love of the Church and love of freedom During many generations every violent outbreak of High Church feeling with one exception has been unfavourable to civil liberty every violent outbreak of zeal for liberty with one exception has been unfavourable to the authority and influence of the prelacy and the priesthood In sixteen eighty eight the cause of the hierarchy was for a moment that of the popular party More than nine thousand clergymen with the Primate and his most respectable suffragans at their head offered themselves to endure bonds and the spoiling of their goods for the great fundamental principle of our free constitution The effect was a coalition which included the most zealous Cavaliers the most zealous Republicans and all the intermediate sections of the community The spirit which had supported Hampden in the preceding generation the spirit which in the succeeding generation supported Sacheverell combined to support the Archbishop who was Hampden and Sacheverell in one Those classes of society which are most deeply interested in the preservation of order which in troubled times are generally most ready to strengthen the hands of government and which have a natural antipathy to agitators followed without scruple the guidance of a venerable man the first peer of the realm the first minister of the Church a Tory in politics a saint in manners whom tyranny had in his own despite turned into a demagogue Those on the other hand who had always abhorred episcopacy as a relic of Popery and as an instrument of arbitrary power now asked on bended knees the blessing of a prelate who was ready to wear fetters and to lay his aged limbs on bare stones rather than betray the interests of the Protestant religion and set the prerogative above the laws With love of the Church and with love of freedom was mingled at this great crisis a third feeling which is among the most honourable peculiarities of our national character An individual oppressed by power even when destitute of all claim to public respect and gratitude generally finds strong sympathy among us Thus in the time of our grandfathers society was thrown into confusion by the persecution of Wilkes We have ourselves seen the nation roused almost to madness by the wrongs of Queen Caroline It is probable therefore that even if no great political and religious interests had been staked on the event of the proceeding against the Bishops England would not have seen without strong emotions of pity and anger old men of stainless virtue pursued by the vengeance of a harsh and inexorable prince who owed to their fidelity the crown which he wore Actuated by these sentiments our ancestors arrayed themselves against the government in one huge and compact mass All ranks all parties all Protestant sects made up that vast phalanx In the van were the Lords Spiritual and Temporal Then came the landed gentry and the clergy both the Universities all the Inns of Court merchants shopkeepers farmers the porters who plied in the streets of the great towns the peasants who ploughed the fields The league against the King included the very foremast men who manned his ships the very sentinels who guarded his palace The names of Whig and Tory were for a moment forgotten The old Exclusionist took the old Abhorrer by the hand Episcopalians Presbyterians Independents Baptists forgot their long feuds and remembered only their common Protestantism and their common danger Divines bred in the school of Laud talked loudly not only of toleration but of comprehension The Archbishop soon after his acquittal put forth a pastoral letter which is one of the most remarkable compositions of that age He had from his youth up been at war with the Nonconformists and had repeatedly assailed them with unjust and unchristian asperity His principal work was a hideous caricature of the Calvinistic theology four hundred ten He had drawn up for the thirtieth of January and for the twenty ninth of May forms of prayer which reflected on the Puritans in language so strong that the government had thought fit to soften it down But now his heart was melted and opened He solemnly enjoined the Bishops and clergy to have a very tender regard to their brethren the Protestant Dissenters to visit them often to entertain them hospitably to discourse with them civilly to persuade them if it might be to conform to the Church but if that were found impossible to join them heartily and affectionately in exertions for the blessed cause of the Reformation four hundred eleven Many pious persons in subsequent years remembered that time with bitter regret They described it as a short glimpse of a golden age between two iron ages Such lamentation though natural was not reasonable The coalition of sixteen eighty eight was produced and could be produced only by tyranny which approached to insanity and by danger which threatened at once all the great institutions of the country If there has never since been similar union the reason is that there has never since been similar misgovernment It must be remembered that though concord is in itself better than discord discord may indicate a better state of things than is indicated by concord Calamity and peril often force men to combine Prosperity and security often

Prince of Wales sent to France Lauzun The King s Preparations for Flight His Flight THE acquittal of the Bishops was not the only event which makes the thirtieth of June sixteen eighty eight a great epoch in history On that day while the bells of a hundred churches were ringing while multitudes were busied from Hyde Park to Mile End in piling faggots and dressing Popes for the rejoicings of the night was despatched from London to the Hague an instrument scarcely less important to the liberties of England than the Great Charter The prosecution of the Bishops and the birth of the Prince of Wales had produced a great revolution in the feelings of many Tories At the very moment at which their Church was suffering the last excess of injury and insult they were compelled to renounce the hope of peaceful deliverance Hitherto they had flattered themselves that the trial to which their loyalty was subjected would though severe be temporary and that their wrongs would shortly be redressed without any violation of the ordinary rule of succession A very different prospect was now before them As far as they could look forward they saw only misgovernment such as that of the last three years extending through ages The cradle of the heir apparent of the crown was surrounded by Jesuits Deadly hatred of that Church of which he would one day be the head would be studiously instilled into his infant mind would be the guiding principle of his life and would be bequeathed by him to his posterity This vista of calamities had no end It stretched beyond the life of the youngest man living beyond the eighteenth century None could say how many generations of Protestant Englishmen might hive to bear oppression such as even when it had been believed to be short had been found almost insupportable Was there then no remedy One remedy there was quick sharp and decisive a remedy which the Whigs had been but too ready to employ but which had always been regarded by the Tories as in all cases unlawful The greatest Anglican doctors of that age had maintained that no breach of law or contract no excess of cruelty rapacity or licentiousness on the part of a rightful King could justify his people in withstanding him by force Some of them had delighted to exhibit the doctrine of nonresistance in a form so exaggerated as to shock common sense and humanity They frequently and emphatically remarked that Nero was at the head of the Roman government when Saint Paul inculcated the duty of obeying magistrates The inference which they drew was that if an English King should without any law but his own pleasure persecute his subjects for not worshipping idols should fling them to the lions in the Tower should wrap them up in pitched cloth and set them on fire to light up Saint James s Park and should go on with these massacres till whole towns and shires were left without one inhabitant the survivors would still be bound meekly to submit and to be torn in pieces or roasted alive without a struggle The arguments in favour of this proposition were futile indeed but the place of sound argument was amply supplied by the omnipotent sophistry of interest and of passion Many writers have expressed wonder that the high spirited Cavaliers of England should have been zealous for the most slavish theory that has ever been known among men The truth is that this theory at first presented itself to the Cavalier as the very opposite of slavish Its tendency was to make him not a slave but a freeman and a master It exalted him by exalting one whom he regarded as his protector as his friend as the head of his beloved party and of his more beloved Church When Republicans were dominant the Royalist had endured wrongs and insults which the restoration of the legitimate government had enabled him to retaliate Rebellion was therefore associated in his imagination with subjection and degradation and monarchical authority with liberty and ascendency It had never crossed his imagination that a time might come when a King a Stuart would persecute the most loyal of the clergy and gentry with more than the animosity of the Rump or the Protector That time had however arrived It was now to be seen how the patience which Churchmen professed to have learned from the writings of Paul would stand the test of a persecution by no means so severe as that of Nero The event was such as everybody who knew anything of human nature would have predicted Oppression speedily did what philosophy and eloquence would have failed to do The system of Filmer might have survived the attacks of Locke but it never recovered from the death blow given by James That logic which while it was used to prove that Presbyterians and Independents ought to bear imprisonment and confiscation with meekness had been pronounced unanswerable seemed to be of very little force when the question was whether Anglican Bishops should be imprisoned and the revenues of Anglican colleges confiscated It has been often repeated from the pulpits of all the Cathedrals in the land that the apostolical injunction to obey the civil magistrate was absolute and universal and that it was impious presumption in man to limit a precept which had been promulgated without any limitation in the word of God Now however divines whose sagacity had been sharpened by the imminent danger in which they stood of being turned out of their livings and prebends to make room for Papists discovered flaws in the reasoning which had formerly seemed so convincing The ethical parts of Scripture were not to be construed like Acts of Parliament or like the casuistical treatises of the schoolmen What Christian really turned the left cheek to the ruffian who had smitten the right What Christian really gave his cloak to the thieves who had taken his coat away Both in the Old and in the New Testament general rules were perpetually laid down unaccompanied by the exceptions Thus there was a general command not to kill unaccompanied by any reservation in favour of the warrior who kills in defence of his king and country There was a general command not to swear unaccompanied by any reservation in favour of the witness who swears to speak the truth before a judge Yet the lawfulness of defensive war and of judicial oaths was disputed only by a few obscure sectaries and was positively affirmed in the articles of the Church of England All the arguments which showed that the Quaker who refused to bear arms or to kiss the Gospels was unreasonable and perverse might be turned against those who denied to subjects the right of resisting extreme tyranny by force If it was contended that the texts which prohibited homicide and the texts which prohibited swearing though generally expressed must be construed in subordination to the great commandment by which every man is enjoined to promote the welfare of his neighbours and would when so construed be found not to apply to cases in which homicide or swearing might be absolutely necessary to protect the dearest interests of society it was not easy to deny that the texts which prohibited resistance ought to be construed in the same manner If the ancient people of God had been directed sometimes to destroy human life and sometimes to bind themselves by oaths they had also been directed sometimes to resist wicked princes If early fathers of the Church had occasionally used language which seemed to imply that they disapproved of all resistance they had also occasionally used language which seemed to imply that they disapproved of all war and of all oaths In truth the doctrine of passive obedience as taught at Oxford in the reign of Charles the Second can be deduced from the Bible only by a mode of interpretation which would irresistibly lead us to the conclusions of Barclay and Penn It was not merely by arguments drawn from the letter of Scripture that the Anglican theologians had during the years which immediately followed the Restoration laboured to prove their favourite tenet They had attempted to show that even if revelation had been silent reason would have taught wise men the folly and wickedness of all resistance to established government It was universally admitted that such resistance was except in extreme cases unjustifiable And who would undertake to draw the line between extreme cases and ordinary cases Was there any government in the world under which there were not to be found some discontented and factious men who would say and perhaps think that their grievances constituted an extreme case If indeed it were possible to lay down a clear and accurate rule which might forbid men to rebel against Trajan and yet leave them at liberty to rebel against Caligula such a rule might be highly beneficial But no such rule had even been or ever would be framed To say that rebellion was lawful under some circumstances without accurately defining those circumstances was to say that every man might rebel whenever he thought fit and a society in which every man rebelled whenever he thought fit would be more miserable than a society governed by the most cruel and licentious despot It was therefore necessary to maintain the great principle of nonresistance in all its integrity Particular cases might doubtless be put in which resistance would benefit a community but it was on the whole better that the people should patiently endure a bad government than that they should relieve themselves by violating a law on which the security of all government depended Such reasoning easily convinced a dominant and prosperous party but could ill bear the scrutiny of minds strongly excited by royal injustice and ingratitude It is true that to trace the exact boundary between rightful and wrongful resistance is impossible but this impossibility arises from the nature of right and wrong and is found in almost every part of ethical science A good action is not distinguished from a bad action by marks so plain as those which distinguish a hexagon from a square There is a frontier where virtue and vice fade into each other Who has ever been able to define the exact boundary between courage and rashness between prudence and cowardice between frugality and avarice between liberality and prodigality Who has ever been able to say how far mercy to offenders ought to be carried and where it ceases to deserve the name of mercy and becomes a pernicious weakness What casuist what lawyer has ever been able nicely to mark the limits of the right of selfdefence All our jurists bold that a certain quantity of risk to life or limb justifies a man in shooting or stabbing an assailant but they have long given up in despair the attempt to describe in precise words that quantity of risk They only say that it must be not a slight risk but a risk such as would cause serious apprehension to a man of firm mind and who will undertake to say what is the precise amount of apprehension which deserves to be called serious or what is the precise texture of mind which deserves to be called firm It is doubtless to be regretted that the nature of words and the nature of things do not admit of more accurate legislation nor can it be denied that wrong will often be done when men are judges in their own cause and proceed instantly to execute their own judgment Yet who would on that account interdict all selfdefence The right which a people has to resist a bad government bears a close analogy to the right which an individual in the absence of legal protection has to slay an assailant In both cases the evil must be grave In both cases all regular and peaceable modes of defence must be exhausted before the aggrieved party resorts to extremities In both cases an awful responsibility is incurred In both cases the burden of the proof lies on him who has ventured on so desperate an expedient and if he fails to vindicate himself he is justly liable to the severest penalties But in neither case can we absolutely deny the existence of the right A man beset by assassins is not bound to let himself be tortured and butchered without using his weapons because nobody has ever been able precisely to define the amount of danger which justifies homicide Nor is a society bound to endure passively all that tyranny can inflict because nobody has ever been able precisely to define the amount of misgovernment which justifies rebellion But could the resistance of Englishmen to such a prince as James be properly called rebellion The thoroughpaced disciples of Filmer indeed maintained that there was no difference whatever between the polity of our country and that of Turkey and that if the King did not confiscate the contents of all the tills in Lombard Street and send mutes with bowstrings to Sancroft and Halifax this was only because His Majesty was too gracious to use the whole power which he derived from heaven But the great body of Tories though in the heat of conflict they might occasionally use language which seemed to indicate that they approved of these extravagant doctrines heartily abhorred despotism The English government was in their view a limited monarchy Yet how can a monarchy be said to be limited if force is never to be employed even in the last resort for the purpose of maintaining the limitations In Muscovy where the sovereign was by the constitution of the state absolute it might perhaps be with some colour of truth contended that whatever excesses he might commit he was still entitled to demand on Christian principles the obedience of his subjects But here prince and people were alike bound by the laws It was therefore James who incurred the woe denounced against those who insult the powers that be It was James who was resisting the ordinance of God who was mutinying against that legitimate authority to which he ought to have been subject not only for wrath but also for conscience sake and who was in the true sense of the words of Jesus withholding from Caesar the things which were Caesar s Moved by such considerations as these the ablest and most enlightened Tories began to admit that they had overstrained the doctrine of passive obedience The difference between these men and the Whigs as to the reciprocal obligations of Kings and subjects was now no longer a difference of principle There still remained it is true many historical controversies between the party which had always maintained the lawfulness of resistance and the new converts The memory of the blessed Martyr was still as much revered as ever by those old Cavaliers who were ready to take arms against his degenerate son They still spoke with abhorrence of the Long Parliament of the Rye House Plot and of the Western insurrection But whatever they might think about the past the view which they took of the present was altogether Whiggish for they now held that extreme oppression might justify resistance and they held that the oppression which the nation suffered was extreme four hundred twelve It must not however be supposed that all the Tories renounced even at that conjuncture a tenet which they had from childhood been taught to regard as an essential part of Christianity which they had professed during many years with ostentatious vehemence and which they had attempted to propagate by persecution Many were kept steady to their old creed by conscience and many by shame But the greater part even of those who still continued to pronounce all resistance to the sovereign unlawful were disposed in the event of a civil conflict to remain neutral No provocation should drive them to rebel but if rebellion broke forth it did not appear that they were bound to fight for James the Second as they would have fought for Charles the First The Christians of Rome had been forbidden by Saint Paul to resist the government of Nero but there was no reason to believe that the Apostle if he had been alive when the Legions and the Senate rose up against that wicked Emperor would have commanded the brethren to fly to arms in support of tyranny The duty of the persecuted Church was clear she must suffer patiently and commit her cause to God But if God whose providence perpetually educes good out of evil should be pleased as oftentimes He bad been pleased to redress her wrongs by the instrumentality of men whose angry passions her lessons had not been able to tame she might gratefully accept from Him a deliverance which her principles did not permit her to achieve for herself Most of those Tories therefore who still sincerely disclaimed all thought of attacking the government were yet by no means inclined to defend it and perhaps while glorying in their own scruples secretly rejoiced that everybody was not so scrupulous as themselves

none	none	Whether they should draw the sword against the government had during six or seven years been in their view merely a question of prudence and prudence itself now urged them to take a bold course In May before the birth of the Prince of Wales and while it was still uncertain whether the Declaration would or would not be read in the churches Edward Russell had repaired to the Hague He had strongly represented to the Prince of Orange the state of the public mind and had advised his Highness to appear in England at the head of a strong body of troops and to call the people to arms William had seen at a glance the whole importance of the crisis Now or never he exclaimed in Latin to Dykvelt four hundred thirteen To Russell he held more guarded language admitted that the distempers of the state were such as required an extraordinary remedy but spoke with earnestness of the chance of failure and of the calamities which failure might bring on Britain and on Europe He knew well that many who talked in high language about sacrificing their lives and fortunes for their country would hesitate when the prospect of another Bloody Circuit was brought close to them He wanted therefore to have not vague professions of good will but distinct invitations and promises of support subscribed by powerful and eminent men Russell remarked that it would be dangerous to entrust the design to a great number of persons William assented and said that a few signatures would be sufficient if they were the signatures of statesmen who represented great interests four hundred fourteen With this answer Russell returned to London where he found the excitement greatly increased and daily increasing The imprisonment of the Bishops and the delivery of the Queen made his task easier than he could have anticipated He lost no time in collecting the voices of the chiefs of the opposition His principal coadjutor in this work was Henry Sidney brother of Algernon It is remarkable that both Edward Russell and Henry Sidney had been in the household of James that both had partly on public and partly on private grounds become his enemies and that both had to avenge the blood of near kinsmen who had in the same year fallen victims to his implacable severity Here the resemblance ends Russell with considerable abilities was proud acrimonious restless and violent Sidney with a sweet temper and winning manners seemed to be deficient in capacity and knowledge and to be sunk in voluptuousness and indolence His face and form were eminently handsome In his youth he had been the terror of husbands and even now at near fifty he was the favourite of women and the envy of younger men He had formerly resided at the Hague in a public character and had then succeeded in obtaining a large share of William s confidence Many wondered at this for it seemed that between the most austere of statesmen and the most dissolute of idlers there could be nothing in common Swift many years later could not be convinced that one whom he had known only as an illiterate and frivolous old rake could really have played a great part in a great revolution Yet a less acute observer than Swift might have been aware that there is a certain tact resembling an instinct which is often wanting to great orators and philosophers and which is often found in persons who if judged by their conversation or by their writings would be pronounced simpletons Indeed when a man possesses this tact it is in some sense an advantage to him that he is destitute of those more showy talents which would make him an object of admiration of envy and of fear Sidney was a remarkable instance of this truth Incapable ignorant and dissipated as he seemed to be he understood or rather felt with whom it was necessary to be reserved and with whom he might safely venture to be communicative The consequence was that he did what Mordaunt with all his vivacity and invention or Burnet with all his multifarious knowledge and fluent elocution never could have done four hundred fifteen With the old Whigs there could be no difficulty In their opinion there had been scarcely a moment during many years at which the public wrongs would not have justified resistance Devonshire who might be regarded as their chief had private as well as public wrongs to revenge He went into the scheme with his whole heart and answered for his party four hundred sixteen Russell opened the design to Shrewsbury

none	none	He at once agreed to set his estate his honours and his life on the stake But Halifax received the first hint of the project in a way which showed that it would be useless and perhaps hazardous to be explicit He was indeed not the man for such an enterprise His intellect was inexhaustibly fertile of distinctions and objections his temper calm and unadventurous He was ready to oppose the court to the utmost in the House of Lords and by means of anonymous writings but he was little disposed to exchange his lordly repose for the insecure and agitated life of a conspirator to be in the power of accomplices to live in constant dread of warrants and King s messengers nay perhaps to end his days on a scaffold or to live on alms in some back street of the Hague He therefore let fall some words which plainly indicated that he did not wish to be privy to the intentions of his more daring and impetuous friends Sidney understood him and said no more four hundred seventeen The next application was made to Danby and had far better success Indeed for his bold and active spirit the danger and the excitement which were insupportable to the more delicately organized mind of Halifax had a strong fascination The different characters of the two statesmen were legible in their faces 
1052_132776_000006_000002	train-clean-360	The brow the eye and the mouth of Halifax indicated a powerful intellect and an exquisite sense of the ludicrous but the expression was that of a sceptic of a voluptuary of a man not likely to venture his all on a single hazard or to be a martyr in any cause

1121_132777_000007_000000	train-clean-360	These considerations might well have made William uneasy even if all the military means of the United Provinces had been at his absolute disposal

1121_132777_000007_000004	train-clean-360	The States General could not make war or peace could not conclude any alliance or levy any tax without the consent of the States of every province

1121_132777_000007_000007	train-clean-360	In some town councils the party which had during several generations regarded the influence of the Stadtholders with jealousy had great power 
none	none	At the head of this party were the magistrates of the noble city of Amsterdam which was then at the height of prosperity They had ever since the peace of Nimeguen kept up a friendly correspondence with Lewis through the instrumentality of his able and active envoy the Count of Avaux 
1121_132777_000007_000009	train-clean-360	Propositions brought forward by the Stadtholder as indispensable to the security of the commonwealth sanctioned by all the provinces except Holland and sanctioned by seventeen of the eighteen town councils of Holland had repeatedly been negatived by the single voice of Amsterdam 
1121_132777_000007_000010	train-clean-360	The only constitutional remedy in such cases was that deputies from the cities which were agreed should pay a visit to the city which dissented for the purpose of expostulation 
1121_132777_000007_000011	train-clean-360	The number of deputies was unlimited they might continue to expostulate as long as they thought fit and meanwhile all their expenses were defrayed by the obstinate community which refused to yield to their arguments 
none	none	This absurd mode of coercion had once been tried with success on the little town of Gorkum but was not likely to produce much effect on the mighty and opulent Amsterdam renowned throughout the world for its haven bristling with innumerable masts its canals bordered by stately mansions its gorgeous hall of state walled roofed and floored with polished marble its warehouses filled with the most costly productions of Ceylon and Surinam and its Exchange resounding with the endless hubbub of all the languages spoken by civilised men four hundred twenty six The disputes between the majority which supported the Stadtholder and the minority headed by the magistrates of Amsterdam had repeatedly run so high that bloodshed had seemed to be inevitable On one occasion the Prince had attempted to bring the refractory deputies to punishment as traitors On another occasion the gates of Amsterdam had been barred against him and troops had been raised to defend the privileges of the municipal council That the rulers of this great city would ever consent to an expedition offensive in the highest degree to Lewis whom they courted and likely to aggrandise the House of Orange which they abhorred was not likely Yet without their consent such an expedition could not legally be undertaken To quell their opposition by main force was a course from which in different circumstances the resolute and daring Stadtholder would not have shrunk But at that moment it was most important that he should carefully avoid every act which could be represented as tyrannical He could not venture to violate the fundamental laws of Holland at the very moment at which he was drawing the sword against his father in law for violating the fundamental laws of England The violent subversion of one free constitution would have been a strange prelude to the violent restoration of another four hundred twenty seven There was yet another difficulty which has been too little noticed by English writers but which was never for a moment absent from William s mind In the expedition which he meditated he could succeed only by appealing to the Protestant feeling of England and by stimulating that feeling till it became for a time the dominant and almost the exclusive sentiment of the nation This would indeed have been a very simple course had the end of all his politics been to effect a revolution in our island and to reign there But he had in view an ulterior end which could be attained only by the help of princes sincerely attached to the Church of Rome He was desirous to unite the Empire the Catholic King and the Holy See with England and Holland in a league against the French ascendency It was therefore necessary that while striking the greatest blow ever struck in defence of Protestantism he should yet contrive not to lose the goodwill of governments which regarded Protestantism as a deadly heresy Such were the complicated difficulties of this great undertaking Continental statesmen saw a part of those difficulties British statesmen another part One capacious and powerful mind alone took them all in at one view and determined to surmount them all It was no easy thing to subvert the English government by means of a foreign army without galling the national pride of Englishmen It was no easy thing to obtain from that Batavian faction which regarded France with partiality and the House of Orange with aversion a decision in favour of an expedition which would confound all the schemes of France and raise the House of Orange to the height of greatness It was no easy thing to lead enthusiastic Protestants on a crusade against Popery with the good wishes of almost all Popish governments and of the Pope himself Yet all these things William effected All his objects even those which appeared most incompatible with each other he attained completely and at once The whole history of ancient and of modern times records no other such triumph of statesmanship The task would indeed have been too arduous even for such a statesman as the Prince of Orange had not his chief adversaries been at this time smitten with an infatuation such as by many men not prone to superstition was ascribed to the special judgment of God Not only was the King of England as he had ever been stupid and perverse but even the counsel of the politic King of France was turned into foolishness Whatever wisdom and energy could do William did Those obstacles which no wisdom or energy could have overcome his enemies themselves studiously removed On the great day on which the Bishops were acquitted and on which the invitation was despatched to the Hague James returned from Hounslow to Westminster in a gloomy and agitated mood He made an effort that afternoon to appear cheerful four hundred twenty eight but the bonfires the rockets and above all the waxen Popes who were blazing in every quarter of London were not likely to soothe him Those who saw him on the morrow could easily read in his face and demeanour the violent emotions which agitated his mind four hundred twenty nine During some days he appeared so unwilling to talk about the trial that even Barillon could not venture to introduce the subject four hundred thirty Soon it began to be clear that defeat and mortification had only hardened the King s heart The first words which he uttered when he learned that the objects of his revenge had escaped him were So much the worse for them In a few days these words which he according to his fashion repeated many times were fully explained He blamed himself not for having prosecuted the Bishops but for having prosecuted them before a tribunal where questions of fact were decided by juries and where established principles of law could not be utterly disregarded even by the most servile Judges This error he determined to repair Not only the seven prelates who had signed the petition but the whole Anglican clergy should have reason to curse the day on which they had triumphed over their Sovereign Within a fortnight after the trial an order was made enjoining all Chancellors of dioceses and all Archdeacons to make a strict inquisition throughout their respective jurisdictions and to report to the High Commission within five weeks the names of all such rectors vicars and curates as had omitted to read the Declaration four hundred thirty one The King anticipated with delight the terror with which the offenders would learn that they were to be cited before a court which would give them no quarter four hundred thirty two The number of culprits was little if at all short of ten thousand and after what had passed at Magdalene College every one of them might reasonably expect to be interdicted from all his spiritual functions ejected from his benefice declared incapable of holding any other preferment and charged with the costs of the proceedings which had reduced him to beggary Such was the persecution with which James smarting from his great defeat in Westminster Hall resolved to harass the clergy Meanwhile he tried to show the lawyers by a prompt and large distribution of rewards and punishments that strenuous and unblushing servility even when least successful was a sure title to his favour and that whoever after years of obsequiousness ventured to deviate but for one moment into courage and honesty was guilty of an unpardonable offence The violence and audacity which the apostate Williams had exhibited throughout the trial of the Bishops had made him hateful to the whole nation four hundred thirty three He was recompensed with a baronetcy Holloway and Powell had raised their character by declaring that in their judgment the petition was no libel They were dismissed from their situations four hundred thirty four The fate of Wright seems to have been during some time in suspense He had indeed summed up against the Bishops but he had suffered their counsel to question the dispensing power He had pronounced the petition a libel but he had carefully abstained from pronouncing the Declaration legal and through the whole proceeding his tone had been that of a man who remembered that a day of reckoning might come He had indeed strong claims to indulgence for it was hardly to be expected that any human impudence would hold out without flagging through such a task in the presence of such a bar and of such an auditory The members of the Jesuitical cabal however blamed his want of spirit the Chancellor pronounced him a beast and it was generally believed that a new Chief Justice would be appointed four hundred thirty five But no change was made It would indeed have been no easy matter to supply Wright s place The many lawyers who were far superior to him in parts and learning were with scarcely an exception hostile to the designs of the government and the very few lawyers who surpassed him in turpitude and effrontery were with scarcely an exception to be found only in the lowest ranks of the profession and would have been incompetent to conduct the ordinary business of the Court of King s Bench Williams it is true united all the qualities which James required in a magistrate But the services of Williams were needed at the bar and had he been moved thence the crown would have been left without the help of any advocate even of the third rate Nothing had amazed or mortified the King more than the enthusiasm which the Dissenters had shown in the cause of the Bishops Penn who though he had himself sacrificed wealth and honours to his conscientious scruples seems to have imagined that nobody but himself had a conscience imputed the discontent of the Puritans to envy and dissatisfied ambition They had not had their share of the benefits promised by the Declaration of Indulgence none of them had been admitted to any high and honourable post and therefore it was not strange that they were jealous of the Roman Catholics Accordingly within a week after the great verdict had been pronounced in Westminster Hall Silas Titus a noted Presbyterian a vehement Exclusionist and a manager of Stafford s impeachment was invited to occupy a seat in the Privy Council He was one of the persons on whom the opposition had most confidently reckoned But the honour now offered to him and the hope of obtaining a large sum due to him from the crown overcame his virtue and to the great disgust of all classes of Protestants he was sworn in four hundred thirty six The vindictive designs of the King against the Church were not accomplished Almost all the Archdeacons and diocesan Chancellors refused to furnish the information which was required The day on which it had been intended that the whole body of the priesthood should be summoned to answer for the crime of disobedience arrived The High Commission met It appeared that scarcely one ecclesiastical officer had sent up a return At the same time a paper of grave import was delivered to the board It came from Sprat Bishop of Rochester During two years supported by the hope of an Archbishopric he had been content to bear the reproach of persecuting that Church which he was bound by every obligation of conscience and honour to defend But his hope had been disappointed He saw that unless he abjured his religion he had no chance of sitting on the metropolitan throne of York He was too goodnatured to find any pleasure in tyranny and too discerning not to see the signs of the coming retribution He therefore determined to resign his odious functions and he communicated his determination to his colleagues in a letter written like all his prose compositions with great propriety and dignity of style It was impossible he said that he could longer continue to be a member of the Commission He had himself in obedience to the royal command read the Declaration but he could not presume to condemn thousands of pious and loyal divines who had taken a different view of their duty and since it was resolved to punish them for acting according to their conscience he must declare that he would rather suffer with them than be accessary to their sufferings The Commissioners read and stood aghast The very faults of their colleague the known laxity of his principles the known meanness of his spirit made his defection peculiarly alarming A government must be indeed in danger when men like Sprat address it in the language of Hampden The tribunal lately so insolent became on a sudden strangely tame The ecclesiastical functionaries who had defied its authority were not even reprimanded It was not thought safe to hint any suspicion that their disobedience had been intentional They were merely enjoined to have their reports ready in four months The Commission then broke up in confusion It had received a death blow four hundred thirty seven While the High Commission shrank from a conflict with the Church the Church conscious of its strength and animated by a new enthusiasm invited by a series of defiances the attack of the High Commission Soon after the acquittal of the Bishops the venerable Ormond the most illustrious of the Cavaliers of the great civil war sank under his infirmities The intelligence of his death was conveyed with speed to Oxford Instantly the University of which he had long been Chancellor met to name a successor One party was for the eloquent and accomplished Halifax another for the grave and orthodox Nottingham Some mentioned the Earl of Abingdon who resided near them and had recently been turned out of the lieutenancy of the county for refusing to join with the King against the established religion But the majority consisting of a hundred and eighty graduates voted for the young Duke of Ormond grandson of their late head and son of the gallant Ossory The speed with which they came to this resolution was caused by their apprehension that if there were a delay even of a day the King would attempt to force on them some chief who would betray their rights The apprehension was reasonable for only two hours after they had separated came a mandate from Whitehall requiring them to choose Jeffreys Happily the election of young Ormond was already complete and irrevocable four hundred thirty eight A few weeks later the infamous Timothy Hall who had distinguished himself among the clergy of London by reading the Declaration was rewarded with the Bishopric of Oxford which had been vacant since the death of the not less infamous Parker Hall came down to his see but the Canons of his Cathedral refused to attend his installation the University refused to create him a Doctor not a single one of the academic youth applied to him for holy orders no cap was touched to him and in his palace he found himself alone four hundred thirty nine Soon afterwards a living which was in the gift of Magdalene College Oxford became vacant Hough and his ejected brethren assembled and presented a clerk and the Bishop of Gloucester in whose diocese the living lay instituted their presentee without hesitation four hundred forty The gentry were not less refractory than the clergy The assizes of that summer wore all over the country an aspect never before known The Judges before they set out on their circuits had been summoned into the King s presence and had been directed by him to impress on the grand jurors and magistrates throughout the kingdom the duty of electing such members of Parliament as would support his policy They obeyed his commands harangued vehemently against the clergy reviled the seven Bishops called the memorable petition a factious libel criticized with great asperity Sancroft s style which was indeed open to criticism and pronounced that his Grace ought to be whipped by Doctor Busby for writing bad English But the only effect of these indecent declamations was to increase the public discontent All the marks of public respect which had usually been shown to the judicial office and to the royal commission were withdrawn The old custom was that men of good birth and estate should ride in the train of the Sheriff when he escorted the Judges to the county town but such a procession could now with difficulty be formed in any part of the kingdom The successors of Powell and Holloway in particular were treated with marked indignity The Oxford circuit had been allotted to them and they had expected to be greeted in every shire by a cavalcade of the loyal gentry But as they approached Wallingford where they were to open their commission for Berkshire the Sheriff alone came forth to meet them As they approached Oxford the eminently loyal capital of an eminently loyal province they were again welcomed by the Sheriff alone four hundred forty one The army was scarcely less disaffected than the clergy or the gentry The garrison of the Tower had drunk the health of the imprisoned Bishops The footguards stationed at Lambeth had with every mark of reverence welcomed the Primate back to his palace Nowhere had the news of the acquittal been received with more clamorous delight than at Hounslow Heath In truth the great force which the King had assembled for the purpose of overawing his mutinous capital had become more mutinous than the capital itself and was more dreaded by the court than by the citizens Early in August therefore the camp was broken up and the troops were sent to quarters in different parts of the country four hundred forty two James flattered himself that it would be easier to deal with separate battalions than with many thousands of men collected in one mass The first experiment was tried on Lord Lichfield s regiment of infantry now called the Twelfth of the Line That regiment was probably selected because it had been raised at the time of the Western insurrection in Staffordshire a province where the Roman Catholics were more numerous and powerful than in almost any other part of England The men were drawn up in the King s presence Their major informed them that His Majesty wished them to subscribe an engagement binding them to assist in carrying into effect his intentions concerning the test and that all who did not choose to comply must quit the service on the spot To the King s great astonishment whole ranks instantly laid down their pikes and muskets Only two officers and a few privates all Roman Catholics obeyed his command He remained silent for a short time Then he bade the men take up their arms Another time he said with a gloomy look I shall not do you the honour to consult you four hundred forty three It was plain that if he determined to persist in his designs he must remodel his army Yet materials for that purpose he could not find in our island The members of his Church even in the districts where they were most numerous were a small minority of the people Hatred of Popery had spread through all classes of his Protestant subjects and had become the ruling passion even of ploughmen and artisans But there was another part of his dominions where a very different spirit animated the great body of the population There was no limit to the number of Roman Catholic soldiers whom the good pay and quarters of England would attract across saint George s Channel Tyrconnel had been during some time employed in forming out of the peasantry of his country a military force on which his master might depend Already Papists of Celtic blood and speech composed almost the whole army of Ireland Barillon earnestly and repeatedly advised James to bring over that army for the purpose of coercing the English four hundred forty four James wavered He wished to be surrounded by troops on whom he could rely but he dreaded the explosion of national feeling which the appearance of a great Irish force on English ground must produce At last as usually happens when a weak man tries to avoid opposite inconveniences he took a course which united them all He brought over Irishmen not indeed enough to hold down the single city of London or the single county of York but more than enough to excite the alarm and rage of the whole kingdom from Northumberland to Cornwall Battalion after battalion raised and trained by Tyrconnel landed on the western coast and moved towards the capital and Irish recruits were imported in considerable numbers to fill up vacancies in the English regiments four hundred forty five Of the many errors which James committed none was more fatal than this Already he had alienated the hearts of his people by violating their laws confiscating their estates and persecuting their religion Of those who had once been most zealous for monarchy he had already made many rebels in heart Yet he might still with some chance of success have appealed to the patriotic spirit of his subjects against an invader For they were a race insular in temper as well as in geographical position Their national antipathies were indeed in that age unreasonably and unamiably strong Never had the English been accustomed to the control of interference of any stranger The appearance of a foreign army on their soil might impel them to rally even round a King whom they had no reason to love William might perhaps have been unable to overcome this difficulty but James removed it Not even the arrival of a brigade of Lewis s musketeers would have excited such resentment and shame as our ancestors felt when they saw armed columns of Papists just arrived from Dublin moving in military pomp along the high roads No man of English blood then regarded the aboriginal Irish as his countrymen They did not belong to our branch of the great human family They were distinguished from us by more than one moral and intellectual peculiarity which the difference of situation and of education great as that difference was did not seem altogether to explain They had an aspect of their own a mother tongue of their own When they talked English their pronunciation was ludicrous their phraseology was grotesque as is always the phraseology of those who think in one language and express their thoughts in another They were therefore foreigners and of all foreigners they were the most hated and despised the most hated for they had during five centuries always been our enemies the most despised for they were our vanquished enslaved and despoiled enemies The Englishman compared with pride his own fields with the desolate bogs whence the Rapparees issued forth to rob and murder and his own dwelling with the hovels where the peasants and the hogs of the Shannon wallowed in filth together He was a member of a society far inferior indeed in wealth and civilisation to the society in which we live but still one of the wealthiest and most highly civilised societies that the world had then seen the Irish were almost as rude as the savages of Labrador He was a freeman the Irish were the hereditary serfs of his race He worshipped God after a pure and rational fashion the Irish were sunk in idolatry and superstition He knew that great numbers of Irish had repeatedly fled before a small English force and that the whole Irish population had been held down by a small English colony and he very complacently inferred that he was naturally a being of a higher order than the Irishman for it is thus that a dominant race always explains its ascendency and excuses its tyranny That in vivacity humour and eloquence the Irish stand high among the nations of the world is now universally acknowledged That when well disciplined they are excellent soldiers has been proved on a hundred fields of battle Yet it is certain that a century and a half ago they were generally despised in our island as both a stupid and a cowardly people And these were the men who were to hold England down by main force while her civil and ecclesiastical constitution was destroyed The blood of the whole nation boiled at the thought To be conquered by Frenchmen or by Spaniards would have seemed comparatively a tolerable fate With Frenchmen and Spaniards we had been accustomed to treat on equal terms We had sometimes envied their prosperity sometimes dreaded their power sometimes congratulated ourselves on their friendship In spite of our unsocial pride we admitted that they were great nations and that they could boast of men eminent in the arts of war and peace But to be subjugated by an inferior caste was a degradation beyond all other degradation The English felt as the white inhabitants of Charleston and New Orleans would feel if those towns were occupied by negro garrisons The real facts would have been sufficient to excite uneasiness and indignation but the real facts were lost amidst a crowd of wild rumours which flew without ceasing from coffeehouse to coffeehouse and from alebench to alebench and became more wonderful and terrible at every stage of the progress The number of the Irish troops who had landed on our shores might justly excite serious apprehensions as to the King s ulterior designs but it was magnified tenfold by the public apprehensions It may well be supposed that the rude kerne of Connaught placed with arms in his hands among a foreign people whom he hated and by whom he was hated in turn was guilty of some excesses These excesses were exaggerated by report and in addition to the outrages which the stranger had really committed all the offences of his English comrades were set down to his account From every corner of the kingdom a cry arose against the foreign barbarians who forced themselves into private houses seized horses and waggons extorted money and insulted women These men it was said were the sons of those who forty seven years before had massacred Protestants by tens of thousands The history of the rebellion of sixteen forty one a history which even when soberly related might well move pity and horror and which had been frightfully distorted by national and religious antipathies was now the favourite topic of conversation Hideous stories of houses burned with all the inmates of women and young children butchered of near relations compelled by torture to be the murderers of each other of corpses outraged and mutilated were told and heard with full belief and intense interest Then it was added that the dastardly savages who had by surprise committed all these cruelties on an unsuspecting and defenceless colony had as soon as Oliver came among them on his great mission of vengeance flung down their arms in panic terror and had sunk without trying the chances of a single pitched field into that slavery which was their fit portion Many signs indicated that another great spoliation and slaughter of the Saxon settlers was meditated by the Lord Lieutenant Already thousands of Protestant colonists flying from the injustice and insolence of Tyrconnel had raised the indignation of the mother country by describing all that they had suffered and all that they had with too much reason feared How much the public mind had been excited by the complaints of these fugitives had recently been shown in a manner not to be mistaken Tyrconnel had transmitted for the royal approbation the heads of a bill repealing the law by which half the soil of Ireland was held and he had sent to Westminster as his agents two of his Roman Catholic countrymen who had lately been raised to high judicial office Nugent Chief Justice of the Irish Court of King s Bench a personification of all the vices and weaknesses which the English then imagined to be characteristic of the Popish Celt and Rice a Baron of the Irish Exchequer who in abilities and attainments was perhaps the foremost man of his race and religion The object of the mission was well known and the two Judges could not venture to show themselves in the streets If ever they were recognised the rabble shouted Room for the Irish Ambassadors and their coach was escorted with mock solemnity by a train of ushers and harbingers bearing sticks with potatoes stuck on the points four hundred forty six So strong and general indeed was at that time the aversion of the English to the Irish that the most distinguished Roman Catholics partook of it Powis and Bellasyse expressed in coarse and acrimonious language even at the Council board their antipathy to the aliens four hundred forty seven Among English Protestants that antipathy was still stronger and perhaps it was strongest in the army Neither officers nor soldiers were disposed to bear patiently the preference shown by their master to a foreign and a subject race The Duke of Berwick who was Colonel of the Eighth Regiment of the Line then quartered at Portsmouth gave orders that thirty men just arrived from Ireland should be enlisted The English soldiers declared that they would not serve with these intruders John Beaumont the Lieutenant Colonel in his own name and in the name of five of the Captains protested to the Duke s face against this insult to the English army and nation We raised the regiment he said at our own charges to defend His Majesty s crown in a time of danger We had then no difficulty in procuring hundreds of English recruits We can easily keep every company up to its full complement without admitting Irishmen We therefore do not think it consistent with our honour to have these strangers forced on us and we beg that we may either be permitted to command men of our own nation or to lay down our commissions Berwick sent to Windsor for directions The King greatly exasperated instantly despatched a troop of horse to Portsmouth with orders to bring the six refractory officers before him A council of war sate on them They refused to make any submission and they were sentenced to be cashiered the highest punishment which a court martial was then competent to inflict The whole nation applauded the disgraced officers and the prevailing sentiment was stimulated by an unfounded rumour that while under arrest they had been treated with cruelty four hundred forty eight Public feeling did not then manifest itself by those signs with which we are familiar by large meetings and by vehement harangues Nevertheless it found a vent Thomas Wharton who in the last Parliament had represented Buckinghamshire and who was already conspicuous both as a libertine and as a Whig had written a satirical ballad on the administration of Tyrconnel In this little poem an Irishman congratulates a brother Irishman in a barbarous jargon on the approaching triumph of Popery and of the Milesian race The Protestant heir will be excluded The Protestant officers will be broken The Great Charter and the praters who appeal to it will be hanged in one rope The good Talbot will shower commissions on his countrymen and will cut the throats of the English These verses which were in no respect above the ordinary standard of street poetry had for burden some gibberish which was said to have been used as a watchword by the insurgents of Ulster in sixteen forty one The verses and the tune caught the fancy of the nation From one end of England to the other all classes were constantly singing this idle rhyme It was especially the delight of the English army More than seventy years after the Revolution a great writer delineated with exquisite skill a veteran who had fought at the Boyne and at Namur One of the characteristics of the good old soldier is his trick of whistling Lillibullero four hundred forty nine Wharton afterwards boasted that he had sung a King out of three kingdoms But in truth the success of Lillibullero was the effect and not the cause of that excited state of public feeling which produced the Revolution While James was thus raising against himself all those national feelings which but for his own folly might have saved his throne Lewis was in another way exerting himself not less effectually to facilitate the enterprise which William meditated The party in Holland which was favourable to France was a minority but a minority strong enough according to the constitution of the Batavian federation to prevent the Stadtholder from striking any great blow To keep that minority steady was an object to which if the Court of Versailles had been wise every other object would at that conjuncture have been postponed Lewis however had during some time laboured as if of set purpose to estrange his Dutch friends and he at length though not without difficulty succeeded in forcing them to become his enemies at the precise moment at which their help would have been invaluable to him There were two subjects on which the people of the United Provinces were peculiarly sensitive religion and trade and both their religion and their trade the French King assailed The persecution of the Huguenots and the revocation of the edict of Nantes had everywhere moved the grief and indignation of Protestants But in Holland these feelings were stronger than in any other country for many persons of Dutch birth confiding in the repeated and solemn declarations of Lewis that the toleration granted by his grandfather should be maintained had for commercial purposes settled in France and a large proportion of the settlers had been naturalised there Every post now brought to Holland the tidings that these persons were treated with extreme rigour on account of their religion Dragoons it was reported were quartered on one Another had been held naked before a fire till he was half roasted All were forbidden under the severest penalties to celebrate the rites of their religion or to quit the country into which they had under false pretences been decoyed The partisans of the House of Orange exclaimed against the cruelty and perfidy of the tyrant The opposition was abashed and dispirited Even the town council of Amsterdam though strongly attached to the French interest and to the Arminian theology and though little inclined to find fault with Lewis or to sympathize with the Calvinists whom he persecuted could not venture to oppose itself to the general sentiment for in that great city there was scarcely one wealthy merchant who had not some kinsman or friend among the sufferers Petitions numerously and respectably signed were presented to the Burgomasters imploring them to make strong representations to Avaux There were even suppliants who made their way into the Stadthouse flung themselves on their knees described with tears and sobs the lamentable condition of those whom they most loved and besought the intercession of the magistrates The pulpits resounded with invectives and lamentations The press poured forth heartrending narratives and stirring exhortations Avaux saw the whole danger He reported to his court that even the well intentioned for so he always called the enemies of the House of Orange either partook of the public feeling or were overawed by it and he suggested the policy of making some concession to their wishes The answers which he received from Versailles were cold and acrimonious Some Dutch families indeed which had not been naturalised in France were permitted to return to their country But to those natives of Holland who had obtained letters of naturalisation Lewis refused all indulgence No power on earth he said should interfere between him and his subjects These people had chosen to become his subjects and how he treated them was a matter with which no neighbouring state had anything to do The magistrates of Amsterdam naturally resented the scornful ingratitude of the potentate whom they had strenuously and unscrupulously served against the general sense of their own countrymen Soon followed another provocation which they felt even more keenly Lewis began to make war on their trade He first put forth an edict prohibiting the importation of herrings into his dominions Avaux hastened to inform his court that this step had excited great alarm and indignation that sixty thousand persons in the United Provinces subsisted by the herring fishery and that some strong measure of retaliation would probably be adopted by the States The answer which he received was that the King was determined not only to persist but also to increase the duties on many of those articles in which Holland carried on a lucrative trade with France The consequence of these errors errors committed in defiance of repeated warnings and as it should seem in the mere wantonness of selfwill was that now when the voice of a single powerful member of the Batavian federation might have averted an event fatal to all the politics of Lewis no such voice was raised The Envoy with all his skill vainly endeavoured to rally the party by the help of which he had during several years held the Stadtholder in check The arrogance and obstinacy of the master counteracted all the efforts of the servant At length Avaux was compelled to send to Versailles the alarming tidings that no reliance could be placed on Amsterdam so long devoted to the French cause that some of the well intentioned were alarmed for their religion and that the few whose inclinations were unchanged could not venture to utter what they thought The fervid eloquence of preachers who declaimed against the horrors of the French persecution and the lamentations of bankrupts who ascribed their ruin to the French decrees had wrought up the people to such a temper that no citizen could declare himself favourable to France without imminent risk of being flung into the nearest canal Men remembered that only fifteen years before the most illustrious chief of the party adverse to the House of Orange had been torn to pieces by an infuriated mob in the very precinct of the palace of the States General A similar fate might not improbably befall those who should at this crisis be accused of serving the purposes of France against their native land and against the reformed religion four hundred fifty While Lewis was thus forcing his friends in Holland to become or to pretend to become his enemies he was labouring with not less success to remove all the scruples which might have prevented the Roman Catholic princes of the Continent from countenancing William s designs A new quarrel had arisen between the Court of Versailles and the Vatican a quarrel in which the injustice and insolence of the French King were perhaps more offensively displayed than in any other transaction of his reign It had long been the rule at Rome that no officer of justice or finance could enter the dwelling inhabited by the minister who represented a Catholic state In process of time not only the dwelling but a large precinct round it was held inviolable It was a point of honour with every Ambassador to extend as widely as possible the limits of the region which was under his protection At length half the city consisted of privileged districts within which the Papal government had no more power than within the Louvre or the Escurial Every asylum was thronged with contraband traders fraudulent bankrupts thieves and assassins In every asylum were collected magazines of stolen or smuggled goods From every asylum ruffians sallied forth nightly to plunder and stab In no town of Christendom consequently was law so impotent and wickedness so audacious as in the ancient capital of religion and civilisation On this subject Innocent felt as became a priest and a prince He declared that he would receive no Ambassador who insisted on a right so destructive of order and morality There was at first much murmuring but his resolution was so evidently just that all governments but one speedily acquiesced The Emperor highest in rank among Christian monarchs the Spanish court distinguished among all courts by sensitiveness and pertinacity on points of etiquette renounced the odious privilege Lewis alone was impracticable What other sovereigns might choose to do he said was nothing to him He therefore sent a mission to Rome escorted by a great force of cavalry and infantry The Ambassador marched to his palace as a general marches in triumph through a conquered town The house was strongly guarded Round the limits of the protected district sentinels paced the rounds day and night as on the walls of a fortress The Pope was unmoved They trust he cried in chariots and in horses but we will remember the name of the Lord our God He betook him vigorously to his spiritual weapons and laid the region garrisoned by the French under an interdict four hundred fifty one This dispute was at the height when another dispute arose in which the Germanic body was as deeply concerned as the Pope Cologne and the surrounding district were governed by an Archbishop who was an Elector of the Empire The right of choosing this great prelate belonged under certain limitations to the Chapter of the Cathedral The Archbishop was also Bishop of Liege of Munster and of Hildesheim His dominions were extensive and included several strong fortresses which in the event of a campaign on the Rhine would be of the highest importance In time of war he could bring twenty thousand men into the field Lewis had spared no effort to gain so valuable an ally and had succeeded so well that Cologne had been almost separated from Germany and had become an outwork of France Many ecclesiastics devoted to the court of Versailles had been brought into the Chapter and Cardinal Furstemburg a mere creature of that court had been appointed Coadjutor In the summer of the year sixteen eighty eight the archbishopric became vacant Furstemburg was the candidate of the House of Bourbon The enemies of that house proposed the young Prince Clement of Bavaria Furstemburg was already a Bishop and therefore could not be moved to another diocese except by a special dispensation from the Pope or by a postulation in which it was necessary that two thirds of the Chapter of Cologne should join The Pope would grant no dispensation to a creature of France The Emperor induced more than a third part of the Chapter to vote for the Bavarian prince Meanwhile in the Chapters of Liege Munster and Hildesheim the majority was adverse to France Lewis saw with indignation and alarm that an extensive province which he had begun to regard as a fief of his crown was about to become not merely independent of him but hostile to him In a paper written with great acrimony he complained of the injustice with which France was on all occasions treated by that See which ought to extend a parental protection to every part of Christendom Many signs indicated his fixed resolution to support the pretensions of his candidate by arms against the Pope and the Pope s confederates four hundred fifty two Thus Lewis by two opposite errors raised against himself at once the resentment of both the religious parties between which Western Europe was divided Having alienated one great section of Christendom by persecuting the Huguenots he alienated another by insulting the Holy See These faults he committed at a conjuncture at which no fault could be committed with impunity and under the eye of an opponent second in vigilance sagacity and energy to no statesman whose memory history has preserved William saw with stern delight his adversaries toiling to clear away obstacle after obstacle from his path While they raised against themselves the enmity of all sects he laboured to conciliate all The great design which he meditated he with exquisite skill presented to different governments in different lights and it must be added that though those lights were different none of them was false He called on the princes of Northern Germany to rally round him in defence of the common cause of all reformed Churches He set before the two heads of the House of Austria the danger with which they were threatened by French ambition and the necessity of rescuing England from vassalage and of uniting her to the European confederacy four hundred fifty three He disclaimed and with truth all bigotry The real enemy he said of the British Roman Catholics was that shortsighted and headstrong monarch who when he might easily have obtained for them a legal toleration had trampled on law liberty property in order to raise them to an odious and precarious ascendency If the misgovernment of James were suffered to continue it must produce at no remote time a popular outbreak which might be followed by a barbarous persecution of the Papists The Prince declared that to avert the horrors of such a persecution was one of his chief objects If he succeeded in his design he would use the power which he must then possess as head of the Protestant interest to protect the members of the Church of Rome Perhaps the passions excited by the tyranny of James might make it impossible to efface the penal laws from the statute book but those laws should be mitigated by a lenient administration No class would really gain more by the proposed expedition than those peaceable and unambitious Roman Catholics who merely wished to follow their callings and to worship their Maker without molestation The only losers would be the Tyrconnels the Dovers the Albevilles and the other political adventurers who in return for flattery and evil counsel had obtained from their credulous master governments regiments and embassies While William exerted himself to enlist on his side the sympathies both of Protestants and of Roman Catholics he exerted himself with not less vigour and prudence to provide the military means which his undertaking required He could not make a descent on England without the sanction of the United Provinces If he asked for that sanction before his design was ripe for execution his intentions might possibly be thwarted by the faction hostile to his house and would certainly be divulged to the whole world He therefore determined to make his preparations with all speed and when they were complete to seize some favourable moment for requesting the consent of the federation It was observed by the agents of France that he was more busy than they had ever known him Not a day passed on which he was not seen spurring from his villa to the Hague He was perpetually closeted with his most distinguished adherents Twenty four ships of war were fitted out for sea in addition to the ordinary force which the commonwealth maintained There was as it chanced an excellent pretence for making this addition to the marine for some Algerine corsairs had recently dared to show themselves in the German Ocean A camp was formed near Nimeguen Many thousands of troops were assembled there In order to strengthen this army the garrisons were withdrawn from the strongholds in Dutch Brabant Even the renowned fortress of Bergopzoom was left almost defenceless Field pieces bombs and tumbrels from all the magazines of the United Provinces were collected at the head quarters All the bakers of Rotterdam toiled day and night to make biscuit All the gunmakers of Utrecht were found too few to execute the orders for pistols and muskets All the saddlers of Amsterdam were hard at work on harness and bolsters Six thousand sailors were added to the naval establishment Seven thousand new soldiers were raised They could not indeed be formally enlisted without the sanction of the federation but they were well drilled and kept in such a state of discipline that they might without difficulty be distributed into regiments within twenty four hours after that sanction should be obtained These preparations required ready money but William had by strict economy laid up against a great emergency a treasure amounting to about two hundred and fifty thousand pounds sterling What more was wanting was supplied by the zeal of his partisans Great quantities of gold not less it was said than a hundred thousand guineas came to him from England The Huguenots who had carried with them into exile large quantities of the precious metals were eager to lend him all that they possessed for they fondly hoped that if he succeeded they should be restored to the country of their birth and they feared that if he failed they should scarcely be safe even in the country of their adoption four hundred fifty four Through the latter part of July and the whole of August the preparations went on rapidly yet too slowly for the vehement spirit of William Meanwhile the intercourse between England and Holland was active The ordinary modes of conveying intelligence and passengers were no longer thought safe A light bark of marvellous speed constantly ran backward and forward between Schevening and the eastern coast of our island four hundred fifty five By this vessel William received a succession of letters from persons of high note in the Church the state and the army Two of the seven prelates who had signed the memorable petition Lloyd Bishop of saint Asaph and Trelawney Bishop of Bristol had during their residence in the tower reconsidered the doctrine of nonresistance and were ready to welcome an armed deliverer A brother of the Bishop of Bristol Colonel Charles Trelawney who commanded one of the Tangier regiments now known as the Fourth of the Line signified his readiness to draw his sword for the Protestant religion Similar assurances arrived from the savage Kirke Churchill in a letter written with a certain elevation of language which was the sure mark that he was going to commit a baseness declared that he was determined to perform his duty to heaven and to his country and that he put his honour absolutely into the hands of the Prince of Orange William doubtless read these words with one of those bitter and cynical smiles which gave his face its least pleasing expression It was not his business to take care of the honour of other men nor had the most rigid casuists pronounced it unlawful in a general to invite to use and to reward the services of deserters whom he could not but despise four hundred fifty six Churchill s letter was brought by Sidney whose situation in England had become hazardous and who having taken many precautions to hide his track had passed over to Holland about the middle of August four hundred fifty seven About the same time Shrewsbury and Edward Russell crossed the German Ocean in a boat which they had hired with great secrecy and appeared at the Hague Shrewsbury brought with him twelve thousand pounds which he had raised by a mortgage on his estates and which he lodged in the bank of Amsterdam four hundred fifty eight Devonshire Danby and Lumley remained in England where they undertook to rise in arms as soon as the Prince should set foot on the island There is reason to believe that at this conjuncture William first received assurances of support from a very different quarter The history of Sunderland s intrigues is covered with an obscurity which it is not probable that any inquirer will ever succeed in penetrating but though it is impossible to discover the whole truth it is easy to detect some palpable fictions The Jacobites for obvious reasons affirmed that the revolution of sixteen eighty eight was the result of a plot concerted long before Sunderland they represented as the chief conspirator He had they averred in pursuance of his great design incited his too confiding master to dispense with statutes to create an illegal tribunal to confiscate freehold property and to send the fathers of the Established Church to a prison This romance rests on no evidence and though it has been repeated down to our own time seems hardly to deserve confutation No fact is more certain than that Sunderland opposed some of the most imprudent steps which James took and in particular the prosecution of the Bishops which really brought on the decisive crisis But even if this fact were not established there would still remain one argument sufficient to decide the controversy What conceivable motive had Sunderland to wish for a revolution Under the existing system he was at the height of dignity and prosperity As President of the Council he took precedence of the whole temporal peerage As Principal Secretary of State he was the most active and powerful member of the cabinet He might look forward to a dukedom He had obtained the garter lately worn by the brilliant and versatile Buckingham who having squandered away a princely fortune and a vigorous intellect had sunk into the grave deserted contemned and broken hearted four hundred fifty nine Money which Sunderland valued more than honours poured in upon him in such abundance that with ordinary management he might hope to become in a few years one of the wealthiest subjects in Europe The direct emolument of his posts though considerable was a very small part of what he received From France alone he drew a regular stipend of near six thousand pounds a year besides large occasional gratuities He had bargained with Tyrconnel for five thousand a year or fifty thousand pounds down from Ireland What sums he made by selling places titles and pardons can only be conjectured but must have been enormous James seemed to take a pleasure in loading with wealth one whom he regarded as his own convert All fines all forfeitures went to Sunderland On every grant toll was paid to him If any suitor ventured to ask any favour directly from the King the answer was Have you spoken to my Lord President One bold man ventured to say that the Lord President got all the money of the court Well replied His Majesty he deserves it all four hundred sixty We shall scarcely overrate the amount of the minister s gains if we put them at thirty thousand pounds a year and it must be remembered that fortunes of thirty thousand pounds a year were in his time rarer than fortunes of a hundred thousand pounds a year now are It is probable that there was then not one peer of the realm whose private income equalled Sunderland s official income What chance was there that in a new order of things a man so deeply implicated in illegal and unpopular acts a member of the High Commission a renegade whom the multitude in places of general resort pursued with the cry of Popish dog would be greater and richer What chance that he would even be able to escape condign punishment He had undoubtedly been long in the habit of looking forward to the time when William and Mary might be in the ordinary course of nature and law at the head of the English government and had probably attempted to make for himself an interest in their favour by promises and services which if discovered would not have raised his credit at Whitehall But it may with confidence be affirmed that he had no wish to see them raised to power by a revolution and that he did not at all foresee such a revolution when towards the close of June sixteen eighty eight he solemnly joined the communion of the Church of Rome Scarcely however had he by that inexpiable crime made himself an object of hatred and contempt to the whole nation when he learned that the civil and ecclesiastical polity of England would shortly be vindicated by foreign and domestic arms From that moment all his plans seem to have undergone a change Fear bowed down his whole soul and was so written in his face that all who saw him could read four hundred sixty one It could hardly be doubted that if there were a revolution the evil counsellors who surrounded the throne would be called to a strict account and among those counsellors he stood in the foremost rank The loss of his places his salaries his pensions was the least that he had to dread His patrimonial mansion amid woods at Althorpe might be confiscated He might lie many years in a prison He might end his days in a foreign land a pensioner on the bounty of France Even this was not the worst Visions of an innumerable crowd covering Tower Hill and shouting with savage joy at the sight of the apostate of a scaffold hung with black of Burnet reading the prayer for the departing and of Ketch leaning on the axe with which Russell and Monmouth had been mangled in so butcherly a fashion began to haunt the unhappy statesman There was yet one way in which he might escape a way more terrible to a noble spirit than a prison or a scaffold He might still by a well timed and useful treason earn his pardon from the foes of the government It was in his power to render to them at this conjuncture services beyond all price for he had the royal ear he had great influence over the Jesuitical cabal and he was blindly trusted by the French Ambassador A channel of communication was not wanting a channel worthy of the purpose which it was to serve The Countess of Sunderland was an artful woman who under a show of devotion which imposed on some grave men carried on with great activity both amorous and political intrigues four hundred sixty two The handsome and dissolute Henry Sidney had long been her favourite lover Her husband was well pleased to see her thus connected with the court of the Hague Whenever he wished to transmit a secret message to Holland he spoke to his wife she wrote to Sidney and Sidney communicated her letter to William One of her communications was intercepted and carried to James She vehemently protested that it was a forgery Her husband with characteristic ingenuity defended himself by representing that it was quite impossible for any man to be so base as to do what he was in the habit of doing Even if this is Lady Sunderland s hand he said that is no affair of mine Your Majesty knows my domestic misfortunes The footing on which my wife and mister Sidney are is but too public Who can believe that I would make a confidant of the man who has injured my honour in the tenderest point of the man whom of all others I ought most to hate four hundred sixty three This defence was thought satisfactory and secret intelligence was still transmitted from the wittol to the adulteress from the adulteress to the gallant and from the gallant to the enemies of James It is highly probable that the first decisive assurances of Sunderland s support were conveyed orally by Sidney to William about the middle of August It is certain that from that time till the expedition was ready to sail a most significant correspondence was kept up between the Countess and her lover A few of her letters partly written in cipher are still extant They contain professions of good will and promises of service mingled with earnest intreaties for protection The writer intimates that her husband will do all that his friends at the Hague can wish she supposes that it will be necessary for him to go into temporary exile but she hopes that his banishment will not be perpetual and that his patrimonial estate will be spared and she earnestly begs to be informed in what place it will be best for him to take refuge till the first fury of the storm is over four hundred sixty four The help of Sunderland was most welcome For as the time of striking the great blow drew near the anxiety of William became intense From common eyes his feelings were concealed by the icy tranquillity of his demeanour but his whole heart was open to Bentinck The preparations were not quite complete The design was already suspected and could not be long concealed The King of France or the city of Amsterdam might still frustrate the whole plan If Lewis were to send a great force into Brabant if the faction which hated the Stadtholder were to raise its head all was over My sufferings my disquiet the Prince wrote are dreadful

none	none	Never in my life did I so much feel the need of God s guidance four hundred sixty five Bentinck s wife was at this time dangerously ill and both the friends were painfully anxious about her God support you William wrote and enable you to bear your part in a work on which as far as human beings can see the welfare of his Church depends four hundred sixty six It was indeed impossible that a design so vast as that which had been formed against the King of England should remain during many weeks a secret No art could prevent intelligent men from perceiving that William was making great military and naval preparations and from suspecting the object with which those preparations were made Early in August hints that some great event was approaching were whispered up and down London The weak and corrupt Albeville was then on a visit to England and was or affected to be certain that the Dutch government entertained no design unfriendly to James But during the absence of Albeville from his post Avaux performed with eminent skill the duties both of French and English Ambassador to the States and supplied Barillon as well as Lewis with ample intelligence Avaux was satisfied that a descent on England was in contemplation and succeeded in convincing his master of the truth Every courier who arrived at Westminster either from the Hague or from Versailles brought earnest warnings four hundred sixty seven But James was under a delusion which appears to have been artfully encouraged by Sunderland The Prince of Orange said the cunning minister would never dare to engage in an expedition beyond sea leaving Holland defenceless The States remembering what they had suffered and what they had been in danger of suffering during the great agony of sixteen seventy two would never incur the risk of again seeing an invading army encamped on the plain between Utrecht and Amsterdam There was doubtless much discontent in England but the interval was immense between discontent and rebellion Men of rank and fortune were not disposed lightly to hazard their honours their estates and their lives How many eminent Whigs had held high language when Monmouth was in the Netherlands And yet when he set up his standard what eminent Whig had joined it It was easy to understand why Lewis affected to give credit to these idle rumours He doubtless hoped to frighten the King of England into taking the French side in the dispute about Cologne By such reasoning James was easily lulled into stupid security four hundred sixty eight The alarm and indignation of Lewis increased daily The style of his letters became sharp and vehement four hundred sixty nine He could not understand he wrote this lethargy on the eve of a terrible crisis Was the King bewitched Were his ministers blind Was it possible that nobody at Whitehall was aware of what was passing in England and on the Continent Such foolhardy security could scarcely be the effect of mere improvidence There must be foul play James was evidently in bad hands Barillon was earnestly cautioned not to repose implicit confidence in the English ministers but he was cautioned in vain On him as on James Sunderland had cast a spell which no exhortation could break Lewis bestirred himself vigorously Bonrepaux who was far superior to Barillon in shrewdness and who had always disliked and distrusted Sunderland was despatched to London with an offer of naval assistance Avaux was at the same time ordered to declare to the States General that France had taken James under her protection A large body of troops was held in readiness to march towards the Dutch frontier This bold attempt to save the infatuated tyrant in his own despite was made with the full concurrence of Skelton who was now Envoy from England to the court of Versailles Avaux in conformity with his instructions demanded an audience of the States It was readily granted The assembly was unusually large The general belief was that some overture respecting commerce was about to be made and the President brought a written answer framed on that supposition As soon as Avaux began to disclose his errand signs of uneasiness were discernible Those who were believed to enjoy the confidence of the Prince of Orange cast down their eyes The agitation became great when the Envoy announced that his master was strictly bound by the ties of friendship and alliance to His Britannic Majesty and that any attack on England would be considered as a declaration of war against France The President completely taken by surprise stammered out a few evasive phrases and the conference terminated It was at the same time notified to the States that Lewis had taken under his protection Cardinal Furstemburg and the Chapter of Cologne four hundred seventy The Deputies were in great agitation Some recommended caution and delay Others breathed nothing but war Fagel spoke vehemently of the French insolence and implored his brethren not to be daunted by threats The proper answer to such a communication he said was to levy more soldiers and to equip more ships A courier was instantly despatched to recall William from Minden where he was holding a consultation of high moment with the Elector of Brandenburg But there was no cause for alarm James was bent on ruining himself and every attempt to stop him only made him rush more eagerly to his doom When his throne was secure when his people were submissive when the most obsequious of Parliaments was eager to anticipate all his reasonable wishes when foreign kingdoms and commonwealths paid emulous court to him when it depended only on himself whether he would be the arbiter of Christendom he had stooped to be the slave and the hireling of France And now when by a series of crimes and follies he had succeeded in alienating his neighbours his subjects his soldiers his sailors his children and had left himself no refuge but the protection of France he was taken with a fit of pride and determined to assert his independence That help which when he did not want it he had accepted with ignominious tears he now when it was indispensable to him threw contemptuously away Having been abject when he might with propriety have been punctilious in maintaining his dignity he became ungratefully haughty at a moment when haughtiness must bring on him at once derision and ruin He resented the friendly intervention which might have saved him Was ever King so used Was he a child or an idiot that others must think for him Was he a petty prince a Cardinal Furstemburg who must fall if not upheld by a powerful patron Was he to be degraded in the estimation of all Europe by an ostentatious patronage which he had never asked Skelton was recalled to answer for his conduct and as soon as he arrived was committed prisoner to the Tower Citters was well received at Whitehall and had a long audience He could with more truth than diplomatists on such occasions think at all necessary disclaim on the part of the States General any hostile project For the States General had as yet no official knowledge of the design of William nor was it by any means impossible that they might even now refuse to sanction that design James declared that he gave not the least credit to the rumours of a Dutch invasion and that the conduct of the French government had surprised and annoyed him Middleton was directed to assure all the foreign ministers that there existed no such alliance between France and England as the Court of Versailles had for its own ends pretended To the Nuncio the King said that the designs of Lewis were palpable and should be frustrated This officious protection was at once an insult and a snare My good brother said James has excellent qualities but flattery and vanity have turned his head four hundred seventy one Adda who was much more anxious about Cologne than about England encouraged this strange delusion Albeville who had now returned to his post was commanded to give friendly assurances to the States General and to add some high language which might have been becoming in the mouth of Elizabeth or Oliver My master he said is raised alike by his power and by his spirit above the position which France affects to assign to him There is some difference between a King of England and an Archbishop of Cologne The reception of Bonrepaux at Whitehall was cold The naval succours which he offered were not absolutely declined but he was forced to return without having settled anything and the Envoys both of the United Provinces and of the House of Austria were informed that his mission had been disagreeable to the King and had produced no result After the Revolution Sunderland boasted and probably with truth that he had induced his master to reject the proffered assistance of France four hundred seventy two The perverse folly of James naturally excited the indignation of his powerful neighbour Lewis complained that in return for the greatest service which he could render to the English government that government had given him the lie in the face of all Christendom He justly remarked that what Avaux had said touching the alliance between France and Great Britain was true according to the spirit though perhaps not according to the letter There was not indeed a treaty digested into articles signed sealed and ratified but assurances equivalent in the estimation of honourable men to such a treaty had during some years been constantly exchanged between the two Courts Lewis added that high as was his own place in Europe he should never be so absurdly jealous of his dignity as to see an insult in any act prompted by friendship But James was in a very different situation and would soon learn the value of that aid which he had so ungraciously rejected four hundred seventy three Yet notwithstanding the stupidity and ingratitude of James it would have been wise in Lewis to persist in the resolution which had been notified to the States General Avaux whose sagacity and judgment made him an antagonist worthy of William was decidedly of this opinion The first object of the French government so the skilful Envoy reasoned ought to be to prevent the intended descent on England The way to prevent that descent was to invade the Spanish Netherlands and to menace the Batavian frontier The Prince of Orange indeed was so bent on his darling enterprise that he would persist even if the white flag were flying on the walls of Brussels He had actually said that if the Spaniards could only manage to keep Ostend Mons and Namur till the next spring he would then return from England with a force which would soon recover all that had been lost But though such was the Prince s opinion it was not the opinion of the States They would not readily consent to send their Captain General and the flower of their army across the German Ocean while a formidable enemy threatened their own territory four hundred seventy four Lewis admitted the force of these reasonings but he had already resolved on a different line of action Perhaps he had been provoked by the discourtesy and wrongheadedness of the English government and indulged his temper at the expense of his interest Perhaps he was misled by the counsels of his minister of war Louvois whose influence was great and who regarded Avaux with no friendly feeling It was determined to strike in a quarter remote from Holland a great and unexpected blow Lewis suddenly withdrew his troops from Flanders and poured them into Germany One army placed under the nominal command of the Dauphin but really directed by the Duke of Duras and by Vauban the father of the science of fortification invested Philipsburg Another led by the Marquess of Boufflers seized Worms Mentz and Treves A third commanded by the Marquess of Humieres entered Bonn All down the Rhine from Carlsruhe to Cologne the French arms were victorious The news of the fall of Philipsburg reached Versailles on All Saints day while the Court was listening to a sermon in the chapel The King made a sign to the preacher to stop announced the good news to the congregation and kneeling down returned thanks to God for this great success The audience wept for joy four hundred seventy five The tidings were eagerly welcomed by the sanguine and susceptible people of France Poets celebrated the triumphs of their magnificent patron Orators extolled from the pulpit the wisdom and magnanimity of the eldest son of the Church The Te Deum was sung with unwonted pomp and the solemn notes of the organ were mingled with the clash of the cymbal and the blast of the trumpet But there was little cause for rejoicing The great statesman who was at the head of the European coalition smiled inwardly at the misdirected energy of his foe Lewis had indeed by his promptitude gained some advantages on the side of Germany but those advantages would avail little if England inactive and inglorious under four successive Kings should suddenly resume her old rank in Europe A few weeks would suffice for the enterprise on which the fate of the world depended and for a few weeks the United Provinces were in security William now urged on his preparations with indefatigable activity and with less secrecy than he had hitherto thought necessary Assurances of support came pouring in daily from foreign courts Opposition had become extinct at the Hague It was in vain that Avaux even at this last moment exerted all his skill to reanimate the faction which had contended against three generations of the House of Orange The chiefs of that faction indeed still regarded the Stadtholder with no friendly feeling They had reason to fear that if he prospered in England he would become absolute master of Holland Nevertheless the errors of the court of Versailles and the dexterity with which he had availed himself of those errors made it impossible to continue the struggle against him He saw that the time had come for demanding the sanction of the States Amsterdam was the head quarters of the party hostile to his line his office and his person and even from Amsterdam he had at this moment nothing to apprehend Some of the chief functionaries of that city had been repeatedly closeted with him with Dykvelt and with Bentinck and had been induced to promise that they would promote or at least that they would not oppose the great design some were exasperated by the commercial edicts of Lewis some were in deep distress for kinsmen and friends who were harassed by the French dragoons some shrank from the responsibility of causing a schism which might be fatal to the Batavian federation and some were afraid of the common people who stimulated by the exhortations of zealous preachers were ready to execute summary justice on any traitor to the Protestant cause The majority therefore of that town council which had long been devoted to France pronounced in favour of William s undertaking Thenceforth all fear of opposition in any part of the United Provinces was at an end and the full sanction of the federation to his enterprise was in secret sittings formally given four hundred seventy six The Prince had already fixed upon a general well qualified to be second in command This was indeed no light matter A random shot or the dagger of an assassin might in a moment leave the expedition without a head It was necessary that a successor should be ready to fill the vacant place Yet it was impossible to make choice of any Englishman without giving offence either to the Whigs or to the Tories nor had any Englishman then living shown that he possessed the military skill necessary for the conduct of a campaign On the other band it was not easy to assign preeminence to a foreigner without wounding the national sensibility of the haughty islanders One man there was and only one in Europe to whom no objection could be found Frederic Count of Schomberg a German sprung from a noble house of the Palatinate He was generally esteemed the greatest living master of the art of war His rectitude and piety tried by strong temptations and never found wanting commanded general respect and confidence Though a Protestant he had been during many years in the service of Lewis and had in spite of the ill offices of the Jesuits extorted from his employer by a series of great actions the staff of a Marshal of France When persecution began to rage the brave veteran steadfastly refused to purchase the royal favour by apostasy resigned without one murmur all his honours and commands quitted his adopted country for ever and took refuge at the court of Berlin He had passed his seventieth year but both his mind and his body were still in full vigour He had been in England and was much loved and honoured there He had indeed a recommendation of which very few foreigners could then boast for he spoke our language not only intelligibly but with grace and purity He was with the consent of the Elector of Brandenburg and with the warm approbation of the chiefs of all English parties appointed William s lieutenant four hundred seventy seven And now the Hague was crowded with British adventurers of all the various parties which the tyranny of James had united in a strange coalition old royalists who had shed their blood for the throne old agitators of the army of the Parliament Tories who had been persecuted in the days of the Exclusion Bill Whigs who had fled to the Continent for their share in the Rye House Plot Conspicuous in this great assemblage were Charles Gerard Earl of Macclesfield an ancient Cavalier who had fought for Charles the First and had shared the exile of Charles the Second Archibald Campbell who was the eldest son of the unfortunate Argyle but had inherited nothing except an illustrious name and the inalienable affection of a numerous clan Charles Paulet Earl of Wiltshire heir apparent of the Marquisate of Winchester and Peregrine Osborne Lord Dumblame heir apparent of the Earldom of Danby Mordaunt exulting in the prospect of adventures irresistibly attractive to his fiery nature was among the foremost volunteers Fletcher of Saltoun had learned while guarding the frontier of Christendom against the infidels that there was once more a hope of deliverance for his country and had hastened to offer the help of his sword Sir Patrick Hume who had since his flight from Scotland lived humbly at Utrecht now emerged from his obscurity but fortunately his eloquence could on this occasion do little mischief for the Prince of Orange was by no means disposed to be the lieutenant of a debating society such as that which had ruined the enterprise of Argyle The subtle and restless Wildman who had some time before found England an unsafe residence and had retired to Germany now repaired from Germany to the Prince s court There too was Carstairs a presbyterian minister from Scotland who in craft and courage had no superior among the politicians of his age He had been entrusted some years before by Fagel with important secrets and had resolutely kept them in spite of the most horrible torments which could be inflicted by boot and thumbscrew His rare fortitude had earned for him as large a share of the Prince s confidence and esteem as was granted to any man except Bentinck four hundred seventy eight Ferguson could not remain quiet when a revolution was preparing He secured for himself a passage in the fleet and made himself busy among his fellow emigrants but he found himself generally distrusted and despised He had been a great man in the knot of ignorant and hotheaded outlaws who had urged the feeble Monmouth to destruction but there was no place for a lowminded agitator half maniac and half knave among the grave statesmen and generals who partook the cares of the resolute and sagacious William The difference between the expedition of sixteen eighty five and the expedition of sixteen eighty eight was sufficiently marked by the difference between the manifestoes which the leaders of those expeditions published For Monmouth Ferguson had scribbled an absurd and brutal libel about the burning of London the strangling of Godfrey the butchering of Essex and the poisoning of Charles The Declaration of William was drawn up by the Grand Pensionary Fagel who was highly renowned as a publicist Though weighty and learned it was in its original form much too prolix but it was abridged and translated into English by Burnet who well understood the art of popular composition It began by a solemn preamble setting forth that in every community the strict observance of law was necessary alike to the happiness of nations and to the security of governments The Prince of Orange had therefore seen with deep concern that the fundamental laws of a kingdom with which he was by blood and by marriage closely connected had by the advice of evil counsellors been grossly and systematically violated The power of dispensing with Acts of Parliament had been strained to such a point that the whole legislative authority had been transferred to the crown Decisions at variance with the spirit of the constitution had been obtained from the tribunals by turning out Judge after Judge till the bench had been filled with men ready to obey implicitly the directions of the government Notwithstanding the King s repeated assurances that he would maintain the established religion persons notoriously hostile to that religion had been promoted not only to civil offices but also to ecclesiastical benefices The government of the Church had in defiance of express statutes been entrusted to a new court of High Commission and in that court one avowed Papist had a seat Good subjects for refusing to violate their duty and their oaths had been ejected from their property in contempt of the Great Charter of the liberties of England Meanwhile persons who could not legally set foot on the island had been placed at the head of seminaries for the corruption of youth Lieutenants Deputy Lieutenants Justices of the Peace had been dismissed in multitudes for refusing to support a pernicious and unconstitutional policy The franchises of almost every borough in the realm bad been invaded The courts of justice were in such a state that their decisions even in civil matters had ceased to inspire confidence and that their servility in criminal cases had brought on the kingdom the stain of innocent blood All these abuses loathed by the English nation were to be defended it seemed by an army of Irish Papists Nor was this all The most arbitrary princes had never accounted it an offence in a subject modestly and peaceably to represent his grievances and to ask for relief But supplication was now treated as a high misdemeanour in England For no crime but that of offering to the Sovereign a petition drawn up in the most respectful terms the fathers of the Church had been imprisoned and prosecuted and every Judge who gave his voice in their favour had instantly been turned out The calling of a free and lawful Parliament might indeed be an effectual remedy for all these evils but such a Parliament unless the whole spirit of the administration were changed the nation could not hope to see It was evidently the intention of the court to bring together by means of regulated corporations and of Popish returning officers a body which would be a House of Commons in name alone Lastly there were circumstances which raised a grave suspicion that the child who was called Prince of Wales was not really born of the Queen For these reasons the Prince mindful of his near relation to the royal house and grateful for the affection which the English people had ever shown to his beloved wife and to himself had resolved in compliance with the request of many Lords Spiritual and Temporal and of many other persons of all ranks to go over at the head of a force sufficient to repel violence He abjured all thought of conquest He protested that while his troops remained in the island they should be kept under the strictest restraints of discipline and that as soon as the nation had been delivered from tyranny they should be sent back His single object was to have a free and legal Parliament assembled and to the decision of such a Parliament he solemnly pledged himself to leave all questions both public and private As soon as copies of this Declaration were banded about the Hague signs of dissension began to appear among the English Wildman indefatigable in mischief prevailed on some of his countrymen and among others on the headstrong and volatile Mordaunt to declare that they would not take up arms on such grounds The paper had been drawn up merely to please the Cavaliers and the parsons The injuries of the Church and the trial of the Bishops had been put too prominently forward and nothing had been said of the tyrannical manner in which the Tories before their rupture with the court had treated the Whigs Wildman then brought forward a counterproject prepared by himself which if it had been adopted would have disgusted all the Anglican clergy and four fifths of the landed aristocracy The leading Whigs strongly opposed him Russell in particular declared that if such an insane course were taken there would be an end of the coalition from which alone the nation could expect deliverance The dispute was at length settled by the authority of William who with his usual good sense determined that the manifesto should stand nearly as Fagel and Burnet had framed it four hundred seventy nine While these things were passing in Holland James had at length become sensible of his danger Intelligence which could not be disregarded came pouring in from various quarters At length a despatch from Albeville removed all doubts It is said that when the King had read it the blood left his cheeks and he remained some time speechless four hundred eighty He might indeed well be appalled The first easterly wind would bring a hostile armament to the shores of his realm All Europe one single power alone excepted was impatiently waiting for the news of his downfall The help of that single power he had madly rejected Nay he had requited with insult the friendly intervention which might have saved him The French armies which but for his own folly might have been employed in overawing the States General were besieging Philipsburg or garrisoning Mentz In a few days he might have to fight on English ground for his crown and for the birthright of his infant son His means were indeed in appearance great The navy was in a much more efficient state than at the time of his accession and the improvement is partly to be attributed to his own exertions He had appointed no Lord High Admiral or Board of Admiralty but had kept the chief direction of maritime affairs in his own hands and had been strenuously assisted by Pepys It is a proverb that the eye of a master is more to be trusted than that of a deputy and in an age of corruption and peculation a department on which a sovereign even of very slender capacity bestows close personal attention is likely to be comparatively free from abuses It would have been easy to find an abler minister of marine than James but it would not have been easy to find among the public men of that age any minister of marine except James who would not have embezzled stores taken bribes from contractors and charged the crown with the cost of repairs which had never been made The King was in truth almost the only person who could be trusted not to rob the King There had therefore been during the last three years much less waste and pilfering in the dockyards than formerly Ships had been built which were fit to go to sea An excellent order had been issued increasing the allowances of Captains and at the same time strictly forbidding them to carry merchandise from port to port without the royal permission The effect of these reforms was already perceptible and James found no difficulty in fitting out at short notice a considerable fleet Thirty ships of the line all third rates and fourth rates were collected in the Thames under the command of Lord Dartmouth The loyalty of Dartmouth was above suspicion and he was thought to have as much professional skill and knowledge as any of the patrician sailors who in that age rose to the highest naval commands without a regular naval training and who were at once flag officers on the sea and colonels of infantry on shore four hundred eighty one The regular army was the largest that any King of England had ever commanded and was rapidly augmented New companies were incorporated with the existing regiments Commissions for the raising of fresh regiments were issued Four thousand men were added to the English establishment Three thousand were sent for with all speed from Ireland As many more were ordered to march southward from Scotland James estimated the force with which he should be able to meet the invaders at near forty thousand troops exclusive of the militia four hundred eighty two The navy and army were therefore far more than sufficient to repel a Dutch invasion But could the navy could the army be trusted Would not the trainbands flock by thousands to the standard of the deliverer The party which had a few years before drawn the sword for Monmouth would undoubtedly be eager to welcome the Prince of Orange And what had become of the party which had during seven and forty years been the bulwark of monarchy Where were now those gallant gentlemen who had ever been ready to shed their blood for the crown Outraged and insulted driven from the bench of justice and deprived of all military command they saw the peril of their ungrateful Sovereign with undisguised delight Where were those priests and prelates who had from ten thousand pulpits proclaimed the duty of obeying the anointed delegate of God Some of them had been imprisoned some had been plundered all had been placed under the iron rule of the High Commission and had been in hourly fear lest some new freak of tyranny should deprive them of their freeholds and leave them without a morsel of bread That Churchmen would even now so completely forget the doctrine which had been their peculiar boast as to join in active resistance seemed incredible But could their oppressor expect to find among them the spirit which in the preceding generation had triumphed over the armies of Essex and Waller and had yielded only after a desperate struggle to the genius and vigour of Cromwell The tyrant was overcome by fear He ceased to repeat that concession had always ruined princes and sullenly owned that he must stoop to court the Tories once more four hundred eighty three There is reason to believe that Halifax was at this time invited to return to office and that he was not unwilling to do so The part of mediator between the throne and the nation was of all parts that for which he was best qualified and of which he was most ambitious How the negotiation with him was broken off is not known but it is not improbable that the question of the dispensing power was the insurmountable difficulty His hostility to that power had caused his disgrace three years before and nothing that had since happened had been of a nature to change his views James on the other hand was fully determined to make no concession on that point four hundred eighty four As to other matters he was less pertinacious He put forth a proclamation in which he solemnly promised to protect the Church of England and to maintain the Act of Uniformity He declared himself willing to make great sacrifices for the sake of concord He would no longer insist that Roman Catholics should be admitted into the House of Commons and he trusted that his people would justly appreciate such a proof of his disposition to meet their wishes Three days later he notified his intention to replace all the magistrates and Deputy Lieutenants who had been dismissed for refusing to support his policy On the day after the appearance of this notification Compton s suspension was taken off four hundred eighty five At the same time the King gave an audience to all the Bishops who were then in London They had requested admittance to his presence for the purpose of tendering their counsel in this emergency The Primate was spokesman He respectfully asked that the administration might be put into the hands of persons duly qualified that all acts done under pretence of the dispensing power might be revoked that the Ecclesiastical Commission might be annulled that the wrongs of Magdalene College might be redressed and that the old franchises of the municipal corporations might be restored He hinted very intelligibly that there was one most desirable event which would completely secure the throne and quiet the distracted realm If His Majesty would reconsider the points in dispute between the Churches of Rome and England perhaps by the divine blessing on the arguments which the Bishops wished to lay before him he might be convinced that it was his duty to return to the religion of his father and of his grandfather Thus far Sancroft said he had spoken the sense of his brethren There remained a subject on which he had not taken counsel with them but to which he thought it his duty to advert He was indeed the only man of his profession who could advert to that subject without being suspected of an interested motive The metropolitan see of York had been three years vacant The Archbishop implored the King to fill it speedily with a pious and learned divine and added that such a divine might without difficulty be found among those who then stood in the royal presence The King commanded himself sufficiently to return thanks for this unpalatable counsel and promised to consider what bad been said four hundred eighty six Of the dispensing power he would not yield one tittle No unqualified person was removed from any civil or military office But some of Sancroft s suggestions were adopted Within forty eight hours the Court of High Commission was abolished four hundred eighty seven It was determined that the charter of the City of London which had been forfeited six years before should be restored and the Chancellor was sent in state to carry back the venerable parchment to Guildhall four hundred eighty eight A week later the public was informed that the Bishop of Winchester who was by virtue of his office Visitor of Magdalene College had it in charge from the King to correct whatever was amiss in that society It was not without a long struggle and a bitter pang that James stooped to this last humiliation Indeed he did not yield till the Vicar Apostolic Leyburn who seems to have behaved on all occasions like a wise and honest man declared that in his judgment the ejected President and Fellows had been wronged and that on religious as well as on political grounds restitution ought to be made to them four hundred eighty nine In a few days appeared a proclamation restoring the forfeited franchises of all the municipal corporations four hundred ninety James flattered himself that concessions so great made in the short space of a month would bring back to him the hearts of his people Nor can it be doubted that such concessions made before there was reason to expect an invasion from Holland would have done much to conciliate the Tories But gratitude is not to be expected by rulers who give to fear what they have refused to justice During three years the King had been proof to all argument and to all entreaty Every minister who had dared to raise his voice in favour of the civil and ecclesiastical constitution of the realm had been disgraced A Parliament eminently loyal had ventured to protest gently and respectfully against a violation of the fundamental laws of England and had been sternly reprimanded prorogued and dissolved Judge after Judge had been stripped of the ermine for declining to give decisions opposed to the whole common and statute law The most respectable Cavaliers had been excluded from all share in the government of their counties for refusing to betray the public liberties Scores of clergymen had been deprived of their livelihood for observing their oaths Prelates to whose steadfast fidelity the King owed the crown which he wore had on their knees besought him not to command them to violate the laws of God and of the land Their modest petition had been treated as a seditious libel They had been browbeaten threatened imprisoned prosecuted and had narrowly escaped utter ruin Then at length the nation finding that right was borne down by might and that even supplication was regarded as a crime began to think of trying the chances of war The oppressor learned that an armed deliverer was at hand and would be eagerly welcomed by Whigs and Tories Dissenters and Churchmen All was immediately changed That government which had requited constant and zealous service with spoliation and persecution that government which to weighty reasons and pathetic intreaties had replied only by injuries and insults became in a moment strangely gracious Every Gazette now announced the removal of some grievance It was then evident that on the equity the humanity the plighted word of the King no reliance could be placed and that he would govern well only so long as he was under the strong dread of resistance His subjects were therefore by no means disposed to restore to him a confidence which he had justly forfeited or to relax the pressure which had wrung from him the only good acts of his whole reign The general impatience for the arrival of the Dutch became every day stronger The gales which at this time blew obstinately from the west and which at once prevented the Prince s armament from sailing and brought fresh Irish regiments from Dublin to Chester were bitterly cursed and reviled by the common people The weather it was said was Popish Crowds stood in Cheapside gazing intently at the weathercock on the graceful steeple of Bow Church and praying for a Protestant wind four hundred ninety one The general feeling was strengthened by an event which though merely accidental was not unnaturally ascribed to the perfidy of the King The Bishop of Winchester announced that in obedience to the royal commands he designed to restore the ejected members of Magdalene College He fixed the twenty first of October for this ceremony and on the twentieth went down to Oxford The whole University was in expectation The expelled Fellows had arrived from all parts of the kingdom eager to take possession of their beloved home Three hundred gentlemen on horseback escorted the Visitor to his lodgings As he passed the bells rang and the High Street was crowded with shouting spectators He retired to rest The next morning a joyous crowd assembled at the gates of Magdalene but the Bishop did not make his appearance and soon it was known that he had been roused from his bed by a royal messenger and had been directed to repair immediately to Whitehall This strange disappointment caused much wonder and anxiety but in a few hours came news which to minds disposed not without reason to think the worst seemed completely to explain the King s change of purpose The Dutch armament had put out to sea and had been driven back by a storm The disaster was exaggerated by rumour Many ships it was said had been lost Thousands of horses had perished All thought of a design on England must be relinquished at least for the present year Here was a lesson for the nation While James expected immediate invasion and rebellion he had given orders that reparation should be made to those whom he had unlawfully despoiled As soon as he found himself safe those orders had been revoked This imputation though at that time generally believed and though since that time repeated by writers who ought to have been well informed was without foundation It is certain that the mishap of the Dutch fleet could not by any mode of communication have been known at Westminster till some hours after the Bishop of Winchester had received the summons which called him away from Oxford The King however had little right to complain of the suspicions of his people If they sometimes without severely examining evidence ascribed to his dishonest policy what was really the effect of accident or inadvertence the fault was his own That men who are in the habit of breaking faith should be distrusted when they mean to keep it is part of their just and natural punishment four hundred ninety two It is remarkable that James on this occasion incurred one unmerited imputation solely in consequence of his eagerness to clear himself from another imputation equally unmerited The Bishop of Winchester had been hastily summoned from Oxford to attend an extraordinary meeting of the Privy Council or rather an assembly of Notables which had been convoked at Whitehall With the Privy Councillors were joined in this solemn sitting all the Peers Spiritual and Temporal who chanced to be in or near the capital the Judges the crown lawyers the Lord Mayor and the Aldermen of the City of London A hint had been given to Petre that he would do well to absent himself In truth few of the Peers would have chosen to sit with him Near the head of the board a chair of state was placed for the Queen Dowager The Princess Anne had been requested to attend but had excused herself on the plea of delicate health James informed this great assembly that he thought it necessary to produce proofs of the birth of his son The arts of bad men had poisoned the public mind to such an extent that very many believed the Prince of Wales to be a supposititious child But Providence had graciously ordered things so that scarcely any prince had ever come into the world in the presence of so many witnesses Those witnesses then appeared and gave their evidence After all the depositions had been taken James with great solemnity declared that the imputation thrown on him was utterly false and that he would rather die a thousand deaths than wrong any of his children All who were present appeared to be satisfied The evidence was instantly published and was allowed by judicious and impartial persons to be decisive four hundred ninety three But the judicious are always a minority and scarcely anybody was then impartial The whole nation was convinced that all sincere Papists thought it a duty to perjure themselves whenever they could by perjury serve the interests of their Church Men who having been bred Protestants had for the sake of lucre pretended to be converted to Popery were if possible less trustworthy than sincere Papists The depositions of all who belonged to these two classes were therefore regarded as mere nullities Thus the weight of the testimony on which James had relied was greatly reduced What remained was malignantly scrutinised To every one of the few Protestant witnesses who had said anything material some exception was taken One was notoriously a greedy sycophant Another had not indeed yet apostatized but was nearly related to an apostate The people asked as they had asked from the first why if all was right the King knowing as he knew that many doubted the reality of his wife s pregnancy had not taken care that the birth should be more satisfactorily proved Was there nothing suspicious in the false reckoning in the sudden change of abode in the absence of the Princess Anne and of the Archbishop of Canterbury Why was no prelate of the Established Church in attendance Why was not the Dutch Ambassador summoned Why above all were not the Hydes loyal servants of the crown faithful sons of the Church and natural guardians of the interest of their nieces suffered to mingle with the crowd of Papists which was assembled in and near the royal bedchamber Why in short was there in the long list of assistants not a single name which commanded public confidence and respect The true answer to these questions was that the King s understanding was weak that his temper was despotic and that he had willingly seized an opportunity of manifesting his contempt for the opinion of his subjects But the multitude not contented with this explanation attributed to deep laid villany what was really the effect of folly and perverseness Nor was this opinion confined to the multitude The Lady Anne at her toilette on the morning after the Council spoke of the investigation with such scorn as emboldened the very tirewomen who were dressing her to put in their jests Some of the Lords who had heard the examination and had appeared to be satisfied were really unconvinced Lloyd Bishop of saint Asaph whose piety and learning commanded general respect continued to the end of his life to believe that a fraud had been practised The depositions taken before the Council had not been many hours in the hands of the public when it was noised abroad that Sunderland had been dismissed from all his places The news of his disgrace seems to have taken the politicians of the coffeehouses by surprise but did not astonish those who had observed what was passing in the palace Treason had not been brought home to him by legal or even by tangible evidence but there was a strong suspicion among those who watched him closely that through some channel or other he was in communication with the enemies of that government in which he occupied so high a place He with unabashed forehead imprecated on his own head all evil here and hereafter if he was guilty His only fault he protested was that he had served the crown too well Had he not given hostages to the royal cause Had he not broken down every bridge by which he could in case of a disaster effect his retreat Had he not gone all lengths in favour of the dispensing power sate in the High Commission signed the warrant for the commitment of the Bishops appeared as a witness against them at the hazard of his life amidst the hisses and curses of the thousands who filled Westminster Hall Had he not given the last proof of fidelity by renouncing his religion and publicly joining a Church which the nation detested What had he to hope from a change What had he not to dread These arguments though plausible and though set off by the most insinuating address could not remove the impression which whispers and reports arriving at once from a hundred different quarters had produced The King became daily colder and colder Sunderland attempted to support himself by the Queen s help obtained an audience of Her Majesty and was actually in her apartment when Middleton entered and by the King s orders demanded the seals That evening the fallen minister was for the last time closeted with the Prince whom he had flattered and betrayed The interview was a strange one Sunderland acted calumniated virtue to perfection He regretted not he said the Secretaryship of State or the Presidency of the Council if only he retained his sovereign s esteem Do not sir do not make me the most unhappy gentleman in your dominions by refusing to declare that you acquit me of disloyalty The King hardly knew what to believe There was no positive proof of guilt and the energy and pathos with which Sunderland lied might have imposed on a keener understanding than that with which he had to deal At the French embassy his professions still found credit There he declared that he should remain a few days in London and show himself at court He would then retire to his country seat at Althorpe and try to repair his dilapidated fortunes by economy If a revolution should take place he must fly to France His ill requited loyalty had left him no other place of refuge four hundred ninety four The seals which had been taken from Sunderland were delivered to Preston The same Gazette which announced this change contained the official intelligence of the disaster which had befallen the Dutch fleet four hundred ninety five That disaster was serious though far less serious than the King and his few adherents misled by their wishes were disposed to believe On the sixteenth of October according to the English reckoning was held a solemn sitting of the States of Holland The Prince came to bid them farewell He thanked them for the kindness with which they had watched over him when he was left an orphan child for the confidence which they had reposed in him during his administration and for the assistance which they had granted to him at this momentous crisis He entreated them to believe that he had always meant and endeavoured to promote the interest of his country He was now quitting them perhaps never to return If he should fall in defence of the reformed religion and of the independence of Europe he commended his beloved wife to their care The Grand Pensionary answered in a faltering voice and in all that grave senate there was none who could refrain from shedding tears But the iron stoicism of William never gave way and he stood among his weeping friends calm and austere as if he had been about to leave them only for a short visit to his hunting grounds at Loo four hundred ninety six The deputies of the principal towns accompanied him to his yacht Even the representatives of Amsterdam so long the chief seat of opposition to his administration joined in paying him this compliment Public prayers were offered for him on that day in all the churches of the Hague In the evening he arrived at Helvoetsluys and went on board of a frigate called the Brill His flag was immediately hoisted It displayed the arms of Nassau quartered with those of England The motto embroidered in letters three feet long was happily chosen The House of Orange had long used the elliptical device I will maintain The ellipsis was now filled up with words of high import The liberties of England and the Protestant religion The Prince had not been many hours on board when the wind became fair On the nineteenth the armament put to sea and traversed before a strong breeze about half the distance between the Dutch and English coasts Then the wind changed blew hard from the west and swelled into a violent tempest The ships scattered and in great distress regained the shore of Holland as they best might The Brill reached Helvoetsluys on the twenty first The Prince s fellow passengers had observed with admiration that neither peril nor mortification had for one moment disturbed his composure He now though suffering from sea sickness refused to go on shore for he conceived that by remaining on board he should in the most effectual manner notify to Europe that the late misfortune had only delayed for a very short time the execution of his purpose In two or three days the fleet reassembled One vessel only had been cast away Not a single soldier or sailor was missing Some horses had perished but this loss the Prince with great expedition repaired and before the London Gazette had spread the news of his mishap he was again ready to sail four hundred ninety seven His Declaration preceded him only by a few hours On the first of November it began to be mentioned in mysterious whispers by the politicians of London was passed secretly from man to man and was slipped into the boxes of the post office One of the agents was arrested and the packets of which he was in charge were carried to Whitehall The King read and was greatly troubled His first impulse was to bide the paper from all human eyes He threw into the fire every copy which had been brought to him except one and that one he would scarcely trust out of his own hands four hundred ninety eight The paragraph in the manifesto which disturbed him most was that in which it was said that some of the Peers Spiritual and Temporal had invited the Prince of Orange to invade England Halifax Clarendon and Nottingham were then in London They were immediately summoned to the palace and interrogated Halifax though conscious of innocence refused at first to make any answer Your Majesty asks me said he whether I have committed high treason If I am suspected let me be brought before my peers And how can your Majesty place any dependence on the answer of a culprit whose life is at stake Even if I had invited His Highness over I should without scruple plead Not Guilty The King declared that he did not at all consider Halifax as a culprit and that he had asked the question as one gentleman asks another who has been calumniated whether there be the least foundation for the calumny In that case said Halifax I have no objection to aver as a gentleman speaking to a gentleman on my honour which is as sacred as my oath that I have not invited the Prince of Orange over four hundred ninety nine Clarendon and Nottingham said the same The King was still more anxious to ascertain the temper of the Prelates If they were hostile to him his throne was indeed in danger But it could not be There was something monstrous in the supposition that any Bishop of the Church of England could rebel against his Sovereign Compton was called into the royal closet and was asked whether he believed that there was the slightest ground for the Prince s assertion The Bishop was in a strait for he was himself one of the seven who had signed the invitation and his conscience not a very enlightened conscience would not suffer him it seems to utter a direct falsehood Sir he said I am quite confident that there is not one of my brethren who is not as guiltless as myself in this matter The equivocation was ingenious but whether the difference between the sin of such an equivocation and the sin of a lie be worth any expense of ingenuity may perhaps be doubted The King was satisfied I fully acquit you all he said But I think it necessary that you should publicly contradict the slanderous charge brought against you in the Prince s declaration The Bishop very naturally begged that he might be allowed to read the paper which he was required to contradict but the King would not suffer him to look at it On the following day appeared a proclamation threatening with the severest punishment all who should circulate or who should even dare to read William s manifesto five hundred The Primate and the few Spiritual Peers who happened to be then in London had orders to wait upon the King Preston was in attendance with the Prince s Declaration in his hand My Lords said James listen to this passage It concerns you Preston then read the sentence in which the Spiritual Peers were mentioned The King proceeded I do not believe one word of this I am satisfied of your innocence but I think it fit to let you know of what you are accused The Primate with many dutiful expressions protested that the King did him no more than justice I was born in your Majesty s allegiance I have repeatedly confirmed that allegiance by my oath I can have but one King at one time I have not invited the Prince over and I do not believe that a single one of my brethren has done so I am sure I have not said Crewe of Durham Nor I said Cartwright of Chester Crewe and Cartwright might well be believed for both had sate in the Ecclesiastical Commission When Compton s turn came he parried the question with an adroitness which a Jesuit might have envied I gave your Majesty my answer yesterday James repeated again and again that he fully acquitted them all Nevertheless it would in his judgment be for his service and for their own honour that they should publicly vindicate themselves He therefore required them to draw up a paper setting forth their abhorrence of the Prince s design They remained silent their silence was supposed to imply consent and they were suffered to withdraw five hundred one Meanwhile the fleet of William was on the German Ocean It was on the evening of Thursday the first of November that he put to sea the second time The wind blew fresh from the east The armament during twelve hours held a course towards the north west The light vessels sent out by the English Admiral for the purpose of obtaining intelligence brought back news which confirmed the prevailing opinion that the enemy would try to land in Yorkshire All at once on a signal from the Prince s ship the whole fleet tacked and made sail for the British Channel The same breeze which favoured the voyage of the invaders prevented Dartmouth from coming out of the Thames His ships were forced to strike yards and topmasts and two of his frigates which had gained the open sea were shattered by the violence of the weather and driven back into the river five hundred two The Dutch fleet ran fast before the gale and reached the Straits at about ten in the morning of Saturday the third of November William himself in the Brill led the way More than six hundred vessels with canvass spread to a favourable wind followed in his train The transports were in the centre The men of war more than fifty in number formed an outer rampart Herbert with the title of Lieutenant Admiral General commanded the whole fleet His post was in the rear and many English sailors inflamed against Popery and attracted by high pay served under him It was not without great difficulty that the Prince had prevailed on some Dutch officers of high reputation to submit to the authority of a stranger But the arrangement was eminently judicious There was in the King s fleet much discontent and an ardent zeal for the Protestant faith But within the memory of old mariners the Dutch and English navies had thrice with heroic spirit and various fortune contended for the empire of the sea Our sailors had not forgotten the broom with which Tromp had threatened to sweep the Channel or the fire which De Ruyter had lighted in the dockyards of the Medway Had the rival nations been once more brought face to face on the element of which both claimed the sovereignty all other thoughts might have given place to mutual animosity A bloody and obstinate battle might have been fought Defeat would have been fatal to William s enterprise Even victory would have deranged all his deeply meditated schemes of policy He therefore wisely determined that the pursuers if they overtook him should be hailed in their own mother tongue and adjured by an admiral under whom they had served and whom they esteemed not to fight against old mess mates for Popish tyranny Such an appeal might possibly avert a conflict If a conflict took place one English commander would be opposed to another nor would the pride of the islanders be wounded by learning that Dartmouth had been compelled to strike to Herbert five hundred three Happily William s precautions were not necessary Soon after midday he passed the Straits His fleet spread to within a league of Dover on the north and of Calais on the south The men of war on the extreme right and left saluted both fortresses at once The troops appeared under arms on the decks The flourish of trumpets the clash of cymbals and the rolling of drums were distinctly heard at once on the English and French shores An innumerable company of gazers blackened the white beach of Kent Another mighty multitude covered the coast of Picardy Rapin de Thoyras who driven by persecution from his country had taken service in the Dutch army and accompanied the Prince to England described the spectacle many years later as the most magnificent and affecting that was ever seen by human eyes At sunset the armament was off Beachy Head Then the lights were kindled The sea was in a blaze for many miles But the eyes of all the steersmen were fixed throughout the night on three huge lanterns which flamed on the stern of the Brill five hundred four Meanwhile a courier bad been riding post from Dover Castle to Whitehall with news that the Dutch had passed the Straits and were steering westward It was necessary to make an immediate change in all the military arrangements Messengers were despatched in every direction Officers were roused from their beds at dead of night At three on the Sunday morning there was a great muster by torchlight in Hyde Park The King had sent several regiments northward in the expectation that William would land in Yorkshire Expresses were despatched to recall them All the forces except those which were necessary to keep the peace of the capital were ordered to move to the west Salisbury was appointed as the place of rendezvous but as it was thought possible that Portsmouth might be the first point of attack three battalions of guards and a strong body of cavalry set out for that fortress In a few hours it was known that Portsmouth was safe and these troops received orders to change their route and to hasten to Salisbury five hundred five When Sunday the fourth of November dawned the cliffs of the Isle of Wight were full in view of the Dutch armament That day was the anniversary both of William s birth and of his marriage Sail was slackened during part of the morning and divine service was performed on board of the ships In the afternoon and through the night the fleet held on its course Torbay was the place where the Prince intended to land But the morning of Monday the fifth of November was hazy The pilot of the Brill could not discern the sea marks and carried the fleet too far to the west The danger was great To return in the face of the wind was impossible Plymouth was the next port But at Plymouth a garrison had been posted under the command of Lord Bath The landing might be opposed and a check might produce serious consequences There could be little doubt moreover that by this time the royal fleet had got out of the Thames and was hastening full sail down the Channel Russell saw the whole extent of the peril and exclaimed to Burnet You may go to prayers Doctor All is over At that moment the wind changed a soft breeze sprang up from the south the mist dispersed the sun shone forth and under the mild light of an autumnal noon the fleet turned back passed round the lofty cape of Berry Head and rode safe in the harbour of Torbay five hundred six Since William looked on that harbour its aspect has greatly changed The amphitheatre which surrounds the spacious basin now exhibits everywhere the signs of prosperity and civilisation At the northeastern extremity has sprung up a great watering place to which strangers are attracted from the most remote parts of our island by the Italian softness of the air for in that climate the myrtle flourishes unsheltered and even the winter is milder than the Northumbrian April The inhabitants are about ten thousand in number The newly built churches and chapels the baths and libraries the hotels and public gardens the infirmary and the museum the white streets rising terrace above terrace the gay villas peeping from the midst of shrubberies and flower beds present a spectacle widely different from any that in the seventeenth century England could show At the opposite end of the bay lies sheltered by Berry head the stirring market town of Brixham the wealthiest seat of our fishing trade A pier and a haven were formed there at the beginning of the present century but have been found insufficient for the increasing traffic The population is about six thousand souls The shipping amounts to more than two hundred sail The tonnage exceeds many times the tonnage of the port of Liverpool under the Kings of the House of Stuart But Torbay when the Dutch fleet cast anchor there was known only as a haven where ships sometimes took refuge from the tempests of the Atlantic Its quiet shores were undisturbed by the bustle either of commerce or of pleasure and the huts of ploughmen and fishermen were thinly scattered over what is now the site of crowded marts and of luxurious pavilions The peasantry of the coast of Devonshire remembered the name of Monmouth with affection and held Popery in detestation They therefore crowded down to the seaside with provisions and offers of service The disembarkation instantly commenced Sixty boats conveyed the troops to the coast Mackay was sent on shore first with the British regiments The Prince soon followed He landed where the quay of Brixham now stands The whole aspect of the place has been altered Where we now see a port crowded with shipping and a market place swarming with buyers and sellers the waves then broke on a desolate beach but a fragment of the rock on which the deliverer stepped from his boat has been carefully preserved and is set up as an object of public veneration in the centre of that busy wharf As soon as the Prince had planted his foot on dry ground he called for horses Two beasts such as the small yeomen of that time were in the habit of riding were procured from the neighbouring village William and Schomberg mounted and proceeded to examine the country As soon as Burnet was on shore he hastened to the Prince An amusing dialogue took place between them Burnet poured forth his congratulations with genuine delight and then eagerly asked what were His Highness s plans Military men are seldom disposed to take counsel with gownsmen on military matters and William regarded the interference of unprofessional advisers in questions relating to war with even more than the disgust ordinarily felt by soldiers on such occasions But he was at that moment in an excellent humour and instead of signifying his displeasure by a short and cutting reprimand graciously extended his hand and answered his chaplain s question by another question Well Doctor what do you think of predestination now The reproof was so delicate that Burnet whose perceptions were not very fine did not perceive it He answered with great fervour that he should never forget the signal manner in which Providence had favoured their undertaking five hundred seven During the first day the troops who had gone on shore had many discomforts to endure The earth was soaked with rain The baggage was still on board of the ships Officers of high rank were compelled to sleep in wet clothes on the wet ground the Prince himself had no better quarters than a hut afforded His banner was displayed on the thatched roof and some bedding brought from his ship was spread for him on the floor five hundred eight There was some difficulty about landing the horses and it seemed probable that this operation would occupy several days But on the following morning the prospect cleared The wind was gentle The water in the bay was as even as glass Some fishermen pointed out a place where the ships could be brought within sixty feet of the beach This was done and in three hours many hundreds of horses swam safely to shore The disembarkation had hardly been effected when the wind rose again and swelled into a fierce gale from the west The enemy coming in pursuit down the Channel had been stopped by the same change of weather which enabled William to land During two days the King s fleet lay on an unruffled sea in sight of Beachy Head At length Dartmouth was able to proceed He passed the Isle of Wight and one of his ships came in sight of the Dutch topmasts in Torbay Just at this moment he was encountered by the tempest and compelled to take shelter in the harbour of Portsmouth five hundred nine At that time James who was not incompetent to form a judgment on a question of seamanship declared himself perfectly satisfied that his Admiral had done all that man could do and had yielded only to the irresistible hostility of the winds and waves At a later period the unfortunate prince began with little reason to suspect Dartmouth of treachery or at least of slackness five hundred ten The weather had indeed served the Protestant cause so well that some men of more piety than judgment fully believed the ordinary laws of nature to have been suspended for the preservation of the liberty and religion of England Exactly a hundred years before they said the Armada invincible by man had been scattered by the wrath of God Civil freedom and divine truth were again in jeopardy and again the obedient elements had fought for the good cause The wind had blown strong from the east while the Prince wished to sail down the Channel had turned to the south when he wished to enter Torbay had sunk to a calm during the disembarkation and as soon as the disembarkation was completed had risen to a storm and had met the pursuers in the face Nor did men omit to remark that by an extraordinary coincidence the Prince had reached our shores on a day on which the Church of England commemorated by prayer and thanksgiving the wonderful escape of the royal House and of the three Estates from the blackest plot ever devised by Papists Carstairs whose suggestions were sure to meet with attention from the Prince recommended that as soon as the landing had been effected public thanks should be offered to God for the protection so conspicuously accorded to the great enterprise This advice was taken and with excellent effect The troops taught to regard themselves as favourites of heaven were inspired with new courage and the English people formed the most favourable opinion of a general and an army so attentive to the duties of religion On Tuesday the sixth of November William s army began to march up the country Some regiments advanced as far as Newton Abbot A stone set up in the midst of that little town still marks the spot where the Prince s Declaration was solemnly read to the people The movements of the troops were slow for the rain fell in torrents and the roads of England were then in a state which seemed frightful to persons accustomed to the excellent communications of Holland William took up his quarters during two days at Ford a seat of the ancient and illustrious family of Courtenay in the neighbourhood of Newton Abbot He was magnificently lodged and feasted there but it is remarkable that the owner of the house though a strong Whig did not choose to be the first to put life and fortune in peril and cautiously abstained from doing anything which if the King should prevail could be treated as a crime Exeter in the meantime was greatly agitated Lamplugh the bishop as soon as he heard that the Dutch were at Torbay set off in terror for London The Dean fled from the deanery The magistrates were for the King the body of the inhabitants for the Prince Every thing was in confusion when on the morning of Thursday the eighth of November a body of troops under the command of Mordaunt appeared before the city With Mordaunt came Burnet to whom William had entrusted the duty of protecting the clergy of the Cathedral from injury and insult five hundred eleven The Mayor and Aldermen had ordered the gates to be closed but yielded on the first summons The deanery was prepared for the reception of the Prince On the following day Friday the ninth he arrived The magistrates had been pressed to receive him in state at the entrance of the city but had steadfastly refused The pomp of that day however could well spare them Such a sight had never been seen in Devonshire Many went forth half a day s journey to meet the champion of their religion All the neighbouring villages poured forth their inhabitants A great crowd consisting chiefly of young peasants brandishing their cudgels had assembled on the top of Haldon Hill whence the army marching from Chudleigh first descried the rich valley of the Exe and the two massive towers rising from the cloud of smoke which overhung the capital of the West The road all down the long descent and through the plain to the banks of the river was lined mile after mile with spectators From the West Gate to the Cathedral Close the pressing and shouting on each side was such as reminded Londoners of the crowds on the Lord Mayor s day The houses were gaily decorated Doors windows balconies and roofs were thronged with gazers An eye accustomed to the pomp of war would have found much to criticize in the spectacle For several toilsome marches in the rain through roads where one who travelled on foot sank at every step up to the ancles in clay had not improved the appearance either of the men or of their accoutrements But the people of Devonshire altogether unused to the splendour of well ordered camps were overwhelmed with delight and awe Descriptions of the martial pageant were circulated all over the kingdom They contained much that was well fitted to gratify the vulgar appetite for the marvellous For the Dutch army composed of men who had been born in various climates and had served under various standards presented an aspect at once grotesque gorgeous and terrible to islanders who had in general a very indistinct notion of foreign countries First rode Macclesfield at the head of two hundred gentlemen mostly of English blood glittering in helmets and cuirasses and mounted on Flemish war horses Each was attended by a negro brought from the sugar plantations on the coast of Guiana The citizens of Exeter who had never seen so many specimens of the African race gazed with wonder on those black faces set off by embroidered turbans and white feathers Then with drawn broad swords came a squadron of Swedish horsemen in black armour and fur cloaks They were regarded with a strange interest for it was rumoured that they were natives of a land where the ocean was frozen and where the night lasted through half the year and that they had themselves slain the huge bears whose skins they wore Next surrounded by a goodly company of gentlemen and pages was borne aloft the Prince s banner On its broad folds the crowd which covered the roofs and filled the windows read with delight that memorable inscription The Protestant religion and the liberties of England But the acclamations redoubled when attended by forty running footmen the Prince himself appeared armed on back and breast wearing a white plume and mounted on a white charger With how martial an air he curbed his horse how thoughtful and commanding was the expression of his ample forehead and falcon eye may still be seen on the canvass of Kneller Once those grave features relaxed into a smile It was when an ancient woman perhaps one of the zealous Puritans who through twenty eight years of persecution had waited with firm faith for the consolation of Israel perhaps the mother of some rebel who had perished in the carnage of Sedgemoor or in the more fearful carnage of the Bloody Circuit broke from the crowd rushed through the drawn swords and curvetting horses touched the hand of the deliverer and cried out that now she was happy Near to the Prince was one who divided with him the gaze of the multitude That men said was the great Count Schomberg the first soldier in Europe since Turenne and Conde were gone the man whose genius and valour had saved the Portuguese monarchy on the field of Montes Claros the man who had earned a still higher glory by resigning the truncheon of a Marshal of France for the sake of the true religion It was not forgotten that the two heroes who indissolubly united by their common Protestantism were entering Exeter together had twelve years before been opposed to each other under the walls of Maestricht and that the energy of the young Prince had not then been found a match for the cool science of the veteran who now rode in friendship by his side Then came a long column of the whiskered infantry of Switzerland distinguished in all the continental wars of two centuries by preeminent valour and discipline but never till that week seen on English ground And then marched a succession of bands designated as was the fashion of that age after their leaders Bentinck Solmes and Ginkell Talmash and Mackay With peculiar pleasure Englishmen might look on one gallant regiment which still bore the name of the honoured and lamented Ossory The effect of the spectacle was heightened by the recollection of the renowned events in which many of the warriors now pouring through the West Gate had borne a share For they had seen service very different from that of the Devonshire militia or of the camp at Hounslow Some of them had repelled the fiery onset of the French on the field of Seneff and others had crossed swords with the infidels in the cause of Christendom on that great day when the siege of Vienna was raised The very senses of the multitude were fooled by imagination Newsletters conveyed to every part of the kingdom fabulous accounts of the size and strength of the invaders It was affirmed that they were with scarcely an exception above six feet high and that they wielded such huge pikes swords and muskets as had never before been seen in England Nor did the wonder of the population diminish when the artillery arrived twenty one huge pieces of brass cannon which were with difficulty tugged along by sixteen cart horses to each Much curiosity was excited by a strange structure mounted on wheels It proved to be a moveable smithy furnished with all tools and materials necessary for repairing arms and carriages But nothing raised so much admiration as the bridge of boats which was laid with great speed on the Exe for the conveyance of waggons and afterwards as speedily taken to pieces and carried away It was made if report said true after a pattern contrived by the Christians who were warring against the Great Turk on the Danube The foreigners inspired as much good will as admiration Their politic leader took care to distribute the quarters in such a manner as to cause the smallest possible inconvenience to the inhabitants of Exeter and of the neighbouring villages The most rigid discipline was maintained Not only were pillage and outrage effectually prevented but the troops were required to demean themselves with civility towards all classes Those who had formed their notions of an army from the conduct of Kirke and his Lambs were amazed to see soldiers who never swore at a landlady or took an egg without paying for it In return for this moderation the people furnished the troops with provisions in great abundance and at reasonable prices five hundred twelve Much depended on the course which at this great crisis the clergy of the Church of England might take and the members of the Chapter of Exeter were the first who were called upon to declare their sentiments Burnet informed the Canons now left without a head by the flight of the Dean that they could not be permitted to use the prayer for the Prince of Wales and that a solemn service must be performed in honour of the safe arrival of the Prince The Canons did not choose to appear in their stalls but some of the choristers and prebendaries attended William repaired in military state to the Cathedral As he passed under the gorgeous screen that renowned organ scarcely surpassed by any of those which are the boast of his native Holland gave out a peal of triumph He mounted the Bishop s seat a stately throne rich with the carving of the fifteenth century Burnet stood below and a crowd of warriors and nobles appeared on the right hand and on the left The singers robed in white sang the Te Deum When the chaunt was over Burnet read the Prince s Declaration but as soon as the first words were uttered prebendaries and singers crowded in all haste out of the choir At the close Burnet cried in a loud voice God save the Prince of Orange and many fervent voices answered Amen five hundred thirteen On Sunday the eleventh of November Burnet preached before the Prince in the Cathedral and dilated on the signal mercy vouchsafed by God to the English Church and nation At the same time a singular event happened in a humbler place of worship Ferguson resolved to preach at the Presbyterian meeting house The minister and elders would not consent but the turbulent and halfwitted knave fancying that the times of Fleetwood and Harrison were come again forced the door went through the congregation sword in hand mounted the pulpit and there poured forth a fiery invective against the King The time for such follies had gone by and this exhibition excited nothing but derision and disgust five hundred fourteen While these things were passing in Devonshire the ferment was great in London The Prince s Declaration in spite of all precautions was now in every man s hands On the sixth of November James still uncertain on what part of the coast the invaders had landed summoned the Primate and three other Bishops Compton of London White of Peterborough and Sprat of Rochester to a conference in the closet The King listened graciously while the prelates made warm professions of loyalty and assured them that he did not suspect them But where said he is the paper that you were to bring me Sir answered Sancroft we have brought no paper We are not solicitous to clear our fame to the world It is no new thing to us to be reviled and falsely accused Our consciences acquit us your Majesty acquits us and we are satisfied Yes said the King but a declaration from you is necessary to my service He then produced a copy of the Prince s manifesto See he said how you are mentioned here Sir answered one of the Bishops not one person in five hundred believes this manifesto to be genuine No cried the King fiercely then those five hundred would bring the Prince of Orange to cut my throat God forbid exclaimed the prelates in concert But the King s understanding never very clear was now quite bewildered One of his peculiarities was that whenever his opinion was not adopted he fancied that his veracity was questioned This paper not genuine he exclaimed turning over the leaves with his hands Am I not worthy to be believed Is my word not to be taken At all events sir said one of the Bishops this is not an ecclesiastical matter It lies within the sphere of the civil power God has entrusted your Majesty with the sword and it is not for us to invade your functions Then the Archbishop with that gentle and temperate malice which inflicts the deepest wounds declared that he must be excused from setting his hand to any political document I and my brethren sir he said have already smarted severely for meddling with affairs of state and we shall be very cautious how we do so again We once subscribed a petition of the most harmless kind we presented it in the most respectful manner and we found that we had committed a high offence We were saved from ruin only by the merciful protection of God And sir the ground then taken by your Majesty s Attorney and Solicitor was that out of Parliament we were private men and that it was criminal presumption in private men to meddle with politics They attacked us so fiercely that for my part I gave myself over for lost I thank you for that my Lord of Canterbury said the King I should have hoped that you would not have thought yourself lost by falling into my hands Such a speech might have become the mouth of a merciful sovereign but it came with a bad grace from a prince who had burned a woman alive for harbouring one of his flying enemies from a prince round whose knees his own nephew had clung in vain agonies of supplication The Archbishop was not to be so silenced He resumed his story and recounted the insults which the creatures of the court had offered to the Church of England among which some ridicule thrown on his own style occupied a conspicuous place The King had nothing to say but that there was no use in repeating old grievances and that he had hoped that these things had been quite forgotten He who never forgot the smallest injury that he had suffered could not understand how others should remember for a few weeks the most deadly injuries that he had inflicted At length the conversation came back to the point from which it had wandered The King insisted on having from the Bishops a paper declaring their abhorrence of the Prince s enterprise They with many professions of the most submissive loyalty pertinaciously refused The Prince they said asserted that he had been invited by temporal as well as by spiritual peers The imputation was common Why should not the purgation be common also I see how it is said the King Some of the temporal peers have been with you and have persuaded you to cross me in this matter The Bishops solemnly averred that it was not so But it would they said seem strange that on a question involving grave political and military considerations the temporal peers should be entirely passed over and the prelates alone should be required to take a prominent part But this said James is my method I am your King It is for me to judge what is best I will go my own way and I call on you to assist me The Bishops assured him that they would assist him in their proper department as Christian ministers with their prayers and as peers of the realm with their advice in his Parliament James who wanted neither the prayers of heretics nor the advice of Parliaments was bitterly disappointed After a long altercation I have done he said I will urge you no further Since you will not help me I must trust to myself and to my own arms five hundred fifteen The Bishops had hardly left the royal presence when a courier arrived with the news that on the preceding day the Prince of Orange had landed in Devonshire During the following week London was violently agitated On Sunday the eleventh of November a rumour was circulated that knives gridirons and caldrons intended for the torturing of heretics were concealed in the monastery which had been established under the King s protection at Clerkenwell Great multitudes assembled round the building and were about to demolish it when a military force arrived The crowd was dispersed and several of the rioters were slain An inquest sate on the bodies and came to a decision which strongly indicated the temper of the public mind The jury found that certain loyal and well disposed persons who had gone to put down the meetings of traitors and public enemies at a mass house had been wilfully murdered by the soldiers and this strange verdict was signed by all the jurors The ecclesiastics at Clerkenwell naturally alarmed by these symptoms of popular feeling were desirous to place their property in safety They succeeded in removing most of their furniture before any report of their intentions got abroad But at length the suspicions of the rabble were excited The two last carts were stopped in Holborn and all that they contained was publicly burned in the middle of the street So great was the alarm among the Catholics that all their places of worship were closed except those which belonged to the royal family and to foreign Ambassadors five hundred sixteen On the whole however things as yet looked not unfavourably for James The invaders had been more than a week on English ground Yet no man of note had joined them No rebellion had broken out in the north or the east No servant of the crown appeared to have betrayed his trust The royal army was assembling fast at Salisbury and though inferior in discipline to that of William was superior in numbers The Prince was undoubtedly surprised and mortified by the slackness of those who had invited him to England By the common people of Devonshire indeed he had been received with every sign of good will but no nobleman no gentleman of high consideration had yet repaired to his quarters The explanation of this singular fact is probably to be found in the circumstance that he had landed in a part of the island where he had not been expected His friends in the north had made their arrangements for a rising on the supposition that he would be among them with an army His friends in the west had made no arrangements at all and were naturally disconcerted at finding themselves suddenly called upon to take the lead in a movement so important and perilous They had also fresh in their recollection and indeed full in their sight the disastrous consequences of rebellion gibbets heads mangled quarters families still in deep mourning for brave sufferers who had loved their country well but not wisely After a warning so terrible and so recent some hesitation was natural It was equally natural however that William who trusting to promises from England had put to hazard not only his own fame and fortunes but also the prosperity and independence of his native land should feel deeply mortified He was indeed so indignant that he talked of falling back to Torbay reembarking his troops returning to Holland and leaving those who had betrayed him to the fate which they deserved At length on Monday the twelfth of November a gentleman named Burrington who resided in the neighbourhood of Crediton joined the Prince s standard and his example was followed by several of his neighbours Men of higher consequence had already set out from different parts of the country for Exeter The first of these was John Lord Lovelace distinguished by his taste by his magnificence and by the audacious and intemperate vehemence of his Whiggism He had been five or six times arrested for political offences The last crime laid to his charge was that he had contemptuously denied the validity of a warrant signed by a Roman Catholic Justice of the Peace He had been brought before the Privy Council and strictly examined but to little purpose He resolutely refused to criminate himself and the evidence against him was insufficient He was dismissed but before he retired James exclaimed in great heat My Lord this is not the first trick that you have played me Sir answered Lovelace with undaunted spirit I never played any trick to your Majesty or to any other person Whoever has accused me to your Majesty of playing tricks is a liar Lovelace had subsequently been admitted into the confidence of those who planned the Revolution five hundred seventeen His mansion built by his ancestors out of the spoils of Spanish galleons from the Indies rose on the ruins of a house of Our Lady in that beautiful valley through which the Thames not yet defiled by the precincts of a great capital nor rising and falling with the flow and ebb of the sea rolls under woods of beech round the gentle hills of Berkshire Beneath the stately saloon adorned by Italian pencils was a subterraneous vault in which the bones of ancient monks had sometimes been found In this dark chamber some zealous and daring opponents of the government had held many midnight conferences during that anxious time when England was impatiently expecting the Protestant wind five hundred eighteen The season for action had now arrived Lovelace with seventy followers well armed and mounted quitted his dwelling and directed his course westward He reached Gloucestershire without difficulty But Beaufort who governed that county was exerting all his great authority and influence in support of the crown The militia had been called out A strong party had been posted at Cirencester When Lovelace arrived there he was informed that he could not be suffered to pass It was necessary for him either to relinquish his undertaking or to fight his way through He resolved to force a passage and his friends and tenants stood gallantly by him A sharp conflict took place The militia lost an officer and six or seven men but at length the followers of Lovelace were overpowered he was made a prisoner and sent to Gloucester Castle five hundred nineteen Others were more fortunate On the day on which the skirmish took place at Cirencester Richard Savage Lord Colchester son and heir of the Earl Rivers and father by a lawless amour of that unhappy poet whose misdeeds and misfortunes form one of the darkest portions of literary history came with between sixty and seventy horse to Exeter With him arrived the bold and turbulent Thomas Wharton A few hours later came Edward Russell son of the Earl of Bedford and brother of the virtuous nobleman whose blood had been shed on the scaffold Another arrival still more important was speedily announced Colchester Wharton and Russell belonged to that party which had been constantly opposed to the court James Bertie Earl of Abingdon had on the contrary been regarded as a supporter of arbitrary government He had been true to James in the days of the Exclusion Bill He had as Lord Lieutenant of Oxfordshire acted with vigour and severity against the adherents of Monmouth and had lighted bonfires to celebrate the defeat of Argyle But dread of Popery had driven him into opposition and rebellion He was the first peer of the realm who made his appearance at the quarters of the Prince of Orange five hundred twenty But the King had less to fear from those who openly arrayed themselves against his authority than from the dark conspiracy which had spread its ramifications through his army and his family Of that conspiracy Churchill unrivalled in sagacity and address endowed by nature with a certain cool intrepidity which never failed him either in fighting or lying high in military rank and high in the favour of the Princess Anne must be regarded as the soul It was not yet time for him to strike the decisive blow But even thus early he inflicted by the instrumentality of a subordinate agent a wound serious if not deadly on the royal cause Edward Viscount Cornbury eldest son of the Earl of Clarendon was a young man of slender abilities loose principles and violent temper He had been early taught to consider his relationship to the Princess Anne as the groundwork of his fortunes and had been exhorted to pay her assiduous court It had never occurred to his father that the hereditary loyalty of the Hydes could run any risk of contamination in the household of the King s favourite daughter but in that household the Churchills held absolute sway and Cornbury became their tool He commanded one of the regiments of dragoons which had been sent westward Such dispositions had been made that on the fourteenth of November he was during a few hours the senior officer at Salisbury and all the troops assembled there were subject to his authority It seems extraordinary that at such a crisis the army on which every thing depended should have been left even for a moment under the command of a young Colonel who had neither abilities nor experience There can be little doubt that so strange an arrangement was the result of deep design and as little doubt to what head and to what heart the design is to be imputed Suddenly three of the regiments of cavalry which had assembled at Salisbury were ordered to march westward Cornbury put himself at their head and conducted them first to Blandford and thence to Dorchester From Dorchester after a halt of an hour or two they set out for Axminster Some of the officers began to be uneasy and demanded an explanation of these strange movements Cornbury replied that he had instructions to make a night attack on some troops which the Prince of Orange had posted at Honiton But suspicion was awake Searching questions were put and were evasively answered At last Cornbury was pressed to produce his orders He perceived not only that it would be impossible for him to carry over all the three regiments as he had hoped but that he was himself in a situation of considerable peril He accordingly stole away with a few followers to the Dutch quarters Most of his troops returned to Salisbury but some who had been detached from the main body and who had no suspicion of the designs of their commander proceeded to Honiton There they found themselves in the midst of a large force which was fully prepared to receive them Resistance was impossible Their leader pressed them to take service under William A gratuity of a month s pay was offered to them and was by most of them accepted five hundred twenty one The news of these events reached London on the fifteenth James had been on the morning of that day in high good humour Bishop Lamplugh had just presented himself at court on his arrival from Exeter and had been most graciously received My Lord said the King you are a genuine old Cavalier The archbishopric of York which had now been vacant more than two years and a half was immediately bestowed on Lamplugh as the reward of loyalty That afternoon just as the King was sitting down to dinner arrived an express with the tidings of Cornbury s defection James turned away from his untasted meal swallowed a crust of bread and a glass of wine and retired to his closet He afterwards learned that as he was rising from table several of the Lords in whom he reposed the greatest confidence were shaking hands and congratulating each other in the adjoining gallery When the news was carried to the Queen s apartments she and her ladies broke out into tears and loud cries of sorrow five hundred twenty two The blow was indeed a heavy one It was true that the direct loss to the crown and the direct gain to the invaders hardly amounted to two hundred men and as many horses But where could the King henceforth expect to find those sentiments in which consists the strength of states and of armies Cornbury was the heir of a house conspicuous for its attachment to monarchy His father Clarendon his uncle Rochester were men whose loyalty was supposed to be proof to all temptation What must be the strength of that feeling against which the most deeply rooted hereditary prejudices were of no avail of that feeling which could reconcile a young officer of high birth to desertion aggravated by breach of trust and by gross falsehood That Cornbury was not a man of brilliant parts or enterprising temper made the event more alarming It was impossible to doubt that he had in some quarter a powerful and artful prompter Who that prompter was soon became evident In the meantime no man in the royal camp could feel assured that he was not surrounded by traitors Political rank military rank the honour of a nobleman the honour of a soldier the strongest professions the purest Cavalier blood could no longer afford security Every man might reasonably doubt whether every order which he received from his superior was not meant to serve the purposes of the enemy That prompt obedience without which an army is merely a rabble was necessarily at an end What discipline could there be among soldiers who had just been saved from a snare by refusing to follow their commanding officer on a secret expedition and by insisting on a sight of his orders Cornbury was soon kept in countenance by a crowd of deserters superior to him in rank and capacity but during a few days he stood alone in his shame and was bitterly reviled by many who afterwards imitated his example and envied his dishonourable precedence Among these was his own father The first outbreak of Clarendon s rage and sorrow was highly pathetic Oh God he ejaculated that a son of mine should be a rebel A fortnight later he made up his mind to be a rebel himself Yet it would be unjust to pronounce him a mere hypocrite In revolutions men live fast the experience of years is crowded into hours old habits of thought and action are violently broken novelties which at first sight inspire dread and disgust become in a few days familiar endurable attractive Many men of far purer virtue and higher spirit than Clarendon were prepared before that memorable year ended to do what they would have pronounced wicked and infamous when it began The unhappy father composed himself as well as he could and sent to ask a private audience of the King It was granted James said with more than his usual graciousness that he from his heart pitied Cornbury s relations and should not hold them at all accountable for the crime of their unworthy kinsman Clarendon went home scarcely daring to look his friends in the face Soon however he learned with surprise that the act which had as he at first thought for ever dishonoured his family was applauded by some persons of high station His niece the Princess of Denmark asked him why he shut himself up He answered that he had been overwhelmed with confusion by his son s villany Anne seemed not at all to understand this feeling People she said are very uneasy about Popery I believe that many of the army will do the same five hundred twenty three And now the King greatly disturbed called together the principal officers who were still in London Churchill who was about this time promoted to the rank of Lieutenant General made his appearance with that bland serenity which neither peril nor infamy could ever disturb The meeting was attended by Henry Fitzroy Duke of Grafton whose audacity and activity made him conspicuous among the natural children of Charles the Second Grafton was colonel of the first regiment of Foot Guards He seems to have been at this time completely under Churchill s influence and was prepared to desert the royal standard as soon as the favourable moment should arrive Two other traitors were in the circle Kirke and Trelawney who commanded those two fierce and lawless bands then known as the Tangier regiments Both of them had like the other Protestant officers of the army long seen with extreme displeasure the partiality which the King had shown to members of his own Church and Trelawney remembered with bitter resentment the persecution of his brother the Bishop of Bristol James addressed the assembly in terms worthy of a better man and of a better cause It might be he said that some of the officers had conscientious scruples about fighting for him If so he was willing to receive back their commissions But he adjured them as gentlemen and soldiers not to imitate the shameful example of Cornbury All seemed moved and none more than Churchill He was the first to vow with well feigned enthusiasm that he would shed the last drop of his blood in the service of his gracious master Grafton was loud and forward in similar protestations and the example was followed by Kirke and Trelawney five hundred twenty four Deceived by these professions the King prepared to set out for Salisbury Before his departure he was informed that a considerable number of peers temporal and spiritual desired to be admitted to an audience They came with Sancroft at their head to present a petition praying that a free and legal Parliament might be called and that a negotiation might be opened with the Prince of Orange The history of this petition is curious The thought seems to have occurred at once to two great chiefs of parties who had long been rivals and enemies Rochester and Halifax They both independently of one another consulted the Bishops The Bishops warmly approved of the suggestion It was then proposed that a general meeting of peers should be called to deliberate on the form of an address to the King It was term time and in term time men of rank and fashion then lounged every day in Westminster Hall as they now lounge in the clubs of Pall Mall and Saint James s Street Nothing could be easier than for the Lords who assembled there to step aside into some adjoining room and to hold a consultation But unexpected difficulties arose Halifax became first cold and then adverse It was his nature to discover objections to everything and on this occasion his sagacity was quickened by rivalry The scheme which he had approved while he regarded it as his own began to displease him as soon as he found that it was also the scheme of Rochester by whom he had been long thwarted and at length supplanted and whom he disliked as much as it was in his easy nature to dislike anybody Nottingham was at that time much under the influence of Halifax They both declared that they would not join in the address if Rochester signed it Clarendon expostulated in vain I mean no disrespect said Halifax to my Lord Rochester but he has been a member of the Ecclesiastical Commission the proceedings of that court must soon be the subject of a very serious inquiry and it is not fit that one who has sate there should take any part in our petition Nottingham with strong expressions of personal esteem for Rochester avowed the same opinion The authority of the two dissentient Lords prevented several other noblemen from subscribing the address but the Hydes and the Bishops persisted Nineteen signatures were procured and the petitioners waited in a body on the King five hundred twenty five He received their address ungraciously He assured them indeed that he passionately desired the meeting of a free Parliament and he promised them on the faith of a King that he would call one as soon as the Prince of Orange should have left the island But how said he can a Parliament be free when an enemy is in the kingdom and can return near a hundred votes To the prelates he spoke with peculiar acrimony I could not he said prevail on you the other day to declare against this invasion but you are ready enough to declare against me Then you would not meddle with politics You have no scruple about meddling now You have excited this rebellious temper among your flocks and now you foment it You would be better employed in teaching them how to obey than in teaching me how to govern He was much incensed against his nephew Grafton whose signature stood next to that of Sancroft and said to the young man with great asperity You know nothing about religion you care nothing about it and yet forsooth you must pretend to have a conscience It is true sir answered Grafton with impudent frankness that I have very little conscience but I belong to a party which has a great deal five hundred twenty six Bitter as was the King s language to the petitioners it was far less bitter that that which he held after they had withdrawn He had done he said far too much already in the hope of satisfying an undutiful and ungrateful people He had always hated the thought of concession but he had suffered himself to be talked over and now he like his father before him had found that concession only made subjects more encroaching He would yield nothing more not an atom and after his fashion he vehemently repeated many times Not an atom Not only would he make no overtures to the invaders but he would receive none If the Dutch sent flags of truce the first messenger should be dismissed without an answer the second should be hanged five hundred twenty seven In such a mood James set out for Salisbury His last act before his departure was to appoint a Council of five Lords to represent him in London during his absence Of the five two were Papists and by law incapable of office Joined with them was Jeffreys a Protestant indeed but more detested by the nation than any Papist To the other two members of this board Preston and Godolphin no serious objection could be made On the day on which the King left London the Prince of Wales was sent to Portsmouth That fortress was strongly garrisoned and was under the government of Berwick The fleet commanded by Dartmouth lay close at hand and it was supposed that if things went ill the royal infant would without difficulty be conveyed from Portsmouth to France five hundred twenty eight On the nineteenth James reached Salisbury and took up his quarters in the episcopal palace Evil news was now fast pouring in upon him from all sides The western counties had at length risen As soon as the news of Cornbury s desertion was known many wealthy landowners took heart and hastened to Exeter Among them was Sir William Portman of Bryanstone one of the greatest men in Dorsetshire and Sir Francis Warre of Hestercombe whose interest was great in Somersetshire five hundred twenty nine But the most important of the new comets was Seymour who had recently inherited a baronetcy which added little to his dignity and who in birth in political influence and in parliamentary abilities was beyond comparison the foremost among the Tory gentlemen of England At his first audience he is said to have exhibited his characteristic pride in a way which surprised and amused the Prince I think Sir Edward said William meaning to be very civil that you are of the family of the Duke of Somerset Pardon me sir said Sir Edward who never forgot that he was the head of the elder branch of the Seymours the Duke of Somerset is of my family five hundred thirty The quarters of William now began to present the appearance of a court More than sixty men of rank and fortune were lodged at Exeter and the daily display of rich liveries and of coaches drawn by six horses in the Cathedral Close gave to that quiet precinct something of the splendour and gaiety of Whitehall The common people were eager to take arms and it would have been easy to form many battalions of infantry But Schomberg who thought little of soldiers fresh from the plough maintained that if the expedition could not succeed without such help it would not succeed at all and William who had as much professional feeling as Schomberg concurred in this opinion Commissions therefore for raising new regiments were very sparingly given and none but picked recruits were enlisted It was now thought desirable that the Prince should give a public reception to the whole body of noblemen and gentlemen who had assembled at Exeter He addressed them in a short but dignified and well considered speech He was not he said acquainted with the faces of all whom he saw But he had a list of their names and knew how high they stood in the estimation of their country He gently chid their tardiness but expressed a confident hope that it was not yet too late to save the kingdom Therefore he said gentlemen friends and fellow Protestants we bid you and all your followers most heartily welcome to our court and camp five hundred thirty one Seymour a keen politician long accustomed to the tactics of faction saw in a moment that the party which had begun to rally round the Prince stood in need of organization It was as yet he said a mere rope of sand no common object had been publicly and formally avowed nobody was pledged to anything As soon as the assembly at the Deanery broke up he sent for Burnet and suggested that an association should be formed and that all the English adherents of the Prince should put their hands to an instrument binding them to be true to their leader and to each other Burnet carried the suggestion to the Prince and to Shrewsbury by both of whom it was approved A meeting was held in the Cathedral A short paper drawn up by Burnet was produced approved and eagerly signed The subscribers engaged to pursue in concert the objects set forth in the Prince s declaration to stand by him and by each other to take signal vengeance on all who should make any attempt on his person and even if such an attempt should unhappily succeed to persist in their undertaking till the liberties and the religion of the nation should be effectually secured five hundred thirty two About the same time a messenger arrived at Exeter from the Earl of Bath who commanded at Plymouth Bath declared that he placed himself his troops and the fortress which he governed at the Prince s disposal The invaders therefore had now not a single enemy in their rear five hundred thirty three While the West was thus rising to confront the King the North was all in a flame behind him On the sixteenth Delamere took arms in Cheshire He convoked his tenants called upon them to stand by him promised that if they fell in the cause their leases should be renewed to their children and exhorted every one who had a good horse either to take the field or to provide a substitute five hundred thirty four He appeared at Manchester with fifty men armed and mounted and his force had trebled before he reached Boaden Downs The neighbouring counties were violently agitated It had been arranged that Danby should seize York and that Devonshire should appear at Nottingham At Nottingham no resistance was anticipated But at York there was a small garrison under the command of Sir John Reresby Danby acted with rare dexterity A meeting of the gentry and freeholders of Yorkshire had been summoned for the twenty second of November to address the King on the state of affairs All the Deputy Lieutenants of the three Ridings several noblemen and a multitude of opulent esquires and substantial yeomen had been attracted to the provincial capital Four troops of militia had been drawn out under arms to preserve the public peace The Common Hall was crowded with freeholders and the discussion had begun when a cry was suddenly raised that the Papists were up and were slaying the Protestants The Papists of York were much more likely to be employed in seeking for hiding places than in attacking enemies who outnumbered them in the proportion of a hundred to one But at that time no story of Popish atrocity could be so wild and marvellous as not to find ready belief The meeting separated in dismay The whole city was in confusion At this moment Danby at the head of about a hundred horsemen rode up to the militia and raised the cry No Popery A free Parliament The Protestant religion The militia echoed the shout The garrison was instantly surprised and disarmed The governor was placed under arrest The gates were closed Sentinels were posted everywhere The populace was suffered to pull down a Roman Catholic chapel but no other harm appears to have been done On the following morning the Guildhall was crowded with the first gentlemen of the shire and with the principal magistrates of the city The Lord Mayor was placed in the chair Danby proposed a Declaration setting forth the reasons which had induced the friends of the constitution and of the Protestant religion to rise in arms This Declaration was eagerly adopted and received in a few hours the signatures of six peers of five baronets of six knights and of many gentlemen of high consideration five hundred thirty five Devonshire meantime at the head of a great body of friends and dependents quitted the palace which he was rearing at Chatsworth and appeared in arms at Derby There he formally delivered to the municipal authorities a paper setting forth the reasons which had moved him to this enterprise He then proceeded to Nottingham which soon became the head quarters of the Northern insurrection Here a proclamation was put forth couched in bold and severe terms The name of rebellion it was said was a bugbear which could frighten no reasonable man Was it rebellion to defend those laws and that religion which every King of England bound himself by oath to maintain How that oath had lately been observed was a question on which it was to be hoped a free Parliament would soon pronounce In the meantime the insurgents declared that they held it to be not rebellion but legitimate self defence to resist a tyrant who knew no law but his own will The Northern rising became every day more formidable Four powerful and wealthy Earls Manchester Stamford Rutland and Chesterfield repaired to Nottingham and were joined there by Lord Cholmondley and by Lord Grey de Ruthyn five hundred thirty six All this time the hostile armies in the south were approaching each other The Prince of Orange when he learned that the King had arrived at Salisbury thought it time to leave Exeter He placed that city and the surrounding country under the government of Sir Edward Seymour and set out on Wednesday the twenty first of November escorted by many of the most considerable gentlemen of the western counties for Axminster where he remained several days The King was eager to fight and it was obviously his interest to do so Every hour took away something from his own strength and added something to the strength of his enemies It was most important too that his troops should be blooded A great battle however it might terminate could not but injure the Prince s popularity All this William perfectly understood and determined to avoid an action as long as possible It is said that when Schomberg was told that the enemy were advancing and were determined to fight he answered with the composure of a tactician confident in his skill That will be just as we may choose It was however impossible to prevent all skirmishing between the advanced guards of the armies William was desirous that in such skirmishing nothing might happen which could wound the pride or rouse the vindictive feelings of the nation which he meant to deliver He therefore with admirable prudence placed his British regiments in the situations where there was most risk of collision The outposts of the royal army were Irish The consequence was that in the little combats of this short campaign the invaders had on their side the hearty sympathy of all Englishmen The first of these encounters took place at Wincanton Mackay s regiment composed of British soldiers lay near a body of the King s Irish troops commanded by their countryman the gallant Sarsfield Mackay sent out a small party under a lieutenant named Campbell to procure horses for the baggage Campbell found what he wanted at Wincanton and was just leaving that town on his return when a strong detachment of Sarsfield s troops approached The Irish were four to one but Campbell resolved to fight it out to the last With a handful of resolute men he took his stand in the road The rest of his soldiers lined the hedges which overhung the highway on the right and on the left The enemy came up Stand cried Campbell for whom are you I am for King James answered the leader of the other party And I for the Prince of Orange cried Campbell We will prince you answered the Irishman with a curse Fire exclaimed Campbell and a sharp fire was instantly poured in from both the hedges The King s troops received three well aimed volleys before they could make any return At length they succeeded in carrying one of the hedges and would have overpowered the little band which was opposed to them had not the country people who mortally hated the Irish given a false alarm that more of the Prince s troops were coming up Sarsfield recalled his men and fell back and Campbell proceeded on his march unmolested with the baggage horses This affair creditable undoubtedly to the valour and discipline of the Prince s army was magnified by report into a victory won against great odds by British Protestants over Popish barbarians who had been brought from Connaught to oppress our island five hundred thirty seven A few hours after this skirmish an event took place which put an end to all risk of a more serious struggle between the armies Churchill and some of his principal accomplices were assembled at Salisbury Two of the conspirators Kirke and Trelawney had proceeded to Warminster where their regiments were posted All was ripe for the execution of the long meditated treason Churchill advised the King to visit Warminster and to inspect the troops stationed there James assented and his coach was at the door of the episcopal palace when his nose began to bleed violently He was forced to postpone his expedition and to put himself under medical treatment Three days elapsed before the hemorrhage was entirely subdued and during those three days alarming rumours reached his ears It was impossible that a conspiracy so widely spread as that of which Churchill was the head could be kept altogether secret There was no evidence which could be laid before a jury or a court martial but strange whispers wandered about the camp Feversham who held the chief command reported that there was a bad spirit in the army It was hinted to the King that some who were near his person were not his friends and that it would be a wise precaution to send Churchill and Grafton under a guard to Portsmouth James rejected this counsel A propensity to suspicion was not among his vices Indeed the confidence which he reposed in professions of fidelity and attachment was such as might rather have been expected from a goodhearted and inexperienced stripling than from a politician who was far advanced in life who had seen much of the world who had suffered much from villanous arts and whose own character was by no means a favourable specimen of human nature It would be difficult to mention any other man who having himself so little scruple about breaking faith was so slow to believe that his neighbours could break faith with him Nevertheless the reports which he had received of the state of his army disturbed him greatly He was now no longer impatient for a battle He even began to think of retreating On the evening of Saturday the twenty fourth of November he called a council of war The meeting was attended by those officers against whom he had been most earnestly cautioned Feversham expressed an opinion that it was desirable to fall back Churchill argued on the other side The consultation lasted till midnight At length the King declared that he had decided for a retreat Churchill saw or imagined that he was distrusted and though gifted with a rare self command could not conceal his uneasiness Before the day broke he fled to the Prince s quarters accompanied by Grafton five hundred thirty eight Churchill left behind him a letter of explanation It was written with that decorum which he never failed to preserve in the midst of guilt and dishonour He acknowledged that he owed everything to the royal favour Interest he said and gratitude impelled him in the same direction Under no other government could he hope to be so great and prosperous as he had been but all such considerations must yield to a paramount duty He was a Protestant and he could not conscientiously draw his sword against the Protestant cause As to the rest he would ever be ready to hazard life and fortune in defence of the sacred person and of the lawful rights of his gracious master five hundred thirty nine Next morning all was confusion in the royal camp The King s friends were in dismay His enemies could not conceal their exultation The consternation of James was increased by news which arrived on the same day from Warminster Kirke who commanded at that post had refused to obey orders which he had received from Salisbury There could no longer be any doubt that he too was in league with the Prince of Orange It was rumoured that he had actually gone over with all his troops to the enemy and the rumour though false was during some hours fully believed five hundred forty A new light flashed on the mind of the unhappy King He thought that he understood why he had been pressed a few days before to visit Warminster There he would have found himself helpless at the mercy of the conspirators and in the vicinity of the hostile outposts Those who might have attempted to defend him would have been easily overpowered He would have been carried a prisoner to the head quarters of the invading army Perhaps some still blacker treason might have been committed for men who have once engaged in a wicked and perilous enterprise are no longer their own masters and are often impelled by a fatality which is part of their just punishment to crimes such as they would at first have shuddered to contemplate Surely it was not without the special intervention of some guardian Saint that a King devoted to the Catholic Church had at the very moment when he was blindly hastening to captivity perhaps to death been suddenly arrested by what he had then thought a disastrous malady All these things confirmed James in the resolution which he had taken on the preceding evening Orders were given for an immediate retreat Salisbury was in an uproar The camp broke up with the confusion of a flight No man knew whom to trust or whom to obey The material strength of the army was little diminished but its moral strength had been destroyed Many whom shame would have restrained from leading the way to the Prince s quarters were eager to imitate an example which they never would have set and many who would have stood by their King while he appeared to be resolutely advancing against the invaders felt no inclination to follow a receding standard five hundred forty one James went that day as far as Andover He was attended by his son in law Prince George and by the Duke of Ormond Both were among the conspirators and would probably have accompanied Churchill had he not in consequence of what had passed at the council of war thought it expedient to take his departure suddenly The impenetrable stupidity of Prince George served his turn on this occasion better than cunning would have done It was his habit when any news was told him to exclaim in French possible Is it possible This catchword was now of great use to him Est il possible he cried when he had been made to understand that Churchill and Grafton were missing And when the ill tidings came from Warminster he again ejaculated Est il possible Prince George and Ormond were invited to sup with the King at Andover The meal must have been a sad one The King was overwhelmed by his misfortunes His son in law was the dullest of companions I have tried Prince George sober said Charles the Second and I have tried him drunk and drunk or sober there is nothing in him five hundred forty two Ormond who was through life taciturn and bashful was not likely to be in high spirits at such a moment At length the repast terminated The King retired to rest Horses were in waiting for the Prince and Ormond who as soon as they left the table mounted and rode off They were accompanied by the Earl of Drumlanrig eldest son of the Duke of Queensberry The defection of this young nobleman was no insignificant event For Queensberry was the head of the Protestant Episcopalians of Scotland a class compared with whom the bitterest English Tories might be called Whiggish and Drumlanrig himself was Lieutenant Colonel of Dundee s regiment a band more detested by the Whigs than even Kirke s lambs This fresh calamity was announced to the King on the following morning He was less disturbed by the news than might have been expected The shock which he had undergone twenty four hours before had prepared him for almost any disaster and it was impossible to be seriously angry with Prince George who was hardly an accountable being for having yielded to the arts of such a tempter as Churchill What said James is Est il possible gone too After all a good trooper would have been a greater loss five hundred forty three In truth the King s whole anger seems at this time to have been concentrated and not without cause on one object He set off for London breathing vengeance against Churchill and learned on arriving a new crime of the arch deceiver The Princess Anne had been some hours missing Anne who had no will but that of the Churchills had been induced by them to notify under her own hand to William a week before her approbation of his enterprise She assured him that she was entirely in the hands of her friends and that she would remain in the palace or take refuge in the City as they might determine five hundred forty four On Sunday the twenty fifth of November she and those who thought for her were under the necessity of coming to a sudden resolution That afternoon a courier from Salisbury brought tidings that Churchill had disappeared that he had been accompanied by Grafton that Kirke had proved false and that the royal forces were in full retreat There was as usually happened when great news good or bad arrived in town an immense crowd that evening in the galleries of Whitehall Curiosity and anxiety sate on every face The Queen broke forth into natural expressions of indignation against the chief traitor and did not altogether spare his too partial mistress The sentinels were doubled round that part of the palace which Anne occupied The Princess was in dismay In a few hours her father would be at Westminster It was not likely that he would treat her personally with severity but that he would permit her any longer to enjoy the society of her friend was not to be hoped It could hardly be doubted that Sarah would be placed under arrest and would be subjected to a strict examination by shrewd and rigorous inquisitors Her papers would be seized Perhaps evidence affecting her life might be discovered If so the worst might well be dreaded The vengeance of the implacable King knew no distinction of sex For offences much smaller than those which might probably be brought home to Lady Churchill he had sent women to the scaffold and the stake Strong affection braced the feeble mind of the Princess There was no tie which she would not break no risk which she would not run for the object of her idolatrous affection I will jump out of the window she cried rather than be found here by my father The favourite undertook to manage an escape She communicated in all haste with some of the chiefs of the conspiracy In a few hours every thing was arranged That evening Anne retired to her chamber as usual At dead of night she rose and accompanied by her friend Sarah and two other female attendants stole down the back stairs in a dressing gown and slippers The fugitives gained the open street unchallenged A hackney coach was in waiting for them there Two men guarded the humble vehicle One of them was Compton Bishop of London the Princess s old tutor the other was the magnificent and accomplished Dorset whom the extremity of the public danger had roused from his luxurious repose The coach drove instantly to Aldersgate Street where the town residence of the Bishops of London then stood within the shadow of their Cathedral There the Princess passed the night On the following morning she set out for Epping Forest In that wild tract Dorset possessed a venerable mansion which has long since been destroyed In his hospitable dwelling the favourite resort during many years of wits and poets the fugitives made a short stay They could not safely attempt to reach William s quarters for the road thither lay through a country occupied by the royal forces It was therefore determined that Anne should take refuge with the northern insurgents Compton wholly laid aside for the time his sacerdotal character Danger and conflict had rekindled in him all the military ardour which he had felt twenty eight years before when he rode in the Life Guards He preceded the Princess s carriage in a buff coat and jackboots with a sword at his side and pistols in his holsters Long before she reached Nottingham she was surrounded by a body guard of gentlemen who volunteered to escort her They invited the Bishop to act as their colonel and he consented with an alacrity which gave great scandal to rigid Churchmen and did not much raise his character even in the opinion of Whigs five hundred forty five When on the morning of the twenty sixth Anne s apartment was found empty the consternation was great in Whitehall While the Ladies of her Bedchamber ran up and down the courts of the palace screaming and wringing their hands while Lord Craven who commanded the Foot Guards was questioning the sentinels in the gallery while the Chancellor was sealing up the papers of the Churchills the Princess s nurse broke into the royal apartments crying out that the dear lady had been murdered by the Papists The news flew to Westminster Hall There the story was that Her Highness had been hurried away by force to a place of confinement When it could no longer be denied that her flight had been voluntary numerous fictions were invented to account for it She had been grossly insulted she had been threatened nay though she was in that situation in which woman is entitled to peculiar tenderness she had been beaten by her cruel stepmother The populace which years of misrule had made suspicious and irritable was so much excited by these calumnies that the Queen was scarcely safe Many Roman Catholics and some Protestant Tories whose loyalty was proof to all trials repaired to the palace that they might be in readiness to defend her in the event of an outbreak In the midst of this distress and tenor arrived the news of Prince George s flight The courier who brought these evil tidings was fast followed by the King himself The evening was closing in when James arrived and was informed that his daughter had disappeared After all that he had suffered this affliction forced a cry of misery from his lips God help me he said my own children have forsaken me five hundred forty six That evening he sate in Council with his principal ministers till a late hour It was determined that he should summon all the Lords Spiritual and Temporal who were then in London to attend him on the following day and that he should solemnly ask their advice Accordingly on the afternoon of Tuesday the twenty seventh the Lords met in the dining room of the palace The assembly consisted of nine prelates and between thirty and forty secular nobles all Protestants The two Secretaries of State Middleton and Preston though not peers of England were in attendance The King himself presided The traces of severe bodily and mental suffering were discernible in his countenance and deportment He opened the proceedings by referring to the petition which had been put into his hands just before he set out for Salisbury The prayer of that petition was that he would convoke a free Parliament Situated as he then was he had not he said thought it right to comply But during his absence from London great changes had taken place He had also observed that his people everywhere seemed anxious that the Houses should meet He had therefore commanded the attendance of his faithful Peers in order to ask their counsel For a time there was silence Then Oxford whose pedigree unrivalled in antiquity and splendour gave him a kind of primacy in the meeting said that in his opinion those Lords who had signed the petition to which His Majesty had referred ought now to explain their views These words called up Rochester He defended the petition and declared that he still saw no hope for the throne or the country but in a Parliament He would not he said venture to affirm that in so disastrous an extremity even that remedy would be efficacious but he had no other remedy to propose He added that it might be advisable to open a negotiation with the Prince of Orange Jeffreys and Godolphin followed and both declared that they agreed with Rochester Then Clarendon rose and to the astonishment of all who remembered his loud professions of loyalty and the agony of shame and sorrow into which he had been thrown only a few days before by the news of his son s defection broke forth into a vehement invective against tyranny and Popery Even now he said His Majesty is raising in London a regiment into which no Protestant is admitted That is not true cried James in great agitation from the head of the board Clarendon persisted and left this offensive topic only to pass to a topic still more offensive He accused the unfortunate King of pusillanimity Why retreat from Salisbury Why not try the event of a battle Could people be blamed for submitting to the invader when they saw their sovereign run away at the head of his army James felt these insults keenly and remembered them long Indeed even Whigs thought the language of Clarendon indecent and ungenerous Halifax spoke in a very different tone During several years of peril he had defended with admirable ability the civil and ecclesiastical constitution of his country against the prerogative But his serene intellect singularly unsusceptible of enthusiasm and singularly averse to extremes began to lean towards the cause of royalty at the very moment at which those noisy Royalists who had lately execrated the Trimmers as little bettor than rebels were everywhere rising in rebellion It was his ambition to be at this conjuncture the peacemaker between the throne and the nation His talents and character fitted him for that office and if he failed the failure is to be ascribed to causes against which no human skill could contend and chiefly to the folly faithlessness and obstinacy of the Prince whom he tried to save Halifax now gave utterance to much unpalatable truth but with a delicacy which brought on him the reproach of flattery from spirits too abject to understand that what would justly be called flattery when offered to the powerful is a debt of humanity to the fallen With many expressions of sympathy and deference he declared it to be his opinion that the King must make up his mind to great sacrifices It was not enough to convoke a Parliament or to open a negotiation with the Prince of Orange Some at least of the grievances of which the nation complained should be instantly redressed without waiting till redress was demanded by the Houses or by the captain of the hostile army Nottingham in language equally respectful declared that he agreed with Halifax The chief concessions which these Lords pressed the King to make were three He ought they said forthwith to dismiss all Roman Catholics from office to separate himself wholly from France and to grant an unlimited amnesty to those who were in arms against him The last of these propositions it should seem admitted of no dispute For though some of those who were banded together against the King had acted towards him in a manner which might not unreasonably excite his bitter resentment it was more likely that he would soon be at their mercy than that they would ever be at his It would have been childish to open a negotiation with William and yet to denounce vengeance against men whom William could not without infamy abandon But the clouded understanding and implacable temper of James held out long against the arguments of those who laboured to convince him that it would be wise to pardon offences which he could not punish I cannot do it he exclaimed I must make examples Churchill above all Churchill whom I raised so high He and he alone has done all this He has corrupted my army He has corrupted my child He would have put me into the hands of the Prince of Orange but for God s special providence My Lords you are strangely anxious for the safety of traitors None of you troubles himself about my safety In answer to this burst of impotent anger those who had recommended the amnesty represented with profound respect but with firmness that a prince attacked by powerful enemies can be safe only by conquering or by conciliating If your Majesty after all that has happened has still any hope of safety in arms we have done but if not you can be safe only by regaining the affections of your people After long and animated debate the King broke up the meeting My Lords he said you have used great freedom but I do not take it ill of you I have made up my mind on one point I shall call a Parliament The other suggestions which have been offered are of grave importance and you will not be surprised that I take a night to reflect on them before I decide five hundred forty seven At first James seemed disposed to make excellent use of the time which he had taken for consideration The Chancellor was directed to issue writs convoking a Parliament for the thirteenth of January Halifax was sent for to the closet had a long audience and spoke with much more freedom than he had thought it decorous to use in the presence of a large assembly He was informed that he had been appointed a Commissioner to treat with the Prince of Orange With him were joined Nottingham and Godolphin The King declared that he was prepared to make great sacrifices for the sake of peace Halifax answered that great sacrifices would doubtless be required Your Majesty he said must not expect that those who have the power in their hands will consent to any terms which would leave the laws at the mercy of the prerogative With this distinct explanation of his views he accepted the Commission which the King wished him to undertake five hundred forty eight The concessions which a few hours before had been so obstinately refused were now made in the most liberal manner A proclamation was put forth by which the King not only granted a free pardon to all who were in rebellion against him but declared them eligible to be members of the approaching Parliament It was not even required as a condition of eligibility that they should lay down their arms The same Gazette which announced that the Houses were about to meet contained a notification that Sir Edward Hales who as a Papist as a renegade as the foremost champion of the dispensing power and as the harsh gaoler of the Bishops was one of the most unpopular men in the realm had ceased to be Lieutenant of the Tower and had been succeeded by his late prisoner Bevil Skelton who though he held no high place in the esteem of his countrymen was at least not disqualified by law for public trust five hundred forty nine But these concessions were meant only to blind the Lords and the nation to the King s real designs He had secretly determined that even in this extremity he would yield nothing On the very day on which he issued the proclamation of amnesty he fully explained his intentions to Barillon This negotiation said James is a mere feint I must send commissioners to my nephew that I may gain time to ship off my wife and the Prince of Wales You know the temper of my troops None but the Irish will stand by me and the Irish are not in sufficient force to resist the enemy A Parliament would impose on me conditions which I could not endure I should be forced to undo all that I have done for the Catholics and to break with the King of France As soon therefore as the Queen and my child are safe I will leave England and tale refuge in Ireland in Scotland or with your master five hundred fifty Already James had made preparations for carrying this scheme into effect Dover had been sent to Portsmouth with instructions to take charge of the Prince of Wales and Dartmouth who commanded the fleet there had been ordered to obey Dover s directions in all things concerning the royal infant and to have a yacht manned by trusty sailors in readiness to sail for France at a moment s notice five hundred fifty one The King now sent positive orders that the child should instantly be conveyed to the nearest continental port five hundred fifty two Next to the Prince of Wales the chief object of anxiety was the Great Seal To that symbol of kingly authority our jurists have always ascribed a peculiar and almost mysterious importance It is held that if the Keeper of the Seal should affix it without taking the royal pleasure to a patent of peerage or to a pardon though he may be guilty of a high offence the instrument cannot be questioned by any court of law and can be annulled only by an Act of Parliament James seems to have been afraid that his enemies might get this organ of his will into their hands and might thus give a legal validity to acts which might affect him injuriously Nor will his apprehensions be thought unreasonable when it is remembered that exactly a hundred years later the Great Seal of a King was used with the assent of Lords and Commons and with the approbation of many great statesmen and lawyers for the purpose of transferring his prerogatives to his son Lest the talisman which possessed such formidable powers should be abused James determined that it should be kept within a few yards of his own closet Jeffreys was therefore ordered to quit the costly mansion which he had lately built in Duke Street and to take up his residence in a small apartment at Whitehall five hundred fifty three The King had made all his preparations for flight when an unexpected impediment compelled him to postpone the execution of his design His agents at Portsmouth began to entertain scruples Even Dover though a member of the Jesuitical cabal showed signs of hesitation Dartmouth was still less disposed to comply with the royal wishes He had hitherto been faithful to the throne and had done all that he could do with a disaffected fleet and in the face of an adverse wind to prevent the Dutch from landing in England but he was a zealous member of the Established Church and was by no means friendly to the policy of that government which he thought himself bound in duty and honour to defend The mutinous tamper of the officers and men under his command had caused him much anxiety and he had been greatly relieved by the news that a free Parliament had been convoked and that Commissioners had been named to treat with the Prince of Orange The joy was clamorous throughout the fleet An address warmly thanking the King for these gracious concessions to public feeling was drawn up on board of the flag ship The Admiral signed first Thirty eight Captains wrote their names under his This paper on its way to Whitehall crossed the messenger who brought to Portsmouth the order that the Prince of Wales should instantly be conveyed to France Dartmouth learned with bitter grief and resentment that the free Parliament the general amnesty the negotiation were all parts of a great fraud on the nation and that in this fraud he was expected to be an accomplice In a pathetic and manly letter he declared that he had already carried his obedience to the farthest point to which a Protestant and an Englishman could go To put the heir apparent of the British crown into the hands of Lewis would be nothing less than treason against the monarchy The nation already too much alienated from the Sovereign would be roused to madness The Prince of Wales would either not return at all or would return attended by a French army If His Royal Highness remained in the island the worst that could be apprehended was that he would be brought up a member of the national Church and that he might be so brought up ought to be the prayer of every loyal subject Dartmouth concluded by declaring that he would risk his life in defence of the throne but that he would be no party to the transporting of the Prince into France five hundred fifty four This letter deranged all the projects of James He learned too that he could not on this occasion expect from his Admiral even passive obedience For Dartmouth had gone so far as to station several sloops at the mouth of the harbour of Portsmouth with orders to suffer no vessel to pass out unexamined A change of plan was necessary The child must be brought back to London and sent thence to France An interval of some days must elapse before this could be done During that interval the public mind must be amused by the hope of a Parliament and the semblance of a negotiation Writs were sent out for the elections Trumpeters went backward and forward between the capital and the Dutch headquarters At length passes for the king s Commissioners arrived and the three Lords set out on their embassy They left the capital in a state of fearful distraction The passions which during three troubled years had been gradually gathering force now emancipated from the restraint of fear and stimulated by victory and sympathy showed themselves without disguise even in the precincts of the royal dwelling The grand jury of Middlesex found a bill against the Earl of Salisbury for turning Papist five hundred fifty five The Lord Mayor ordered the houses of the Roman Catholics of the City to be searched for arms The mob broke into the house of one respectable merchant who held the unpopular faith in order to ascertain whether he had not run a mine from his cellars under the neighbouring parish church for the purpose of blowing up parson and congregation five hundred fifty six The hawkers bawled about the streets a hue and cry after Father Petre who had withdrawn himself and not before it was time from his apartments in the palace five hundred fifty seven Wharton s celebrated song with many additional verses was chaunted more loudly than ever in all the streets of the capital The very sentinels who guarded the palace hummed as they paced their rounds The English confusion to Popery drink Lillibullero bullen a la The secret presses of London worked without ceasing Many papers daily came into circulation by means which the magistracy could not discover or would not check One of these has been preserved from oblivion by the skilful audacity with which it was written and by the immense effect which it produced It purported to be a supplemental declaration under the hand and seal of the Prince of Orange but it was written in a style very different from that of his genuine manifesto Vengeance alien from the usages of Christian and civilised nations was denounced against all Papists who should dare to espouse the royal cause They should be treated not as soldiers or gentlemen but as freebooters The ferocity and licentiousness of the invading army which had hitherto been restrained with a strong hand should be let loose on them Good Protestants and especially those who inhabited the capital were adjured as they valued all that was dear to them and commanded on peril of the Prince s highest displeasure to seize disarm and imprison their Roman Catholic neighbours This document it is said was found by a Whig bookseller one morning under his shop door He made haste to print it Many copies were dispersed by the post and passed rapidly from hand to hand Discerning men had no difficulty in pronouncing it a forgery devised by some unquiet and unprincipled adventurer such as in troubled times are always busy in the foulest and darkest offices of faction But the multitude was completely duped Indeed to such a height had national and religious feeling been excited against the Irish Papists that most of those who believed the spurious proclamation to be genuine were inclined to applaud it as a seasonable exhibition of vigour When it was known that no such document had really proceeded from William men asked anxiously what impostor had so daringly and so successfully personated his Highness Some suspected Ferguson others Johnson At length after the lapse of twenty seven years Hugh Speke avowed the forgery and demanded from the House of Brunswick a reward for so eminent a service rendered to the Protestant religion He asserted in the tone of a man who conceives himself to have done something eminently virtuous and honourable that when the Dutch invasion had thrown Whitehall into consternation he had offered his services to the court had pretended to be estranged from the Whigs and had promised to act as a spy upon them that he had thus obtained admittance to the royal closet had vowed fidelity had been promised large pecuniary rewards and had procured blank passes which enabled him to travel backwards and forwards across the hostile lines All these things he protested that he had done solely in order that he might unsuspected aim a deadly blow at the government and produce a violent outbreak of popular feeling against the Roman Catholics The forged proclamation he claimed as one of his contrivances but whether his claim were well founded may be doubted He delayed to make it so long that we may reasonably suspect him of having waited for the death of those who could confute him and he produced no evidence but his own five hundred fifty eight While these things happened in London every post from every part of the country brought tidings of some new insurrection Lumley had seized Newcastle The inhabitants had welcomed him with transport The statue of the King which stood on a lofty pedestal of marble had been pulled down and hurled into the Tyne The third of December was long remembered at Hull as the town taking day That place had a garrison commanded by Lord Langdale a Roman Catholic The Protestant officers concerted with the magistracy a plan of revolt Langdale and his adherents were arrested and soldiers and citizens united in declaring for the Protestant religion and a free Parliament five hundred fifty nine The Pastern Counties were up The Duke of Norfolk attended by three hundred gentlemen armed and mounted appeared in the stately marketplace of Norwich The Mayor and Aldermen met him there and engaged to stand by him against Popery and arbitrary power five hundred sixty Lord Herbert of Cherbury and Sir Edward Harley took up arms in Worcestershire five hundred sixty one Bristol the second city of the realm opened its gates to Shrewsbury Trelawney the Bishop who had entirely unlearned in the Tower the doctrine of nonresistance was the first to welcome the Prince s troops Such was the temper of the inhabitants that it was thought unnecessary to leave any garrison among them five hundred sixty two The people of Gloucester rose and delivered Lovelace from confinement An irregular army soon gathered round him Some of his horsemen had only halters for bridles Many of his infantry had only clubs for weapons But this force such as it was marched unopposed through counties once devoted to the House of Stuart and at length entered Oxford in triumph The magistrates came in state to welcome the insurgents The University itself exasperated by recent injuries was little disposed to pass censures on rebellion Already some of the Heads of Houses had despatched one of their number to assure the Prince of Orange that they were cordially with him and that they would gladly coin their plate for his service The Whig chief therefore rode through the capital of Toryism amidst general acclamation Before him the drums beat Lillibullero Behind him came a long stream of horse and foot The whole High Street was gay with orange ribands For already the orange riband had the double signification which after the lapse of one hundred and sixty years it still retains Already it was the emblem to the Protestant Englishman of civil and religious freedom to the Roman Catholic Celt of subjugation and persecution five hundred sixty three While foes were thus rising up all round the King friends were fast shrinking from his side The idea of resistance had become familiar to every mind Many who had been struck with horror when they heard of the first defections now blamed themselves for having been so slow to discern the signs of the times There was no longer any difficulty or danger in repairing to William The King in calling on the nation to elect representatives had by implication authorised all men to repair to the places where they had votes or interest and many of those places were already occupied by invaders or insurgents Clarendon eagerly caught at this opportunity of deserting the falling cause He knew that his speech in the Council of Peers had given deadly offence and he was mortified by finding that he was not to be one of the royal Commissioners He had estates in Wiltshire He determined that his son the son of whom he had lately spoken with grief and horror should be a candidate for that county and under pretence of looking after the election he set out for the West He was speedily followed by the Earl of Oxford and by others who had hitherto disclaimed all connection with the Prince s enterprise five hundred sixty four By this time the invaders steadily though slowly advancing were within seventy miles of London Though midwinter was approaching the weather was fine the way was pleasant and the turf of Salisbury Plain seemed luxuriously smooth to men who had been toiling through the miry ruts of the Devonshire and Somersetshire highways The route of the army lay close by Stonehenge and regiment after regiment halted to examine that mysterious ruin celebrated all over the Continent as the greatest wonder of our island William entered Salisbury with the same military pomp which he had displayed at Exeter and was lodged there in the palace which the King had occupied a few days before five hundred sixty five His train was now swelled by the Earls of Clarendon and Oxford and by other men of high rank who had till within a few days been considered as jealous Royalists Van Citters also made his appearance at the Dutch head quarters He had been during some weeks almost a prisoner in his house near Whitehall under the constant observation of relays of spies Yet in spite of those spies or perhaps by their help he had succeeded in obtaining full and accurate intelligence of all that passed in the palace and now full fraught wrath valuable information about men and things he came to assist the deliberations of William five hundred sixty six Thus far the Prince s enterprise had prospered beyond the anticipations of the most sanguine And now according to the general law which governs human affairs prosperity began to produce disunion The Englishmen assembled at Salisbury were divided into two parties One party consisted of Whigs who had always regarded the doctrines of passive obedience and of indefeasible hereditary right as slavish superstitions Many of them had passed years in exile All had been long shut out from participation to the favours of the crown They now exulted in the near prospect of greatness and of vengeance Burning with resentment flushed with victory and hope they would hear of no compromise Nothing less than the deposition of their enemy would content them nor can it be disputed that herein they were perfectly consistent They had exerted themselves nine years earlier to exclude him from the throne because they thought it likely that he would be a bad King It could therefore scarcely be expected that they would willingly leave him on the throne now that he had turned out a far worse King than any reasonable man could have anticipated On the other hand not a few of William s followers were zealous Tories who had till very recently held the doctrine of nonresistance in the most absolute form but whose faith in that doctrine had for a moment given way to the strong passions excited by the ingratitude of the King and by the peril of the Church No situation could be more painful or perplexing than that of the old Cavalier who found himself in arms against the throne The scruples which had not prevented him from repairing to the Dutch camp began to torment him cruelly as soon as he was there His mind misgave him that he had committed a crime At all events he had exposed himself to reproach by acting in diametrical opposition to the professions of his whole life He felt insurmountable disgust for his new allies They were people whom ever since he could remember he had been reviling and persecuting Presbyterians Independents Anabaptists old soldiers of Cromwell brisk boys of Shaftesbury accomplices in the Rye House Plot captains of the Western Insurrection He naturally wished to find out some salvo which might sooth his conscience which might vindicate his consistency and which might put a distinction between him and the crew of schismatical rebels whom he had always despised and abhorred but with whom he was now in danger of being confounded He therefore disclaimed with vehemence all thought of taking the crown from that anointed head which the ordinance of heaven and the fundamental laws of the realm had made sacred His dearest wish was to see a reconciliation effected on terms which would not lower the royal dignity He was no traitor He was not in truth resisting the kingly authority He was in arms only because he was convinced that the best service which could be rendered to the throne was to rescue His Majesty by a little gentle coercion from the hands of wicked counsellors The evils which the mutual animosity of these factions tended to produce were to a great extent averted by the ascendency and by the wisdom of the Prince Surrounded by eager disputants officious advisers abject flatterers vigilant spies malicious talebearers he remained serene and inscrutable He preserved silence while silence was possible When he was forced to speak the earnest and peremptory tone in which he uttered his well weighed opinions soon silenced everybody else Whatever some of his too zealous adherents might say he uttered not a word indicating any design on the English crown He was doubtless well aware that between him and that crown were still interposed obstacles which no prudence might be able to surmount and which a single false step would make insurmountable His only chance of obtaining the splendid prize was not to seize it rudely but to wait till without any appearance of exertion or stratagem on his part his secret wish should be accomplished by the force of circumstances by the blunders of his opponents and by the free choice of the Estates of the Realm Those who ventured to interrogate him learned nothing and yet could not accuse him of shuffling He quietly referred them to his Declaration and assured them that his views had undergone no change since that instrument had been drawn up So skilfully did he manage his followers that their discord seems rather to have strengthened than to have weakened his hands but it broke forth with violence when his control was withdrawn interrupted the harmony of convivial meetings and did not respect even the sanctity of the house of God Clarendon who tried to hide from others and from himself by an ostentatious display of loyal sentiments the plain fact that he was a rebel was shocked to hear some of his new associates laughing over their wine at the royal amnesty which had just been graciously offered to them They wanted no pardon they said They would make the King ask pardon before they had done with him Still more alarming and disgusting to every good Tory was an incident which happened at Salisbury Cathedral As soon as the officiating minister began to read the collect for the King Barnet among whose many good qualities selfcommand and a fine sense of the becoming cannot be reckoned rose from his knees sate down in his stall and uttered some contemptuous noises which disturbed the devotions of the congregation five hundred sixty seven In a short time the factions which divided the Prince s camp had an opportunity of measuring their strength The royal Commissioners were on their way to him Several days had elapsed since they had been appointed and it was thought strange that in a case of such urgency there should be such delay But in truth neither James nor William was desirous that negotiations should speedily commence for James wished only to gain time sufficient for sending his wife and son into prance and the position of William became every day more commanding At length the Prince caused it to be notified to the Commissioners that he would meet them at Hungerford He probably selected this place because lying at an equal distance from Salisbury and from Oxford it was well situated for a rendezvous of his most important adherents At Salisbury were those noblemen and gentlemen who had accompanied him from Holland or had joined him in the West and at Oxford were many chiefs of the Northern insurrection Late on Thursday the sixth of December he reached Hungerford The little town was soon crowded with men of rank and note who came thither from opposite quarters The Prince was escorted by a strong body of troops The northern Lords brought with them hundreds of irregular cavalry whose accoutrements and horsemanship moved the mirth of men accustomed to the splendid aspect and exact movements of regular armies five hundred sixty eight While the Prince lay at Hungerford a sharp encounter took place between two hundred and fifty of his troops and six hundred Irish who were posted at Reading The superior discipline of the invaders was signally proved on this occasion Though greatly outnumbered they at one onset drove the King s forces in confusion through the streets of the town into the market place There the Irish attempted to rally but being vigorously attacked in front and fired upon at the same time by the inhabitants from the windows of the neighbouring houses they soon lost hart and fled with the loss of them colours and of fifty men Of the conquerors only five fell The satisfaction which this news gave to the Lords and gentlemen who had joined William was unmixed There was nothing in what had happened to gall their national feelings The Dutch had not beaten the English but had assisted an English town to free itself from the insupportable dominion of the Irish five hundred sixty nine On the morning of Saturday the eighth of December the King s Commissioners reached Hungerford The Prince s body guard was drawn up to receive them with military respect Bentinck welcomed them and proposed to conduct them immediately to his master They expressed a hope that the Prince would favour them with a private audience but they were informed that he had resolved to hear them and answer them in public They were ushered into his bedchamber where they found him surrounded by a crowd of noblemen and gentlemen Halifax whose rank age and abilities entitled him to precedence was spokesman The proposition which the Commissioners had been instructed to make was that the points in dispute should be referred to the Parliament for which the writs were already sealing and that in the mean time the Prince s army would not come within thirty or forty miles of London Halifax having explained that this was the basis on which he and his colleagues were prepared to treat put into William s hands a letter from the King and retired William opened the letter and seemed unusually moved It was the first letter which he had received from his father in law since they had become avowed enemies Once they had been on good terms and had written to each other familiarly nor had they even when they had begun to regard each other with suspicion and aversion banished from their correspondence those forms of kindness which persons nearly related by blood and marriage commonly use The letter which the Commissioners had brought was drawn up by a secretary in diplomatic form and in the French language I have had many letters from the King said William but they were all in English and in his own hand He spoke with a sensibility which he was little in the habit of displaying Perhaps he thought at that moment how much reproach his enterprise just beneficent and necessary as it was must bring on him and on the wife who was devoted to him Perhaps he repined at the hard fate which had placed him in such a situation that he could fulfil his public duties only by breaking through domestic ties and envied the happier condition of those who are not responsible for the welfare of nations and Churches But such thoughts if they rose in his mind were firmly suppressed He requested the Lords and gentlemen whom he had convoked on this occasion to consult together unrestrained by his presence as to the answer which ought to be returned To himself however he reserved the power of deciding in the last resort after hearing their opinion He then left them and retired to Littlecote Hall a manor house situated about two miles off and renowned down to our own times not more on account of its venerable architecture and furniture than an account of a horrible and mysterious crime which was perpetrated there in the days of the Tudors five hundred seventy Before he left Hungerford he was told that Halifax had expressed a great desire to see Burnet In this desire there was nothing strange for Halifax and Burnet had long been on terms of friendship No two men indeed could resemble each other less Burnet was utterly destitute of delicacy and tact Halifax s taste was fastidious and his sense of the ludicrous morbidly quick Burnet viewed every act and every character through a medium distorted and coloured by party spirit The tendency of Halifax s mind was always to see the faults of his allies more strongly than the faults of his opponents Burnet was with all his infirmities and through all the vicissitudes of a life passed in circumstances not very favourable to piety a sincerely pious man The sceptical and sarcastic Halifax lay under the imputation of infidelity Halifax therefore often incurred Burnet s indignant censure and Burnet was often the butt of Halifax s keen and polished pleasantry Yet they were drawn to each other by a mutual attraction liked each other s conversation appreciated each other s abilities interchanged opinions freely and interchanged also good offices in perilous times It was not however merely from personal regard that Halifax now wished to see his old acquaintance The Commissioners must have been anxious to know what was the Prince s real aim He had refused to see them in private and little could be learned from what he might say in a formal and public interview Almost all those who were admitted to his confidence were men taciturn and impenetrable as himself Burnet was the only exception He was notoriously garrulous and indiscreet Yet circumstances had made it necessary to trust him and he would doubtless under the dexterous management of Halifax have poured out secrets as fast as words William knew this well and when he was informed that Halifax was asking for the Doctor could not refrain from exclaiming If they get together there will be fine tattling Burnet was forbidden to see the Commissioners in private but he was assured in very courteous terms that his fidelity was regarded by the Prince as above all suspicion and that there might be no ground for complaint the prohibition was made general That afternoon the noblemen and gentlemen whose advice William had asked met in the great room of the principal inn at Hungerford Oxford was placed in the chair and the King s overtures were taken into consideration It soon appeared that the assembly was divided into two parties a party anxious to come to terms with the King and a party bent on his destruction The latter party had the numerical superiority but it was observed that Shrewsbury who of all the English nobles was supposed to enjoy the largest share of William s confidence though a Whig sided on this occasion with the Tories After much altercation the question was put The majority was for rejecting the proposition which the royal Commissioners had been instructed to make The resolution of the assembly was reported to the Prince at Littlecote On no occasion during the whole course of his eventful life did he show more prudence and selfcommand He could not wish the negotiation to succeed But he was far too wise a man not to know that if unreasonable demands made by him should cause it to fail public feeling would no longer be on his side He therefore overruled the opinion of his too eager followers and declared his determination to treat on the basis proposed by the King Many of the Lords and gentlemen assembled at Hungerford remonstrated a whole day was spent in bickering but William s purpose was immovable He declared himself willing to refer all the questions in dispute to the Parliament which had just been summoned and not to advance within forty miles of London On his side he made some demands which even those who were least disposed to commend him allowed to be moderate He insisted that the existing statutes should be obeyed till they should be altered by competent authority and that all persons who held offices without a legal qualification should be forthwith dismissed The deliberations of the Parliament he justly conceived could not be free if it was to sit surrounded by Irish regiments while he and his army lay at a distance of several marches He therefore thought it reasonable that since his troops were not to advance within forty miles of London on the west the King s troops should fall back as far to the east There would thus be round the spot where the Houses were to meet a wide circle of neutral ground Within that circle indeed there were two fastnesses of great importance to the people of the capital the Tower which commanded their dwellings and Tilbury Fort which commanded their maritime trade It was impossible to leave these places ungarrisoned William therefore proposed that they should be temporarily entrusted to the care of the City of London It might possibly be convenient that when the Parliament assembled the King should repair to Westminster with a body guard The Prince announced that in that case he should claim the right of repairing thither also with an equal number of soldiers It seemed to him just that while military operations were suspended both the armies should be considered as alike engaged in the service of the English nation and should be alike maintained out of the English revenue Lastly he required some guarantee that the King would not take advantage of the armistice for the purpose of introducing a French force into England The point where there was most danger was Portsmouth The Prince did not however insist that this important fortress should be delivered up to him but proposed that it should during the truce be under the government of an officer in whom both himself and James could confide The propositions of William were framed with a punctilious fairness such as might have been expected rather from a disinterested umpire pronouncing an award than from a victorious prince dictating to a helpless enemy No fault could be found with them by the partisans of the King But among the Whigs there was much murmuring They wanted no reconciliation with their old master They thought themselves absolved from all allegiance to him They were not disposed to recognise the authority of a Parliament convoked by his writ They were averse to an armistice and they could not conceive why if there was to be an armistice it should be an armistice on equal terms By all the laws of war the stronger party had a right to take advantage of his strength and what was there in the character of James to justify any extraordinary indulgence Those who reasoned thus little knew from how elevated a point of view and with how discerning an eye the leader whom they censured contemplated the whole situation of England and Europe They were eager to ruin James and would therefore either have refused to treat with him on any conditions or have imposed on him conditions insupportably hard To the success of William s vast and profound scheme of policy it was necessary that James should ruin himself by rejecting conditions ostentatiously liberal The event proved the wisdom of the course which the majority of the Englishmen at Hungerford were inclined to condemn On Sunday the ninth of December the Prince s demands were put in writing and delivered to Halifax The Commissioners dined at Littlecote A splendid assemblage had been invited to meat them The old hall hung with coats of mail which had seen the wars of the Roses and with portraits of gallants who had adorned the court of Philip and Nary was now crowded with Peers and Generals In such a throng a short question and answer might be exchanged without attracting notice Halifax seized this opportunity the first which had presented itself of extracting all that Burnet knew or thought What is it that you want said the dexterous diplomatist do you wish to get the King into your power Not at all said Burnet we would not do the least harm to his person And if he were to go away said Halifax There is nothing said Burnet so much to be wished There can be no doubt that Burnet expressed the general sentiment of the Whigs in the Prince s camp They were all desirous that James should fly from the country but only a few of the wisest among them understood how important it was that his flight should be ascribed by the nation to his own folly and perverseness and not to harsh usage and well grounded apprehension It seems probable that even in the extremity to which he was now reduced all his enemies united would have been unable to effect his complete overthrow had he not been his own worst enemy but while his Commissioners were labouring to save him he was labouring as earnestly to make all their efforts useless five hundred seventy one His plans were at length ripe for execution The pretended negotiation had answered its purpose On the same day on which the three Lords reached Hungerford the Prince of Wales arrived at Westminster It had been intended that he should come over London Bridge and some Irish troops were sent to Southwark to meet him But they were received by a great multitude with such hooting and execration that they thought it advisable to retire with all speed The poor child crossed the Thames at Kingston and was brought into Whitehall so privately that many believed him to be still at Portsmouth five hundred seventy two To send him and the Queen out of the country without delay was now the first object of James But who could be trusted to manage the escape Dartmouth was the most loyal of Protestant Tories and Dartmouth had refused Dover was a creature of the Jesuits and even Dover had hesitated It was not very easy to find an Englishman of rank and honour who would undertake to place the heir apparent of the English crown in the hands of the King of France In these circumstances James bethought him of a French nobleman who then resided in London Antonine Count of Lauzun Of this man it has been said that his life was stranger than the dreams of other people At an early age he had been the intimate associate of Lewis and had been encouraged to expect the highest employments under the French crown Then his fortunes had undergone an eclipse Lewis had driven from him the friend of his youth with bitter reproaches and had it was said scarcely refrained from adding blows The fallen favourite had been sent prisoner to a fortress but he had emerged from his confinement had again enjoyed the smiles of his master and had gained the heart of one of the greatest ladies in Europe Anna Maria daughter of Gaston Duke of Orleans granddaughter of King Henry the Fourth and heiress of the immense domains of the house of Montpensier The lovers were bent on marriage The royal consent was obtained During a few hours Lauzun was regarded by the court as an adopted member of the house of Bourbon The portion which the princess brought with her might well have been an object of competition to sovereigns three great dukedoms an independent principality with its own mint and with its own tribunals and an income greatly exceeding the whole revenue of the kingdom of Scotland But this splendid prospect had been overcast The match had been broken off The aspiring suitor had been during many years shut up in an Alpine castle At length Lewis relented Lauzun was forbidden to appear in the royal presence but was allowed to enjoy liberty at a distance from the court He visited England and was well received at the palace of James and in the fashionable circles of London for in that age the gentlemen of France were regarded throughout Europe as models of grace and many Chevaliers and Viscounts who had never been admitted to the interior circle at Versailles found themselves objects of general curiosity and admiration at Whitehall Lauzun was in every respect the man for the present emergency He had courage and a sense of honour had been accustomed to eccentric adventures and with the keen observation and ironical pleasantry of a finished man of the world had a strong propensity to knight errantry All his national feelings and all his personal interests impelled him to undertake the adventure from which the most devoted subjects of the English crown seemed to shrink As the guardian at a perilous crisis of the Queen of Great Britain and of the Prince of Wales he might return with honour to his native land he might once more be admitted to see Lewis dress and dine and might after so many vicissitudes recommence in the decline of life the strangely fascinating chase of royal favour Animated by such feelings Lauzun eagerly accepted the high trust which was offered to him The arrangements for the flight were promptly made a vessel was ordered to be in readiness at Gravesend but to reach Gravesend was not easy The City was in a state of extreme agitation The slightest cause sufficed to bring a crowd together No foreigner could appear in the streets without risk of being stopped questioned and carried before a magistrate as a Jesuit in disguise It was therefore necessary to take the road on the south of the Thames No precaution which could quiet suspicion was omitted The King and Queen retired to rest as usual When the palace had been some time profoundly quiet James rose and called a servant who was in attendance You will find said the King a man at the door of the antechamber bring him hither The servant obeyed and Lauzun was ushered into the royal bedchamber I confide to you said James my Queen and my son everything must be risked to carry them into France Lauzun with a truly chivalrous spirit returned thanks for the dangerous honour which had been conferred on him and begged permission to avail himself of the assistance of his friend Saint Victor a gentleman of Provence whose courage and faith had been often tried The services of so valuable an assistant were readily accepted Lauzun gave his hand to Mary Saint Victor wrapped up in his warm cloak the ill fated heir of so many Kings The party stole down the back stairs and embarked in an open skiff It was a miserable voyage The night was bleak the rain fell the wind roared the waves were rough at length the boat reached Lambeth and the fugitives landed near an inn where a coach and horses were in waiting Some time elapsed before the horses could be harnessed Mary afraid that her face might be known would not enter the house She remained with her child cowering for shelter from the storm under the tower of Lambeth Church and distracted by terror whenever the ostler approached her with his lantern Two of her women attended her one who gave suck to the Prince and one whose office was to rock his cradle but they could be of little use to their mistress for both were foreigners who could hardly speak the English language and who shuddered at the rigour of the English climate The only consolatory circumstance was that the little boy was well and uttered not a single cry At length the coach was ready Saint Victor followed it on horseback The fugitives reached Gravesend safely and embarked in the yacht which waited for them They found there Lord Powis and his wife Three Irish officers were also on board These men had been sent thither in order that they might assist Lauzun in any desperate emergency for it was thought not impossible that the captain of the ship might prove false and it was fully determined that on the first suspicion of treachery he should be stabbed to the heart There was however no necessity for violence The yacht proceeded down the river with a fair wind and Saint Victor having seen her under sail spurred back with the good news to Whitehall five hundred seventy three On the morning of Monday the tenth of December the King learned that his wife and son had begun their voyage with a fair prospect of reaching their destination About the same time a courier arrived at the palace with despatches from Hungerford Had James been a little more discerning or a little less obstinate those despatches would have induced him to reconsider all his plans The Commissioners wrote hopefully The conditions proposed by the conqueror were strangely liberal The King himself could not refrain from exclaiming that they were more favourable than he could have expected He might indeed not unreasonably suspect that they had been framed with no friendly design but this mattered nothing for whether they were offered in the hope that by closing with them he would lay the ground for a happy reconciliation or as is more likely in the hope that by rejecting them he would exhibit himself to the whole nation as utterly unreasonable and incorrigible his course was equally clear In either case his policy was to accept them promptly and to observe them faithfully But it soon appeared that William had perfectly understood the character with which he had to deal and in offering those terms which the Whigs at Hungerford had censured as too indulgent had risked nothing The solemn farce by which the public had been amused since the retreat of the royal army from Salisbury was prolonged during a few hours All the Lords who were still in the capital were invited to the palace that they might be informed of the progress of the negotiation which had been opened by their advice Another meeting of Peers was appointed for the following day The Lord Mayor and the Sheriffs of London were also summoned to attend the King He exhorted them to perform their duties vigorously and owned that he had thought it expedient to send his wife and child out of the country but assured them that he would himself remain at his post While he uttered this unkingly and unmanly falsehood his fixed purpose was to depart before daybreak Already he had entrusted his most valuable moveables to the care of several foreign Ambassadors His most important papers had been deposited with the Tuscan minister But before the flight there was still something to be done The tyrant pleased himself with the thought that he might avenge himself on a people who had been impatient of his despotism by inflicting on them at parting all the evils of anarchy He ordered the Great Seal and the writs for the new Parliament to be brought to his apartment The writs which could be found he threw into the fire Those which had been already sent out he annulled by an instrument drawn up in legal form To Feversham he wrote a letter which could be understood only as a command to disband the army Still however the King concealed his intention of absconding even from his chief ministers Just before he retired he directed Jeffreys to be in the closet early on the morrow and while stepping into bed whispered to Mulgrave that the news from Hungerford was highly satisfactory Everybody withdrew except the Duke of Northumberland This young man a natural son of Charles the Second by the Duchess of Cleveland commanded a troop of Life Guards and was a Lord of the Bedchamber It seems to have been then the custom of the court that in the Queen s absence a Lord of the Bedchamber should sleep on a pallet in the King s room and it was Northumberland s turn to perform this duty At three in the morning of Tuesday the eleventh of December James rose took the Great Seal in his hand laid his commands on Northumberland not to open the door of the bedchamber till the usual hour and disappeared through a secret passage the same passage probably through which Huddleston had been brought to the bedside of the late king Sir Edward Hales was in attendance with a hackney coach James was conveyed to Millbank where he crossed the Thames in a small wherry As he passed Lambeth he flung the Great Seal into the midst of the stream where after many months it was accidentally caught by a fishing net and dragged up At Vauxhall he landed A carriage and horses had been stationed there for him and he immediately took the road towards Sheerness where a boy belonging to the Custom House had been ordered to await his arrival five hundred seventy four CHAPTER X The Flight of James known great

the Security of Liberty Disputes and Compromise The Declaration of Right Arrival of Mary Tender and Acceptance of the Crown William and Mary proclaimed peculiar Character of the English Revolution NORTHUMBERLAND strictly obeyed the injunction which had been laid on him and did not open the door of the royal apartment till it was broad day The antechamber was filled with courtiers who came to make their morning bow and with Lords who had been summoned to Council The news of James s flight passed in an instant from the galleries to the streets and the whole capital was in commotion It was a terrible moment The King was gone The Prince had not arrived No Regency had been appointed The Great Seal essential to the administration of ordinary justice had disappeared It was soon known that Feversham had on the receipt of the royal order instantly disbanded his forces What respect for law or property was likely to be found among soldiers armed and congregated emancipated from the restraints of discipline and destitute of the necessaries of life On the other hand the populace of London had during some weeks shown a strong disposition to turbulence and rapine The urgency of the crisis united for a short time all who had any interest in the peace of society Rochester had till that day adhered firmly to the royal cause He now saw that there was only one way of averting general confusion Call your troop of Guards together he said to Northumberland and declare for the Prince of Orange The advice was promptly followed The principal officers of the army who were then in London held a meeting at Whitehall and resolved that they would submit to William s authority and would till his pleasure should be known keep their men together and assist the civil power to preserve order five hundred seventy five The Peers repaired to Guildhall and were received there with all honour by the magistracy of the city In strictness of law they were no better entitled than any other set of persons to assume the executive administration But it was necessary to the public safety that there should be a provisional government and the eyes of men naturally turned to the hereditary magnates of the realm The extremity of the danger drew Sancroft forth from his palace He took the chair and under his presidency the new Archbishop of York five Bishops and twenty two temporal Lords determined to draw up subscribe and publish a Declaration By this instrument they declared that they were firmly attached to the religion and constitution of their country and that they had cherished the hope of seeing grievances redressed and tranquillity restored by the Parliament which the King had lately summoned but that this hope had been extinguished by his flight They had therefore determined to join with the Prince of Orange in order that the freedom of the nation might be vindicated that the rights of the Church might be secured that a just liberty of conscience might be given to Dissenters and that the Protestant interest throughout the world might be strengthened Till His Highness should arrive they were prepared to take on themselves the responsibility of giving such directions as might be necessary for the preservation of order A deputation was instantly sent to lay this Declaration before the Prince and to inform him that he was impatiently expected in London five hundred seventy six The Lords then proceeded to deliberate on the course which it was necessary to take for the prevention of tumult They sent for the two Secretaries of State Middleton refused to submit to what he regarded as an usurped authority but Preston astounded by his master s flight and not knowing what to expect or whither to turn obeyed the summons A message was sent to Skelton who was Lieutenant of the Tower requesting his attendance at Guildhall He came and was told that his services were no longer wanted and that he must instantly deliver up his keys He was succeeded by Lord Lucas At the same time the Peers ordered a letter to be written to Dartmouth enjoining him to refrain from all hostile operations against the Dutch fleet and to displace all the Popish officers who held commands under him five hundred seventy seven The part taken in these proceedings by Sancroft and by some other persons who had up to that day been strictly faithful to the principle of passive obedience deserves especial notice To usurp the command of the military and naval forces of the state to remove the officers whom the King had set over his castles and his ships and to prohibit his Admiral from giving battle to his enemies was surely nothing less than rebellion Yet several honest and able Tories of the school of Filmer persuaded themselves that they could do all these things without incurring the guilt of resisting their Sovereign The distinction which they took was at least ingenious Government they said is the ordinance of God Hereditary monarchical government is eminently the ordinance of God While the King commands what is lawful we must obey him actively When he commands what is unlawful we must obey him passively In no extremity are we justified in withstanding him by force But if he chooses to resign his office his rights over us are at an end While he governs us though he may govern us ill we are bound to submit but if he refuses to govern us at all we are not bound to remain for ever without a government Anarchy is not the ordinance of God nor will he impute it to us as a sin that when a prince whom in spite of extreme provocations we have never ceased to honour and obey has departed we know not whither leaving no vicegerent we take the only course which can prevent the entire dissolution of society Had our Sovereign remained among us we were ready little as he deserved our love to die at his feet Had he when he quitted us appointed a regency to govern us with vicarious authority during his absence to that regency alone should we have looked for direction But he has disappeared having made no provision for the preservation of order or the administration of justice With him and with his Great Seal has vanished the whole machinery by which a murderer can be punished by which the right to an estate can be decided by which the effects of a bankrupt can be distributed His last act has been to free thousands of armed men from the restraints of military discipline and to place them in such a situation that they must plunder or starve Yet a few hours and every man s hand will be against his neighbour Life property female honour will be at the mercy of every lawless spirit We are at this moment actually in that state of nature about which theorists have written so much and in that state we have been placed not by our fault but by the voluntary defection of him who ought to have been our protector His defection may be justly called voluntary for neither his life nor his liberty was in danger His enemies had just consented to treat with him on a basis proposed by himself and had offered immediately to suspend all hostile operations on conditions which he could not deny to be liberal In such circumstances it is that he has abandoned his trust We retract nothing We are in nothing inconsistent We still assert our old doctrines without qualification We still hold that it is in all cases sinful to resist the magistrate but we say that there is no longer any magistrate to resist He who was the magistrate after long abusing his powers has at last abdicated them The abuse did not give us a right to depose him but the abdication gives us a right to consider how we may best supply his place It was on these grounds that the Prince s party was now swollen by many adherents who had previously stood aloof from it Never within the memory of man had there been so near an approach to entire concord among all intelligent Englishmen as at this conjuncture and never had concord been more needed Legitimate authority there was none All those evil passions which it is the office of government to restrain and which the best governments restrain but imperfectly were on a sudden emancipated from control avarice licentiousness revenge the hatred of sect to sect the hatred of nation to nation On such occasions it will ever be found that the human vermin which neglected by ministers of state and ministers of religion barbarous in the midst of civilisation heathen in the midst of Christianity burrows among all physical and all moral pollution in the cellars and garrets of great cities will at once rise into a terrible importance So it was now in London When the night the longest night as it chanced of the year approached forth came from every den of vice from the bear garden at Hockley and from the labyrinth of tippling houses and brothels in the Friars thousands of housebreakers and highwaymen cutpurses and ringdroppers With these were mingled thousands of idle apprentices who wished merely for the excitement of a riot Even men of peaceable and honest habits were impelled by religious animosity to join the lawless part of the population For the cry of No Popery a cry which has more than once endangered the existence of London was the signal for outrage and rapine First the rabble fell on the Roman Catholic places of worship The buildings were demolished Benches pulpits confessionals breviaries were heaped up and set on fire A great mountain of books and furniture blazed on the site of the convent at Clerkenwell Another pile was kindled before the ruins of the Franciscan house in Lincoln s Inn Fields The chapel in Lime Street the chapel in Bucklersbury were pulled down The pictures images and crucifixes were carried along the streets in triumph amidst lighted tapers torn from the altars The procession bristled thick with swords and staves and on the point of every sword and of every staff was an orange The King s printing house whence had issued during the preceding three years innumerable tracts in defence of Papal supremacy image worship and monastic vows was to use a coarse metaphor which then for the first time came into use completely gutted The vast stock of paper much of which was still unpolluted by types furnished an immense bonfire From monasteries temples and public offices the fury of the multitude turned to private dwellings Several houses were pillaged and destroyed but the smallness of the booty disappointed the plunderers and soon a rumour was spread that the most valuable effects of the Papists had been placed under the care of the foreign Ambassadors To the savage and ignorant populace the law of nations and the risk of bringing on their country the just vengeance of all Europe were as nothing The houses of the Ambassadors were besieged A great crowd assembled before Barillon s door in saint James s Square He however fared better than might have been expected For though the government which he represented was held in abhorrence his liberal housekeeping and exact payments had made him personally popular Moreover he had taken the precaution of asking for a guard of soldiers and as several men of rank who hued near him had done the same a considerable force was collected in the Square The rioters therefore when they were assured that no arms or priests were concealed under his roof left him unmolested The Venetian Envoy was protected by a detachment of troops but the mansions occupied by the ministers of the Elector Palatine and of the Grand Duke of Tuscany were destroyed One precious box the Tuscan minister was able to save from the marauders It contained nine volumes of memoirs written in the hand of James himself These volumes reached France in safety and after the lapse of more than a century perished there in the havoc of a revolution far more terrible than that from which they had escaped But some fragments still remain and though grievously mutilated and imbedded in great masses of childish fiction well deserve to be attentively studied The rich plate of the Chapel Royal had been deposited at Wild House near Lincoln s Inn Fields the residence of the Spanish ambassador Ronquillo Ronquillo conscious that he and his court had not deserved ill of the English nation had thought it unnecessary to ask for soldiers but the mob was not in a mood to make nice distinctions The name of Spain had long been associated in the public mind with the Inquisition and the Armada with the cruelties of Mary and the plots against Elizabeth Ronquillo had also made himself many enemies among the common people by availing himself of his privilege to avoid the necessity of paying his debts His house was therefore sacked without mercy and a noble library which he had collected perished in the flames His only comfort was that the host in his chapel was rescued from the same fate five hundred seventy eight The morning of the twelfth of December rose on a ghastly sight The capital in many places presented the aspect of a city taken by storm The Lords met at Whitehall and exerted themselves to restore tranquillity The trainbands were ordered under arms A body of cavalry was kept in readiness to disperse tumultuous assemblages Such atonement as was at that moment possible was made for the gross insults which had been offered to foreign governments A reward was promised for the discovery of the property taken from Wild House and Ronquillo who had not a bed or an ounce of plate left was splendidly lodged in the deserted palace of the Kings of England A sumptuous table was kept for him and the yeomen of the guard were ordered to wait in his antechamber with the same observance which they were in the habit of paying to the Sovereign These marks of respect soothed even the punctilious pride of the Spanish court and averted all danger of a rupture five hundred seventy nine In spite however of the well meant efforts of the provisional government the agitation grew hourly more formidable It was heightened by an event which even at this distance of time can hardly be related without a feeling of vindictive pleasure A scrivener who lived at Wapping and whose trade was to furnish the seafaring men there with money at high interest had some time before lent a sum on bottomry The debtor applied to equity for relief against his own bond and the case came before Jeffreys The counsel for the borrower having little else to say said that the lender was a Trimmer The Chancellor instantly fired A Trimmer where is he Let me see him I have heard of that kind of monster What is it made like The unfortunate creditor was forced to stand forth The Chancellor glared fiercely on him stormed at him and sent him away half dead with fright While I live the poor man said as he tottered out of the court I shall never forget that terrible countenance And now the day of retribution had arrived The Trimmer was walking through Wapping when he saw a well known face looking out of the window of an alehouse He could not be deceived The eyebrows indeed had been shaved away The dress was that of a common sailor from Newcastle and was black with coal dust but there was no mistaking the savage eye and mouth of Jeffreys The alarm was given In a moment the house was surrounded by hundreds of people shaking bludgeons and bellowing curses The fugitive s life was saved by a company of the trainbands and he was carried before the Lord Mayor The Mayor was a simple man who had passed his whole life in obscurity and was bewildered by finding himself an important actor in a mighty revolution The events of the last twenty four hours and the perilous state of the city which was under his charge had disordered his mind and his body When the great man at whose frown a few days before the whole kingdom had trembled was dragged into the justice room begrimed with ashes half dead with fright and followed by a raging multitude the agitation of the unfortunate Mayor rose to the height He fell into fits and was carried to his bed whence he never rose Meanwhile the throng without was constantly becoming more numerous and more savage Jeffreys begged to be sent to prison An order to that effect was procured from the Lords who were sitting at Whitehall and he was conveyed in a carriage to the Tower Two regiments of militia were drawn out to escort him and found the duty a difficult one It was repeatedly necessary for them to form as if for the purpose of repelling a charge of cavalry and to present a forest of pikes to the mob The thousands who were disappointed of their revenge pursued the coach with howls of rage to the gate of the Tower brandishing cudgels and holding up halters full in the prisoner s view The wretched man meantime was in convulsions of terror He wrung his hands he looked wildly out sometimes at one window sometimes at the other and was heard even above the tumult crying Keep them off gentlemen For God s sake keep them off At length having suffered far more than the bitterness of death he was safely lodged in the fortress where some of his most illustrious victims had passed their last days and where his own life was destined to close in unspeakable ignominy and horror five hundred eighty All this time an active search was making after Roman Catholic priests Many were arrested Two Bishops Ellis and Leyburn were sent to Newgate The Nuncio who had little reason to expect that either his spiritual or his political character would be respected by the multitude made his escape disguised as a lacquey in the train of the minister of the Duke of Savoy five hundred eighty one Another day of agitation and terror closed and was followed by a night the strangest and most terrible that England had ever seen Early in the evening an attack was made by the rabble on a stately house which had been built a few months before for Lord Powis which in the reign of George the Second was the residence of the Duke of Newcastle and which is still conspicuous at the northwestern angle of Lincoln s Inn Fields Some troops were sent thither the mob was dispersed tranquillity seemed to be restored and the citizens were retiring quietly to their beds Just at this time arose a whisper which swelled fast into a fearful clamour passed in an hour from Piccadilly to Whitechapel and spread into every street and alley of the capital It was said that the Irish whom Feversham had let loose were marching on London and massacring every man woman and child on the road At one in the morning the drums of the militia beat to arms Everywhere terrified women were weeping and wringing their hands while their fathers and husbands were equipping themselves for fight Before two the capital wore a face of stern preparedness which might well have daunted a real enemy if such an enemy had been approaching Candles were blazing at all the windows The public places were as bright as at noonday All the great avenues were barricaded More than twenty thousand pikes and muskets lined the streets The late daybreak of the winter solstice found the whole City still in arms During many years the Londoners retained a vivid recollection of what they called the Irish Night When it was known that there had been no cause of alarm attempts were made to discover the origin of the rumour which had produced so much agitation It appeared that some persons who had the look and dress of clowns just arrived from the country had first spread the report in the suburbs a little before midnight but whence these men came and by whom they were employed remained a mystery And soon news arrived from many quarters which bewildered the public mind still more The panic had not been confined to London The cry that disbanded Irish soldiers were coming to murder the Protestants had with malignant ingenuity been raised at once in many places widely distant from each other Great numbers of letters skilfully framed for the purpose of frightening ignorant people had been sent by stage coaches by waggons and by the post to various parts of England All these letters came to hand almost at the same time In a hundred towns at once the populace was possessed with the belief that armed barbarians were at hand bent on perpetrating crimes as foul as those which had disgraced the rebellion of Ulster No Protestant would find mercy Children would be compelled by torture to murder their parents Babes would be stuck on pikes or flung into the blazing ruins of what had lately been happy dwellings Great multitudes assembled with weapons the people in some places began to pull down bridges and to throw up barricades but soon the excitement went down In many districts those who had been so foully imposed upon learned with delight alloyed by shame that there was not a single Popish soldier within a week s march There were places indeed where some straggling bands of Irish made their appearance and demanded food but it can scarcely be imputed to them as a crime that they did not choose to die of hunger and there is no evidence that they committed any wanton outrage In truth they were much less numerous than was commonly supposed and their spirit was cowed by finding themselves left on a sudden without leaders or provisions in the midst of a mighty population which felt towards them as men feel towards a drove of wolves Of all the subjects of James none had more reason to execrate him than these unfortunate members of his church and defenders of his throne five hundred eighty two It is honourable to the English character that notwithstanding the aversion with which the Roman Catholic religion and the Irish race were then regarded notwithstanding the anarchy which was the effect of the flight of James notwithstanding the artful machinations which were employed to scare the multitude into cruelty no atrocious crime was perpetrated at this conjuncture Much property indeed was destroyed and carried away The houses of many Roman Catholic gentlemen were attacked Parks were ravaged Deer were slain and stolen Some venerable specimens of the domestic architecture of the middle ages bear to this day the marks of popular violence The roads were in many places made impassable by a selfappointed police which stopped every traveller till he proved that he was not a Papist The Thames was infested by a set of pirates who under pretence of searching for arms or delinquents rummaged every boat that passed Obnoxious persons were insulted and hustled Many persons who were not obnoxious were glad to ransom their persons and effects by bestowing some guineas on the zealous Protestants who had without any legal authority assumed the office of inquisitors But in all this confusion which lasted several days and extended over many counties not a single Roman Catholic lost his life The mob showed no inclination to blood except in the case of Jeffreys and the hatred which that bad man inspired had more affinity with humanity than with cruelty five hundred eighty three Many years later Hugh Speke affirmed that the Irish Night was his work that he had prompted the rustics who raised London and that he was the author of the letters which had spread dismay through the country His assertion is not intrinsically improbable but it rests on no evidence except his own word He was a man quite capable of committing such a villany and quite capable also of falsely boasting that he had committed it five hundred eighty four At London William was impatiently expected for it was not doubted that his vigour and ability would speedily restore order and security There was however some delay for which the Prince cannot justly be blamed His original intention had been to proceed from Hungerford to Oxford where he was assured of an honourable and affectionate reception but the arrival of the deputation from Guildhall induced him to change his intention and to hasten directly towards the capital On the way he learned that Feversham in pursuance of the King s orders had dismissed the royal army and that thousands of soldiers freed from restraint and destitute of necessaries were scattered over the counties through which the road to London lay It was therefore impossible for William to proceed slenderly attended without great danger not only to his own person about which he was not much in the habit of being solicitous but also to the great interests which were under his care It was necessary that he should regulate his own movements by the movements of his troops and troops could then move but slowly over the highways of England in midwinter He was on this occasion a little moved from his ordinary composure I am not to be thus dealt with he exclaimed with bitterness and that my Lord Feversham shall find Prompt and judicious measures were taken to remedy the evils which James had caused Churchill and Grafton were entrusted with the task of reassembling the dispersed army and bringing it into order The English soldiers were invited to resume their military character The Irish were commanded to deliver up their arms on pain of being treated as banditti but were assured that if they would submit quietly they should be supplied with necessaries five hundred eighty five The Prince s orders were carried into effect with scarcely any opposition except from the Irish soldiers who had been in garrison at Tilbury One of these men snapped a pistol at Grafton It missed fire and the assassin was instantly shot dead by an Englishman About two hundred of the unfortunate strangers made a gallant attempt to return to their own country They seized a richly laden East Indiaman which had just arrived in the Thames and tried to procure pilots by force at Gravesend No pilot however was to be found and they were under the necessity of trusting to their own skill in navigation They soon ran their ship aground and after some bloodshed were compelled to lay down their arms five hundred eighty six William had now been five weeks on English ground and during the whole of that time his good fortune had been uninterrupted His own prudence and firmness had been conspicuously displayed and yet had done less for him than the folly and pusillanimity of others And now at the moment when it seemed that his plans were about to be crowned with entire success they were disconcerted by one of those strange incidents which so often confound the most exquisite devices of human policy On the morning of the thirteenth of December the people of London not yet fully recovered from the agitation of the Irish Night were surprised by a rumour that the King had been detained and was still in the island The report gathered strength during the day and was fully confirmed before the evening James had travelled with relays of coach horses along the southern shore of the Thames and on the morning of the twelfth had reached Emley Ferry near the island of Sheppey There lay the hoy in which he was to sail He went on board but the wind blew fresh and the master would not venture to put to sea without more ballast A tide was thus lost Midnight was approaching before the vessel began to float By that time the news that the King had disappeared that the country was without a government and that London was in confusion had travelled fast down the Thames and wherever it spread had produced outrage and misrule The rude fishermen of the Kentish coast eyed the hoy with suspicion and with cupidity It was whispered that some persons in the garb of gentlemen had gone on board of her in great haste Perhaps they were Jesuits perhaps they were rich Fifty or sixty boatmen animated at once by hatred of Popery and by love of plunder boarded the hoy just as she was about to make sail The passengers were told that they must go on shore and be examined by a magistrate The King s appearance excited suspicion It is Father Petre cried one ruffian I know him by his lean jaws Search the hatchet faced old Jesuit became the general cry He was rudely pulled and pushed about His money and watch were taken from him He had about him his coronation ring and some other trinkets of great value but these escaped the search of the robbers who indeed were so ignorant of jewellery that they took his diamond buckles for bits of glass At length the prisoners were put on shore and carried to an inn A crowd had assembled there to see them and James though disguised by a wig of different shape and colour from that which he usually wore was at once recognised For a moment the rabble seemed to be overawed but the exhortations of their chiefs revived their courage and the sight of Hales whom they well knew and bitterly hated inflamed their fury His park was in the neighbourhood and at that very moment a band of rioters was employed in pillaging his house and shooting his deer The multitude assured the King that they would not hurt him but they refused to let him depart It chanced that the Earl of Winchelsea a Protestant but a zealous royalist head of the Finch family and a near kinsman of Nottingham was then at Canterbury As soon as he learned what had happened he hastened to the coast accompanied by some Kentish gentlemen By their intervention the King was removed to a more convenient lodging but he was still a prisoner The mob kept constant watch round the house to which he had been carried and some of the ringleaders lay at the door of his bedroom His demeanour meantime was that of a man all the nerves of whose mind had been broken by the load of misfortunes Sometimes he spoke so haughtily that the rustics who had charge of him were provoked into making insolent replies Then he betook himself to supplication Let me go he cried get me a boat The Prince of Orange is hunting for my life If you do not let me fly now it will be too late My blood will be on your heads He that is not with me is against me On this last text he preached a sermon half an hour long He harangued on a strange variety of subjects on the disobedience of the fellows of Magdalene College on the miracles wrought by Saint Winifred s well on the disloyalty of the black coats and on the virtues of a piece of the true cross which he had unfortunately lost What have I done he demanded of the Kentish squires who attended him Tell me the truth What error have I committed Those to whom he put these questions were too humane to return the answer which must have risen to their lips and listened to his wild talk in pitying silence five hundred eighty seven When the news that he had been stopped insulted roughly handled and plundered and that he was still a prisoner in the hands of rude churls reached the capital many passions were roused Rigid Churchmen who had a few hours before begun to think that they were freed from their allegiance to him now felt misgivings He had not quitted his kingdom He had not consummated his abdication If he should resume his regal office could they on their principles refuse to pay him obedience Enlightened statesmen foresaw with concern that all the disputes which his flight had for a moment set at rest would be revived and exasperated by his return Some of the common people though still smarting from recent wrongs were touched with compassion for a great prince outraged by ruffians and were willing to entertain a hope more honourable to their good nature than to their discernment that he might even now repent of the errors which had brought on him so terrible a punishment From the moment when it was known that the King was still in England Sancroft who had hitherto acted as chief of the provisional government absented himself from the sittings of the Peers Halifax who had just returned from the Dutch head quarters was placed in the chair His sentiments had undergone a great change in a few hours Both public and private feelings now impelled him to join the Whigs Those who candidly examine the evidence which has come down to us will be of opinion that he accepted the office of royal Commissioner in the sincere hope of effecting an accommodation between the King and the Prince on fair terms The negotiation had commenced prosperously the Prince had offered terms which the King could not but acknowledge to be fair the eloquent and ingenious Trimmer might flatter himself that he should be able to mediate between infuriated factions to dictate a compromise between extreme opinions to secure the liberties and religion of his country without exposing her to the risks inseparable from a change of dynasty and a disputed succession While he was pleasing himself with thoughts so agreeable to his temper he learned that he had been deceived and had been used as an instrument for deceiving the nation His mission to Hungerford had been a fool s errand The King had never meant to abide by the terms which he had instructed his Commissioners to propose He had charged them to declare that he was willing to submit all the questions in dispute to the Parliament which he had summoned and while they were delivering his message he had burned the writs made away with the seal let loose the army suspended the administration of justice dissolved the government and fled from the capital Halifax saw that an amicable arrangement was no longer possible He also felt it may be suspected the vexation natural to a man widely renowned for wisdom who finds that he has been duped by an understanding immeasurably inferior to his own and the vexation natural to a great master of ridicule who finds himself placed in a ridiculous situation His judgment and his resentment alike induced him to relinquish the schemes of reconciliation on which he had hitherto been intent and to place himself at the head of those who were bent on raising William to the throne five hundred eighty eight A journal of what passed in the Council of Lords while Halifax presided is still extant in his own handwriting five hundred eighty nine No precaution which seemed necessary for the prevention of outrage and robbery was omitted The Peers took on themselves the responsibility of giving orders that if the rabble rose again the soldiers should fire with bullets Jeffreys was brought to Whitehall and interrogated as to what had become of the Great Seal and the writs At his own earnest request he was remanded to the Tower as the only place where his life could be safe and he retired thanking and blessing those who had given him the protection of a prison A Whig nobleman moved that Oates should be set at liberty but this motion was overruled five hundred ninety The business of the day was nearly over and Halifax was about to rise when he was informed that a messenger from Sheerness was in attendance No occurrence could be more perplexing or annoying To do anything to do nothing was to incur a grave responsibility Halifax wishing probably to obtain time for communication with the Prince would have adjourned the meeting but Mulgrave begged the Lords to keep their seats and introduced the messenger The man told his story with many tears and produced a letter written in the King s hand and addressed to no particular person but imploring the aid of all good Englishmen five hundred ninety one Such an appeal it was hardly possible to disregard The Lords ordered Feversham to hasten with a troop of the Life Guards to the place where the King was detained and to set his Majesty at liberty Already Middleton and a few other adherents of the royal cause had set out to assist and comfort their unhappy master They found him strictly confined and were not suffered to enter his presence till they had delivered up their swords The concourse of people about him was by this time immense Some Whig gentlemen of the neighbourhood had brought a large body of militia to guard him They had imagined most erroneously that by detaining him they were ingratiating themselves with his enemies and were greatly disturbed when they learned that the treatment which the King had undergone was disapproved by the Provisional Government in London and that a body of cavalry was on the road to release him Feversham soon arrived He had left his troop at Sittingbourne but there was no occasion to use force The King was suffered to depart without opposition and was removed by his friends to Rochester where he took some rest which he greatly needed He was in a pitiable state Not only was his understanding which had never been very clear altogether bewildered but the personal courage which when a young man he had shown in several battles both by sea and by land had forsaken him The rough corporal usage which he had now for the first time undergone seems to have discomposed him more than any other event of his chequered life The desertion of his army of his favourites of his family affected him less than the indignities which he suffered when his hoy was boarded The remembrance of those indignities continued long to rankle in his heart and on one occasion showed itself in a way which moved all Europe to contemptuous mirth In the fourth year of his exile he attempted to lure back his subjects by offering them an amnesty The amnesty was accompanied by a long list of exceptions and in this list the poor fishermen who had searched his pockets rudely appeared side by side with Churchill and Danby From this circumstance we may judge how keenly he must have felt the outrage while it was still recent five hundred ninety two Yet had he possessed an ordinary measure of good sense he would have seen that those who had detained him had unintentionally done him a great service The events which had taken place during his absence from his capital ought to have convinced him that if he had succeeded in escaping he never would have returned In his own despite he had been saved from ruin He had another chance a last chance Great as his offences had been to dethrone him while he remained in his kingdom and offered to assent to such conditions as a free Parliament might impose would have been almost impossible During a short time he seemed disposed to remain He sent Feversham from Rochester with a letter to William The substance of the letter was that His Majesty was on his way back to Whitehall that he wished to have a personal conference with the Prince and that Saint James s Palace should be fitted up for his Highness five hundred ninety three William was now at Windsor He had learned with deep mortification the events which had taken place on the coast of Kent Just before the news arrived those who approached him observed that his spirits were unusually high He had indeed reason to rejoice A vacant throne was before him All parties it seemed would with one voice invite him to mount it On a sudden his prospects were overcast The abdication it appeared had not been completed A large proportion of his own followers would have scruples about deposing a King who remained among them who invited them to represent their grievances in a parliamentary way and who promised full redress It was necessary that the Prince should examine his new position and determine on a new line of action No course was open to him which was altogether free from objections no course which would place him in a situation so advantageous as that which he had occupied a few hours before Yet something might be done The King s first attempt to escape had failed What was now most to be desired was that he should make a second attempt with better success He must be at once frightened and enticed The liberality with which he had been treated in the negotiation at Hungerford and which he had requited by a breach of faith would now be out of season No terms of accommodation must be proposed to him If he should propose terms he must be coldly answered No violence must be used towards him or even threatened Yet it might not be impossible without either using or threatening violence to make so weak a man uneasy about his personal safety He would soon be eager to fly All facilities for flight must then be placed within his reach and care must be taken that he should not again be stopped by any officious blunderer Such was William s plan and the ability and determination with which he carried it into effect present a strange contrast to the folly and cowardice with which he had to deal He soon had an excellent opportunity of commencing his system of intimidation Feversham arrived at Windsor with James s letter The messenger had not been very judiciously selected It was he who had disbanded the royal army To him primarily were to be imputed the confusion and terror of the Irish Night His conduct was loudly blamed by the public William had been provoked into muttering a few words of menace and a few words of menace from William s lips generally meant something Feversham was asked for his safe conduct He had none By coming without one into the midst of a hostile camp he had according to the laws of war made himself liable to be treated with the utmost severity William refused to see him and ordered him to be put under arrest five hundred ninety four Zulestein was instantly despatched to inform James that the Prince declined the proposed conference and desired that His Majesty would remain at Rochester But it was too late James was already in London He had hesitated about the journey and had at one time determined to make another attempt to reach the Continent But at length he yielded to the urgency of friends who were wiser than himself and set out for Whitehall He arrived there on the afternoon of Sunday the sixteenth of December He had been apprehensive that the common people who during his absence had given so many proofs of their aversion to Popery would offer him some affront But the very violence of the recent outbreak had produced a remission The storm had spent itself Good humour and pity had succeeded to fury In no quarter was any disposition shown to insult the King Some cheers were raised as his coach passed through the City The bells of some churches were rung and a few bonfires were lighted in honour of his return five hundred ninety five His feeble mind which had just before been sunk in despondency was extravagantly elated by these unexpected signs of popular goodwill and compassion He entered his dwelling in high spirits It speedily resumed its old aspect Roman Catholic priests who had during the preceding week been glad to hide themselves from the rage of the multitude in vaults and cocklofts now came forth from their lurking places and demanded possession of their old apartments in the palace Grace was said at the royal table by a Jesuit The Irish brogue then the most hateful of all sounds to English ears was heard everywhere in the courts and galleries The King himself had resumed all his old haughtiness He held a Council his last Council and even in that extremity summoned to the board persons not legally qualified to sit there He expressed high displeasure at the conduct of those Lords who during his absence had dared to take the administration on themselves It was their duty he conceived to let society be dissolved to let the houses of Ambassadors be pulled down to let London be set on fire rather than assume the functions which he had thought fit to abandon Among those whom he thus censured were some nobles and prelates who in spite of all his errors had been constantly true to him and who even after this provocation never could be induced by hope or fear to transfer their allegiance from him to any other sovereign five hundred ninety six But his courage was soon cast down Scarcely had he entered his palace when Zulestein was announced William s cold and stern message was delivered The King still pressed for a personal conference with his nephew I would not have left Rochester he said if I had known that he wished me not to do so but since I am here I hope that he will come to Saint James s I must plainly tell your Majesty said Zulestein that His Highness will not come to London while there are any troops here which are not under his orders The King confounded by this answer remained silent Zulestein retired and soon a gentleman entered the bedchamber with the news that Feversham had been put under arrest five hundred ninety seven James was greatly disturbed Yet the recollection of the applause with which he had been greeted still buoyed up his spirits A wild hope rose in his mind He fancied that London so long the stronghold of Protestantism and Whiggism was ready to take arms in his defence He sent to ask the Common Council whether if he took up his residence in the City they would engage to defend him against the Prince But the Common Council had not forgotten the seizure of the charter and the judicial murder of Cornish and refused to give the pledge which was demanded Then the King s heart again sank within him Where he asked was he to look for protection He might as well have Dutch troops about him as his own Life Guards As to the citizens he now understood what their huzzas and bonfires were worth Nothing remained but flight and yet he said he knew that there was nothing which his enemies so much desired as that he would fly five hundred ninety eight While he was in this state of trepidation his fate was the subject of a grave deliberation at Windsor The court of William was now crowded to overflowing with eminent men of all parties Most of the chiefs of the Northern insurrection had joined him Several of the Lords who had during the anarchy of the preceding week taken upon themselves to act as a provisional government had as soon as the King returned quitted London for the Dutch head quarters One of these was Halifax William had welcomed him with great satisfaction but had not been able to suppress a sarcastic smile at seeing the ingenious and accomplished politician who had aspired to be the umpire in that great contention forced to abandon the middle course and to take a side Among those who at this conjuncture repaired to Windsor were some men who had purchased the favour of James by ignominious services and who were now impatient to atone by betraying their master for the crime of having betrayed their country Such a man was Titus who had sate at the Council board in defiance of law and who had laboured to unite the Puritans with the Jesuits in a league against the constitution Such a man was Williams who had been converted by interest from a demagogue into a champion of prerogative and who was now ready for a second apostasy These men the Prince with just contempt suffered to wait at the door of his apartment in vain expectation of an audience five hundred ninety nine On Monday the seventeenth of December all the Peers who were at Windsor were summoned to a solemn consultation at the Castle The subject proposed for deliberation was what should be done with the King William did not think it advisable to be present during the discussion He retired and Halifax was called to the chair On one point the Lords were agreed The King could not be suffered to remain where he was That one prince should fortify himself in Whitehall and the other in Saint James s that there should be two hostile garrisons within an area of a hundred acres was universally felt to be inexpedient Such an arrangement could scarcely fail to produce suspicions insults and bickerings which might end in blood The assembled Lords therefore thought it advisable that James should be sent out of London Ham which had been built and decorated by Lauderdale on the banks of the Thames out of the plunder of Scotland and the bribes of France and which was regarded as the most luxurious of villas was proposed as a convenient retreat When the Lords had come to this conclusion they requested the Prince to join them Their opinion was then communicated to him by Halifax William listened and approved A short message to the King was drawn up Whom said William shall we send with it Ought it not said Halifax to be conveyed by one of your Highness s officers Nay my Lord answered the Prince by your favour it is sent by the advice of your Lordships and some of you ought to carry it Then without pausing to give time for remonstrance he appointed Halifax Shrewsbury and Delamere to be the messengers six hundred The resolution of the Lords appeared to be unanimous But there were in the assembly those who by no means approved of the decision in which they affected to concur and who wished to see the King treated with a severity which they did not venture openly to recommend It is a remarkable fact that the chief of this party was a peer who had been a vehement Tory and who afterwards died a Nonjuror Clarendon The rapidity with which at this crisis he went backward and forward from extreme to extreme might seem incredible to people living in quiet times but will not surprise those who have had an opportunity of watching the course of revolutions He knew that the asperity with which he had in the royal presence censured the whole system of government had given mortal offence to his old master On the other hand he might as the uncle of the Princesses hope to be great and rich in the new world which was about to commence The English colony in Ireland regarded him as a friend and patron and he felt that on the confidence and attachment of that great interest much of his importance depended To such considerations as these the principles which he had during his whole life ostentatiously professed now gave way He repaired to the Prince s closet and represented the danger of leaving the King at liberty The Protestants of Ireland were in extreme peril There was only one way to secure their estates and their lives and that was to keep His Majesty close prisoner It might not be prudent to shut him up in an English castle But he might be sent across the sea and confined in the fortress of Breda till the affairs of the British Islands were settled If the Prince were in possession of such a hostage Tyrconnel would probably lay down the sword of state and the English ascendency would be restored to Ireland without a blow If on the other hand James should escape to France and make his appearance at Dublin accompanied by a foreign army the consequences must be disastrous William owned that there was great weight in these reasons but it could not be He knew his wife s temper and he knew that she never would consent to such a step Indeed it would not be for his own honour to treat his vanquished kinsman so ungraciously Nor was it quite clear that generosity might not be the best policy Who could say what effect such severity as Clarendon recommended might produce on the public mind of England Was it impossible that the loyal enthusiasm which the King s misconduct had extinguished might revive as soon as it was known that he was within the walls of a foreign fortress On these grounds William determined not to subject his father in law to personal restraint and there can be little doubt that the determination was wise six hundred one James while his fate was under discussion remained at Whitehall fascinated as it seemed by the greatness and nearness of the danger and unequal to the exertion of either struggling or flying In the evening news came that the Dutch had occupied Chelsea and Kensington The King however prepared to go to rest as usual The Coldstream Guards were on duty at the palace They were commanded by William Earl of Craven an aged man who more than fifty years before had been distinguished in war and love who had led the forlorn hope at Creutznach with such courage that he had been patted on the shoulder by the great Gustavus and who was believed to have won from a thousand rivals the heart of the unfortunate Queen of Bohemia Craven was now in his eightieth year but time had not tamed his spirit six hundred two It was past ten o clock when he was informed that three battalions of the Prince s foot mingled with some troops of horse were pouring down the long avenue of saint James s Park with matches lighted and in full readiness for action Count Solmes who commanded the foreigners said that his orders were to take military possession of the posts round Whitehall and exhorted Craven to retire peaceably Craven swore that he would rather be cut in pieces but when the King who was undressing himself learned what was passing he forbade the stout old soldier to attempt a resistance which must have been ineffectual By eleven the Coldstream Guards had withdrawn and Dutch sentinels were pacing the rounds on every side of the palace Some of the King s attendants asked whether he would venture to lie down surrounded by enemies He answered that they could hardly use him worse than his own subjects had done and with the apathy of a man stupified by disasters went to bed and to sleep six hundred three Scarcely was the palace again quiet when it was again roused A little after midnight the three Lords arrived from Windsor Middleton was called up to receive them They informed him that they were charged with an errand which did not admit of delay The King was awakened from his first slumber and they were ushered into his bedchamber They delivered into his hand the letter with which they had been entrusted and informed him that the Prince would be at Westminster in a few hours and that His Majesty would do well to set out for Ham before ten in the morning James made some difficulties He did not like Ham It was a pleasant place in the summer but cold and comfortless at Christmas and was moreover unfurnished Halifax answered that furniture should be instantly sent in The three messengers retired but were speedily followed by Middleton who told them that the King would greatly prefer Rochester to Ham They answered that they had not authority to accede to His Majesty s wish but that they would instantly send off an express to the Prince who was to lodge that night at Sion House A courier started immediately and returned before daybreak with William s consent That consent indeed was most gladly given for there could be no doubt that Rochester had been named because it afforded facilities for flight and that James might fly was the first wish of his nephew six hundred four On the morning of the eighteenth of December a rainy and stormy morning the royal barge was early at Whitehall stairs and round it were eight or ten boats filled with Dutch soldiers Several noblemen and gentlemen attended the King to the waterside It is said and may well be believed that many tears were shed For even the most zealous friend of liberty could scarcely have seen unmoved the sad and ignominious close of a dynasty which might have been so great Shrewsbury did all in his power to soothe the fallen Sovereign Even the bitter and vehement Delamere was softened But it was observed that Halifax who was generally distinguished by his tenderness to the vanquished was on this occasion less compassionate than his two colleagues The mock embassy to Hungerford was doubtless still rankling in his mind six hundred five While the King s barge was slowly working its way on rough billows down the river brigade after brigade of the Prince s troops came pouring into London from the west It had been wisely determined that the duty of the capital should be chiefly done by the British soldiers in the service of the States General The three English regiments were quartered in and round the Tower the three Scotch regiments in Southwark six hundred six In defiance of the weather a great multitude assembled between Albemarle House and Saint James s Palace to greet the Prince Every hat every cane was adorned with an orange riband The bells were ringing all over London Candles for an illumination were disposed in the windows Faggots for bonfires were heaped up in the streets William however who had no taste for crowds and shouting took the road through the Park Before nightfall he arrived at Saint James s in a light carriage accompanied by Schomberg In a short time all the rooms and staircases in the palace were thronged by those who came to pay their court Such was the press that men of the highest rank were unable to elbow their way into the presence chamber six hundred seven While Westminster was in this state of excitement the Common Council was preparing at Guildhall an address of thanks and congratulation The Lord Major was unable to preside He had never held up his head since the Chancellor had been dragged into the justice room in the garb of a collier But the Aldermen and the other officers of the corporation were in their places On the following day the magistrates of the City went in state to pay their duty to their deliverer Their gratitude was eloquently expressed by their Recorder Sir George Treby Some princes of the House of Nassau he said had been the chief officers of a great republic Others had worn the imperial crown But the peculiar title of that illustrious line to the public veneration was this that God had set it apart and consecrated it to the high office of defending truth and freedom against tyrants from generation to generation On the same day all the prelates who were in town Sancroft excepted waited on the Prince in a body Then came the clergy of London the foremost men of their profession in knowledge eloquence and influence with their bishop at their head With them were mingled some eminent dissenting ministers whom Compton much to his honour treated with marked courtesy A few months earlier or a few months later such courtesy would have been considered by many Churchmen as treason to the Church Even then it was but too plain to a discerning eye that the armistice to which the Protestant sects had been forced would not long outlast the danger from which it had sprung About a hundred Nonconformist divines resident in the capital presented a separate address They were introduced by Devonshire and were received with every mark of respect and kindness The lawyers paid their homage headed by Maynard who at ninety years of age was as alert and clearheaded as when he stood up in Westminster Hall to accuse Strafford mister Serjeant said the Prince you must have survived all the lawyers of your standing Yes sir said the old man and but for your Highness I should have survived the laws too six hundred eight But though the addresses were numerous and full of eulogy though the acclamations were loud though the illuminations were splendid though Saint James s Palace was too small for the crowd of courtiers though the theatres were every night from the pit to the ceiling one blaze of orange ribands William felt that the difficulties of his enterprise were but beginning He had pulled a government down The far harder task of reconstruction was now to be performed From the moment of his landing till he reached London he had exercised the authority which by the laws of war acknowledged throughout the civilised world belongs to the commander of an army in the field It was now necessary that he should exchange the character of a general for that of a magistrate and this was no easy task A single false step might be fatal and it was impossible to take any step without offending prejudices and rousing angry passions Some of the Prince s advisers pressed him to assume the crown at once as his own by right of conquest and then as King to send out under his Great Seal writs calling a Parliament This course was strongly recommended by some eminent lawyers It was they said the shortest way to what could otherwise be attained only through innumerable difficulties and disputes It was in strict conformity with the auspicious precedent set after the battle of Bosworth by Henry the Seventh It would also quiet the scruples which many respectable people felt as to the lawfulness of transferring allegiance from one ruler to another Neither the law of England nor the Church of England recognised any right in subjects to depose a sovereign But no jurist no divine had ever denied that a nation overcome in war might without sin submit to the decision of the God of battles Thus after the Chaldean conquest the most pious and patriotic Jews did not think that they violated their duty to their native King by serving with loyalty the new master whom Providence had set over them The three confessors who had been marvellously preserved in the furnace held high office in the province of Babylon Daniel was minister successively of the Assyrian who subjugated Judah and of the Persian who subjugated Assyria Nay Jesus himself who was according to the flesh a prince of the house of David had by commanding his countrymen to pay tribute to Caesar pronounced that foreign conquest annuls hereditary right and is a legitimate title to dominion It was therefore probable that great numbers of Tories though they could not with a clear conscience choose a King for themselves would accept without hesitation a King given to them by the event of war six hundred nine On the other side however there were reasons which greatly preponderated The Prince could not claim the crown as won by his sword without a gross violation of faith In his Declaration he had protested that he had no design of conquering England that those who imputed to him such a design foully calumniated not only himself but the patriotic noblemen and gentlemen who had invited him over that the force which he brought with him was evidently inadequate to an enterprise so arduous and that it was his full resolution to refer all the public grievances and all his own pretensions to a free Parliament For no earthly object could it be right or wise that he should forfeit his word so solemnly pledged in the face of all Europe Nor was it certain that by calling himself a conqueror he would have removed the scruples which made rigid Churchmen unwilling to acknowledge him as King For call himself what he might all the world knew that he was not really a conqueror It was notoriously a mere fiction to say that this great kingdom with a mighty fleet on the sea with a regular army of forty thousand men and with a militia of a hundred and thirty thousand men had been without one siege or battle reduced to the state of a province by fifteen thousand invaders Such a fiction was not likely to quiet consciences really sensitive but it could scarcely fail to gall the national pride already sore and irritable The English soldiers were in a temper which required the most delicate management They were conscious that in the late campaign their part had not been brilliant Captains and privates were alike impatient to prove that they had not given way before an inferior force from want of courage Some Dutch officers had been indiscreet enough to boast at a tavern over their wine that they had driven the King s army before them This insult had raised among the English troops a ferment which but for the Prince s prompt interference would probably have ended in a terrible slaughter six hundred ten What in such circumstances was likely to be the effect of a proclamation announcing that the commander of the foreigners considered the whole island as lawful prize of war It was also to be remembered that by putting forth such a proclamation the Prince would at once abrogate all the rights of which he had declared himself the champion For the authority of a foreign conqueror is not circumscribed by the customs and statutes of the conquered nation but is by its own nature despotic Either therefore it was not competent to William to declare himself King or it was competent to him to declare the Great Charter and the Petition of Right nullifies to abolish trial by jury and to raise taxes without the consent of Parliament He might indeed reestablish the ancient constitution of the realm But if he did so he did so in the exercise of an arbitrary discretion English liberty would thenceforth be held by a base tenure It would be not as heretofore an immemorial inheritance but a recent gift which the generous master who had bestowed it might if such had been his pleasure have withheld William therefore righteously and prudently determined to observe the promises contained in his Declaration and to leave to the legislature the office of settling the government So carefully did he avoid whatever looked like usurpation that he would not without some semblance of parliamentary authority take upon himself even to convoke the Estates of the Realm or to direct the executive administration during the elections Authority strictly parliamentary there was none in the state but it was possible to bring together in a few hours an assembly which would be regarded by the nation with a large portion of the respect due to a Parliament One Chamber might be formed of the numerous Lords Spiritual and Temporal who were then in London and another of old members of the House of Commons and of the magistrates of the City The scheme was ingenious and was promptly executed The Peers were summoned to saint James s on the twenty first of December About seventy attended The Prince requested them to consider the state of the country and to lay before him the result of their deliberations Shortly after appeared a notice inviting all gentlemen who had sate in the House of Commons during the reign of Charles the Second to attend His Highness on the morning of the twenty sixth The Aldermen of London were also summoned and the Common Council was requested to send a deputation six hundred eleven It has often been asked in a reproachful tone why the invitation was not extended to the members of the Parliament which had been dissolved in the preceding year The answer is obvious One of the chief grievances of which the nation complained was the manner in which that Parliament had been elected The majority of the burgesses had been returned by constituent bodies remodelled in a manner which was generally regarded as illegal and which the Prince had in his Declaration condemned James himself had just before his downfall consented to restore the old municipal franchises It would surely have been the height of inconsistency in William after taking up arms for the purpose of vindicating the invaded charters of corporations to recognise persons chosen in defiance of those charters as the legitimate representatives of the towns of England On Saturday the twenty second the Lords met in their own house That day was employed in settling the order of proceeding A clerk was appointed and as no confidence could be placed in any of the twelve judges some serjeants and barristers of great note were requested to attend for the purpose of giving advice on legal points It was resolved that on the Monday the state of the kingdom should be taken into consideration six hundred twelve The interval between the sitting of Saturday and the sitting of Monday was anxious and eventful A strong party among the Peers still cherished the hope that the constitution and religion of England might be secured without the deposition of the King This party resolved to move a solemn address to him imploring him to consent to such terms as might remove the discontents and apprehensions which his past conduct had excited Sancroft who since the return of James from Kent to Whitehall had taken no part in public affairs determined to come forth from his retreat on this occasion and to put himself at the head of the Royalists Several messengers were sent to Rochester with letters for the King He was assured that his interests would be strenuously defended if only he could at this last moment make up his mind to renounce designs abhorred by his people Some respectable Roman Catholics followed him in order to implore him for the sake of their common faith not to carry the vain contest further six hundred thirteen The advice was good but James was in no condition to take it His understanding had always been dull and feeble and such as it was womanish tremors and childish fancies now disabled him from using it He was aware that his flight was the thing which his adherents most dreaded and which his enemies most desired Even if there had been serious personal risk in remaining the occasion was one on which he ought to have thought it infamous to flinch for the question was whether he and his posterity should reign on an ancestral throne or should be vagabonds and beggars But in his mind all other feelings had given place to a craven fear for his life To the earnest entreaties and unanswerable arguments of the agents whom his friends had sent to Rochester he had only one answer His head was in danger In vain he was assured that there was no ground for such an apprehension that common sense if not principle would restrain the Prince of Orange from incurring the guilt and shame of regicide and parricide and that many who never would consent to depose their Sovereign while he remained on English ground would think themselves absolved from their allegiance by his desertion Fright overpowered every other feeling James determined to depart and it was easy for him to do so He was negligently guarded all persons were suffered to repair to him vessels ready to put to sea lay at no great distance and their boats might come close to the garden of the house in which he was lodged Had he been wise the pains which his keepers took to facilitate his escape would have sufficed to convince him that he ought to stay where he was In truth the snare was so ostentatiously exhibited that it could impose on nothing but folly bewildered by terror The arrangements were expeditiously made On the evening of Saturday the twenty second the King assured some of the gentlemen who had been sent to him from London with intelligence and advice that he would see them again in the morning He went to bed rose at dead of night and attended by Berwick stole out at a back door and went through the garden to the shore of the Medway A small skiff was in waiting Soon after the dawn of Sunday the fugitives were on board of a smack which was running down the Thames six hundred fourteen That afternoon the tidings of the flight reached London The King s adherents were confounded The Whigs could not conceal their joy The good news encouraged the Prince to take a bold and important step He was informed that communications were passing between the French embassy and the party hostile to him It was well known that at that embassy all the arts of corruption were well understood and there could be little doubt that at such a conjuncture neither intrigues nor pistoles would be spared Barillon was most desirous to remain a few days longer in London and for that end omitted no art which could conciliate the victorious party In the streets he quieted the populace who looked angrily at his coach by throwing money among them At his table he publicly drank the health of the Prince of Orange But William was not to be so cajoled He had not indeed taken on himself to exercise regal authority but he was a general and as such he was not bound to tolerate within the territory of which he had taken military occupation the presence of one whom he regarded as a spy Before that day closed Barillon was informed that he must leave England within twenty four hours He begged hard for a short delay but minutes were precious the order was repeated in more peremptory terms and he unwillingly set off for Dover That no mark of contempt and defiance might be omitted he was escorted to the coast by one of his Protestant countrymen whom persecution had driven into exile So bitter was the resentment excited by the French ambition and arrogance that even those Englishmen who were not generally disposed to take a favourable view of William s conduct loudly applauded him for retorting with so much spirit the insolence with which Lewis had during many years treated every court in Europe six hundred fifteen On Monday the Lords met again Halifax was chosen to preside The Primate was absent the Royalists sad and gloomy the Whigs eager and in high spirits It was known that James had left a letter behind him Some of his friends moved that it might be produced in the faint hope that it might contain propositions which might furnish a basis for a happy settlement On this motion the previous question was put and carried Godolphin who was known not to be unfriendly to his old master uttered a few words which were decisive I have seen the paper he said and I grieve to say that there is nothing in it which will give your Lordships any satisfaction In truth it contained no expression of regret for pass errors it held out no hope that those errors would for the future be avoided and it threw the blame of all that had happened on the malice of William and on the blindness of a nation deluded by the specious names of religion and property None ventured to propose that a negotiation should be opened with a prince whom the most rigid discipline of adversity seemed only to have made more obstinate in wrong Something was said about inquiring into the birth of the Prince of Wales but the Whig peers treated the suggestion with disdain I did not expect my Lords exclaimed Philip Lord Wharton an old Roundhead who had commanded a regiment against Charles the First at Edgehill I did not expect to hear anybody at this time of day mention the child who was called Prince of Wales and I hope that we have now heard the last of him After long discussion it was resolved that two addresses should be presented to William One address requested him to take on himself provisionally the administration of the government the other recommended that he should by circular letters subscribed with his own hand invite all the constituent bodies of the kingdom to send up representatives to Westminster At the same time the Peers took upon themselves to issue an order banishing all Papists except a few privileged persons from London and the vicinity six hundred sixteen The Lords presented their addresses to the Prince on the following day without waiting for the issue of the deliberations of the commoners whom he had called together It seems indeed that the hereditary nobles were disposed at this moment to be punctilious in asserting their dignity and were unwilling to recognise a coordinate authority in an assembly unknown to the law They conceived that they were a real House of Lords The other Chamber they despised as only a mock House of Commons William however wisely excused himself from coming to any decision till he had ascertained the sense of the gentlemen who had formerly been honoured with the confidence of the counties and towns of England six hundred seventeen The commoners who had been summoned met in Saint Stephen s Chapel and formed a numerous assembly They placed in the chair Henry Powle who had represented Cirencester in several Parliaments and had been eminent among the supporters of the Exclusion Bill Addresses were proposed and adopted similar to those which the Lords had already presented No difference of opinion appeared on any serious question and some feeble attempts which were made to raise a debate on points of form were put down by the general contempt Sir Robert Sawyer declared that he could not conceive how it was possible for the Prince to administer the government without some distinguishing title such as Regent or Protector Old Maynard who as a lawyer had no equal and who was also a politician versed in the tactics of revolutions was at no pains to conceal his disdain for so puerile an objection taken at a moment when union and promptitude were of the highest importance We shall sit here very long he said if we sit till Sir Robert can conceive how such a thing is possible and the assembly thought the answer as good as the cavil deserved six hundred eighteen The resolutions of the meeting were communicated to the Prince He forthwith announced his determination to comply with the joint request of the two Chambers which he had called together to issue letters summoning a Convention of the Estates of the Realm and till the Convention should meet to take on himself the executive administration six hundred nineteen He had undertaken no light task The whole machine of government was disordered The Justices of the Peace had abandoned their functions The officers of the revenue had ceased to collect the taxes The army which Feversham had disbanded was still in confusion and ready to break out into mutiny The fleet was in a scarcely less alarming state Large arrears of pay were due to the civil and military servants of the crown and only forty thousand pounds remained in the Exchequer The Prince addressed himself with vigour to the work of restoring order He published a proclamation by which all magistrates were continued in office and another containing orders for the collection of the revenue six hundred twenty The new modelling of the army went rapidly on Many of the noblemen and gentlemen whom James had removed from the command of the English regiments were reappointed A way was found of employing the thousands of Irish soldiers whom James had brought into England They could not safely be suffered to remain in a country where they were objects of religious and national animosity They could not safely be sent home to reinforce the army of Tryconnel It was therefore determined that they should be sent to the Continent where they might under the banners of the House of Austria render indirect but effectual service to the cause of the English constitution and of the Protestant religion Dartmouth was removed from his command and the navy was conciliated by assurances that every sailor should speedily receive his due The City of London undertook to extricate the Prince from his financial difficulties The Common Council by an unanimous vote engaged to find him two hundred thousand pounds It was thought a great proof both of the wealth and of the public spirit of the merchants of the capital that in forty eight hours the whole sum was raised on no security but the Prince s word A few weeks before James had been unable to procure a much smaller sum though he had offered to pay higher interest and to pledge valuable property six hundred twenty one In a very few days the confusion which the invasion the insurrection the flight of James and the suspension of all regular government had produced was at an end and the kingdom wore again its accustomed aspect There was a general sense of security Even the classes which were most obnoxious to public hatred and which had most reason to apprehend a persecution were protected by the politic clemency of the conqueror Persons deeply implicated in the illegal transactions of the late reign not only walked the streets in safety but offered themselves as candidates for seats in the Convention Mulgrave was received not ungraciously at saint James s Feversham was released from arrest and was permitted to resume the only office for which he was qualified that of keeping the bank at the Queen Dowager s basset table But no body of men had so much reason to feel grateful to William as the Roman Catholics It would not have been safe to rescind formally the severe resolutions which the Peers had passed against the professors of a religion generally abhorred by the nation but by the prudence and humanity of the Prince those resolutions were practically annulled On his line of march from Torbay to London he had given orders that no outrage should be committed on the persons or dwellings of Papists He now renewed those orders and directed Burnet to see that they were strictly obeyed A better choice could not have been made for Burnet was a man of such generosity and good nature that his heart always warmed towards the unhappy and at the same time his known hatred of Popery was a sufficient guarantee to the most zealous Protestants that the interests of their religion would be safe in his hands He listened kindly to the complaints of the Roman Catholics procured passports for those who wished to go beyond sea and went himself to Newgate to visit the prelates who were imprisoned there He ordered them to be removed to a more commodious apartment and supplied with every indulgence He solemnly assured them that not a hair of their heads should be touched and that as soon as the Prince could venture to act as he wished they should be set at liberty The Spanish minister reported to his government and through his government to the Pope that no Catholic need feel any scruple of conscience on account of the late revolution in England that for the danger to which the members of the true Church were exposed James alone was responsible and that William alone had saved them from a sanguinary persecution six hundred twenty two There was therefore little alloy to the satisfaction with which the princes of the House of Austria and the Sovereign Pontiff learned that the long vassalage of England was at an end When it was known at Madrid that William was in the full career of success a single voice in the Spanish Council of State faintly expressed regret that an event which in a political point of view was most auspicious should be prejudicial to the interests of the true Church six hundred twenty three But the tolerant policy of the Prince soon quieted all scruples and his elevation was seen with scarcely less satisfaction by the bigoted Grandees of Castile than by the English Whigs With very different feelings had the news of this great revolution been received in France The politics of a long eventful and glorious reign had been confounded in a day England was again the England of Elizabeth and of Cromwell and all the relations of all the states of Christendom were completely changed by the sudden introduction of this new power into the system The Parisians could talk of nothing but what was passing in London National and religious feeling impelled them to take the part of James They knew nothing of the English constitution They abominated the English Church Our revolution appeared to them not as the triumph of public liberty over despotism but as a frightful domestic tragedy in which a venerable and pious Servius was hurled from his throne by a Tarquin and crushed under the chariot wheels of a Tullia They cried shame on the traitorous captains execrated the unnatural daughters and regarded William with a mortal loathing tempered however by the respect which valour capacity and success seldom fail to inspire six hundred twenty four The Queen exposed to the night wind and rain with the infant heir of three crowns clasped to her breast the King stopped robbed and outraged by ruffians were objects of pity and of romantic interest to all France But Lewis saw with peculiar emotion the calamities of the House of Stuart All the selfish and all the generous parts of his nature were moved alike After many years of prosperity he had at length met with a great check He had reckoned on the support or neutrality of England He had now nothing to expect from her but energetic and pertinacious hostility A few weeks earlier he might not unreasonably have hoped to subjugate Flanders and to give law to Germany At present he might think himself fortunate if he should be able to defend his own frontiers against a confederacy such as Europe had not seen during many ages From this position so new so embarrassing so alarming nothing but a counterrevolution or a civil war in the British Islands could extricate him He was therefore impelled by ambition and by fear to espouse the cause of the fallen dynasty And it is but just to say that motives nobler than ambition or fear had a large share in determining his course His heart was naturally compassionate and this was an occasion which could not fail to call forth all his compassion His situation had prevented his good feelings from fully developing themselves Sympathy is rarely strong where there is a great inequality of condition and he was raised so high above the mass of his fellow creatures that their distresses excited in him only a languid pity such as that with which we regard the sufferings of the inferior animals of a famished redbreast or of an overdriven posthorse The devastation of the Palatinate and the persecution of the Huguenots had therefore given him no uneasiness which pride and bigotry could not effectually soothe But all the tenderness of which he was capable was called forth by the misery of a great King who had a few weeks ago been served on the knee by Lords and who was now a destitute exile With that tenderness was mingled in the soul of Lewis a not ignoble vanity He would exhibit to the world a pattern of munificence and courtesy He would show mankind what ought to be the bearing of a perfect gentleman in the highest station and on the greatest occasion and in truth his conduct was marked by a chivalrous generosity and urbanity such as had not embellished the annals of Europe since the Black Prince had stood behind the chair of King John at the supper on the field Poitiers

none	none	They repaired to the Council chamber and put Hamilton into the chair Though there seems to have been little difference of opinion their debates lasted three days a fact which is sufficiently explained by the circumstance that Sir Patrick Hume was one of the debaters Arran ventured to recommend a negotiation with the King But this motion was ill received by the mover s father and by the whole assembly and did not even find a seconder At length resolutions were carried closely resembling the resolutions which the English Lords and Commoners had presented to the Prince a few days before He was requested to call together a Convention of the Estates of Scotland to fix the fourteenth of March for the day of meeting and till that day to take on himself the civil and military administration To this request he acceded and thenceforth the government of the whole island was in his hands six hundred thirty one The decisive moment approached and the agitation of the public mind rose to the height Knots of politicians were everywhere whispering and consulting The coffeehouses were in a ferment The presses of the capital never rested Of the pamphlets which appeared at that time enough may still be collected to form several volumes and from those pamphlets it is not difficult to gather a correct notion of the state of parties There was a very small faction which wished to recall James without stipulations There was also a very small faction which wished to set up a commonwealth and to entrust the administration to a council of state under the presidency of the Prince of Orange But these extreme opinions were generally held in abhorrence Nineteen twentieths of the nation consisted of persons in whom love of hereditary monarchy and love of constitutional freedom were combined though in different proportions and who were equally opposed to the total abolition of the kingly office and to the unconditional restoration of the King But in the wide interval which separated the bigots who still clung to the doctrines of Filmer from the enthusiasts who still dreamed the dreams of Harrington there was room for many shades of opinion If we neglect minute subdivisions we shall find that the great majority of the nation and of the Convention was divided into four bodies

1316_132800_000010_000006	train-clean-360	Their old theory sound or unsound was at least complete and coherent

1316_132800_000010_000010	train-clean-360	For what satisfactory guarantee could he give 
none	none	How was it possible to draw up an Act of Parliament in language clearer than the language of the Acts of Parliament which required that the Dean of Christ Church should be a Protestant How was it possible to put any promise into words stronger than those in which James had repeatedly declared that he would strictly respect the legal rights of the Anglican clergy If law or honour could have bound him he would never have been forced to fly from his kingdom If neither law nor honour could bind him could he safely be permitted to return It is probable however that in spite of these arguments a motion for opening a negotiation with James would have been made in the Convention and would have been supported by the great body of Tories had he not been on this as on every other occasion his own worst enemy Every post which arrived from Saint Germains brought intelligence which damped the ardour of his adherents He did not think it worth his while to feign regret for his past errors or to promise amendment He put forth a manifesto telling his people that it had been his constant care to govern them with justice and moderation and that they had been cheated into ruin by imaginary grievances six hundred thirty four The effect of his folly and obstinacy was that those who were most desirous to see him restored to his throne on fair conditions felt that by proposing at that moment to treat with him they should injure the cause which they wished to serve They therefore determined to coalesce with another body of Tories of whom Sancroft was the chief Sancroft fancied that he had found out a device by which provision might be made for the government of the country without recalling James and yet without despoiling him of his crown This device was a Regency The most uncompromising of those divines who had inculcated the doctrine of passive obedience had never maintained that such obedience was due to a babe or to a madman It was universally acknowledged that when the rightful sovereign was intellectually incapable of performing his office a deputy might be appointed to act in his stead and that any person who should resist the deputy and should plead as an excuse for doing so the command of a prince who was in the cradle or who was raving would justly incur the penalties of rebellion Stupidity perverseness and superstition such was the reasoning of the Primate had made James as unfit to rule his dominions as any child in swaddling clothes or as any maniac who was grinning and chattering in the straw of Bedlam That course must therefore be taken which had been taken when Henry the Sixth was an infant and again when he became lethargic 
1316_132800_000011_000011	train-clean-360	James could not be King in effect but he must still continue to be King in semblance 
none	none	Writs must still run in his name His image and superscription must still appear on the coin and on the Great Seal Acts of Parliament must still be called from the years of his reign But the administration must be taken from him and confided to a Regent named by the Estates of the Realm In this way Sancroft gravely maintained the people would remain true to their allegiance the oaths of fealty which they had sworn to their King would be strictly fulfilled and the most orthodox Churchmen might without any scruple of conscience take office under the Regent six hundred thirty five The opinion of Sancroft had great weight with the whole Tory party and especially with the clergy A week before the day for which the Convention had been summoned a grave party assembled at Lambeth Palace heard prayers in the chapel dined with the Primate and then consulted on the state of public affairs Five suffragans of the Archbishop who had shared his perils and his glory in the preceding summer were present The Earls of Clarendon and Ailesbury represented the Tory laity The unanimous sense of the meeting appeared to be that those who had taken the oath of allegiance to James might justifiably withdraw their obedience from him but could not with a safe conscience call any other by the name of King six hundred thirty six Thus two sections of the Tory party a section which looked forward to an accommodation with James and a section which was opposed to any such accommodation agreed in supporting the plan of Regency But a third section which though not very numerous had great weight and influence recommended a very different plan The leaders of this small band were Danby and the Bishop of London in the House of Lords and Sir Robert Sawyer in the House of Commons They conceived that they had found out a way of effecting a complete revolution under strictly legal forms It was contrary to all principle they said that the King should be deposed by his subjects nor was it necessary to depose him He had himself by his flight abdicated his power and dignity A demise had actually taken place All constitutional lawyers held that the throne of England could not be one moment vacant The next heir had therefore succeeded Who then was the next heir As to the infant who had been carried into France his entrance into the world had been attended by many suspicious circumstances It was due to the other members of the royal family and to the nation that all doubts should be cleared up An investigation had been solemnly demanded in the name of the Princess of Orange by her husband and would have been instituted if the parties who were accused of fraud had not taken a course which in any ordinary case would have been considered as a decisive proof of guilt They had not chosen to await the issue of a solemn parliamentary proceeding they had stolen away into a foreign country they had carried with them the child they had carried with them all those French and Italian women of the bedchamber who if there had been foul play must have been privy to it and who ought therefore to have been subjected to a rigorous cross examination To admit the boy s claim without inquiry was impossible and those who called themselves his parents had made inquiry impossible Judgment must therefore go against him by default If he was wronged he was wronged not by the nation but by those whose strange conduct at the time of his birth had justified the nation in demanding investigation and who had then avoided investigation by flight He might therefore with perfect equity be considered as a pretender And thus the crown had legally devolved on the Princess of Orange She was actually Queen Regnant The Houses had nothing to do but to proclaim her She might if such were her pleasure make her husband her first minister and might even with the consent of Parliament bestow on him the title of King The persons who preferred this scheme to any other were few and it was certain to be opposed both by all who still bore any good will to James and by all the adherents of William Yet Danby confident in his own knowledge of parliamentary tactics and well aware how much when great parties are nearly balanced a small flying squadron can effect was not without hopes of being able to keep the event of the contest in suspense till both Whigs and Tories despairing of complete victory and afraid of the consequences of delay should suffer him to act as umpire Nor is it impossible that he might have succeeded if his efforts had been seconded nay if they had not been counteracted by her whom he wished to raise to the height of human greatness Quicksighted as he was and versed in affairs he was altogether ignorant of the character of Mary and of the feeling with which she regarded her husband nor was her old preceptor Compton better informed William s manners were dry and cold his constitution was infirm and his temper by no means bland he was not a man who would commonly be thought likely to inspire a fine young woman of twenty six with a violent passion It was known that he had not always been strictly constant to his wife and talebearers had reported that she did not live happily with him The most acute politicians therefore never suspected that with all his faults he had obtained such an empire over her heart as princes the most renowned for their success in gallantry Francis the First and Henry the Fourth Lewis the Fourteenth and Charles the Second had never obtained over the heart of any woman and that the three kingdoms of her forefathers were valuable in her estimation chiefly because by bestowing them on him she could prove to him the intensity and disinterestedness of her affection Danby in profound ignorance of her sentiments assured her that he would defend her rights and that if she would support him he hoped to place her alone on the throne six hundred thirty seven The course of the Whigs meanwhile was simple and consistent Their doctrine was that the foundation of our government was a contract expressed on one side by the oath of allegiance and on the other by the coronation oath and that the duties imposed by this contract were mutual They held that a sovereign who grossly abused his power might lawfully be withstood and dethroned by his people That James had grossly abused his power was not disputed and the whole Whig party was ready to pronounce that he had forfeited it Whether the Prince of Wales was supposititious was a point not worth discussing There were now far stronger reasons than any which could be drawn from the circumstances of his birth for excluding him from the throne A child brought to the royal couch in a warming pan might possibly prove a good King of England But there could be no such hope for a child educated by a father who was the most stupid and obstinate of tyrants in a foreign country the seat of despotism and superstition in a country where the last traces of liberty had disappeared where the States General had ceased to meet where parliaments had long registered without one remonstrance the most oppressive edicts of the sovereign where valour genius learning seemed to exist only for the purpose of aggrandising a single man where adulation was the main business of the press the pulpit and the stage and where one chief subject of adulation was the barbarous persecution of the Reformed Church Was the boy likely to learn under such tuition and in such a situation respect for the institutions of his native land Could it be doubted that he would be brought up to be the slave of the Jesuits and the Bourbons and that he would be if possible more bitterly prejudiced than any preceding Stuart against the laws of England Nor did the Whigs think that situated as the country then was a departure from the ordinary rule of succession was in itself an evil They were of opinion that till that rule had been broken the doctrines of indefeasible hereditary right and passive obedience would be pleasing to the court would be inculcated by the clergy and would retain a strong hold on the public mind The notion would still prevail that the kingly office is the ordinance of God in a sense different from that in which all government is his ordinance It was plain that till this superstition was extinct the constitution could never be secure For a really limited monarchy cannot long exist in a society which regards monarchy as something divine and the limitations as mere human inventions Royalty in order that it might exist in perfect harmony with our liberties must be unable to show any higher or more venerable title than that by which we hold our liberties The King must be henceforth regarded as a magistrate a great magistrate indeed and highly to be honoured but subject like all other magistrates to the law and deriving his power from heaven in no other sense than that in which the Lords and the Commons may be said to derive their power from heaven The best way of effecting this salutary change would be to interrupt the course of descent Under sovereigns who would consider it as little short of high treason to preach nonresistance and the patriarchal theory of government under sovereigns whose authority springing from resolutions of the two Houses could never rise higher than its source there would be little risk of oppression such as had compelled two generations of Englishmen to rise in arms against two generations of Stuarts On these grounds the Whigs were prepared to declare the throne vacant to fill it by election and to impose on the prince of their choice such conditions as might secure the country against misgovernment The time for the decision of these great questions had now arrived At break of day on the twenty second of January the House of Commons was crowded with knights and burgesses On the benches appeared many faces which had been well known in that place during the reign of Charles the Second but had not been seen there under his successor Most of those Tory squires and of those needy retainers of the court who had been returned in multitudes to the Parliament of sixteen eighty five had given place to the men of the old country party the men who had driven the Cabal from power who had carried the Habeas Corpus Act and who had sent up the Exclusion Bill to the Lords Among them was Powle deeply read in the history and law of Parliament and distinguished by the species of eloquence which is required when grave questions are to be solemnly brought under the notice of senates and Sir Thomas Littleton versed in European politics and gifted with a vehement and piercing logic which had often when after a long sitting the candles had been lighted roused the languishing House and decided the event of the debate There too was William Sacheverell an orator whose great parliamentary abilities were many years later a favourite theme of old men who lived to see the conflicts of Walpole and Pulteney six hundred thirty eight With these eminent persons was joined Sir Robert Clayton the wealthiest merchant of London whose palace in the Old Jewry surpassed in splendour the aristocratical mansions of Lincoln s Inn Fields and Covent Garden whose villa among the Surrey hills was described as a garden of Eden whose banquets vied with those of Kings and whose judicious munificence still attested by numerous public monuments had obtained for him in the annals of the City a place second only to that of Gresham In the Parliament which met at Oxford in sixteen eighty one Clayton had as member for the capital and at the request of his constituents moved for leave to bring in the Bill of Exclusion and had been seconded by Lord Russell In sixteen eighty five the City deprived of its franchises and governed by the creatures of the court had returned four Tory representatives But the old charter had now been restored and Clayton had been again chosen by acclamation six hundred thirty nine Nor must John Birch be passed over He had begun life as a carter but had in the civil wars left his team had turned soldier had risen to the rank of Colonel in the army of the Commonwealth had in high fiscal offices shown great talents for business had sate many years in Parliament and though retaining to the last the rough manners and plebeian dialect of his youth had by strong sense and mother wit gained the ear of the Commons and was regarded as a formidable opponent by the most accomplished debaters of his time six hundred forty These were the most conspicuous among the veterans who now after a long seclusion returned to public life But they were all speedily thrown into the shade by two younger Whigs who on this great day took their seats for the first time who soon rose to the highest honours of the state who weathered together the fiercest storms of faction and who having been long and widely renowned as statesmen as orators and as munificent patrons of genius and learning died within a few months of each other soon after the accession of the House of Brunswick These were Charles Montague and John Somers One other name must be mentioned a name then known only to a small circle of philosophers but now pronounced beyond the Ganges and the Mississippi with reverence exceeding that which is paid to the memory of the greatest warriors and rulers Among the crowd of silent members appeared the majestic forehead and pensive face of Isaac Newton The renowned University on which his genius had already begun to impress a peculiar character still plainly discernible after the lapse of a hundred and sixty years had sent him to the Convention and he sate there in his modest greatness the unobtrusive but unflinching friend of civil and religious freedom The first act of the Commons was to choose a Speaker and the choice which they made indicated in a manner not to be mistaken their opinion touching the great questions which they were about to decide Down to the very eve of the meeting it had been understood that Seymour would be placed in the chair He had formerly sate there during several years He had great and various titles to consideration descent fortune knowledge experience eloquence He had long been at the head of a powerful band of members from the Western counties Though a Tory he had in the last Parliament headed with conspicuous ability and courage the opposition to Popery and arbitrary power He had been among the first gentlemen who had repaired to the Dutch head quarters at Exeter and had been the author of that association by which the Prince s adherents had bound themselves to stand or fall together But a few hours before the Houses met a rumour was spread that Seymour was against declaring the throne vacant As soon therefore as the benches had filled the Earl of Wiltshire who represented Hampshire stood up and proposed that Powle should be Speaker Sir Vere Fane member for Kent seconded the motion A plausible objection might have been raised for it was known that a petition was about to be presented against Powle s return but the general cry of the House called him to the chair and the Tories thought it prudent to acquiesce six hundred forty one The mace was then laid on the table the list of members was called over and the names of the defaulters were noted Meanwhile the Peers about a hundred in number had met had chosen Halifax to be their Speaker and had appointed several eminent lawyers to perform the functions which in regular Parliaments belong to the judges There was in the course of that day frequent communication between the Houses They joined in requesting that the Prince would continue to administer the government till he should hear further from them in expressing to him their gratitude for the deliverance which he under God had wrought for the nation and in directing that the thirty first of January should be observed as a day of thanksgiving for that deliverance six hundred forty two Thus far no difference of opinion had appeared but both sides were preparing for the conflict The Tories were strong in the Upper House and weak in the Lower and they knew that at such a conjuncture the House which should be the first to come to a resolution would have a great advantage over the other There was not the least chance that the Commons would send up to the Lords a vote in favour of the plan of Regency but if such a vote were sent down from the Lords to the Commons it was not absolutely impossible that many even of the Whig representatives of the people might be disposed to acquiesce rather than take the grave responsibility of causing discord and delay at a crisis which required union and expedition The Commons had determined that on Monday the twenty eighth of January they would take into consideration the state of the nation The Tory Lords therefore proposed on Friday the twenty fifth to enter instantly on the great business for which they had been called together But their motives were clearly discerned and their tactics frustrated by Halifax who ever since his return from Hungerford had seen that the settlement of the government could be effected on Whig principles only and who had therefore for the time allied himself closely with the Whigs Devonshire moved that Tuesday the twenty ninth should be the day By that time he said with more truth than discretion we may have some lights from below which may be useful for our guidance His motion was carried but his language was severely censured by some of his brother peers as derogatory to their order six hundred forty three On the twenty eighth the Commons resolved themselves into a committee of the whole House A member who had more than thirty years before been one of Cromwell s Lords Richard Hampden son of the illustrious leader of the Roundheads and father of the unhappy man who had by large bribes and degrading submissions narrowly escaped with life from the vengeance of James was placed in the chair and the great debate began It was soon evident that an overwhelming majority considered James as no longer King Gilbert Dolben son of the late Archbishop of York was the first who declared himself to be of that opinion He was supported by many members particularly by the bold and vehement Wharton by Sawyer whose steady opposition to the dispensing power had in some measure atoned for old offences by Maynard whose voice though so feeble with age that it could not be heard on distant benches still commanded the respect of all parties and by Somers whose luminous eloquence and varied stores of knowledge were on that day exhibited for the first time within the walls of Parliament The unblushing forehead and voluble tongue of Sir William Williams were found on the same side Already he had been deeply concerned in the excesses both of the worst of oppositions and of the worst of governments He had persecuted innocent Papists and innocent Protestants He had been the patron of Oates and the tool of Petre His name was associated with seditious violence which was remembered with regret and shame by all respectable Whigs and with freaks of despotism abhorred by all respectable Tories How men live under such infamy it is not easy to understand but even such infamy was not enough for Williams He was not ashamed to attack the fallen master to whom he had hired himself out for work which no honest man in the Inns of Court would undertake and from whom he had within six months accepted a baronetcy as the reward of servility Only three members ventured to oppose themselves to what was evidently the general sense of the assembly Sir Christopher Musgrave a Tory gentleman of great weight and ability hinted some doubts Heneage Finch let fall some expressions which were understood to mean that he wished a negotiation to be opened with the King This suggestion was so ill received that he made haste to explain it away He protested that he had been misapprehended He was convinced that under such a prince there could be no security for religion liberty or property To recall King James or to treat with him would be a fatal course but many who would never consent that he should exercise the regal power had conscientious scruples about depriving him of the royal title There was one expedient which would remove all difficulties a Regency This proposition found so little favour that Finch did not venture to demand a division Richard Fanshaw Viscount Fanshaw of the kingdom of Ireland said a few words in behalf of James and recommended an adjournment but the recommendation was met by a general outcry Member after member stood up to represent the importance of despatch Every moment it was said was precious the public anxiety was intense trade was suspended The minority sullenly submitted and suffered the predominant party to take its own course What that course would be was not perfectly clear For the majority was made up of two classes One class consisted of eager and vehement Whigs who if they had been able to take their own course would have given to the proceedings of the Convention a decidedly revolutionary character The other class admitted that a revolution was necessary but regarded it as a necessary evil and wished to disguise it as much as possible under the show of legitimacy The former class demanded a distinct recognition of the right of subjects to dethrone bad princes The latter class desired to rid the country of one bad prince without promulgating any doctrine which might be abused for the purpose of weakening the just and salutary authority of future monarchs The former class dwelt chiefly on the King s misgovernment the latter on his flight The former class considered him as having forfeited his crown the latter as having resigned it It was not easy to draw up any form of words which would please all whose assent it was important to obtain but at length out of many suggestions offered from different quarters a resolution was framed which gave general satisfaction It was moved that King James the Second having endeavoured to subvert the constitution of the kingdom by breaking the original contract between King and people and by the advice of Jesuits and other wicked persons having violated the fundamental laws and having withdrawn himself out of the kingdom had abdicated the government and that the throne had thereby become vacant This resolution has been many times subjected to criticism as minute and severe as was ever applied to any sentence written by man and perhaps there never was a sentence written by man which would bear such criticism less That a King by grossly abusing his power may forfeit it is true That a King who absconds without making any provision for the administration and leaves his people in a state of anarchy may without any violent straining of language be said to have abdicated his functions is also true But no accurate writer would affirm that long continued misgovernment and desertion added together make up an act of abdication It is evident too that the mention of the Jesuits and other evil advisers of James weakens instead of strengthening the case against him For surely more indulgence is due to a man misled by pernicious counsel than to a man who goes wrong from the mere impulse of his own mind It is idle however to examine these memorable words as we should examine a chapter of Aristotle or of Hobbes Such words are to be considered not as words but as deeds If they effect that which they are intended to effect they are rational though they may be contradictory It they fail of attaining their end they are absurd though they carry demonstration with them Logic admits of no compromise The essense of politics is compromise It is therefore not strange that some of the most important and most useful political instruments in the world should be among the most illogical compositions that ever were penned The object of Somers of Maynard and of the other eminent men who shaped this celebrated motion was not to leave to posterity a model of definition and partition but to make the restoration of a tyrant impossible and to place on the throne a sovereign under whom law and liberty might be secure This object they attained by using language which in a philosophical treatise would justly be reprehended as inexact and confused They cared little whether their major agreed with their conclusion if the major secured two hundred votes and the conclusion two hundred more In fact the one beauty of the resolution is its inconsistency There was a phrase for every subdivision of the majority The mention of the original contract gratified the disciples of Sidney The word abdication conciliated politicians of a more timid school There were doubtless many fervent Protestants who were pleased with the censure cast on the Jesuits To the real statesman the single important clause was that which declared the throne vacant and if that clause could be carried he cared little by what preamble it might be introduced The force which was thus united made all resistance hopeless The motion was adopted by the Committee without a division It was ordered that the report should be instantly made Powle returned to the chair the mace was laid on the table Hampden brought up the resolution the House instantly agreed to it and ordered him to carry it to the Lords six hundred forty four On the following morning the Lords assembled early The benches both of the spiritual and of the temporal peers were crowded Hampden appeared at the bar and put the resolution of the Commons into the hands of Halifax The Upper House then resolved itself into a committee and Danby took the chair The discussion was soon interrupted by the reappearance of Hampden with another message The House resumed and was informed that the Commons had just voted it inconsistent with the safety and welfare of this Protestant nation to be governed by a Popish King To this resolution irreconcilable as it obviously was with the doctrine of indefeasible hereditary right the Peers gave an immediate and unanimous assent The principle which was thus affirmed has always down to our own time been held sacred by all Protestant statesmen and has never been considered by any reasonable Roman Catholic as objectionable If indeed our sovereigns were like the Presidents of the United States mere civil functionaries it would not be easy to vindicate such a restriction But the headship of the English Church is annexed to the English crown and there is no intolerance in saying that a Church ought not to be subjected to a head who regards her as schismatical and heretical six hundred forty five After this short interlude the Lords again went into committee The Tories insisted that their plan should be discussed before the vote of the Commons which declared the throne vacant was considered This was conceded to them and the question was put whether a Regency exercising kingly power during the life of James in his name would be the best expedient for preserving the laws and liberties of the nation The contest was long and animated The chief speakers in favour of a Regency were Rochester and Nottingham Halifax and Danby led the other side The Primate strange to say did not make his appearance though earnestly importuned by the Tory peers to place himself at their head His absence drew on him many contumelious censures nor have even his eulogists been able to find any explanation of it which raises his character six hundred forty six The plan of Regency was his own He had a few days before in a paper written with his own hand pronounced that plan to be clearly the best that could be adopted The deliberations of the Lords who supported that plan had been carried on under his roof His situation made it his clear duty to declare publicly what he thought Nobody can suspect him of personal cowardice or of vulgar cupidity It was probably from a nervous fear of doing wrong that at this great conjuncture he did nothing but he should have known that situated as he was to do nothing was to do wrong A man who is too scrupulous to take on himself a grave responsibility at an important crisis ought to be too scrupulous to accept the place of first minister of the Church and first peer of the realm It is not strange however that Sancroft s mind should have been ill at case for he could hardly be blind to the obvious truth that the scheme which he had recommended to his friends was utterly inconsistent with all that he and his brethren had been teaching during many years That the King had a divine and indefeasible right to the regal power and that the regal power even when most grossly abused could not without sin be resisted was the doctrine in which the Anglican Church had long gloried Did this doctrine then really mean only that the King had a divine and indefeasible right to have his effigy and name cut on a seal which was to be daily employed in despite of him for the purpose of commissioning his enemies to levy war on him and of sending his friends to the gallows for obeying him Did the whole duty of a good subject consist in using the word King If so Fairfax at Naseby and Bradshaw in the High Court of justice had performed all the duty of good subjects For Charles had been designated by the generals who commanded against him and even by the judges who condemned him as King Nothing in the conduct of the Long Parliament had been more severely blamed by the Church than the ingenious device of using the name of Charles against himself Every one of her ministers had been required to sign a declaration condemning as traitorous the fiction by which the authority of the sovereign had been separated from his person six hundred forty seven Yet this traitorous fiction was now considered by the Primate and by many of his suffragans as the only basis on which they could in strict conformity with Christian principles erect a government The distinction which Sancroft had borrowed from the Roundheads of the preceding generation subverted from the foundation that system of politics which the Church and the Universities pretended to have learned from Saint Paul The Holy Spirit it had been a thousand times repeated had commanded the Romans to be subject to Nero The meaning of the precept now appeared to be only that the Romans were to call Nero Augustus They were perfectly at liberty to chase him beyond the Euphrates to leave him a pensioner on the bounty of the Parthians to withstand him by force if he attempted to return to punish all who aided him or corresponded with him and to transfer the Tribunitian power and the Consular power the Presidency of the Senate and the command of the Legions to Galba or Vespasian The analogy which the Archbishop imagined that he had discovered between the case of a wrongheaded King and the case of a lunatic King will not bear a moment s examination It was plain that James was not in that state of mind in which if he had been a country gentleman or a merchant any tribunal would have held him incapable of executing a contract or a will He was of unsound mind only as all bad Kings are of unsound mind as Charles the First had been of unsound mind when he went to seize the five members as Charles the Second had been of unsound mind when he concluded the treaty of Dover If this sort of mental unsoundness did not justify subjects in withdrawing their obedience from princes the plan of a Regency was evidently indefensible If this sort of mental unsoundness did justify subjects in withdrawing their obedience from princes the doctrine of nonresistance was completely given up and all that any moderate Whig had ever contended for was fully admitted As to the oath of allegiance about which Sancroft and his disciples were so anxious one thing at least is clear that whoever might be right they were wrong The Whigs held that in the oath of allegiance certain conditions were implied that the King had violated these conditions and that the oath had therefore lost its force But if the Whig doctrine were false if the oath were still binding could men of sense really believe that they escaped the guilt of perjury by voting for a Regency Could they affirm that they bore true allegiance to James while they were in defiance of his protestations made before all Europe authorising another person to receive the royal revenues to summon and prorogue parliaments to create Dukes and Earls to name Bishops and judges to pardon offenders to command the forces of the state and to conclude treaties with foreign powers Had Pascal been able to find in all the folios of the Jesuitical casuists a sophism more contemptible than that which now as it seemed sufficed to quiet the consciences of the fathers of the Anglican Church Nothing could be more evident than that the plan of Regency could be defended only on Whig principles Between the rational supporters of that plan and the majority of the House of Commons there could be no dispute as to the question of right All that remained was a question of expediency And would any statesman seriously contend that it was expedient to constitute a government with two heads and to give to one of those heads regal power without regal dignity and to the other regal dignity without regal power It was notorious that such an arrangement even when made necessary by the infancy or insanity of a prince had serious disadvantages That times of Regency were times of weakness of trouble and of disaster was a truth proved by the whole history of England of France and of Scotland and had almost become a proverb Yet in a case of infancy or of insanity the King was at least passive He could not actively counterwork the Regent What was now proposed was that England should have two first magistrate of ripe age and sound mind waging with each other an irreconcilable war It was absurd to talk of leaving James merely the kingly name and depriving him of all the kingly power For the name was a part of the power The word King was a word of conjuration It was associated in the minds of many Englishmen with the idea of a mysterious character derived from above and in the minds of almost all Englishmen with the idea of legitimate and venerable authority Surely if the title carried with it such power those who maintained that James ought to be deprived of all power could not deny that he ought to be deprived of the title And how long was the anomalous government planned by the genius of Sancroft to last Every argument which could be urged for setting it up at all might be urged with equal force for retaining it to the end of time If the boy who had been carried into France was really born of the Queen he would hereafter inherit the divine and indefeasible right to be called King The same right would very probably be transmitted from Papist to Papist through the whole of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries Both the Houses had unanimously resolved that England should not be governed by a Papist It might well be therefore that from generation to generation Regents would continue to administer the government in the name of vagrant and mendicant Kings There was no doubt that the Regents must be appointed by Parliament The effect therefore of this contrivance a contrivance intended to preserve unimpaired the sacred principle of hereditary monarchy would be that the monarchy would become really elective Another unanswerable reason was urged against Sancroft s plan There was in the statute book a law which had been passed soon after the close of the long and bloody contest between the Houses of York and Lancaster and which had been framed for the purpose of averting calamities such as the alternate victories of those Houses had brought on the nobility and gentry of the realm By this law it was provided that no person should by adhering to a King in possession incur the penalties of treason When the regicides were brought to trial after the Restoration some of them insisted that their case lay within the equity of this act They had obeyed they said the government which was in possession and were therefore not traitors The Judges admitted that this would have been a good defence if the prisoners had acted under the authority of an usurper who like Henry the Fourth and Richard the Third bore the regal title but declared that such a defence could not avail men who had indicted sentenced and executed one who in the indictment in the sentence and in the death warrant was designated as King It followed therefore that whoever should support a Regent in opposition to James would run great risk of being hanged drawn and quartered if ever James should recover supreme power but that no person could without such a violation of law as Jeffreys himself would hardly venture to commit be punished for siding with a King who was reigning though wrongfully at Whitehall against a rightful King who was in exile at Saint Germains six hundred forty eight It should seem that these arguments admit of no reply and they were doubtless urged with force by Danby who had a wonderful power of making every subject which he treated clear to the dullest mind and by Halifax who in fertility of thought and brilliancy of diction had no rival among the orators of that age Yet so numerous and powerful were the Tories in the Upper House that notwithstanding the weakness of their case the defection of their leader and the ability of their opponents they very nearly carried the day A hundred Lords divided Forty nine voted for a Regency fifty one against it In the minority were the natural children of Charles the brothers in law of James the Dukes of Somerset and Ormond the Archbishop of York and eleven Bishops No prelate voted in the majority except Compton and Trelawney six hundred forty nine It was near nine in the evening before the House rose The following day was the thirtieth of January the anniversary of the death of Charles the First The great body of the Anglican clergy had during many years thought it a sacred duty to inculcate on that day the doctrines of nonresistance and passive obedience Their old sermons were now of little use and many divines were even in doubt whether they could venture to read the whole Liturgy The Lower House had declared that the throne was vacant The Upper had not yet expressed any opinion It was therefore not easy to decide whether the prayers for the sovereign ought to be used Every officiating minister took his own course In most of the churches of the capital the petitions for James were omitted but at Saint Margaret s Sharp Dean of Norwich who had been requested to preach before the Commons not only read to their faces the whole service as it stood in the book but before his sermon implored in his own words a blessing on the King and towards the close of his discourse declaimed against the Jesuitical doctrine that princes might lawfully be deposed by their subjects The Speaker that very afternoon complained to the House of this affront You pass a vote one day he said and on the next day it is contradicted from the pulpit in your own hearing Sharp was strenuously defended by the Tories and had friends even among the Whigs for it was not forgotten that he had incurred serious danger in the evil times by the courage with which in defiance of the royal injunction he had preached against Popery Sir Christopher Musgrave very ingeniously remarked that the House had not ordered the resolution which declared the throne vacant to be published Sharp therefore was not only not bound to know anything of that resolution but could not have taken notice of it without a breach of privilege for which he might have been called to the bar and reprimanded on his knees The majority felt that it was not wise at that conjuncture to quarrel with the clergy and the subject was suffered to drop six hundred fifty While the Commons were discussing Sharp s sermon the Lords had again gone into a committee on the state of the nation and had ordered the resolution which pronounced the throne vacant to be read clause by clause The first expression on which a debate arose was that which recognised the original contract between King and people It was not to be expected that the Tory peers would suffer a phrase which contained the quintessence of Whiggism to pass unchallenged A division took place and it was determined by fifty three votes to forty six that the words should stand The severe censure passed by the Commons on the administration of James was next considered and was approved without one dissentient voice Some verbal objections were made to the proposition that James had abdicated the government It was urged that he might more correctly be said to have deserted it This amendment was adopted it should seem with scarcely any debate and without a division By this time it was late and the Lords again adjourned six hundred fifty one Up to this moment the small body of peers which was under the guidance of Danby had acted in firm union with Halifax and the Whigs The effect of this union had been that the plan of Regency had been rejected and the doctrine of the original contract affirmed The proposition that James had ceased to be King had been the rallying point of the two parties which had made up the majority But from that point their path diverged The next question to be decided was whether the throne was vacant and this was a question not merely verbal but of grave practical importance If the throne was vacant the Estates of the Realm might place William in it If it was not vacant he could succeed to it only after his wife after Anne and after Anne s posterity It was according to the followers of Danby an established maxim that our country could not be even for a moment without a rightful prince The man might die but the magistrate was immortal The man might abdicate but the magistrate was irremoveable If these politicians said we once admit that the throne is vacant we admit that it is elective The sovereign whom we may place on it will be a sovereign not after the English but after the Polish fashion Even if we choose the very person who would reign by right of birth still that person will reign not by right of birth but in virtue of our choice and will take as a gift what ought to be regarded as an inheritance That salutary reverence with which the blood royal and the order of primogeniture have hitherto been regarded will be greatly diminished Still more serious will the evil be if we not only fill the throne by election but fill it with a prince who has doubtless the qualities of a great and good ruler and who has wrought a wonderful deliverance for us but who is not first nor even second in the order of succession If we once say that merit however eminent shall be a title to the crown we disturb the very foundations of our polity and furnish a precedent of which every ambitious warrior or statesman who may have rendered any great service to the public will be tempted to avail himself This danger we avoid if we logically follow out the principles of the constitution to their consequences There has been a demise of the crown At the instant of the demise the next heir became our lawful sovereign We consider the Princess of Orange as next heir and we hold that she ought without any delay to be proclaimed what she already is our Queen The Whigs replied that it was idle to apply ordinary rules to a country in a state of revolution that the great question now depending was not to be decided by the saws of pedantic Templars and that if it were to be so decided such saws might be quoted on one side as well as the other If it were a legal maxim that the throne could never be vacant it was also a legal maxim that a living man could have no heir James was still living How then could the Princess of Orange be his heir The truth was that the laws of England had made full provision for the succession when the power of a sovereign and his natural life terminated together but had made no provision for the very rare cases in which his power terminated before the close of his natural life and with one of those very rare cases the Convention had now to deal That James no longer filled the throne both Houses had pronounced Neither common law nor statute law designated any person as entitled to fill the throne between his demise and his decease It followed that the throne was vacant and that the Houses might invite the Prince of Orange to fill it That he was not next in order of birth was true but this was no disadvantage on the contrary it was a positive recommendation Hereditary monarchy was a good political institution but was by no means more sacred than other good political institutions Unfortunately bigoted and servile theologians had turned it into a religious mystery almost as awful and as incomprehensible as transubstantiation itself To keep the institution and yet to get rid of the abject and noxious superstitions with which it had of late years been associated and which had made it a curse instead of a blessing to society ought to be the first object of English statesmen and that object would be best attained by slightly deviating for a time from the general rule of descent and by then returning to it Many attempts were made to prevent an open breach between the party of the Prince and the party of the Princess A great meeting was held at the Earl of Devonshire s House and the dispute was warm Halifax was the chief speaker for William Danby for Mary Of the mind of Mary Danby knew nothing She had been some time expected in London but had been detained in Holland first by masses of ice which had blocked up the rivers and when the thaw came by strong westerly winds Had she arrived earlier the dispute would probably have been at once quieted Halifax on the other side had no authority to say anything in William s name The Prince true to his promise that he would leave the settlement of the government to the Convention had maintained an impenetrable reserve and had not suffered any word look or gesture indicative either of satisfaction or of displeasure to escape him One of his countrymen who had a large share of his confidence had been invited to the meeting and was earnestly pressed by the Peers to give them some information He long excused himself At last he so far yielded to their urgency as to say I can only guess at His Highness s mind If you wish to know what I guess I guess that he would not like to be his wife s gentleman usher but I know nothing I know something now however said Danby I know enough and too much He then departed and the assembly broke up six hundred fifty two On the thirty first of January the debate which had terminated thus in private was publicly renewed in the House of Peers That day had been fixed for the national thanksgiving An office had been drawn up for the occasion by several Bishops among whom were Ken and Sprat It is perfectly free both from the adulation and from the malignity by which such compositions were in that age too often deformed and sustains better perhaps than any occasional service which has been framed during two centuries a comparison with that great model of chaste lofty and pathetic eloquence the Book of Common Prayer The Lords went in the morning to Westminster Abbey The Commons had desired Burnet to preach before them at Saint Margaret s He was not likely to fall into the same error which had been committed in the same place on the preceding day His vigorous and animated discourse doubtless called forth the loud hums of his auditors It was not only printed by command of the House but was translated into French for the edification of foreign Protestants six hundred fifty three The day closed with the festivities usual on such occasions The whole town shone brightly with fireworks and bonfires the roar of guns and the pealing of bells lasted till the night was far spent but before the lights were extinct and the streets silent an event had taken place which threw a damp on the public joy The Peers had repaired from the Abbey to their house and had resumed the discussion on the state of the nation The last words of the resolution of the Commons were taken into consideration and it soon became clear that the majority was not disposed to assent to those words To near fifty Lords who held that the regal title still belonged to James were now added seven or eight who held that it had already devolved on Mary The Whigs finding themselves outnumbered tried to compromise the dispute They proposed to omit the words which pronounced the throne vacant and simply to declare the Prince and Princess King and Queen It was manifest that such a declaration implied though it did not expressly affirm all that the Tories were unwilling to concede For nobody could pretend that William had succeeded to the regal office by right of birth To pass a resolution acknowledging him as King was therefore an act of election and how could there be an election without a vacancy The proposition of the Whig Lords was rejected by fifty two votes to forty seven The question was then put whether the throne was vacant The contents were only forty one the noncontents fifty five Of the minority thirty six protested six hundred fifty four During the two following days London was in an unquiet and anxious state The Tories began to hope that they might be able again to bring forward their favourite plan of Regency with better success Perhaps the Prince himself when he found that he had no chance of wearing the crown might prefer Sancroft s scheme to Danby s It was better doubtless to be a King than to be a Regent but it was better to be a Regent than to be a gentleman usher On the other side the lower and fiercer class of Whigs the old emissaries of Shaftesbury the old associates of College began to stir in the City Crowds assembled in Palace Yard and held threatening language Lord Lovelace who was suspected of having encouraged these assemblages informed the Peers that he was charged with a petition requesting them instantly to declare the Prince and Princess of Orange King and Queen He was asked by whom the petition was signed There are no hands to it yet he answered but when I bring it here next there shall be hands enough This menace alarmed and disgusted his own party The leading Whigs were in truth even more anxious than the Tories that the deliberations of the Convention should be perfectly free and that it should not be in the power of any adherent of James to allege that either House had acted under force A petition similar to that which had been entrusted to Lovelace was brought into the House of Commons but was contemptuously rejected Maynard was foremost in protesting against the attempt of the rabble in the streets to overawe the Estates of the Realm William sent for Lovelace expostulated with him strongly and ordered the magistrates to act with vigour against all unlawful assemblies six hundred fifty five Nothing in the history of our revolution is more deserving of admiration and of imitation than the manner in which the two parties in the Convention at the very moment at which their disputes ran highest joined like one man to resist the dictation of the mob of the capital But though the Whigs were fully determined to maintain order and to respect the freedom of debate they were equally determined to make no concession On Saturday the second of February the Commons without a division resolved to adhere to their resolution as it originally stood James as usual came to the help of his enemies A letter from him to the Convention had just arrived in London It had been transmitted to Preston by the apostate Melfort who was now high in favour at Saint Germains The name of Melfort was an abomination to every Churchman That he was still a confidential minister was alone sufficient to prove that his master s folly and perverseness were incurable No member of either House ventured to propose that a paper which came from such a quarter should be read The contents however were well known to all the town His Majesty exhorted the Lords and Commons not to despair of his clemency and graciously assured them that he would pardon those who had betrayed him some few excepted whom he did not name How was it possible to do any thing for a prince who vanquished deserted banished living on alms told those who were the arbiters of his fate that if they would set him on his throne again he would hang only a few of them six hundred fifty six The contest between the two branches of the legislature lasted some days longer On Monday the fourth of February the Peers resolved that they would insist on their amendments but a protest to which thirty nine names were subscribed was entered on the journals six hundred fifty seven On the following day the Tories determined to try their strength in the Lower House They mustered there in great force A motion was made to agree to the amendments of the Lords Those who were for the plan of Sancroft and those who were for the plan of Danby divided together but they were beaten by two hundred and eighty two votes to a hundred and fifty one The House then resolved to request a free conference with the Lords six hundred fifty eight At the same time strenuous efforts were making without the walls of Parliament to bring the dispute between the two branches of the legislature to a close Burnet thought that the importance of the crisis justified him in publishing the great secret which the Princess had confided to him He knew he said from her own lips that it had long been her full determination even if she came to the throne in the regular course of descent to surrender her power with the sanction of Parliament into the hands of her husband Danby received from her an earnest and almost angry reprimand She was she wrote the Prince s wife she had no other wish than to be subject to him the most cruel injury that could be done to her would be to set her up as his competitor and she never could regard any person who took such a course as her true friend six hundred fifty nine The Tories had still one hope Anne might insist on her own rights and on those of her children No effort was spared to stimulate her ambition and to alarm her conscience Her uncle Clarendon was especially active A few weeks only had elapsed since the hope of wealth and greatness had impelled him to bely the boastful professions of his whole life to desert the royal cause to join with the Wildmans and Fergusons nay to propose that the King should be sent a prisoner to a foreign land and immured in a fortress begirt by pestilential marshes The lure which had produced this strange transformation was the Viceroyalty of Ireland Soon however it appeared that the proselyte had little chance of obtaining the splendid prize on which his heart was set He found that others were consulted on Irish affairs His advice was never asked and when obtrusively and importunately offered was coldly received He repaired many times to Saint James s Palace but could scarcely obtain a word or a look One day the Prince was writing another day he wanted fresh air and must ride in the Park on a third he was closeted with officers on military business and could see nobody Clarendon saw that he was not likely to gain anything by the sacrifice of his principles and determined to take them back again In December ambition had converted him into a rebel In January disappointment reconverted him into a royalist The uneasy consciousness that he had not been a consistent Tory gave a peculiar acrimony to his Toryism six hundred sixty In the House of Lords he had done all in his power to prevent a settlement He now exerted for the same end all his influence over the Princess Anne But his influence over her was small indeed when compared with that of the Churchills who wisely called to their help two powerful allies Tillotson who as a spiritual director had at that time immense authority and Lady Russell whose noble and gentle virtues proved by the most cruel of all trials had gained for her the reputation of a saint The Princess of Denmark it was soon known was willing that William should reign for life and it was evident that to defend the cause of the daughters of James against themselves was a hopeless task six hundred sixty one And now William thought that the time had come when he ought to explain himself He accordingly sent for Halifax Danby Shrewsbury and some other political leaders of great note and with that air of stoical apathy under which he had from a boy been in the habit of concealing his strongest emotions addressed to them a few deeply meditated and weighty words He had hitherto he said remained silent he had used neither solicitation nor menace he had not even suffered a hint of his opinions or wishes to get abroad but a crisis had now arrived at which it was necessary for him to declare his intentions He had no right and no wish to dictate to the Convention All that he claimed was the privilege of declining any office which he felt that he could not hold with honour to himself and with benefit to the public A strong party was for a Regency It was for the Houses to determine whether such an arrrangement would be for the interest of the nation He had a decided opinion on that point and he thought it right to say distinctly that he would not be Regent Another party was for placing the Princess on the throne and for giving to him during her life the title of King and such a share in the administration as she might be pleased to allow him He could not stoop to such a post He esteemed the Princess as much as it was possible for man to esteem woman but not even from her would he accept a subordinate and a precarious place in the government He was so made that he could not submit to be tied to the apron strings even of the best of wives He did not desire to take any part in English affairs but if he did consent to take a part there was one part only which he could usefully or honourably take If the Estates offered him the crown for life he would accept it If not he should without repining return to his native country He concluded by saying that he thought it reasonable that the Lady Anne and her posterity should be preferred in the succession to any children whom he might have by any other wife than the Lady Mary six hundred sixty two The meeting broke up and what the Prince had said was in a few hours known all over London That he must be King was now clear The only question was whether he should hold the regal dignity alone or conjointly with the Princess Halifax and a few other politicians who saw in a strong light the danger of dividing the supreme executive authority thought it desirable that during William s life Mary should be only Queen Consort and a subject But this arrangement though much might doubtless be said for it in argument shocked the general feeling even of those Englishmen who were most attached to the Prince His wife had given an unprecedented proof of conjugal submission and affection and the very least return that could be made to her would be to bestow on her the dignity of Queen Regnant William Herbert one of the most zealous of the Prince s adherents was so much exasperated that he sprang out of the bed to which he was confined by gout and vehemently declared that he never would have drawn a sword in His Highness s cause if he had foreseen that so shameful an arrangement would be made No person took the matter up so eagerly as Burnet His blood boiled at the wrong done to his kind patroness He expostulated vehemently with Bentinck and begged to be permitted to resign the chaplainship While I am His Highness s servant said the brave and honest divine it would be unseemly in me to oppose any plan which may have his countenance I therefore desire to be set free that I may fight the Princess s battle with every faculty that God has given me Bentinck prevailed on Burnet to defer an open declaration of hostilities till William s resolution should be distinctly known In a few hours the scheme which had excited so much resentment was entirely given up and all those who considered James as no longer king were agreed as to the way in which the throne must be filled William and Mary must be King and Queen The heads of both must appear together on the coin writs must run in the names of both both must enjoy all the personal dignities and immunities of royalty but the administration which could not be safely divided must belong to William alone six hundred sixty three And now the time arrived for the free conference between the Houses The managers for the Lords in their robes took their seats along one side of the table in the Painted Chamber but the crowd of members of the House of Commons on the other side was so great that the gentlemen who were to argue the question in vain tried to get through It was not without much difficulty and long delay that the Serjeant at Arms was able to clear a passage six hundred sixty four At length the discussion began A full report of the speeches on both sides has come down to us There are few students of history who have not taken up that report with eager curiosity and laid it down with disappointment The question between the Houses was argued on both sides as a question of law The objections which the Lords made to the resolution of the Commons were verbal and technical and were met by verbal and technical answers Somers vindicated the use of the word abdication by quotations from Grotius and Brissonius Spigelius and Bartolus When he was challenged to show any authority for the proposition that England could be without a sovereign he produced the Parliament roll of the year thirteen ninety nine in which it was expressly set forth that the kingly office was vacant during the interval between the resignation of Richard the Second and the enthroning of Henry the Fourth The Lords replied by producing the Parliament roll of the first year of Edward the Fourth from which it appeared that the record of thirteen ninety nine had been solemnly annulled They therefore maintained that the precedent on which Somers relied was no longer valid Treby then came to Somers s assistance and brought forth the Parliament roll of the first year of Henry the Seventh which repealed the act of Edward the Fourth and consequently restored the validity of the record of thirteen ninety nine After a colloquy of several hours the disputants separated six hundred sixty five The Lords assembled in their own house It was well understood that they were about to yield and that the conference had been a mere form The friends of Mary had found that by setting her up as her husband s rival they had deeply displeased her Some of the Peers who had formerly voted for a Regency had determined to absent themselves or to support the resolution of the Lower House Their opinion they said was unchanged but any government was better than no government and the country could not bear a prolongation of this agony of suspense Even Nottingham who in the Painted Chamber had taken the lead against the Commons declared that though his own conscience would not suffer him to give way he was glad that the consciences of other men were less squeamish Several Lords who had not yet voted in the Convention had been induced to attend Lord Lexington who had just hurried over from the Continent the Earl of Lincoln who was half mad the Earl of Carlisle who limped in on crutches and the Bishop of Durham who had been in hiding and had intended to fly beyond sea but had received an intimation that if he would vote for the settling of the government his conduct in the Ecclesiastical Commission should not be remembered against him Danby desirous to heal the schism which he had caused exhorted the House in a speech distinguished by even more than his usual ability not to persevere in a contest which might be fatal to the state He was strenuously supported by Halifax The spirit of the opposite party was quelled When the question was put whether King James had abdicated the government only three lords said Not Content On the question whether the throne was vacant a division was demanded The Contents were sixty two the Not Contents forty seven It was immediately proposed and carried without a division that the Prince and Princess of Orange should be declared King and Queen of England six hundred sixty six Nottingham then moved that the wording of the oaths of allegiance and supremacy should be altered in such a way that they might be conscientiously taken by persons who like himself disapproved of what the Convention had done and yet fully purposed to be loyal and dutiful subjects of the new sovereigns To this proposition no objection was made Indeed there can be little doubt that there was an understanding on the subject between the Whig leaders and those Tory Lords whose votes had turned the scale on the last division The new oaths were sent down to the Commons together with the resolution that the Prince and Princess should be declared King and Queen six hundred sixty seven It was now known to whom the crown would be given On what conditions it should be given still remained to be decided The Commons had appointed a committee to consider what steps it might be advisable to take in order to secure law and liberty against the aggressions of future sovereigns and the committee had made a report six hundred sixty eight This report recommended first that those great principles of the constitution which had been violated by the dethroned King should be solemnly asserted and secondly that many new laws should be enacted for the purpose of curbing the prerogative and purifying the administration of justice Most of the suggestions of the committee were excellent but it was utterly impossible that the Houses could in a month or even in a year deal properly with matters so numerous so various and so important It was proposed among other things that the militia should be remodelled that the power which the sovereign possessed of proroguing and dissolving Parliaments should be restricted that the duration of Parliaments should be limited that the royal pardon should no longer be pleadable to a parliamentary impeachment that toleration should be granted to Protestant Dissenters that the crime of high treason should be more precisely defined that trials for high treason should be conducted in a manner more favourable to innocence that the judges should hold their places for life that the mode of appointing Sheriffs should be altered that juries should be nominated in such a way as might exclude partiality and corruption that the practice of filing criminal informations in the King s Bench should be abolished that the Court of Chancery should be reformed that the fees of public functionaries should be regulated and that the law of Quo Warranto should be amended It was evident that cautious and deliberate legislation on these subjects must be the work of more than one laborious session and it was equally evident that hasty and crude legislation on subjects so grave could not but produce new grievances worse than those which it might remove If the committee meant to give a list of the reforms which ought to be accomplished before the throne was filled the list was absurdly long If on the other hand the committee meant to give a list of all the reforms which the legislature would do well to make in proper season the list was strangely imperfect Indeed as soon as the report had been read member after member rose to suggest some addition It was moved and carried that the selling of offices should be prohibited that the Habeas Corpus Act should be made more efficient and that the law of Mandamus should be revised One gentleman fell on the chimneymen another on the excisemen and the House resolved that the malpractices of both chimneymen and excisemen should be restrained It is a most remarkable circumstance that while the whole political military judicial and fiscal system of the kingdom was thus passed in review not a single representative of the people proposed the repeal of the statute which subjected the press to a censorship It was not yet understood even by the most enlightened men that the liberty of discussion is the chief safeguard of all other liberties six hundred sixty nine The House was greatly perplexed Some orators vehemently said that too much time had already been lost and that the government ought to be settled without the delay of a day Society was unquiet trade was languishing the English colony in Ireland was in imminent danger of perishing a foreign war was impending the exiled King might in a few weeks be at Dublin with a French army and from Dublin he might soon cross to Chester Was it not insanity at such a crisis to leave the throne unfilled and while the very existence of Parliaments was in jeopardy to waste time in debating whether Parliaments should be prorogued by the sovereign or by themselves On the other side it was asked whether the Convention could think that it had fulfilled its mission by merely pulling down one prince and putting up another Surely now or never was the time to secure public liberty by such fences as might effectually prevent the encroachments of prerogative six hundred seventy There was doubtless great weight in what was urged on both sides The able chiefs of the Whig party among whom Somers was fast rising to ascendency proposed a middle course The House had they said two objects in view which ought to be kept distinct One object was to secure the old polity of the realm against illegal attacks the other was to improve that polity by legal reforms The former object might be attained by solemnly putting on record in the resolution which called the new sovereigns to the throne the claim of the English nation to its ancient franchises so that the King might hold his crown and the people their privileges by one and the same title deed The latter object would require a whole volume of elaborate statutes The former object might be attained in a day the latter scarcely in five years As to the former object all parties were agreed as to the latter there were innumerable varieties of opinion No member of either House would hesitate for a moment to vote that the King could not levy taxes without the consent of Parliament but it would be hardly possible to frame any new law of procedure in cases of high treason which would not give rise to long debate and be condemned by some persons as unjust to the prisoner and by others as unjust to the crown The business of an extraordinary convention of the Estates of the Realm was not to do the ordinary work of Parliaments to regulate the fees of masters in Chancery and to provide against the exactions of gaugers but to put right the great machine of government When this had been done it would be time to inquire what improvement our institutions needed nor would anything be risked by delay for no sovereign who reigned merely by the choice of the nation could long refuse his assent to any improvement which the nation speaking through its representatives demanded On these grounds the Commons wisely determined to postpone all reforms till the ancient constitution of the kingdom should have been restored in all its parts and forthwith to fill the throne without imposing on William and Mary any other obligation than that of governing according to the existing laws of England In order that the questions which had been in dispute between the Stuarts and the nation might never again be stirred it was determined that the instrument by which the Prince and Princess of Orange were called to the throne and by which the order of succession was settled should set forth in the most distinct and solemn manner the fundamental principles of the constitution This instrument known by the name of the Declaration of Right was prepared by a committee of which Somers was chairman The fact that the low born young barrister was appointed to so honourable and important a post in a Parliament filled with able and experienced men only ten days after he had spoken in the House of Commons for the first time sufficiently proves the superiority of his abilities In a few hours the Declaration was framed and approved by the Commons The Lords assented to it with some amendments of no great importance six hundred seventy one The Declaration began by recapitulating the crimes and errors which had made a revolution necessary James had invaded the province of the legislature had treated modest petitioning as a crime had oppressed the Church by means of an illegal tribunal had without the consent of Parliament levied taxes and maintained a standing army in time of peace had violated the freedom of election and perverted the course of justice Proceedings which could lawfully be questioned only in Parliament had been made the subjects of prosecution in the King s Bench Partial and corrupt juries had been returned excessive bail had been required from prisoners excessive fines had been imposed barbarous and unusual punishments had been inflicted the estates of accused persons had been granted away before conviction He by whose authority these things had been done had abdicated the government The Prince of Orange whom God had made the glorious instrument of delivering the nation from superstition and tyranny had invited the Estates of the Realm to meet and to take counsel together for the securing of religion of law and of freedom The Lords and Commons having deliberated had resolved that they would first after the example of their ancestors assert the ancient rights and liberties of England Therefore it was declared that the dispensing power lately assumed and exercised had no legal existence that without grant of Parliament no money could be exacted by the sovereign from the subject that without consent of Parliament no standing army could be kept up in time of peace The right of subjects to petition the right of electors to choose representatives freely the right of Parliaments to freedom of debate the right of the nation to a pure and merciful administration of justice according to the spirit of its own mild laws were solemnly affirmed All these things the Convention claimed in the name of the whole nation as the undoubted inheritance of Englishmen Having thus vindicated the principles of the constitution the Lords and Commons in the entire confidence that the deliverer would hold sacred the laws and liberties which he had saved resolved that William and Mary Prince and Princess of Orange should be declared King and Queen of England for their joint and separate lives and that during their joint lives the administration of the government should be in the Prince alone After them the crown was settled on the posterity of Mary then on Anne and her posterity and then on the posterity of William By this time the wind had ceased to blow from the west The ship in which the Princess of Orange had embarked lay off Margate on the eleventh of February and on the following morning anchored at Greenwich six hundred seventy two She was received with many signs of joy and affection but her demeanour shocked the Tories and was not thought faultless even by the Whigs A young woman placed by a destiny as mournful and awful as that which brooded over the fabled houses of Labdacus and Pelops in such a situation that she could not without violating her duty to her God her husband and her country refuse to take her seat on the throne from which her father had just been hurled should have been sad or at least serious Mary was not merely in high but in extravagant spirits She entered Whitehall it was asserted with a girlish delight at being mistress of so fine a house ran about the rooms peeped into the closets and examined the quilt of the state bed without seeming to remember by whom those magnificent apartments had last been occupied Burnet who had till then thought her an angel in human form could not on this occasion refrain from blaming her He was the more astonished because when he took leave of her at the Hague she had though fully convinced that she was in the path of duty been deeply dejected To him as to her spiritual guide she afterwards explained her conduct William had written to inform her that some of those who had tried to separate her interest from his still continued their machinations they gave it out that she thought herself wronged and if she wore a gloomy countenance the report would be confirmed He therefore intreated her to make her first appearance with an air of cheerfulness Her heart she said was far indeed from cheerful but she had done her best and as she was afraid of not sustaining well a part which was uncongenial to her feelings she had overacted it Her deportment was the subject of reams of scurrility in prose and verse it lowered her in the opinion of some whose esteem she valued nor did the world know till she was beyond the reach of praise and censure that the conduct which had brought on her the reproach of levity and insensibility was really a signal instance of that perfect disinterestedness and selfdevotion of which man seems to be incapable but which is sometimes found in woman six hundred seventy three On the morning of Wednesday the thirteenth of February the court of Whitehall and all the neighbouring streets were filled with gazers The magnificent Banqueting House the masterpiece of Inigo embellished by masterpieces of Rubens had been prepared for a great ceremony The walls were lined by the yeomen of the guard Near the northern door on the right hand a large number of Peers had assembled On the left were the Commons with their Speaker attended by the mace The southern door opened and the Prince and Princess of Orange side by side entered and took their place under the canopy of state Both Houses approached bowing low William and Mary advanced a few steps Halifax on the right and Powle on the left stood forth and Halifax spoke The Convention he said had agreed to a resolution which he prayed Their Highnesses to hear They signified their assent and the clerk of the House of Lords read in a loud voice the Declaration of Right When he had concluded Halifax in the name of all the Estates of the Realm requested the Prince and Princess to accept the crown William in his own name and in that of his wife answered that the crown was in their estimation the more valuable because it was presented to them as a token of the confidence of the nation We thankfully accept he said what you have offered us Then for himself he assured them that the laws of England which he had once already vindicated should be the rules of his conduct that it should be his study to promote the welfare of the kingdom and that as to the means of doing so he should constantly recur to the advice of the Houses and should be disposed to trust their judgment rather than his own six hundred seventy four These words were received with a shout of joy which was heard in the streets below and was instantly answered by huzzas from many thousands of voices The Lords and Commons then reverently retired from the Banqueting House and went in procession to the great gate of Whitehall where the heralds and pursuivants were waiting in their gorgeous tabards All the space as far as Charing Cross was one sea of heads The kettle drums struck up the trumpets pealed and Garter King at arms in a loud voice proclaimed the Prince and Princess of Orange King and Queen of England charged all Englishmen to pay from that moment faith and true allegiance to the new sovereigns and besought God who had already wrought so signal a deliverance for our Church and nation to bless William and Mary with a long and happy reign six hundred seventy five Thus was consummated the English Revolution When we compare it with those revolutions which have during the last sixty years overthrown so many ancient governments we cannot but be struck by its peculiar character Why that character was so peculiar is sufficiently obvious and yet seems not to have been always understood either by eulogists or by censors The continental revolutions of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries took place in countries where all trace of the limited monarchy of the middle ages had long been effaced The right of the prince to make laws and to levy money had during many generations been undisputed His throne was guarded by a great regular army His administration could not without extreme peril be blamed even in the mildest terms His subjects held their personal liberty by no other tenure than his pleasure Not a single institution was left which had within the memory of the oldest man afforded efficient protection to the subject against the utmost excess of tyranny Those great councils which had once curbed the regal power had sunk into oblivion Their composition and their privileges were known only to antiquaries We cannot wonder therefore that when men who had been thus ruled succeeded in wresting supreme power from a government which they had long in secret hated they should have been impatient to demolish and unable to construct that they should have been fascinated by every specious novelty that they should have proscribed every title ceremony and phrase associated with the old system and that turning away with disgust from their own national precedents and traditions they should have sought for principles of government in the writings of theorists or aped with ignorant and ungraceful affectation the patriots of Athens and Rome As little can we wonder that the violent action of the revolutionary spirit should have been followed by reaction equally violent and that confusion should speedily have engendered despotism sterner than that from which it had sprung Had we been in the same situation had Strafford succeeded in his favourite scheme of Thorough had he formed an army as numerous and as well disciplined as that which a few years later was formed by Cromwell had a series of judicial decisions similar to that which was pronounced by the Exchequer Chamber in the case of shipmoney transferred to the crown the right of taxing the people had the Star Chamber and the High Commission continued to fine mutilate and imprison every man who dared to raise his voice against the government had the press been as completely enslaved here as at Vienna or at Naples had our Kings gradually drawn to themselves the whole legislative power had six generations of Englishmen passed away without a single session of parliament and had we then at length risen up in some moment of wild excitement against our masters what an outbreak would that have been With what a crash heard and felt to the farthest ends of the world would the whole vast fabric of society have fallen How many thousands of exiles once the most prosperous and the most refined members of this great community would have begged their bread in continental cities or have sheltered their heads under huts of bark in the uncleared forests of America How often should we have seen the pavement of London piled up in barricades the houses dinted with bullets the gutters foaming with blood How many times should we have rushed wildly from extreme to extreme sought refuge from anarchy in despotism and been again driven by despotism into anarchy How many years of blood and confusion would it have cost us to learn the very rudiments of political science How many childish theories would have duped us How many rude and ill poised constitutions should we have set up only to see them tumble down Happy would it have been for us if a sharp discipline of half a century had sufficed to educate us into a capacity of enjoying true freedom These calamities our Revolution averted It was a revolution strictly defensive and had prescription and legitimacy on its side Here and here only a limited monarchy of the thirteenth century had come down unimpaired to the seventeenth century Our parliamentary institutions were in full vigour The main principles of our government were excellent They were not indeed formally and exactly set forth in a single written instrument but they were to be found scattered over our ancient and noble statutes and what was of far greater moment they had been engraven on the hearts of Englishmen during four hundred years That without the consent of the representatives of the nation no legislative act could be passed no tax imposed no regular soldiery kept up that no man could be imprisoned even for a day by the arbitrary will of the sovereign that no tool of power could plead the royal command as a justification for violating any right of the humblest subject were held both by Whigs and Tories to be fundamental laws of the realm A realm of which these were the fundamental laws stood in no need of a new constitution But though a new constitution was not needed it was plain that changes were required The misgovernment of the Stuarts and the troubles which that misgovernment had produced sufficiently proved that there was somewhere a defect in our polity and that defect it was the duty of the Convention to discover and to supply Some questions of great moment were still open to dispute Our constitution had begun to exist in times when statesmen were not much accustomed to frame exact definitions Anomalies therefore inconsistent with its principles and dangerous to its very existence had sprung up almost imperceptibly and not having during many years caused any serious inconvenience had gradually acquired the force of prescription The remedy for these evils was to assert the rights of the people in such language as should terminate all controversy and to declare that no precedent could justify any violation of those rights When this had been done it would be impossible for our rulers to misunderstand the law but unless something more were done it was by no means improbable that they might violate it Unhappily the Church had long taught the nation that hereditary monarchy alone among our institutions was divine and inviolable that the right of the House of Commons to a share in the legislative power was a right merely human but that the right of the King to the obedience of his people was from above that the Great Charter was a statute which might be repealed by those who had made it but that the rule which called the princes of the blood royal to the throne in order of succession was of celestial origin and that any Act of Parliament inconsistent with that rule was a nullity It is evident that in a society in which such superstitions prevail constitutional freedom must ever be insecure A power which is regarded merely as the ordinance of man cannot be an efficient check on a power which is regarded as the ordinance of God It is vain to hope that laws however excellent will permanently restrain a King who in his own opinion and in that of a great part of his people has an authority infinitely higher in kind than the authority which belongs to those laws To deprive royalty of these mysterious attributes and to establish the principle that Kings reigned by a right in no respect differing from the right by which freeholders chose knights of the shire or from the right by which judges granted writs of Habeas Corpus was absolutely necessary to the security of our liberties Thus the Convention had two great duties to perform The first was to clear the fundamental laws of the realm from ambiguity The second was to eradicate from the minds both of the governors and of the governed the false and pernicious notion that the royal prerogative was something more sublime and holy than those fundamental laws The former object was attained by the solemn recital and claim with which the Declaration of Right commences the latter by the resolution which pronounced the throne vacant and invited William and Mary to fill it The change seems small Not a single flower of the crown was touched Not a single new right was given to the people The whole English law substantive and adjective was in the judgment of all the greatest lawyers of Holt and Treby of Maynard and Somers exactly the same after the Revolution as before it Some controverted points had been decided according to the sense of the best jurists and there had been a slight deviation from the ordinary course of succession This was all and this was enough As our Revolution was a vindication of ancient rights so it was conducted with strict attention to ancient formalities In almost every word and act may be discerned a profound reverence for the past The Estates of the Realm deliberated in the old halls and according to the old rules Powle was conducted to his chair between his mover and his seconder with the accustomed forms The Serjeant with his mace brought up the messengers of the Lords to the table of the Commons and the three obeisances were duly made The conference was held with all the antique ceremonial On one side of the table in the Painted Chamber the managers of the Lords sate covered and robed in ermine and gold The managers of the Commons stood bareheaded on the other side The speeches present an almost ludicrous contrast to the revolutionary oratory of every other country Both the English parties agreed in treating with solemn respect the ancient constitutional traditions of the state The only question was in what sense those traditions were to be understood The assertors of liberty said not a word about the natural equality of men and the inalienable sovereignty of the people about Harmodius or Timoleon Brutus the elder or Brutus the younger When they were told that by the English law the crown at the moment of a demise must descend to the next heir they answered that by the English law a living man could have no heir When they were told that there was no precedent for declaring the throne vacant they produced from among the records in the Tower a roll of parchment near three hundred years old on which in quaint characters and barbarous Latin it was recorded that the Estates of the Realm had declared vacant the throne of a perfidious and tyrannical Plantagenet When at length the dispute had been accommodated the new sovereigns were proclaimed with the old pageantry All the fantastic pomp of heraldry was there Clarencieux and Norroy Portcullis and Rouge Dragon the trumpets the banners the grotesque coats embroidered with lions and lilies The title of King of France assumed by the conqueror of Cressy was not omitted in the royal style To us who have lived in the year eighteen forty eight it may seem almost an abuse of terms to call a proceeding conducted with so much deliberation with so much sobriety and with such minute attention to prescriptive etiquette by the terrible name of Revolution And yet this revolution of all revolutions the least violent has been of all revolutions the most beneficent It finally decided the great question whether the popular element which had ever since the age of Fitzwalter and De Montfort been found in the English polity should be destroyed by the monarchical element or should be suffered to develope itself freely and to become dominant The strife between the two principles had been long fierce and doubtful It had lasted through four reigns It had produced seditions impeachments rebellions battles sieges proscriptions judicial massacres Sometimes liberty sometimes royalty had seemed to be on the point of perishing During many years one half of the energy of England had been employed in counteracting the other half The executive power and the legislative power had so effectually impeded each other that the state had been of no account in Europe The King at Arms who proclaimed William and Mary before Whitehall Gate did in truth announce that this great struggle was over that there was entire union between the throne and the Parliament that England long dependent and degraded was again a power of the first rank that the ancient laws by which the prerogative was bounded would henceforth be held as sacred as the prerogative itself and would be followed out to all their consequences that the executive administration would be conducted in conformity with the sense of the representatives of the nation and that no reform which the two Houses should after mature deliberation propose would be obstinately withstood by the sovereign The Declaration of Right though it made nothing law which had not been law before contained the germ of the law which gave religious freedom to the Dissenter of the law which secured the independence of the judges of the law which limited the duration of Parliaments of the law which placed the liberty of the press under the protection of juries of the law which prohibited the slave trade of the law which abolished the sacramental test of the law which relieved the Roman Catholics from civil disabilities of the law which reformed the representative system of every good law which has been passed during a hundred and sixty years of every good law which may hereafter in the course of ages be found necessary to promote the public weal and to satisfy the demands of public opinion The highest eulogy which can be pronounced on the revolution of sixteen eighty eight is this that it was our last revolution Several generations have now passed away since any wise and patriotic Englishman has meditated resistance to the established government In all honest and reflecting minds there is a conviction daily strengthened by experience that the means of effecting every improvement which the constitution requires may be found within the constitution itself Now if ever we ought to be able to appreciate the whole importance of the stand which was made by our forefathers against the House of Stuart All around us the world is convulsed by the agonies of great nations Governments which lately seemed likely to stand during ages have been on a sudden shaken and overthrown The proudest capitals of Western Europe have streamed with civil blood All evil passions the thirst of gain and the thirst of vengeance the antipathy of class to class the antipathy of race to race have broken loose from the control of divine and human laws Fear and anxiety have clouded the faces and depressed the hearts of millions Trade has been suspended and industry paralysed The rich have become poor and the poor have become poorer Doctrines hostile to all sciences to all arts to all industry to all domestic charities doctrines which if carried into effect would in thirty years undo all that thirty centuries have done for mankind and would make the fairest provinces of France and Germany as savage as Congo or Patagonia have been avowed from the tribune and defended by the sword Europe has been threatened with subjugation by barbarians compared with whom the barbarians who marched under Attila and Alboin were enlightened and humane The truest friends of the people have with deep sorrow owned that interests more precious than any political privileges were in jeopardy and that it might be necessary to sacrifice even liberty in order to save civilisation Meanwhile in our island the regular course of government has never been for a day interrupted The few bad men who longed for license and plunder have not had the courage to confront for one moment the strength of a loyal nation rallied in firm array round a parental throne And if it be asked what has made us to differ from others the answer is that we never lost what others are wildly and blindly seeking to regain It is because we had a preserving revolution in the seventeenth century that we have not had a destroying revolution in the nineteenth It is because we had freedom in the midst of servitude that we have order in the midst of anarchy For the authority of law for the security of property for the peace of our streets for the happiness of our houses our gratitude is due under Him who raises and pulls down nations at his pleasure to the Long Parliament to the

this controversy a Jesuit named Andrew Patton whom mister Oliver in his biography of the Order pronounces to have been a man of distinguished ability very frankly owns his deficiencies A P having been eighteen years out of his own country pretends not yet to any perfection of the English expression or orthography His orthography is indeed deplorable In one of his letters wright is put for write woed for would He challenged Tenison to dispute with him in Latin that they might be on equal terms In a contemporary satire entitled The Advice is the following couplet Send Pulton to be lashed at Bushy s school That he in print no longer play the fool Another Roman Catholic named William Clench wrote a treatise on the Pope s supremacy and dedicated it to the Queen in Italian The following specimen of his style may suffice O del sagro marito fortunata consorte O dolce alleviamento d affari alti O grato ristoro di pensieri noiosi nel cui petto latteo lucente specchio d illibata matronal pudicizia nel cui seno odorato come in porto damor si ritira il Giacomo O beata regia coppia O felice inserto tra l invincibil leoni e le candide aquile Clench s English is of a piece with his Tuscan For example Peter signifies an inexpugnable rock able to evacuate all the plots of hell s divan and naufragate all the lurid designs of empoisoned heretics Another Roman Catholic treatise entitled The

in the government are perfect and cannot fail but his person being human and mortal and not otherwise privileged than the rest of mankind is subject to all the defects and failings of it He may therefore be incapable of directing the government and dispensing the public treasure c either by absence by infancy lunacy deliracy or apathy whether by nature or casual infirmity or lastly by some invincible prejudices of mind contracted and fixed by education and habit with unalterable resolutions superinduced in matters wholly inconsistent and incompatible with the laws religion peace and true policy of the kingdom In all these cases I say there must be some one or more persons appointed to supply such defect and vicariously to him and by his power and authority to direct public affairs And this done I say further that all proceedings authorities commissions grants c issued as formerly are legal and valid to all intents and the people s allegiance is the same still their oaths and obligations no way thwarted So long as the government moves by the Kings authority and in his name all those sacred ties and settled forms of proceedings are kept and no man s conscience
