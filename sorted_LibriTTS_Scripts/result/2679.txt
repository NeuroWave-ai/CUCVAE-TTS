takes us a rather conservative estimate is fifty hours to get any etext selected entered proofread edited copyright searched and analyzed the copyright letters written et cetera This projected audience is one hundred million readers If our value per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce two dollars million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty six text files per month or four hundred thirty two more Etexts in nineteen ninety nine for a total of two thousand If these reach just ten of the computerized population then the total should reach over two hundred billion Etexts given away this year The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext Files by December thirty one two thousand one ten thousand x one hundred million one Trillion This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers which is only five of the present number of computer users At our revised rates of production we will reach only one third of that goal by

none	none	and T W HIGGINSON PREFACE 
7245_104886_000007_000000	train-clean-360	The eagerness with which the first volume of Emily Dickinson s poems has been read shows very clearly that all our alleged modern artificiality does not prevent a prompt appreciation of the qualities of directness and simplicity in approaching the greatest themes life and love and death 
7245_104888_000003_000000	train-clean-360	love 
none	none	and death 
7245_104886_000007_000001	train-clean-360	That irresistible needle touch as one of her best critics has called it piercing at once the very core of a thought has found a response as wide and sympathetic as it has been unexpected even to those who knew best her compelling power 
none	none	This second volume while open to the same criticism as to form with its predecessor shows also the same shining beauties 
7245_104886_000008_000000	train-clean-360	Although Emily Dickinson had been in the habit of sending occasional poems to friends and correspondents the full extent of her writing was by no means imagined by them 
none	none	Her friend H H must at least have suspected it for in a letter dated fifth September eighteen eighty four she wrote MY DEAR FRIEND What portfolios full of verses you must have It is a cruel wrong to your day and generation that you will not give them light 
7245_104886_000010_000000	train-clean-360	If such a thing should happen as that I should outlive you I wish you would make me your literary legatee and executor 
7245_104886_000010_000001	train-clean-360	Surely after you are what is called dead you will be willing that the poor ghosts you have left behind should be cheered and pleased by your verses will you not 
7245_104886_000010_000002	train-clean-360	You ought to be 
none	none	I do not think we have a right to withhold from the world a word or a thought any more than a deed which might help a single soul Truly yours 
7245_104886_000012_000000	train-clean-360	HELEN JACKSON 
7245_104886_000013_000000	train-clean-360	The portfolios were found shortly after Emily Dickinson s death by her sister and only surviving housemate 
none	none	Most of the poems had been carefully copied on sheets of note paper and tied in little fascicules each of six or eight sheets 
7245_104886_000013_000002	train-clean-360	While many of them bear evidence of having been thrown off at white heat still more had received thoughtful revision 
7245_104886_000013_000003	train-clean-360	There is the frequent addition of rather perplexing foot notes affording large choice of words and phrases 
7245_104888_000005_000000	train-clean-360	choice 
none	none	of words and phrases 
7245_104886_000013_000004	train-clean-360	And in the copies which she sent to friends sometimes one form sometimes another is found to have been used 
none	none	Without important exception her friends have generously placed at the disposal of the Editors any poems they had received from her and these have given the obvious advantage of comparison among several renderings of the same verse To what further rigorous pruning her verses would have been subjected had she published them herself we cannot know They should be regarded in many cases as merely the first strong and suggestive sketches of an artist intended to be embodied at some time in the finished picture 
7245_104886_000015_000000	train-clean-360	Emily Dickinson appears to have written her first poems in the winter of eighteen sixty two 
none	none	In a letter to one of the present Editors the April following she says I made no verse but one or two until this winter 
7245_104886_000016_000000	train-clean-360	The handwriting was at first somewhat like the delicate running Italian hand of our elder gentlewomen but as she advanced in breadth of thought it grew bolder and more abrupt until in her latest years each letter stood distinct and separate from its fellows 
7245_104886_000016_000001	train-clean-360	In most of her poems particularly the later ones everything by way of punctuation was discarded except numerous dashes and all important words began with capitals 
7245_104886_000016_000002	train-clean-360	The effect of a page of her more recent manuscript is exceedingly quaint and strong 
none	none	The fac simile given in the present volume is from one of the earlier transition periods 
7245_104886_000016_000004	train-clean-360	Although there is nowhere a date the handwriting makes it possible to arrange the poems with general chronologic accuracy 
7245_104886_000017_000000	train-clean-360	As a rule the verses were without titles but A Country Burial A Thunder Storm The Humming Bird and a few others were named by their author frequently at the end sometimes only in the accompanying note if sent to a friend 
7245_104890_000094_000000	train-clean-360	A Country Burial 
none	none	A Thunder Storm The Humming Bird and a few others were named by their author frequently at the end sometimes only in the accompanying note if sent to a friend The variation of readings with the fact that she often wrote in pencil and not always clearly have at times thrown a good deal of responsibility upon her Editors But all interference not absolutely inevitable has been avoided The very roughness of her rendering is part of herself and not lightly to be touched for it seems in many cases that she intentionally avoided the smoother and more usual rhymes Like impressionist pictures or Wagner s rugged music the very absence of conventional form challenges attention 
7245_104886_000019_000001	train-clean-360	In Emily Dickinson s exacting hands the especial intrinsic fitness of a particular order of words might not be sacrificed to anything virtually extrinsic and her verses all show a strange cadence of inner rhythmical music 
7245_104886_000019_000002	train-clean-360	Lines are always daringly constructed and the thought rhyme appears frequently appealing indeed to an unrecognized sense more elusive than hearing 
7245_104886_000020_000000	train-clean-360	Emily Dickinson scrutinized everything with clear eyed frankness Every subject was proper ground for legitimate study even the sombre facts of death and burial and the unknown life beyond 
7245_104886_000020_000001	train-clean-360	She touches these themes sometimes lightly sometimes almost humorously more often with weird and peculiar power but she is never by any chance frivolous or trivial 
7245_104886_000020_000002	train-clean-360	And while as one critic has said she may exhibit toward God an Emersonian self possession it was because she looked upon all life with a candor as unprejudiced as it is rare 
7245_104888_000049_000000	train-clean-360	possession 
none	none	it was because she looked upon all life with a candor as unprejudiced as it is rare 
7245_104886_000021_000000	train-clean-360	She had tried society and the world and found them lacking 
7245_104886_000021_000001	train-clean-360	She was not an invalid and she lived in seclusion from no love disappointment 
7245_104886_000021_000002	train-clean-360	Her life was the normal blossoming of a nature introspective to a high degree whose best thought could not exist in pretence 
7245_104886_000022_000000	train-clean-360	Storm wind the wild March sky sunsets and dawns the birds and bees butterflies and flowers of her garden with a few trusted human friends were sufficient companionship 
7245_104886_000022_000001	train-clean-360	The coming of the first robin was a jubilee beyond crowning of monarch or birthday of pope the first red leaf hurrying through the altered air an epoch 
none	none	Immortality was close about her and while never morbid or melancholy she lived in its presence MABEL LOOMIS TODD

none	none	The nearest dream recedes unrealized The heaven we chase Like the June bee Before the school boy Invites the race Stoops to an easy clover Dips evades teases deploys Then to the royal clouds Lifts his light pinnace Heedless of the boy Staring bewildered at the mocking sky Homesick for steadfast honey Ah the bee flies not That brews that rare variety IV We play at paste Till qualified for pearl Then drop the paste And deem ourself a fool The shapes though were similar And our new hands Learned gem tactics Practising sands V I found the phrase to every thought I ever had but one And that defies me as a hand Did try to chalk the sun To races nurtured in the dark How would your own begin Can blaze be done in cochineal Or noon in mazarin VI HOPE Hope is the thing with feathers That perches in the soul And sings the tune without the words And never stops at all And sweetest in the gale is heard And sore must be the storm That could abash the little bird That kept so many warm I ve heard it in the chillest land And on the strangest sea Yet never in extremity It asked a crumb of me

breathe And glance securely round The deer invites no longer Than it eludes the hound L HUNGER I had been hungry all the years My noon had come to dine I trembling drew the table near And touched the curious wine T was this on tables I had seen When turning hungry lone I looked in windows for the wealth I could not hope to own I did not know the ample bread T was so unlike the crumb The birds and I had often shared In Nature s dining room The plenty hurt me t was so new Myself felt ill and odd As berry of a mountain bush Transplanted to the road Nor was I hungry so I found That hunger was a way Of persons outside windows The entering takes away LI I gained it so By climbing slow By catching at the twigs that grow Between the bliss and me It hung so high As well the sky Attempt by strategy I said I gained it This was all Look how I clutch it Lest it fall And I a pauper go Unfitted by an instant s grace For the contented beggar s face I wore an hour ago LII To learn the transport by the pain As blind men learn the sun To die of thirst suspecting That brooks in meadows run To stay the homesick homesick feet Upon a foreign shore Haunted by native lands the while And blue beloved air This is the sovereign anguish This the signal woe These are the patient laureates Whose voices trained below Ascend in ceaseless carol Inaudible indeed To us the duller scholars Of the mysterious bard LIII RETURNING I years had been from home And now before the door I dared not open lest a face I never saw before Stare vacant into mine And ask my business there My business just a life I left Was such still dwelling there I fumbled at my nerve I scanned the windows near The silence like an ocean rolled And broke against my ear I laughed a wooden laugh That I could fear a door Who danger and the dead had faced But never quaked before I fitted to the latch My hand with trembling care Lest back the awful door should spring And leave me standing there I moved my fingers off As cautiously as glass And held my ears and like a thief Fled gasping from the house LIV PRAYER Prayer is the little implement Through which men reach Where presence is denied them They fling their speech By means of it in God s ear If then He hear This sums the apparatus Comprised in prayer LV I know that he exists Somewhere in silence He has hid his rare life From our gross eyes T is an

Would not the jest Have crawled too far LVI MELODIES UNHEARD Musicians wrestle everywhere All day among the crowded air I hear the silver strife And waking long before the dawn Such transport breaks upon the town I think it that new life It is not bird it has no nest Nor band in brass and scarlet dressed Nor tambourine nor man It is not hymn from pulpit read The morning stars the treble led On

that s enough And wade in liberty They cannot take us any more Dungeons may call and guns implore Unmeaning now to me As laughter was an hour ago Or laces or a travelling show Or who died yesterday III NATURE I MOTHER NATURE Nature the gentlest mother Impatient of no child The feeblest or the waywardest Her admonition mild In forest and the hill By traveller is heard Restraining rampant squirrel Or too impetuous bird How fair her conversation A summer afternoon Her household her assembly And when the sun goes down Her voice among the aisles Incites the timid prayer Of the minutest cricket The most unworthy flower When all the children sleep She turns as long away As will suffice to light her lamps Then bending from the sky With infinite affection And infiniter care Her golden finger on her lip Wills silence everywhere II OUT OF THE MORNING Will there really be a morning Is there such a thing as day Could I see it from the mountains If I were as tall as they Has it feet like water lilies Has it feathers like a bird Is it brought from famous countries Of which I have never heard Oh some scholar Oh some sailor Oh some wise man from the skies Please to tell a little pilgrim Where the place called morning lies III At half past three a single bird Unto a silent sky Propounded but a single term Of cautious melody At half past four experiment Had subjugated test And lo her silver principle Supplanted all the rest At half past seven element Nor implement was seen And place was where the presence was Circumference between IV DAY S PARLOR The day came slow till five o clock Then sprang before the hills Like hindered rubies or the light A sudden musket spills The purple could not keep the east The sunrise shook from fold Like breadths of topaz packed a night The lady just unrolled The happy winds their timbrels took The birds in docile rows Arranged themselves around their prince The wind is prince of those The orchard sparkled like a Jew How mighty t was to stay A guest in this stupendous place The parlor of the day V THE SUN S WOOING The sun just touched the morning The morning happy thing Supposed that he had come to dwell And life would be all spring She felt herself supremer A raised ethereal thing Henceforth for her what holiday Meanwhile her wheeling king Trailed slow along the orchards His haughty spangled hems Leaving a new necessity The want of diadems The morning fluttered staggered Felt feebly for her crown Her unanointed forehead Henceforth her only one VI THE ROBIN The robin is the one That interrupts the morn With hurried few express reports When March is scarcely on The robin is the one That overflows the noon With her cherubic quantity An April but begun The robin is the one That speechless from her nest Submits that home and certainty And sanctity are best VII THE BUTTERFLY S DAY From cocoon forth a butterfly As lady from her door Emerged a summer afternoon Repairing everywhere Without design that I could trace Except to stray abroad On miscellaneous enterprise The clovers understood Her pretty parasol was seen Contracting in a field Where men made hay then struggling hard With an opposing cloud Where parties phantom as herself To Nowhere seemed to go In purposeless circumference As t were a tropic show And notwithstanding bee that worked And flower that zealous blew This audience of idleness Disdained them from the sky Till sundown crept a steady tide And men that made the hay And afternoon and butterfly Extinguished in its sea VIII THE BLUEBIRD Before you thought of spring Except as a surmise You see God bless his suddenness A fellow in the skies Of independent hues A little weather worn Inspiriting habiliments Of indigo and brown With specimens of song As if for you to choose Discretion in the interval With gay delays he goes To some superior tree Without a single leaf And shouts for joy to nobody But his seraphic self IX APRIL An altered look about the hills A Tyrian light the village fills A wider sunrise in the dawn A deeper twilight on the lawn A print of a vermilion foot A purple finger on the slope A flippant fly upon the pane A spider at his trade again An added strut in chanticleer A flower expected everywhere An axe shrill singing in the woods Fern odors on untravelled roads All this and more I cannot tell A furtive look you know as well And Nicodemus mystery Receives its annual reply X THE SLEEPING FLOWERS Whose are the little beds I asked Which in the valleys lie Some shook their heads and others smiled And no one made reply Perhaps they did not hear I said I will inquire again Whose are the beds the tiny beds So thick upon the plain T is daisy in the shortest A little farther on Nearest the door to wake the first Little leontodon T is iris sir and aster Anemone and bell Batschia in the blanket red And chubby daffodil Meanwhile at many cradles Her busy foot she plied Humming the quaintest lullaby That ever rocked a child Hush Epigea wakens The crocus stirs her lids Rhodora s cheek is crimson She s dreaming of the woods Then turning from them reverent Their bed time t is she said The bumble bees will wake them When April woods are red XI MY ROSE Pigmy seraphs gone astray Velvet people from Vevay Belles from some lost summer day Bees exclusive coterie Paris could not lay the fold Belted down with emerald Venice could not show a cheek Of a tint so lustrous meek Never such an ambuscade As of brier and leaf displayed For my little damask maid I had rather wear her grace Than an earl s distinguished face I had rather dwell like her Than be Duke of Exeter Royalty enough for me To subdue the bumble bee XII THE ORIOLE S SECRET To hear an oriole sing May be a common thing Or only a divine It is not of the bird Who sings the same unheard As unto crowd The fashion of the ear Attireth that it hear In dun or fair So whether it be rune Or whether it be none Is of within The tune is in the tree The sceptic showeth me No sir In thee XIII THE ORIOLE One of the ones that Midas touched Who failed to touch us all Was that confiding prodigal The blissful oriole So drunk he disavows it With badinage divine So dazzling we mistake him For an alighting mine A pleader a dissembler An epicure a thief Betimes an oratorio An ecstasy in chief The Jesuit of orchards He cheats as he enchants Of an entire attar For his decamping wants The splendor of a Burmah The meteor of birds Departing like a pageant Of ballads and of bards I never thought that Jason sought For any golden fleece But then I am a rural man With thoughts that make for peace But if there were a Jason Tradition suffer me Behold his lost emolument Upon the apple tree XIV IN SHADOW I dreaded that first robin so But he is mastered now And I m accustomed to him grown He hurts a little though I thought if I could only live Till that first shout got by Not all pianos in the woods Had power to mangle me I dared not meet the daffodils For fear their yellow gown Would pierce me with a fashion So foreign to my own I wished the grass would hurry So when t was time to see He d be too tall the tallest one Could stretch to look at me I could not bear the bees should come I wished they d stay away In those dim countries where they go What word had they for me They re here though not a creature failed No blossom stayed away In gentle deference to me The Queen of Calvary Each one salutes me as he goes And I my childish plumes Lift in bereaved acknowledgment Of their unthinking drums XV THE HUMMING BIRD A route of evanescence With a revolving wheel A resonance of emerald A rush of cochineal And every blossom on the bush Adjusts its tumbled head The mail from Tunis probably An easy morning s ride XVI SECRETS The skies can t keep their secret They tell it to the hills The hills just tell the orchards And they the daffodils A bird by chance that goes that way Soft overheard the whole If I should bribe the little bird Who knows but she would tell I think I won t however It s finer not to know If summer were an axiom What sorcery had snow So keep your secret Father I would not if I could Know what the sapphire fellows do In your new fashioned world XVII Who robbed the woods The trusting woods The unsuspecting trees Brought out their burrs and mosses His fantasy to please He scanned their trinkets curious He grasped he bore away What will the solemn hemlock What will the fir tree say XVIII TWO VOYAGERS Two butterflies went out at noon And waltzed above a stream Then stepped straight through the firmament And rested on a beam And then together bore away Upon a shining sea Though never yet in any port Their coming mentioned be If spoken by the distant bird If met in ether sea By frigate or by merchantman Report was not to me XIX BY THE SEA I started early took my dog And visited the sea The mermaids in the basement Came out to look at me And frigates in the upper floor Extended hempen hands Presuming me to be a mouse Aground upon the sands But no man moved me till the tide Went past my simple shoe And past my apron and my belt And past my bodice too And made as he would eat me up As wholly as a dew Upon a dandelion s sleeve And then I started too And he he followed close behind I felt his silver heel Upon my ankle then my shoes Would overflow with pearl Until we met the solid town No man he seemed to know And bowing with a mighty look At me the sea withdrew XX OLD FASHIONED Arcturus is his other name I d rather call him star It s so unkind of science To go and interfere I pull a flower from the woods A monster with a glass Computes the stamens in a breath And has her in a class Whereas I took the butterfly Aforetime in my hat He sits erect in cabinets The clover bells forgot What once was heaven is zenith now Where I proposed to go When time s brief masquerade was done Is mapped and charted too What if the poles should frisk about And stand upon their heads I hope I m ready for the worst Whatever prank betides Perhaps the kingdom of Heaven s changed I hope the children there Won t be new fashioned when I come And laugh at me and stare I hope the father in the skies Will lift his little girl Old fashioned naughty everything Over the stile of pearl XXI A TEMPEST An awful tempest mashed the air The clouds were gaunt and few A black as of a spectre s cloak Hid heaven and earth from view The creatures chuckled on the roofs And whistled in the air And shook their fists and gnashed their teeth And swung their frenzied hair The morning lit the birds arose The monster s faded eyes Turned slowly to his native coast And peace was Paradise XXII THE SEA An everywhere of silver With ropes of sand To keep it from effacing The track called land XXIII IN THE GARDEN A bird came down the walk He did not know I saw He bit an angle worm in halves And ate the fellow raw And then he drank a dew From a convenient grass And then hopped sidewise to the wall To let a beetle pass He glanced with rapid eyes That hurried all abroad They looked like frightened beads I thought He stirred his velvet head Like one in danger cautious I offered him a crumb And he unrolled his feathers And rowed him softer home Than oars divide the ocean Too silver for a seam Or butterflies off banks of noon Leap plashless as they swim XXIV THE SNAKE A narrow fellow in the grass Occasionally rides You may have met him did you not His notice sudden is The grass divides as with a comb A spotted shaft is seen And then it closes at your feet And opens further on He likes a boggy acre A floor too cool for corn Yet when a child and barefoot I more than once at morn Have passed I thought a whip lash Unbraiding in the sun When stooping to secure it It wrinkled and was gone Several of nature s people I know and they know me I feel for them a transport Of cordiality But never met this fellow Attended or alone Without a tighter breathing And zero at the bone XXV THE MUSHROOM The mushroom is the elf of plants At evening it is not At morning in a truffled hut It stops upon a spot As if it tarried always And yet its whole career Is shorter than a snake s delay And fleeter than a tare T is vegetation s juggler The germ of alibi Doth like a bubble antedate And like a bubble hie I feel as if the grass were pleased To have it intermit The surreptitious scion Of summer s circumspect Had nature any outcast face Could she a son contemn Had nature an Iscariot That mushroom it is him XXVI THE STORM There came a wind like a bugle It quivered through the grass And a green chill upon the heat So ominous did pass We barred the windows and the doors As from an emerald ghost The doom s electric moccason That very instant passed On a strange mob of panting trees And fences fled away And rivers where the houses ran The living looked that day The bell within the steeple wild The flying tidings whirled How much can come And much can go And yet abide the world XXVII THE SPIDER A spider sewed at night Without a light Upon an arc of white If ruff it was of dame Or shroud of gnome Himself himself inform Of immortality His strategy Was physiognomy XXVIII I know a place where summer strives With such a practised frost She each year leads her daisies back Recording briefly Lost But when the south wind stirs the pools And struggles in the lanes Her heart misgives her for her vow And she pours soft refrains Into the lap of adamant And spices and the dew That stiffens quietly to quartz Upon her amber shoe XXIX The one that could repeat the summer day Were greater than itself though he Minutest of mankind might be And who could reproduce the sun At period of going down The lingering and the stain I mean When Orient has been outgrown And Occident becomes unknown His name remain XXX THE WlND S VISIT The wind tapped like a tired man And like a host Come in I boldly answered entered then My residence within A rapid footless guest To offer whom a chair Were as impossible as hand A sofa to the air No bone had he to bind him His speech was like the push Of numerous humming birds at once From a superior bush His countenance a billow His fingers if he pass Let go a music as of tunes Blown tremulous in glass He visited still flitting Then like a timid man Again he tapped t was flurriedly And I became alone XXXI Nature rarer uses yellow Than another hue Saves she all of that for sunsets Prodigal of blue Spending scarlet like a woman Yellow she affords Only scantly and selectly Like a lover s words XXXII GOSSIP The leaves like women interchange Sagacious confidence Somewhat of nods and somewhat of Portentous inference The parties in both cases Enjoining secrecy Inviolable compact To notoriety XXXIII SIMPLICITY How happy is the little stone That rambles in the road alone And does n t care about careers And exigencies never fears Whose coat of elemental brown A passing universe put on And independent as the sun Associates or glows alone Fulfilling absolute decree In casual simplicity XXXIV STORM It sounded as if the streets were running And then the streets stood still Eclipse was all we could see at the window And awe was all we could feel By and by the boldest stole out of his covert To see if time was there Nature was in her beryl apron Mixing fresher air XXXV THE RAT The rat is the concisest tenant He pays no rent Repudiates the obligation On schemes intent Balking our wit To sound or circumvent Hate cannot harm A foe so reticent Neither decree Prohibits him Lawful as Equilibrium XXXVI Frequently the woods are pink Frequently are brown Frequently the hills undress Behind my native town Oft a head is crested I was wont to see And as oft a cranny Where it used to be And the earth they tell me On its axis turned Wonderful rotation By but twelve performed XXXVII A THUNDER STORM The wind begun to rock the grass With threatening tunes and low He flung a menace at the earth A menace at the sky The leaves unhooked themselves from trees And started all abroad The dust did scoop itself like hands And throw away the road The wagons quickened on the streets The thunder hurried slow The lightning showed a yellow beak And then a livid claw The birds put up the bars to nests The cattle fled to barns There came one drop of giant rain And then as if the hands That held the dams had parted hold The waters wrecked the sky But overlooked my father s house Just quartering a tree XXXVIII WITH FLOWERS South winds jostle them Bumblebees come Hover hesitate Drink and are gone Butterflies pause On their passage Cashmere I softly plucking Present them here XXXIX SUNSET Where ships of purple gently toss On seas of daffodil Fantastic sailors mingle And then the wharf is still XL She sweeps with many colored brooms And leaves the shreds behind Oh housewife in the evening west Come back and dust the pond You dropped a purple ravelling in You dropped an amber thread And now you ve littered all the East With duds of emerald And still she plies her spotted brooms And still the aprons fly Till brooms fade softly into stars And then I come away XLI Like mighty footlights burned the red At bases of the trees The far theatricals of day Exhibiting to these T was universe that did applaud While chiefest of the crowd Enabled by his royal dress Myself distinguished God XLII PROBLEMS Bring me the sunset in a cup Reckon the morning s flagons up And say how many dew Tell me how far the morning leaps Tell me what time the weaver sleeps Who spun the breadths of blue Write me how many notes there be In the new robin s ecstasy Among astonished boughs How many trips the tortoise makes How many cups the bee partakes The debauchee of dews Also who laid the rainbow s piers Also who leads the docile spheres By withes of supple blue Whose fingers string the stalactite Who counts the wampum of the night To see that none is due Who built this little Alban house And shut the windows down so close My spirit cannot see Who ll let me out some gala day With implements to fly away Passing pomposity XLIII THE JUGGLER OF DAY Blazing in gold and quenching in purple Leaping like leopards to the sky Then at the feet of the old horizon Laying her spotted face to die Stooping as low as the otter s window Touching the roof and tinting the barn Kissing her bonnet to the meadow And the juggler of day is gone XLIV MY CRICKET Farther in summer than the birds Pathetic from the grass A minor nation celebrates Its unobtrusive mass No ordinance is seen So gradual the grace A pensive custom it becomes Enlarging loneliness Antiquest felt at noon When August burning low Calls forth this spectral canticle Repose to typify Remit as yet no grace No furrow on the glow Yet a druidic difference Enhances nature now XLV As imperceptibly as grief The summer lapsed away Too imperceptible at last To seem like perfidy A quietness distilled As twilight long begun Or Nature spending with herself Sequestered afternoon The dusk drew earlier in The morning foreign shone A courteous yet harrowing grace As guest who would be gone And thus without a wing Or service of a keel Our summer made her light escape Into the beautiful XLVI It can t be summer that got through It s early yet for spring There s that long town of white to cross Before the blackbirds sing It can t be dying it s too rouge The dead shall go in white So sunset shuts my question down With clasps of chrysolite XLVII SUMMER S OBSEQUIES The gentian weaves her fringes The maple s loom is red My departing blossoms Obviate parade A brief but patient illness An hour to prepare And one below this morning Is where the angels are It was a short procession The bobolink was there An aged bee addressed us And then we knelt in prayer We trust that she was willing We ask that we may be Summer sister seraph Let us go with thee In the name of the bee And of the butterfly And of the breeze amen XLVIII FRINGED GENTIAN God made a little gentian It tried to be a rose And failed and all the summer laughed But just before the snows There came a purple creature That ravished all the hill And summer hid her forehead And mockery was still The frosts were her condition The Tyrian would not come Until the North evoked it Creator shall I bloom XLIX NOVEMBER Besides the autumn poets sing A few prosaic days A little this side of the snow And that side of the haze A few incisive mornings A few ascetic eyes Gone mister Bryant s golden rod And mister Thomson s sheaves Still is the bustle in the brook Sealed are the spicy valves Mesmeric fingers softly touch The eyes of many elves Perhaps a squirrel may remain My sentiments to share Grant me O Lord a sunny mind Thy windy will to bear L THE SNOW It sifts from leaden sieves It powders all the wood It fills with alabaster wool The wrinkles of the road It makes an even face Of mountain and of plain Unbroken forehead from the east Unto the east again It reaches to the fence It wraps it rail by rail Till it is lost in fleeces It flings a crystal veil On stump and stack and stem The summer s empty room Acres of seams where harvests were Recordless but for them It ruffles wrists of posts As ankles of a queen Then stills its artisans like ghosts Denying they have been LI THE BLUE JAY No brigadier throughout the year So civic as the jay A neighbor and a warrior too With shrill felicity Pursuing winds that censure us A February day The brother of the universe Was never blown away The snow and he are intimate I ve often seen them play When heaven looked upon us all With such severity I felt apology were due To an insulted sky Whose pompous frown was nutriment To their temerity The pillow of this daring head Is pungent evergreens His larder terse and militant Unknown refreshing things His character a tonic His future a dispute Unfair an immortality That leaves this neighbor out IV TIME AND ETERNITY I
