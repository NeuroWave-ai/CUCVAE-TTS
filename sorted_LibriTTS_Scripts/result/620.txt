none	none	CHAPTER twenty four THE FROGS BIRTHDAY TREAT CHAPTER twenty five LOOKING EASTWARD PREFACE SYLVIE AND BRUNO CHAPTER one LESS BREAD MORE TAXES and then all the people cheered again and one man who was more excited than the rest flung his hat high into the air and shouted as well as I could make out Who roar for the Sub Warden Everybody roared but whether it was for the Sub Warden or not did not clearly appear some were shouting Bread and some Taxes but no one seemed to know what it was they really wanted All this I saw from the open window of the Warden s breakfast saloon looking across the shoulder of the Lord Chancellor who had sprung to his feet the moment the shouting began almost as if he had been expecting it and had rushed to the window which commanded the best view of the market place What can it all mean he kept repeating to himself as with his hands clasped behind him and his gown floating in the air he paced rapidly up and down the room I never heard such shouting before and at this time of the morning too And with such unanimity Doesn t it strike you as very remarkable I represented modestly that to my ears it appeared that they were shouting for different things but the Chancellor would not listen to my suggestion for a moment They all shout the same words I assure you he said then leaning well out of the window he whispered to a man who was standing close underneath Keep em together ca n t you The Warden will be here directly Give em the signal for the march up All this was evidently not meant for my ears but I could scarcely help hearing it considering that my chin was almost on the Chancellor s shoulder The march up was a very curious sight a straggling procession of men marching two and two began from the other side of the market place and advanced in an irregular zig zag fashion towards the Palace wildly tacking from side to side like a sailing vessel making way against an unfavourable wind so that the head of the procession was often further from us at the end of one tack than it had been at the end of the previous one Yet it was evident that all was being done under orders for I noticed that all eyes were fixed on the man who stood just under the window and to whom the Chancellor was continually whispering This man held his hat in one hand and a little green flag in the other whenever he waved the flag the procession advanced a little nearer when he dipped it they sidled a little farther off and whenever he waved his hat they all raised a hoarse cheer Hoo roah they cried carefully keeping time with the hat as it bobbed up and down Hoo roah Noo Consti Tooshun Less Bread More Taxes That ll do that ll do the Chancellor whispered Let em rest a bit till I give you the word He s not here yet But at this moment the great folding doors of the saloon were flung open and he turned with a guilty start to receive His High Excellency However it was only Bruno and the Chancellor gave a little gasp of relieved anxiety Morning said the little fellow addressing the remark in a general sort of way to the Chancellor and the waiters Doos oo know where Sylvie is I s looking for Sylvie She s with the Warden I believe y reince the Chancellor replied with a low bow There was no doubt a certain amount of absurdity in applying this title which as of course you see without my telling you was nothing but your Royal Highness condensed into one syllable to a small creature whose father was merely the Warden of Outland still large excuse must be made for a man who had passed several years at the Court of Fairyland and had there acquired the almost impossible art of pronouncing five syllables as one But the bow was lost upon Bruno who had run out of the room even while the great feat of The Unpronounceable Monosyllable was being triumphantly performed Just then a single voice in the distance was understood to shout A speech from the Chancellor Certainly my friends the Chancellor replied with extraordinary promptitude You shall have a speech Here one of the waiters who had been for some minutes busy making a queer looking mixture of egg and sherry respectfully presented it on a large silver salver The Chancellor took it haughtily drank it off thoughtfully smiled benevolently on the happy waiter as he set down the empty glass and began To the best of my recollection this is what he said Ahem Ahem Ahem Fellow sufferers or rather suffering fellows Don t call em names muttered the man under the window I didn t say felons the Chancellor explained You may be sure that I always sympa Ear ear shouted the crowd so loudly as quite to drown the orator s thin squeaky voice that I always sympa he repeated Don t simper quite so much said the man under the window It makes yer look a hidiot And all this time Ear ear went rumbling round the market place like a peal of thunder That I always sympathise yelled the Chancellor the first moment there was silence But your true friend is the Sub Warden Day and night he is brooding on your wrongs I should say your rights that is to say your wrongs no I mean your rights Don t talk no more growled the man under the window You re making a mess of it At this moment the Sub Warden entered the saloon He was a thin man with a mean and crafty face and a greenish yellow complexion and he crossed the room very slowly looking suspiciously about him as if he thought there might be a savage dog hidden somewhere Bravo he cried patting the Chancellor on the back You did that speech very well indeed Why you re a born orator man Oh that s nothing the Chancellor replied modestly with downcast eyes Most orators are born you know The Sub Warden thoughtfully rubbed his chin Why so they are he admitted I never considered it in that light Still you did it very well A word in your ear The rest of their conversation was all in whispers so as I could hear no more I thought I would go and find Bruno I found the little fellow standing in the passage and being addressed by one of the men in livery who stood before him nearly bent double from extreme respectfulness with his hands hanging in front of him like the fins of a fish His High Excellency this respectful man was saying is in his Study y reince He didn t pronounce this quite so well as the Chancellor Thither Bruno trotted and I thought it well to follow him The Warden a tall dignified man with a grave but very pleasant face was seated before a writing table which was covered with papers and holding on his knee one of the sweetest and loveliest little maidens it has ever been my lot to see She looked four or five years older than Bruno but she had the same rosy cheeks and sparkling eyes and the same wealth of curly brown hair Her eager smiling face was turned upwards towards her father s and it was a pretty sight to see the mutual love with which the two faces one in the Spring of Life the other in its late Autumn were gazing on each other No you ve never seen him the old man was saying you couldn t you know he s been away so long traveling from land to land and seeking for health more years than you ve been alive little Sylvie Here Bruno climbed upon his other knee and a good deal of kissing on a rather complicated system was the result He only came back last night said the Warden when the kissing was over he s been traveling post haste for the last thousand miles or so in order to be here on Sylvie s birthday But he s a very early riser and I dare say he s in the Library already Come with me and see him He s always kind to

none	none	You ll be sure to like him Has the Other Professor come too Bruno asked in an awe struck voice Yes they arrived together The Other Professor is well you won t like him quite so much perhaps He s a little more dreamy you know I wiss Sylvie was a little more dreamy said Bruno What do you mean Bruno said Sylvie Bruno went on addressing his father She says she ca n t oo know But I thinks it isn t ca n t it s wo n t Says she ca n t dream the puzzled Warden repeated She do say it Bruno persisted When I says to her Let s stop lessons she says Oh I ca n t dream of letting oo stop yet He always wants to stop lessons Sylvie explained five minutes after we begin Five minutes lessons a day said the Warden You won t learn much at that rate little man That s just what Sylvie says Bruno rejoined She says I wo n t learn my lessons And I tells her over and over I ca n t learn em And what doos oo think she says She says It isn t ca n t it s wo n t Let s go and see the Professor the Warden said wisely avoiding further discussion The children got down off his knees each secured a hand and the happy trio set off for the Library followed by me I had come to the conclusion by this time that none of the party except for a few moments the Lord Chancellor was in the least able to see me What s the matter with him Sylvie asked walking with a little extra sedateness by way of example to Bruno at the other side who never ceased jumping up and down What was the matter but I hope he s all right now was lumbago and rheumatism and that kind of thing He s been curing himself you know he s a very learned doctor Why he s actually invented three new diseases besides a new way of breaking your collar bone Is it a nice way said Bruno Well hum not very the Warden said as we entered the Library And here is the Professor Good morning Professor Hope you re quite rested after your journey A jolly looking fat little man in a flowery dressing gown with a large book under each arm came trotting in at the other end of the room and was going straight across without taking any notice of the children I m looking for Vol Three he said Do you happen to have seen it You don t see my children Professor the Warden exclaimed taking him by the shoulders and turning him round to face them The Professor laughed violently then he gazed at them through his great spectacles for a minute or two without speaking At last he addressed Bruno I hope you have had a

4148_134149_000031_000000	train-clean-360	Bruno looked puzzled 
none	none	I s had the same night oo ve had he replied There s only been one night since yesterday It was the Professor s turn to look puzzled now He took off his spectacles and rubbed them with his handkerchief Then he gazed at them again Then he turned to the Warden Are they bound he enquired No we aren t said Bruno who thought himself quite able to answer this question 
4148_134149_000087_000000	train-clean-360	The Professor shook his head 
none	none	sadly Not even half bound Why would we be half bound said Bruno We re not prisoners But the Professor had forgotten all about them by this time and was speaking to the Warden again You ll be glad to hear he was saying that the Barometer s beginning to move Well which way said the Warden adding to the children Not that I care you know Only he thinks it affects the weather He s a wonderfully clever man you know Sometimes he says things that only the Other Professor can understand Sometimes he says things that nobody can understand Which way is it Professor Up or down Neither said the Professor gently clapping his hands It s going sideways if I may so express myself And what kind of weather does that produce said the Warden Listen children Now you ll hear something worth knowing Horizontal weather said the Professor and made straight for the door very nearly trampling on Bruno who had only just time to get out of his way Isn t he learned the Warden said looking after him with admiring eyes Positively he runs over with learning But he needn t run over me said Bruno The Professor was back in a moment he had changed his dressing gown for a frock coat and had put on a pair of very strange looking boots the tops of which were open umbrellas I thought you d like to see them he said These are the boots for horizontal weather But what s the use of wearing umbrellas round one s knees In ordinary rain the Professor admitted they would not be of much use But if ever it rained horizontally you know they would be invaluable simply invaluable Take the Professor to the breakfast saloon children said the Warden And tell them not to wait for me I had breakfast early as I ve some business to attend to The children seized the Professor s hands as familiarly as if they had known him for years and hurried him away I followed respectfully behind CHAPTER two L AMIE INCONNUE As we entered the breakfast saloon the Professor was saying and he had breakfast by himself early so he begged you wouldn t wait for him my Lady This way my Lady he added this way And then with as it seemed to me most superfluous politeness he flung open the door of my compartment and ushered in a young and lovely lady I muttered to myself with some bitterness And this is of course the opening scene of Vol I She is the Heroine And I am one of those subordinate characters that only turn up when needed for the development of her destiny and whose final appearance is outside the church waiting to greet the Happy Pair Yes my Lady change at Fayfield were the next words I heard oh that too obsequious Guard next station but one And the door closed and the lady settled down into her corner and the monotonous throb of the engine making one feel as if the train were some gigantic monster whose very circulation we could feel proclaimed that we were once more speeding on our way The lady had a perfectly formed nose I caught myself saying to myself hazel eyes and lips and here it occurred to me that to see for myself what the lady was really like would be more satisfactory than much speculation I looked round cautiously and was entirely disappointed of my hope The veil which shrouded her whole face was too thick for me to see more than the glitter of bright eyes and the hazy outline of what might be a lovely oval face but might also unfortunately be an equally unlovely one I closed my eyes again saying to myself couldn t have a better chance for an experiment in Telepathy I ll think out her face and afterwards test the portrait with the original At first no result at all crowned my efforts though I divided my swift mind now hither now thither in a way that I felt sure would have made AEneas green with envy but the dimly seen oval remained as provokingly blank as ever a mere Ellipse as if in some mathematical diagram without even the Foci that might be made to do duty as a nose and a mouth Gradually however the conviction came upon me that I could by a certain concentration of thought think the veil away and so get a glimpse of the mysterious face as to which the two questions is she pretty and is she plain still hung suspended in my mind in beautiful equipoise Success was partial and fitful still there was a result ever and anon the veil seemed to vanish in a sudden flash of light but before I could fully realise the face all was dark again In each such glimpse the face seemed to grow more childish and more innocent and when I had at last thought the veil entirely away it was unmistakeably the sweet face of little Sylvie So either I ve been dreaming about Sylvie I said to myself and this is the reality Or else I ve really been with Sylvie and this is a dream Is Life itself a dream I wonder To occupy the time I got out the letter which had caused me to take this sudden railway journey from my London home down to a strange fishing town on the North coast and read it over again DEAR OLD FRIEND I m sure it will be as great a pleasure to me as it can possibly be to you to meet once more after so many years and of course I shall be ready to give you all the benefit of such medical skill as I have only you know one mustn t violate professional etiquette And you are already in the hands of a first rate London doctor with whom it would be utter affectation for me to pretend to compete I make no doubt he is right in saying the heart is affected all your symptoms point that way One thing at any rate I have already done in my doctorial capacity secured you a bedroom on the ground floor so that you will not need to ascend the stairs at all I shalt expect you by last train on Friday in accordance with your letter and till then I shalt say in the words of the old song Oh for Friday nicht Friday s lang a coming Yours always ARTHUR FORESTER P S Do you believe in Fate This Postscript puzzled me sorely He is far too sensible a man I thought to have become a Fatalist And yet what else can he mean by it And as I folded up the letter and put it away I inadvertently repeated the words aloud Do you believe in Fate The fair Incognita turned her head quickly at the sudden question No I don t she said with a smile Do you I I didn t mean to ask the question I stammered a little taken aback at having begun a conversation in so unconventional a fashion The lady s smile became a laugh not a mocking laugh but the laugh of a happy child who is perfectly at her ease Didn t you she said Then it was a case of what you Doctors call unconscious cerebration I am no Doctor I replied Do I look so like one Or what makes you think it She pointed to the book I had been reading which was so lying that its title Diseases of the Heart was plainly visible One needn t be a Doctor I said to take an interest in medical books There s another class of readers who are yet more deeply interested You mean the Patients she interrupted while a look of tender pity gave new sweetness to her face But with an evident wish to avoid a possibly painful topic one needn t be either to take an interest in books of Science Which contain the greatest amount of Science do you think the books or the minds Rather a profound question for a lady I said to myself holding with the conceit so natural to Man that Woman s intellect is essentially shallow And I considered a minute before replying If you mean living minds I don t think it s possible to decide There is so much written Science that no living person has ever read and there is so much thought out Science that hasn t yet been written But if you mean the whole human race then I think the minds have it everything recorded in books must have once been in some mind you know Isn t that rather like one of the Rules in Algebra my Lady enquired Algebra too I thought with increasing wonder I mean if we consider thoughts as factors may we not say that the Least Common Multiple of all the minds contains that of all the books but not the other way Certainly we may I replied delighted with the illustration And what a grand thing it would be I went on dreamily thinking aloud rather than talking if we could only apply that Rule to books You know in finding the Least Common Multiple we strike out a quantity wherever it occurs except in the term where it is raised to its highest power So we should have to erase every recorded thought except in the sentence where it is expressed with the greatest intensity My Lady laughed merrily Some books would be reduced to blank paper I m afraid she said They would Most libraries would be terribly diminished in bulk But just think what they would gain in quality When will it be done she eagerly asked If there s any chance of it in my time I think I ll leave off reading and wait for it Well perhaps in another thousand years or so Then there s no use waiting said my Lady Let s sit down Uggug my pet come and sit by me Anywhere but by me growled the Sub warden The little wretch always manages to upset his coffee I guessed at once as perhaps the reader will also have guessed if like myself he is very clever at drawing conclusions that my Lady was the Sub Warden s wife and that Uggug a hideous fat boy about the same age as Sylvie with the expression of a prize pig was their son Sylvie and Bruno with the Lord Chancellor made up a party of seven And you actually got a plunge bath every morning said the Sub Warden seemingly in continuation of a conversation with the Professor Even at the little roadside inns Oh certainly certainly the Professor replied with a smile on his jolly face Allow me to explain It is in fact a very simple problem in Hydrodynamics That means a combination of Water and Strength If we take a plunge bath and a man of great strength such as myself about to plunge into it we have a perfect example of this science I am bound to admit the Professor continued in a lower tone and with downcast eyes that we need a man of remarkable strength He must be able to spring from the floor to about twice his own height gradually turning over as he rises so as to come down again head first Why you need a flea not a man exclaimed the Sub Warden Pardon me said the Professor This particular kind of bath is not adapted for a flea Let us suppose he continued folding his table napkin into a graceful festoon that this represents what is perhaps the necessity of this Age the Active Tourist s Portable Bath You may describe it briefly if you like looking at the Chancellor by the letters A T P B The Chancellor much disconcerted at finding everybody looking at him could only murmur in a shy whisper Precisely so One great advantage of this plunge bath continued the Professor is that it requires only half a gallon of water I don t call it a plunge bath His Sub Excellency remarked unless your Active Tourist goes right under But he does go right under the old man gently replied The A T hangs up the P B on a nail thus He then empties the water jug into it places the empty jug below the bag leaps into the air descends head first into the bag the water rises round him to the top of the bag and there you are he triumphantly concluded The A T is as much under water as if he d gone a mile or two down into the Atlantic And he s drowned let us say in about four minutes By no means the Professor answered with a proud smile After about a minute he quietly turns a tap at the lower end of the P B all the water runs back into the jug and there you are again But how in the world is he to get out of the bag again That I take it said the Professor is the most beautiful part of the whole invention All the way up the P B inside are loops for the thumbs so it s something like going up stairs only perhaps less comfortable and by the time the A T has risen out of the bag all but his head he s sure to topple over one way or the other the Law of Gravity secures that And there he is on the floor again A little bruised perhaps Well yes a little bruised but having had his plunge bath that s the great thing Wonderful It s almost beyond belief murmured the Sub Warden The Professor took it as a compliment and bowed with a gratified smile Quite beyond belief my Lady added meaning no doubt to be more complimentary still The Professor bowed but he didn t smile this time I can assure you he said earnestly that provided the bath was made I used it every morning I certainly ordered it that I am clear about my only doubt is whether the man ever finished making it It s difficult to remember after so many years At this moment the door very slowly and creakingly began to open and Sylvie and Bruno jumped up and ran to meet the well known footstep CHAPTER three BIRTHDAY PRESENTS It s my brother the Sub warden exclaimed in a warning whisper Speak out and be

none	none	about it The appeal was evidently addressed to the Lord Chancellor who instantly replied in a shrill monotone like a little boy repeating the alphabet As I was remarking your Sub Excellency this portentous movement You began too soon the other interrupted scarcely able to restrain himself to a whisper so great was his excitement He couldn t have heard you Begin again As I was remarking chanted the obedient Lord Chancellor this portentous movement has already assumed the dimensions of a Revolution And what are the dimensions of a Revolution The voice was genial and mellow and the face of the tall dignified old man who had just entered the room leading Sylvie by the hand and with Bruno riding triumphantly on his shoulder was too noble and gentle to have scared a less guilty man but the Lord Chancellor turned pale instantly and could hardly articulate the words The dimensions your your High Excellency I I scarcely comprehend Well the length breadth and thickness if you like it better And the old man smiled half contemptuously The Lord Chancellor recovered himself with a great effort and pointed to the open window If your High Excellency will listen for a moment to the shouts of the exasperated populace of the exasperated populace the Sub Warden repeated in a louder tone as the Lord Chancellor being in a state of abject terror had dropped almost into a whisper you will understand what it is they want And at that moment there surged into the room a hoarse confused cry in which the only clearly audible words were Less bread More taxes The old man laughed heartily What in the world he was beginning but the Chancellor heard him not Some mistake he muttered hurrying to the window from which he shortly returned with an air of relief Now listen he exclaimed holding up his hand impressively And now the words came quite distinctly and with the regularity of the ticking of a clock More bread Less taxes More bread the Warden repeated in astonishment Why the new Government Bakery was opened only last week and I gave orders to sell the bread at cost price during the present scarcity What can they expect more The Bakery s closed y reince the Chancellor said more loudly and clearly than he had spoken yet He was emboldened by the consciousness that here at least he had evidence to produce and he placed in the Warden s hands a few printed notices that were lying ready with some open ledgers on a side table Yes yes I see the Warden muttered glancing carelessly through them Order countermanded by my brother and supposed to be my doing Rather sharp practice It s all right he added in a louder tone My name is signed to it so I take it on myself But what do they mean by Less Taxes How can they be less I abolished the last of them a month ago It s been put on again y reince and by y reince s own orders and other printed notices were submitted for inspection The Warden whilst looking them over glanced once or twice at the Sub Warden who had seated himself before one of the open ledgers and was quite absorbed in adding it up but he merely repeated It s all right I accept it as my doing And they do say the Chancellor went on sheepishly looking much more like a convicted thief than an Officer of State that a change of Government by the abolition of the Sub Warden I mean he hastily added on seeing the Warden s look of astonishment the abolition of the office of Sub Warden and giving the present holder the right to act as Vice Warden whenever the Warden is absent would appease all this seedling discontent I mean he added glancing at a paper he held in his hand all this seething discontent For fifteen years put in a deep but very harsh voice my husband has been acting as Sub Warden It is too long It is much too long My Lady was a vast creature at all times but when she frowned and folded her arms as now she looked more gigantic than ever and made one try to fancy what a haystack would look like if out of temper He would distinguish himself as a Vice my Lady proceeded being far too stupid to see the double meaning of her words There has been no such Vice in Outland for many a long year as he would be What course would you suggest Sister the Warden mildly enquired My Lady stamped which was undignified and snorted which was ungraceful This is no jesting matter she bellowed I will consult my brother said the Warden Brother and seven makes a hundred and ninety four which is sixteen and two pence the Sub Warden replied Put down two and carry sixteen The Chancellor raised his hands and eyebrows lost in admiration Such a man of business he murmured Brother could I have a word with you in my Study the Warden said in a louder tone The Sub Warden rose with alacrity and the two left the room together My Lady turned to the Professor who had uncovered the urn and was taking its temperature with his pocket thermometer Professor she began so loudly and suddenly that even Uggug who had gone to sleep in his chair left off snoring and opened one eye The Professor pocketed his thermometer in a moment clasped his hands and put his head on one side with a meek smile You were teaching my son before breakfast I believe my Lady loftily remarked I hope he strikes you as having talent Oh very much so indeed my Lady the Professor hastily replied unconsciously rubbing his ear while some painful recollection seemed to cross his mind I was very forcibly struck by His Magnificence I assure you He is a charming boy my Lady exclaimed Even his snores are more musical than those of other boys If that were so the Professor seemed to think the snores of other boys must be something too awful to be endured but he was a cautious man and he said nothing And he s so clever my Lady continued No one will enjoy your Lecture more by the way have you fixed the time for it yet You ve never given one you know and it was promised years ago before you Yes yes my Lady I know Perhaps next Tuesday or Tuesday week That will do very well said my Lady graciously Of course you will let the Other Professor lecture as well I think not my Lady the Professor said with some hesitation You see he always stands with his back to the audience It does very well for reciting but for lecturing You are quite right said my Lady And now I come to think of it there would hardly be time for more than one Lecture And it will go off all the better if we begin with a Banquet and a Fancy dress Ball It will indeed the Professor cried with enthusiasm I shall come as a Grass hopper my Lady calmly proceeded What shall you come as Professor The Professor smiled feebly I shall come as as early as I can my Lady You mustn t come in before the doors are opened said my Lady I ca n t said the Professor Excuse me a moment As this is Lady Sylvie s birthday I would like to and he rushed away Bruno began feeling in his pockets looking more and more melancholy as he did so then he put his thumb in his mouth and considered for a minute then he quietly left the room He had hardly done so before the Professor was back again quite out of breath Wishing you many happy returns of the day my dear child he went on addressing the smiling little girl who had run to meet him Allow me to give you a birthday present It s a second hand pincushion my dear And it only cost fourpence halfpenny Thank you it s very pretty And Sylvie rewarded the old man with a hearty kiss And the pins they gave me for nothing the Professor added in high glee Fifteen of em and only one bent I ll make the bent one into a hook said Sylvie To catch Bruno with when he runs away from his lessons You ca n t guess what my present is said Uggug who had taken the butter dish from the table and was standing behind her with a wicked leer on his face No I ca n t guess Sylvie said without looking up She was still examining the Professor s pincushion It s this cried the bad boy exultingly as he emptied the dish over her and then with a grin of delight at his own cleverness looked round for applause Sylvie coloured crimson as she shook off the butter from her frock but she kept her lips tight shut and walked away to the window where she stood looking out and trying to recover her temper Uggug s triumph was a very short one the Sub Warden had returned just in time to be a witness of his dear child s playfulness and in another moment a skilfully applied box on the ear had changed the grin of delight into a howl of pain My darling cried his mother enfolding him in her fat arms Did they box his ears for nothing A precious pet It s not for nothing growled the angry father Are you aware Madam that I pay the house bills out of a fixed annual sum The loss of all that wasted butter falls on me Do you hear Madam Hold your tongue Sir My Lady spoke very quietly almost in a whisper But there was something in her look which silenced him Don t you see it was only a joke And a very clever one too He only meant that he loved nobody but her And instead of being pleased with the compliment the spiteful little thing has gone away in a huff The Sub Warden was a very good hand at changing a subject He walked across to the window My dear he said is that a pig that I see down below rooting about among your flower beds A pig shrieked my Lady rushing madly to the window and almost pushing her husband out in her anxiety to see for herself Whose pig is it How did it get in Where s that crazy Gardener gone At this moment Bruno re entered the room and passing Uggug who was blubbering his loudest in the hope of attracting notice as if he was quite used to that sort of thing he ran up to Sylvie and threw his arms round her I went to my toy cupboard he said with a very sorrowful face to see if there were somefin fit for a present for oo And there isn t nuffin They s all broken every one And I haven t got no money left to buy oo a birthday present And I ca n t give oo nuffin but this This was a very earnest hug and a kiss Oh thank you darling cried Sylvie I like your present best of all But if so why did she give it back so quickly His Sub Excellency turned and patted the two children on the head with his long lean hands Go away dears he said There s business to talk over Sylvie and Bruno went away hand in hand but on reaching the door Sylvie came back again and went up to Uggug timidly I don t mind about the butter she said and I I m sorry he hurt you And she tried to shake hands with the little ruffian but Uggug only blubbered louder and wouldn t make friends Sylvie left the room with a sigh The Sub Warden glared angrily at his weeping son Leave the room Sirrah he said as loud as he dared His wife was still leaning out of the window and kept repeating I ca n t see that pig Where is it It s moved to the right now it s gone a little to the left said the Sub Warden but he had his back to the window and was making signals to the Lord Chancellor pointing to Uggug and the door with many a cunning nod and wink The Chancellor caught his meaning at last and crossing the room took that interesting child by the ear the next moment he and Uggug were out of the room and the door shut behind them but not before one piercing yell had rung through the room and reached the ears of the fond mother What is that hideous noise she fiercely asked turning upon her startled husband It s some hyaena or other replied the Sub Warden looking vaguely up to the ceiling as if that was where they usually were to be found Let us to business my dear Here comes the Warden And he picked up from the floor a wandering scrap of manuscript on which I just caught the words after which Election duly holden the said Sibimet and Tabikat his wife may at their pleasure assume Imperial before with a guilty look he crumpled it up in his hand CHAPTER four

none	none	 a little flushed and out of breath and adjusting his wig which appeared to have been dragged partly off his head 
3757-134141-0001	train-other-500	But where is my precious child my Lady enquired as the four took their seats at the small side table devoted to ledgers and bundles and bills He left the room a few minutes ago with the Lord Chancellor the Sub Warden briefly explained
none	none	 Ah said my Lady graciously smiling on that high official Your Lordship has a very taking way with children I doubt if any one could gain the ear of my darling Uggug so quickly as you can 
3757-134141-0002	train-other-500	For an entirely stupid woman my Lady s remarks were curiously full of meaning of which she herself was wholly unconscious The Chancellor bowed but with a very uneasy air
none	none	 I think the Warden was about to speak 
3757-134141-0003	train-other-500	he remarked evidently anxious to change the subject But my Lady would not be checked He is a clever boy she continued with enthusiasm but he needs a man like your Lordship to draw him out The Chancellor bit his lip
3757-134141-0004	train-other-500	and was silent He evidently feared that stupid as she looked she understood what she said this time and was having a joke at his expense He might have spared himself all anxiety whatever accidental meaning her words might have she herself never meant anything at all
none	none	 It is all settled the Warden announced 
3757-134141-0005	train-other-500	wasting no time over preliminaries The Sub Wardenship is abolished and my brother is appointed to act as Vice Warden whenever I am absent
3757-134141-0006	train-other-500	So as I am going abroad for a while he will enter on his new duties at once And there will really be a Vice after all my Lady enquired I hope so the Warden smilingly replied My Lady looked much pleased
3757-134141-0007	train-other-500	and tried to clap her hands but you might as well have knocked two feather beds together for any noise it made When my husband is Vice she said it will be the same as if we had a hundred Vices Hear hear cried the Sub Warden
none	none	 You seem to think it very remarkable my Lady remarked with some severity that your wife should speak the truth No not remarkable at all her husband anxiously explained Nothing is remarkable that you say sweet one My Lady smiled approval of the sentiment and went on 
3757-134141-0008	train-other-500	And am I Vice Wardeness If you choose to use that title said the Warden
none	none	 but Your Excellency will be the proper style of address And I trust that both His Excellency and Her Excellency will observe the Agreement I have drawn up The provision I am most anxious about is this 
3757-134141-0009	train-other-500	He unrolled a large parchment scroll and read aloud the words item that we will be kind to the poor The Chancellor worded it for me he added glancing at that great Functionary
3757-134141-0010	train-other-500	I suppose now that word item has some deep legal meaning Undoubtedly replied the Chancellor as articulately as he could with a pen between his lips He was nervously rolling and unrolling several other scrolls
3757-134141-0011	train-other-500	and making room among them for the one the Warden had just handed to him These are merely the rough copies he explained and as soon as I have put in the final corrections making a great commotion among the different parchments a semi colon or two that I have accidentally omitted
3757-134141-0012	train-other-500	here he darted about pen in hand from one part of the scroll to another spreading sheets of blotting paper over his corrections
none	none	 all will be ready for signing 
3757-134141-0013	train-other-500	Should it not be read out first my Lady enquired No need no need
none	none	 the Sub Warden and the Chancellor exclaimed at the same moment with feverish eagerness No need at all the Warden gently assented 
3757-134141-0014	train-other-500	Your husband and I have gone through it together It provides that he shall exercise the full authority of Warden
none	none	 and shall have the disposal of the annual revenue attached to the office until my return 
3757-134141-0015	train-other-500	or failing that until Bruno comes of age and that he shall then hand over to myself or to Bruno as the case may be the Wardenship the unspent revenue and the contents of the Treasury which are to be preserved intact under his guardianship
3757-134141-0016	train-other-500	All this time the Sub Warden was busy with the Chancellor s help shifting the papers from side to side and pointing out to the Warden the place whew he was to sign He then signed it himself and my Lady and the Chancellor added their names as witnesses
3757-134141-0017	train-other-500	Short partings are best said the Warden All is ready for my journey My children are waiting below to see me off He gravely kissed my Lady shook hands with his brother and the Chancellor
none	none	 and left the room The three waited in silence till the sound of wheels announced that the Warden was out of hearing 
3757-134141-0018	train-other-500	then to my surprise they broke into peals of uncontrollable laughter
none	none	 What a game oh what a game cried the Chancellor 
3757-134141-0019	train-other-500	And he and the Vice Warden joined hands and skipped wildly about the room My Lady was too dignified to skip but she laughed like the neighing of a horse and waved her handkerchief above her head it was clear to her very limited understanding that something very clever had been done
3757-134141-0020	train-other-500	but what it was she had yet to learn You said I should hear all about it when the Warden had gone she remarked as soon as she could make herself heard And so you shall Tabby her husband graciously replied as he removed the blotting paper
3757-134141-0021	train-other-500	and showed the two parchments lying side by side This is the one he read but didn t sign and this is the one he signed but didn t read
none	none	 You see it was all covered up except the place for signing the names Yes yes my Lady interrupted eagerly 
3757-134141-0022	train-other-500	and began comparing the two Agreements Item that he shall exercise the authority of Warden in the Warden s absence Why that s been changed into shall be absolute governor for life with the title of Emperor if elected to that office by the people
3757-134141-0023	train-other-500	What Are you Emperor darling Not yet dear the Vice Warden replied It won t do to let this paper be seen just at present All in good time My Lady nodded and read on Item that we will be kind to the poor
none	none	 Why that s omitted altogether Course it is said her husband We re not going to bother about the wretches 
3757-134141-0024	train-other-500	Good said my Lady with emphasis and read on again
none	none	 Item that the contents of the Treasury be preserved intact Why that s altered into shall be at the absolute disposal of the Vice Warden Well Sibby that was a clever trick 
3757-134141-0025	train-other-500	All the Jewels only think May I go and put them on directly Well not just yet Lovey her husband uneasily replied
none	none	 You see the public mind isn t quite ripe for it yet 
3757-134141-0026	train-other-500	We must feel our way Of course we ll have the coach and four out at once And I ll take the title of Emperor as soon as we can safely hold an Election But they ll hardly stand our using the Jewels as long as they know the Warden s alive
3757-134141-0027	train-other-500	We must spread a report of his death A little Conspiracy A Conspiracy cried the delighted lady clapping her hands Of all things I do like a Conspiracy It s so interesting
none	none	 The Vice Warden and the Chancellor interchanged a wink or two Let her conspire to her heart s content the cunning Chancellor whispered 
3757-134141-0028	train-other-500	It ll do no harm And when
none	none	 will the Conspiracy Hist her husband hastily interrupted her as the door opened 
3757-134141-0029	train-other-500	and Sylvie and Bruno came in with their arms twined lovingly round each other Bruno sobbing convulsively with his face hidden on his sister s shoulder and Sylvie more grave and quiet
none	none	 but with tears streaming down her cheeks 
3757-134141-0030	train-other-500	Mustn t cry like that the Vice Warden said sharply but without any effect on the weeping children Cheer em up a bit he hinted to my Lady Cake my Lady muttered to herself with great decision
3757-134141-0031	train-other-500	crossing the room and opening a cupboard from which she presently returned with two slices of plum cake Eat and don t cry were her short and simple orders and the poor children sat down side by side but seemed in no mood for eating For the second time the door opened
none	none	 or rather was burst open this time as Uggug rushed violently into the room shouting that old Beggars come again 
3757-134141-0032	train-other-500	He s not to have any food the Vice warden was beginning but the Chancellor interrupted him
none	none	 It s all right he said in a low voice the servants have their orders 
3757-134141-0033	train-other-500	He s just under here said Uggug who had gone to the window and was looking down into the court yard
none	none	 Where my darling said his fond mother flinging her arms round the neck of the little monster 
3757-134141-0034	train-other-500	All of us except Sylvie and Bruno who took no notice of what was going on followed her to the window The old Beggar looked up at us with hungry eyes
none	none	 Only a crust of bread your Highness he pleaded He was a fine old man 
3757-134141-0035	train-other-500	but looked sadly ill and worn A crust of bread is what I crave he repeated A single crust and a little water Here s some water drink this
none	none	 Uggug bellowed emptying a jug of water over his head 
3757-134141-0036	train-other-500	Well done my boy cried the Vice Warden That s the way to settle such folk
none	none	 Clever boy the Wardeness chimed in Hasn t he good spirits 
3757-134141-0037	train-other-500	Take a stick to him shouted the Vice Warden as the old Beggar shook the water from his ragged cloak and again gazed meekly upwards
none	none	 Take a red hot poker to him 
3757-134141-0038	train-other-500	my Lady again chimed in Possibly there was no red hot poker handy but some sticks were forthcoming in a moment and threatening faces surrounded the poor old wanderer who waved them back with quiet dignity No need to break my old bones he said I am going
none	none	 Not even a crust Poor poor old man exclaimed a little voice at my side half choked with sobs 
3757-134141-0039	train-other-500	Bruno was at the window trying to throw out his slice of plum cake but Sylvie held him back
none	none	 He shalt have my cake 
3757-134141-0040	train-other-500	Bruno cried passionately struggling out of Sylvie s arms Yes
none	none	 yes darling Sylvie gently pleaded 
3757-134141-0041	train-other-500	But don t throw it out He s gone away don t you see Let s go after him
none	none	 And she led him out of the room unnoticed by the rest of the party who were wholly absorbed in watching the old Beggar 
3757-134141-0042	train-other-500	The Conspirators returned to their seats and continued their conversation in an undertone so as not to be heard by Uggug who was still standing at the window By the way
none	none	 there was something about Bruno succeeding to the Wrardenship said my Lady How does that stand in the new Agreement 
3757-134141-0043	train-other-500	The Chancellor chuckled Just the same word for word he said with one exception my Lady Instead of Bruno I ve taken the liberty to put in
none	none	 he dropped his voice to a whisper to put in Uggug you know Uggug indeed 
3757-134141-0044	train-other-500	I exclaimed in a burst of indignation I could no longer control To bring out even that one word seemed a gigantic effort
none	none	 but the cry once uttered all effort ceased at once a sudden gust swept away the whole scene and I found myself sitting up staring at the young lady in the opposite corner of the carriage who had now thrown back her veil and was looking at me with an expression of amused surprise CHAPTER five A BEGGAR S PALACE That I had said something in the act of waking I felt sure the hoarse stifled cry was still ringing in my ears even if the startled look of my fellow traveler had not been evidence enough but what could I possibly say by way of apology 
3757-134142-0000	train-other-500	I hope I didn t frighten you I stammered out at last I have no idea what I said I was dreaming You said Uggug indeed the young lady replied with quivering lips that would curve themselves into a smile
none	none	 in spite of all her efforts to look grave 
3757-134142-0001	train-other-500	At least you didn t say it you shouted it I m very sorry was all I could say feeling very penitent and helpless She has Sylvie s eyes I thought to myself
none	none	 half doubting whether even now I were fairly awake And that sweet look of innocent wonder is all Sylvie s too 
3757-134142-0002	train-other-500	But Sylvie hasn t got that calm resolute mouth nor that far away look of dreamy sadness like one that has had some deep sorrow very long ago And the thick coming fancies almost prevented my hearing the lady s next words
none	none	 If you had had a Shilling Dreadful in your hand she proceeded 
3757-134142-0003	train-other-500	something about Ghosts or Dynamite or Midnight Murder one could understand it those things aren t worth the shilling unless they give one a Nightmare But really with only a medical treatise you know and she glanced with a pretty shrug of contempt at the book over which I had fallen asleep
3757-134142-0004	train-other-500	Her friendliness and utter unreserve took me aback for a moment yet there was no touch of forwardness or boldness about the child for child almost she seemed to be I guessed her at scarcely over twenty
3757-134142-0005	train-other-500	all was the innocent frankness of some angelic visitant new to the ways of earth and the conventionalisms or if you will the barbarisms of Society Even so I mused will Sylvie look and speak in another ten years
3757-134142-0006	train-other-500	You don t care for Ghosts then I ventured to suggest unless they are really terrifying Quite so the lady assented The regular Railway Ghosts I mean the Ghosts of ordinary Railway literature
none	none	 are very poor affairs 
3757-134142-0007	train-other-500	I feel inclined to say with Alexander Selkirk
none	none	 Their tameness is shocking to me And they never do any Midnight Murders 
3757-134142-0008	train-other-500	They couldn t welter in gore to save their lives Weltering in gore is a very expressive phrase certainly Can it be done in any fluid I wonder
none	none	 I think not the lady readily replied quite as if she had thought it out long ago It has to be something thick 
3757-134142-0009	train-other-500	For instance you might welter in bread sauce That being white would be more suitable for a Ghost
none	none	 supposing it wished to welter 
3757-134142-0010	train-other-500	You have a real good terrifying Ghost in that book I hinted How could you guess she exclaimed with the most engaging frankness and placed the volume in my hands I opened it eagerly
3757-134142-0011	train-other-500	with a not unpleasant thrill like what a good ghost story gives one at the uncanny coincidence of my having so unexpectedly divined the subject of her studies It was a book of Domestic Cookery open at the article Bread Sauce
3757-134142-0012	train-other-500	I returned the book looking I suppose a little blank as the lady laughed merrily at my discomfiture It s far more exciting than some of the modern ghosts I assure you Now there was a Ghost last month
none	none	 I don t mean a real Ghost in in Supernature but in a Magazine It was a perfectly flavourless Ghost It wouldn t have frightened a mouse It wasn t a Ghost that one would even offer a chair to 
3757-134142-0013	train-other-500	Three score years and ten baldness and spectacles have their advantages after all I said to myself Instead of a bashful youth and maiden gasping out monosyllables at awful intervals
3757-134142-0014	train-other-500	here we have an old man and a child quite at their ease talking as if they had known each other for years Then you think I continued aloud that we ought sometimes to ask a Ghost to sit down But have we any authority for it
none	none	 In Shakespeare for instance there are plenty of ghosts there does Shakespeare ever give the stage direction hands chair to Ghost 
3757-134142-0015	train-other-500	The lady looked puzzled and thoughtful for a moment then she almost clapped her hands
none	none	 Yes yes he does she cried 
3757-134142-0016	train-other-500	He makes Hamlet say Rest rest perturbed Spirit And that I suppose means an easy chair An American rocking chair I think Fayfield Junction my Lady change for Elveston the guard announced flinging open the door of the carriage
3757-134142-0017	train-other-500	and we soon found ourselves with all our portable property around us on the platform The accommodation provided for passengers waiting at this Junction was distinctly inadequate a single wooden bench apparently intended for three sitters only
none	none	 and even this was already partially occupied by a very old man 
3757-134142-0018	train-other-500	in a smock frock who sat with rounded shoulders and drooping head and with hands clasped on the top of his stick so as to make a sort of pillow for that wrinkled face with its look of patient weariness Come you be off the Station master roughly accosted the poor old man
none	none	 You be off and make way for your betters 
3757-134142-0019	train-other-500	This way my Lady he added in a perfectly different tone If your Ladyship will take a seat
none	none	 the train will be up in a few minutes The cringing servility of his manner was due no doubt 
3757-134142-0020	train-other-500	to the address legible on the pile of luggage which announced their owner to be Lady Muriel Orme passenger to Elveston via Fayfield Junction As I watched the old man slowly rise to his feet and hobble a few paces down the platform
3757-134142-0021	train-other-500	the lines came to my lips From sackcloth couch the Monk arose
none	none	 With toil his stiffen d limbs he rear d A hundred years had flung their snows On his thin locks and floating beard But the lady scarcely noticed the little incident After one glance at the banished man who stood tremulously leaning on his stick she turned to me This is not an American rocking chair by any means Yet may I say slightly changing her place so as to make room for me beside her may I say in Hamlet s words Rest rest she broke off with a silvery laugh perturbed Spirit I finished the sentence for her Yes that describes a railway traveler exactly And here is an instance of it I added as the tiny local train drew up alongside the platform and the porters bustled about opening carriage doors one of them helping the poor old man to hoist himself into a third class carriage while another of them obsequiously conducted the lady and myself into a first class She paused before following him to watch the progress of the other passenger Poor old man she said How weak and ill he looks It was a shame to let him be turned away like that I m very sorry At this moment it dawned on me that these words were not addressed to me but that she was unconsciously thinking aloud 
3757-134142-0022	train-other-500	I moved away a few steps and waited to follow her into the carriage where I resumed the conversation
none	none	 Shakespeare must have traveled by rail if only in a dream 
3757-134142-0023	train-other-500	perturbed Spirit is such a happy phrase Perturbed referring no doubt she rejoined
none	none	 to the sensational booklets peculiar to the Rail 
3757-134142-0024	train-other-500	If Steam has done nothing else it has at least added a whole new Species to English Literature No doubt of it I echoed The true origin of all our medical books and all our cookery books
none	none	 No no she broke in merrily I didn t mean our Literature We are quite abnormal 
3757-134142-0025	train-other-500	But the booklets the little thrilling romances where the Murder comes at page fifteen and the Wedding at page forty surely they are due to Steam And when we travel by Electricity if I may venture to develop your theory we shall have leaflets instead of booklets
none	none	 and the Murder and the Wedding will come on the same page 
3757-134142-0026	train-other-500	A development worthy of Darwin the lady exclaimed enthusiastically Only you reverse his theory
none	none	 Instead of developing a mouse into an elephant you would develop an elephant into a mouse But here we plunged into a tunnel and I leaned back and closed my eyes for a moment trying to recall a few of the incidents of my recent dream 
3757-134142-0027	train-other-500	I thought I saw I murmured sleepily and then the phrase insisted on conjugating itself and ran into you thought you saw he thought he saw and then it suddenly went off into a song
3757-134142-0028	train-other-500	He thought he saw an Elephant That practised on a fife He looked again and found it was A letter from his wife At length I realise he said The bitterness of Life And what a wild being it was who sang these wild words
3757-134142-0029	train-other-500	A Gardener he seemed to be yet surely a mad one by the way he brandished his rake madder by the way he broke ever and anon into a frantic jig
none	none	 maddest of all by the shriek in which he brought out the last words of the stanza It was so far a description of himself 
3757-134142-0030	train-other-500	that he had the feet of an Elephant but the rest of him was skin and bone and the wisps of loose straw that bristled all about him suggested that he had been originally stuffed with it and that nearly all the stuffing had come out
none	none	 Sylvie and Bruno waited patiently till the end of the first verse 
3757-134142-0031	train-other-500	Then Sylvie advanced alone Bruno having suddenly turned shy
none	none	 and timidly introduced herself with the words 
3757-134142-0032	train-other-500	Please I m Sylvie And who s that other thing said the Gardener What thing said Sylvie looking round Oh that s Bruno He s my brother
none	none	 Was he your brother yesterday the Gardener anxiously enquired Course I were cried Bruno who had gradually crept nearer and didn t at all like being talked about without having his share in the conversation Ah well the Gardener said with a kind of groan Things change so here Whenever I look again it s sure to be something different Yet I does my duty I gets up wriggle early at five If I was oo said Bruno I wouldn t wriggle so early It s as bad as being a worm he added in an undertone to Sylvie But you shouldn t be lazy in the morning Bruno said Sylvie Remember it s the early bird that picks up the worm It may if it likes Bruno said with a slight yawn I don t like eating worms one bit I always stop in bed till the early bird has picked them up I wonder you ve the face to tell me such fibs cried the Gardener To which Bruno wisely replied Oo don t want a face to tell fibs wiz only a mouf Sylvie discreetly changed the subject And did you plant all these flowers she said What a lovely garden you ve made Do you know I d like to live here always In the winter nights the Gardener was beginning But I d nearly forgotten what we came about Sylvie interrupted Would you please let us through into the road There s a poor old beggar just gone out and he s very hungry and Bruno wants to give him his cake you know It s as much as my place is worth the Gardener muttered taking a key from his pocket and beginning to unlock a door in the garden wall How much are it wurf Bruno innocently enquired But the Gardener only grinned That s a secret he said Mind you come back quick he called after the children as they passed out into the road I had just time to follow them before he shut the door again We hurried down the road and very soon caught sight of the old Beggar about a quarter of a mile ahead of us and the children at once set off running to overtake him Lightly and swiftly they skimmed over the ground and I could not in the least understand how it was I kept up with them so easily But the unsolved problem did not worry me so much as at another time it might have done there were so many other things to attend to The old Beggar must have been very deaf as he paid no attention whatever to Bruno s eager shouting but trudged wearily on never pausing until the child got in front of him and held up the slice of cake The poor little fellow was quite out of breath and could only utter the one word Cake not with the gloomy decision with which Her Excellency had so lately pronounced it but with a sweet childish timidity looking up into the old man s face with eyes that loved all things both great and small The old man snatched it from him and devoured it greedily as some hungry wild beast might have done but never a word of thanks did he give his little benefactor only growled More more and glared at the half frightened children There is no more Sylvie said with tears in her eyes I d eaten mine It was a shame to let you be turned away like that I m very sorry I lost the rest of the sentence for my mind had recurred with a great shock of surprise to Lady Muriel Orme who had so lately uttered these very words of Sylvie s yes and in Sylvie s own voice and with Sylvie s gentle pleading eyes Follow me were the next words I heard as the old man waved his hand with a dignified grace that ill suited his ragged dress over a bush that stood by the road side which began instantly to sink into the earth At another time I might have doubted the evidence of my eyes or at least have felt some astonishment but in this strange scene my whole being seemed absorbed in strong curiosity as to what would happen next When the bush had sunk quite out of our sight marble steps were seen leading downwards into darkness The old man led the way and we eagerly followed The staircase was so dark at first that I could only just see the forms of the children as hand in hand they groped their way down after their guide but it got lighter every moment with a strange silvery brightness that seemed to exist in the air as there were no lamps visible and when at last we reached a level floor the room in which we found ourselves was almost as light as day It was eight sided having in each angle a slender pillar round which silken draperies were twined The wall between the pillars was entirely covered to the height of six or seven feet with creepers from which hung quantities of ripe fruit and of brilliant flowers that almost hid the leaves In another place perchance I might have wondered to see fruit and flowers growing together here my chief wonder was that neither fruit nor flowers were such as I had ever seen before Higher up each wall contained a circular window of coloured glass and over all was an arched roof that seemed to be spangled all over with jewels With hardly less wonder I turned this way and that trying to make out how in the world we had come in for there was no door and all the walls were thickly covered with the lovely creepers We are safe here my darlings said the old man laying a hand on Sylvie s shoulder and bending down to kiss her Sylvie drew back hastily with an offended air but in another moment with a glad cry of Why it s Father she had run into his arms Father Father Bruno repeated and while the happy children were being hugged and kissed 
3757-134142-0033	train-other-500	I could but rub my eyes and say Where then are the rags gone to for the old man was now dressed in royal robes that glittered with jewels and gold embroidery
none	none	 and wore a circlet of gold around his head CHAPTER six THE MAGIC LOCKET Where are we father Sylvie whispered with her arms twined closely around the old man s neck and with her rosy cheek lovingly pressed to his In Elfland darling It s one of the provinces of Fairyland But I thought Elfland was ever so far from Outland and we ve come such a tiny little way You came by the Royal Road sweet one Only those of royal blood can travel along it but you ve been royal ever since I was made King of Elfland that s nearly a month ago They sent two ambassadors to make sure that their invitation to me to be their new King should reach me One was a Prince so he was able to come by the Royal Road and to come invisibly to all but me the other was a Baron so he had to come by the common road and I dare say he hasn t even arrived yet Then how far have we come Sylvie enquired Just a thousand miles sweet one since the Gardener unlocked that door for you A thousand miles Bruno repeated And may I eat one Eat a mile little rogue No said Bruno I mean may I eat one of that fruits Yes child said his father and then you ll find out what Pleasure is like 
3757-134143-0000	train-other-500	the Pleasure we all seek so madly and enjoy so mournfully Bruno ran eagerly to the wall and picked a fruit that was shaped something like a banana but had the colour of a strawberry He ate it with beaming looks that became gradually more gloomy and were very blank indeed by the time he had finished
none	none	 It hasn t got no taste at all he complained I couldn t feel nuffin in my mouf It s a what s that 
3757-134143-0001	train-other-500	hard word Sylvie It was a Phlizz Sylvie gravely replied
none	none	 Are they all like that father They re all like that to you darling 
3757-134143-0002	train-other-500	because you don t belong to Elfland yet But to me they are real Bruno looked puzzled I ll try anuvver kind of fruits he said and jumped down off the King s knee There s some lovely striped ones just like a rainbow And off he ran
3757-134143-0003	train-other-500	Meanwhile the Fairy King and Sylvie were talking together but in such low tones that I could not catch the words
none	none	 so I followed Bruno who was picking and eating other kinds of fruit in the vain hope of finding some that had a taste I tried to pick so me myself 
3757-134143-0004	train-other-500	but it was like grasping air and I soon gave up the attempt and returned to Sylvie Look well at it my darling the old man was saying and tell me how you like it
none	none	 It s just lovely cried Sylvie delightedly Bruno come and look And she held up so that he might see the light through it 
3757-134143-0005	train-other-500	a heart shaped Locket apparently cut out of a single jewel of a rich blue colour with a slender gold chain attached to it It are welly pretty
none	none	 Bruno more soberly remarked and he began spelling out some words inscribed on it All will 
3757-134143-0006	train-other-500	love Sylvie he made them out at last And so they doos he cried clasping his arms round her neck Everybody loves Sylvie But we love her best don t we Bruno said the old King
3757-134143-0007	train-other-500	as he took possession of the Locket Now Sylvie look at this And he showed her lying on the palm of his hand a Locket of a deep crimson colour the same shape as the blue one and like it attached to a slender golden chain Lovelier and lovelier exclaimed Sylvie
none	none	 clasping her hands in ecstasy Look Bruno And there s words on this one too said Bruno Sylvie will love 
3757-134143-0008	train-other-500	all Now you see the difference said the old man different colours and different words
none	none	 Choose one of them darling I ll give you which ever you like best Sylvie whispered the words several times over with a thoughtful smile 
3757-134143-0009	train-other-500	and then made her decision It s very nice to be loved she said but it s nicer to love other people
none	none	 May I have the red one Father The old man said nothing 
3757-134143-0010	train-other-500	but I could see his eyes fill with tears as he bent his head and pressed his lips to her forehead in a long loving kiss
none	none	 Then he undid the chain and showed her how to fasten it round her neck and to hide it away under the edge of her frock 
3757-134143-0011	train-other-500	It s for you to keep you know he said in a low voice not for other people to see You ll remember how to use it Yes I ll remember said Sylvie And now darlings it s time for you to go back or they ll be missing you and then that poor Gardener will get into trouble
3757-134143-0012	train-other-500	Once more a feeling of wonder rose in my mind as to how in the world we were to get back again since I took it for granted that wherever the children went I was to go
none	none	 but no shadow of doubt seemed to cross their minds as they hugged and kissed him murmuring over and over again Good bye darling Father And then suddenly and swiftly the darkness of midnight seemed to close in upon us and through the darkness harshly rang a strange wild song He thought he saw a Buffalo Upon the chimney piece He looked again and found it was His Sister s Husband s Niece Unless you leave this house he said I ll send for the Police That was me he added looking out at us through the half opened door as we stood waiting in the road And that s what I d have done as sure as potatoes aren t radishes if she hadn t have tooken herself off But I always loves my pay rints like anything Who are oor pay rints said Bruno Them as pay rint for me a course the Gardener replied You can come in now if you like He flung the door open as he spoke and we got out a little dazzled and stupefied at least I felt so at the sudden transition from the half darkness of the railway carriage to the brilliantly lighted platform of Elveston Station A footman 
3757-134143-0013	train-other-500	in a handsome livery came forwards and respectfully touched his hat The carriage is here my Lady he said taking from her the wraps and small articles she was carrying
none	none	 and Lady Muriel after shaking hands and bidding me Good night with a pleasant smile followed him It was with a somewhat blank and lonely feeling that I betook myself to the van 
3757-134143-0014	train-other-500	from which the luggage was being taken out and after giving directions to have my boxes sent after me I made my way on foot to Arthur s lodgings and soon lost my lonely feeling in the hearty welcome my old friend gave me
none	none	 and the cozy warmth and cheerful light of the little sitting room into which he led me Little as you see but quite enough for us two Now take the easy chair old fellow and let s have another look at you 
3757-134143-0015	train-other-500	Well you do look a bit pulled down and he put on a solemn professional air I prescribe Ozone quant suff Social dissipation
none	none	 fiant pilulae quam plurimae 
3757-134143-0016	train-other-500	to be taken feasting three times a day But Doctor I remonstrated
none	none	 Society doesn t receive three times a day That s all you know about it the young Doctor gaily replied 
3757-134143-0017	train-other-500	At home lawn tennis three P M At home kettledrum five P M At home music Elveston doesn t give dinners eight P M Carriages at ten There you are It sounded very pleasant I was obliged to admit
3757-134143-0018	train-other-500	And I know some of the lady society already I added One of them came in the same carriage with me What was she like Then perhaps I can identify her The name was Lady Muriel Orme
none	none	 As to what she was like well I thought her very beautiful Do you know her Yes I do know her 
3757-134143-0019	train-other-500	And the grave Doctor coloured slightly as he added Yes I agree with you She is beautiful I quite lost my heart to her I went on mischievously
none	none	 We talked Have some supper Arthur interrupted with an air of relief as the maid entered with the tray 
3757-134143-0020	train-other-500	And he steadily resisted all my attempts to return to the subject of Lady Muriel until the evening had almost worn itself away Then as we sat gazing into the fire and conversation was lapsing into silence he made a hurried confession
none	none	 I hadn t meant to tell you anything about her he said 
3757-134143-0021	train-other-500	naming no names as if there were only one she in the world till you had seen more of her and formed your own judgment of her
none	none	 but somehow you surprised it out of me And I ve not breathed a word of it to any one else 
3757-134143-0022	train-other-500	But I can trust you with a secret old friend Yes It s true of me what I suppose you said in jest In the merest jest believe me I said earnestly Why man I m three times her age
none	none	 But if she s your choice then I m sure she s all that is good and and sweet Arthur went on and pure and self denying and true hearted and he broke off hastily as if he could not trust himself to say more on a subject so sacred and so precious Silence followed 
3757-134143-0023	train-other-500	and I leaned back drowsily in my easy chair filled with bright and beautiful imaginings of Arthur and his lady love
none	none	 and of all the peace and happiness in store for them 
3757-134143-0024	train-other-500	I pictured them to myself walking together lingeringly and lovingly under arching trees in a sweet garden of their own and welcomed back by their faithful gardener on their return from some brief excursion
none	none	 It seemed natural enough that the gardener should be filled with exuberant delight at the return of so gracious a master and mistress and how strangely childlike they looked I could have taken them for Sylvie and Bruno 
3757-134143-0025	train-other-500	less natural that he should show it by such wild dances such crazy songs
none	none	 He thought he saw a Rattlesnake That questioned him in Greek He looked again and found it was The Middle of Next Week The one thing I regret he said Is that it cannot speak least natural of all that the Vice Warden and my Lady should be standing close beside me discussing an open letter which had just been handed to him by the Professor who stood meekly waiting a few yards off If it were not for those two brats I heard him mutter glancing savagely at Sylvie and Bruno who were courteously listening to the Gardener s song there would be no difficulty whatever Let s hear that bit of the letter again said my Lady And the Vice Warden read aloud 
3757-134143-0026	train-other-500	and we therefore entreat you graciously to accept the Kingship
none	none	 to which you have been unanimously elected by the Council of Elfland and that you will allow your son Bruno of whose goodness cleverness and beauty reports have reached us to be regarded as Heir Apparent 
3757-134143-0027	train-other-500	But what s the difficulty said my Lady Why don t you see The Ambassador that brought this is waiting in the house and he s sure to see Sylvie and Bruno and then when he sees Uggug and remembers all that about
none	none	 goodness cleverness and beauty why he s sure to And where will you find a better boy than Uggug my Lady indignantly interrupted Or a wittier or a lovelier To all of which the Vice Warden simply replied 
3757-134143-0028	train-other-500	Don t you be a great blethering goose
none	none	 Our only chance is to keep those two brats out of sight If you can manage that you may leave the rest to me 
3757-134143-0029	train-other-500	I ll make him believe Uggug to be a model of cleverness and all that
none	none	 We must change his name to Bruno of course said my Lady The Vice Warden rubbed his chin 
3757-134143-0030	train-other-500	Humph No he said musingly Wouldn t do
none	none	 The boy s such an utter idiot he d never learn to answer to it Idiot indeed cried my Lady He s no more an idiot than I am 
3757-134143-0031	train-other-500	You re right my dear
none	none	 the Vice Warden soothingly I replied 
3757-134143-0032	train-other-500	He isn t indeed My Lady was appeased
none	none	 Let s go in and receive the Ambassador she said and beckoned to the Professor 
3757-134143-0033	train-other-500	Which room is he waiting in she inquired In the Library Madam And what did you say his name was said the Vice Warden
none	none	 The Professor referred to a card he held in his hand His Adiposity the Baron Doppelgeist Why does he come with such a funny name said my Lady He couldn t well change it on the journey the Professor meekly replied because of the luggage You go and receive him my Lady said to the Vice Warden and I ll attend to the children CHAPTER seven THE BARONS EMBASSY I was following the Vice Warden but on second thoughts went after my Lady being curious to see how she would manage to keep the children out of sight I found her holding Sylvie s hand and with her other hand stroking Bruno s hair in a most tender and motherly fashion both children were looking bewildered and half frightened My own darlings she was saying I ve been planning a little treat for you The Professor shall take you a long walk into the woods this beautiful evening and you shall take a basket of food with you and have a little picnic down by the river Bruno jumped and clapped his hands That are nice he cried Aren t it Sylvie Sylvie who hadn t quite lost her surprised look put up her mouth for a kiss Thank you very much she said earnestly My Lady turned her head away to conceal the broad grin of triumph that spread over her vast face like a ripple on a lake Little simpletons she muttered to herself as she marched up to the house I followed her in Quite so your Excellency the Baron was saying as we entered the Library All the infantry were under my command He turned and was duly presented to my Lady A military hero said my Lady The fat little man simpered Well yes he replied modestly casting down his eyes My ancestors were all famous for military genius My Lady smiled graciously It often runs in families she remarked just as a love for pastry does The Baron looked slightly offended and the Vice Warden discreetly changed the subject Dinner will soon be ready he said May I have the honour of conducting your Adiposity to the guest chamber Certainly certainly the Baron eagerly assented It would never do to keep dinner waiting And he almost trotted out of the room after the Vice Warden He was back again so speedily that the Vice warden had barely time to explain to my Lady that her remark about a love for pastry was unfortunate You might have seen with half an eye he added that that s his line Military genius indeed Pooh Dinner ready yet the Baron enquired as he hurried into the room Will be in a few minutes the Vice Warden replied Meanwhile let s take a turn in the garden You were telling me he continued as the trio left the house something about a great battle in which you had the command of the infantry True said the Baron The enemy as I was saying far outnumbered us but I marched my men right into the middle of what s that the Military Hero exclaimed in agitated tones drawing back behind the Vice Warden as a strange creature rushed wildly upon them brandishing a spade It s only the Gardener the Vice Warden replied in an encouraging tone Quite harmless I assure you Hark he s singing Its his favorite amusement And once more those shrill discordant tones rang out He thought he saw a Banker s Clerk Descending from the bus He looked again and found it was A Hippopotamus If this should stay to dine he said There won t be mutch for us Throwing away the spade he broke into a frantic jig snapping his fingers and repeating again and again There won t be much for us There won t be much for us Once more the Baron looked slightly offended but the Vice Warden hastily explained that the song had no allusion to him and in fact had no meaning at all You didn t mean anything by it now did you He appealed to the Gardener who had finished his song and stood balancing himself on one leg and looking at them with his mouth open I never means nothing said the Gardener and Uggug luckily came up at the moment and gave the conversation a new turn Allow me to present my son said the Vice warden adding in a whisper one of the best and cleverest boys that ever lived I ll contrive for you to see some of his cleverness He knows everything that other boys don t know and in archery in fishing in painting and in music his skill is but you shall judge for yourself You see that target over there He shall shoot an arrow at it Dear boy he went on aloud his Adiposity would like to see you shoot Bring his Highness bow and arrows Uggug looked very sulky as he received the bow and arrow and prepared to shoot Just as the arrow left the bow the Vice Warden trod heavily on the toe of the Baron who yelled with the pain Ten thousand pardons he exclaimed I stepped back in my excitement See It is a bull s eye The Baron gazed in astonishment He held the bow so awkwardly it seemed impossible he muttered But there was no room for doubt there was the arrow right in the centre of the bull s eye The lake is close by continued the Vice warden Bring his Highness fishing rod And Uggug most unwillingly held the rod and dangled the fly over the water A beetle on your arm cried my Lady pinching the poor Baron s arm worse than if ten lobsters had seized it at once That kind is poisonous she explained But what a pity You missed seeing the fish pulled out An enormous dead cod fish was lying on the bank with the hook in its mouth I had always fancied the Baron faltered that cod were salt water fish Not in this country said the Vice Warden Shall we go in Ask my son some question on the way any subject you like And the sulky boy was violently shoved forwards to walk at the Baron s side Could your Highness tell me the Baron cautiously began how much seven times nine would come to Turn to the left cried the Vice Warden hastily stepping forwards to show the way so hastily that he ran against his unfortunate guest who fell heavily on his face So sorry my Lady exclaimed as she and her husband helped him to his feet again My son was in the act of saying sixty three as you fell The Baron said nothing he was covered with dust and seemed much hurt both in body and mind However when they had got him into the house and given him a good brushing matters looked a little better Dinner was served in due course and every fresh dish seemed to increase the good humour of the Baron but all efforts to get him to express his opinion as to Uggug s cleverness were in vain until that interesting youth had left the room and was seen from the open window prowling about the lawn with a little basket which he was filling with frogs So fond of Natural History as he is dear boy said the doting mother Now do tell us Baron what you think of him To be perfectly candid said the cautious Baron I would like a little more evidence I think you mentioned his skill in Music said the Vice Warden Why he s simply a prodigy You shall hear him play the piano And he walked to the window Ug I mean my boy Come in for a minute and bring the music master with you To turn over the music for him he added as an explanation Uggug having filled his basket with frogs had no objection to obey and soon appeared in the room followed by a fierce looking little man who asked the Vice Warden Vot music vill you haf The Sonata that His Highness plays so charmingly said the Vice Warden His Highness haf not the music master began but was sharply stopped by the Vice warden Silence Sir Go and turn over the music for his Highness My dear to the Wardeness will you show him what to do And meanwhile Baron I ll just show you a most interesting map we have of Outland and Fairyland and that sort of thing By the time my Lady had returned from explaining things to the music master the map had been hung up and the Baron was already much bewildered by the Vice Warden s habit of pointing to one place while he shouted out the name of another My Lady joining in pointing out other places and shouting other names only made matters worse and at last the Baron in despair took to pointing out places for himself and feebly asked Is that great yellow splotch Fairyland Yes that s Fairyland said the Vice warden and you might as well give him a hint he muttered to my Lady about going back to morrow He eats like a shark It would hardly do for me to mention it His wife caught the idea and at once began giving hints of the most subtle and delicate kind Just see what a short way it is back to Fairyland Why if you started to morrow morning you d get there in very little more than a week The Baron looked incredulous It took me a full month to come he said But it s ever so much shorter going back you know The Baron looked appealingly to the Vice warden who chimed in readily You can go back five times in the time it took you to come here once if you start to morrow morning All this time the Sonata was pealing through the room The Baron could not help admitting to himself that it was being magnificently played but he tried in vain to get a glimpse of the youthful performer Every time he had nearly succeeded in catching sight of him either the Vice Warden or his wife was sure to get in the way pointing out some new place on the map and deafening him with some new name He gave in at last wished a hasty good night and left the room while his host and hostess interchanged looks of triumph Deftly done cried the Vice Warden Craftily contrived But what means all that tramping on the stairs He half opened the door looked out and added in a tone of dismay The Baron s boxes are being carried down And what means all that rumbling of wheels cried my Lady She peeped through the window curtains The Baron s carriage has come round she groaned At this moment the door opened a fat furious face looked in a voice hoarse with passion thundered out the words My room is full of frogs I leave you and the door closed again And still the noble Sonata went pealing through the room but it was Arthur s masterly touch that roused the echoes and thrilled my very soul with the tender music of the immortal Sonata Pathetique and it was not till the last note had died away that the tired but happy traveler could bring himself to utter the words good night and to seek his much needed pillow CHAPTER eight 
3819-134145-0000	train-other-500	A RIDE ON A LION The next day glided away pleasantly enough partly in settling myself in my new quarters and partly in strolling round the neighbourhood under Arthur s guidance
3819-134145-0001	train-other-500	and trying to form a general idea of Elveston and its inhabitants When five o clock arrived Arthur proposed without any embarrassment this time to take me with him up to the Hall
3819-134145-0002	train-other-500	in order that I might make acquaintance with the Earl of Ainslie who had taken it for the season and renew acquaintance with his daughter Lady Muriel
3819-134145-0003	train-other-500	My first impressions of the gentle dignified and yet genial old man were entirely favourable and the real satisfaction that showed itself on his daughter s face as she met me with the words
none	none	 this is indeed an unlooked for pleasure 
3819-134145-0004	train-other-500	was very soothing for whatever remains of personal vanity the failures and disappointments of many long years and much buffeting with a rough world had left in me Yet I noted and was glad to note
none	none	 evidence of a far deeper feeling than mere friendly regard 
3819-134145-0005	train-other-500	in her meeting with Arthur though this was as I gathered an almost daily occurrence and the conversation between them in which the Earl and I were only occasional sharers
none	none	 had an ease and a spontaneity 
3819-134145-0006	train-other-500	rarely met with except between very old friends and as I knew that they had not known each other for a longer period than the summer which was now rounding into autumn I felt certain that Love
3819-134145-0007	train-other-500	and Love alone could explain the phenomenon How convenient it would be
3819-134145-0008	train-other-500	Lady Muriel laughingly remarked a propos of my having insisted on saving her the trouble of carrying a cup of tea across the room to the Earl if cups of tea had no weight at all Then perhaps
none	none	 ladies would sometimes be permitted to carry them for short distances One can easily imagine a situation said Arthur where things would necessarily have no weight relatively to each other though each would have its usual weight looked at by itself Some desperate paradox 
3819-134145-0009	train-other-500	said the Earl Tell us how it could be We shall never guess it Well suppose this house just as it is placed a few billion miles above a planet and with nothing else near enough to disturb it
3819-134145-0010	train-other-500	of course it falls to the planet The Earl nodded
none	none	 Of course though it might take some centuries to do it 
3819-134145-0011	train-other-500	And is five o clock tea to be going on all the while said Lady Muriel That and other things said Arthur The inhabitants would live their lives grow up and die
3819-134145-0012	train-other-500	and still the house would be falling falling falling But now as to the relative weight of things Nothing can be heavy you know except by trying to fall and being prevented from doing so You all grant that
3819-134145-0013	train-other-500	We all granted that Well now if I take this book and hold it out at arm s length of course I feel its weight It is trying to fall and I prevent it
none	none	 And if I let go it fails to the floor 
3819-134145-0014	train-other-500	But if we were all falling together it couldn t be trying to fall any quicker you know for if I let go what more could it do than fall And as my hand would be falling too at the same rate
3819-134145-0015	train-other-500	it would never leave it for that would be to get ahead of it in the race And it could never overtake the failing floor
none	none	 I see it clearly said Lady Muriel But it makes one dizzy to think of such things 
3819-134145-0016	train-other-500	How can you make us do it There is a more curious idea yet I ventured to say Suppose a cord fastened to the house from below and pulled down by some one on the planet
3819-134145-0017	train-other-500	Then of course the house goes faster than its natural rate of falling but the furniture with our noble selves
none	none	 would go on failing at their old pace and would therefore be left behind Practically we should rise to the ceiling 
3819-134145-0018	train-other-500	said the Earl The inevitable result of which would be concussion of brain To avoid that said Arthur let us have the furniture fixed to the floor and ourselves tied down to the furniture
3819-134145-0019	train-other-500	Then the five o clock tea could go on in peace With one little drawback Lady Muriel gaily interrupted We should take the cups down with us but what about the tea
3819-134145-0020	train-other-500	I had forgotten the tea Arthur confessed That no doubt would rise to the ceiling unless you chose to drink it on the way
none	none	 Which I think 
3819-134145-0021	train-other-500	is quite nonsense enough for one while said the Earl
none	none	 What news does this gentleman bring us from the great world of London 
3819-134145-0022	train-other-500	This drew me into the conversation which now took a more conventional tone After a while Arthur gave the signal for our departure and in the cool of the evening we strolled down to the beach
3819-134145-0023	train-other-500	enjoying the silence broken only by the murmur of the sea and the far away music of some fishermen s song almost as much as our late pleasant talk We sat down among the rocks
3819-134145-0024	train-other-500	by a little pool so rich in animal vegetable and zoophytic or whatever is the right word life that I became entranced in the study of it and when Arthur proposed returning to our lodgings
3819-134145-0025	train-other-500	I begged to be left there for a while to watch and muse alone The fishermen s song grew ever nearer and clearer as their boat stood in for the beach and I would have gone down to see them land their cargo of fish
3819-134145-0026	train-other-500	had not the microcosm at my feet stirred my curiosity yet more keenly One ancient crab that was for ever shuffling frantically from side to side of the pool
none	none	 had particularly fascinated me there was a vacancy in its stare and an aimless violence in its behaviour that irresistibly recalled the Gardener who had befriended Sylvie and Bruno and as I gazed I caught the concluding notes of the tune of his crazy song The silence that followed was broken by the sweet voice of Sylvie Would you please let us out into the road What After that old beggar again the Gardener yelled and began singing He thought he saw a Kangaroo That worked a coffee mill He looked again and found it was A Vegetable pill Were I to swallow this he said I should be very ill We don t want him to swallow anything Sylvie explained 
3819-134145-0027	train-other-500	He s not hungry But we want to see him So Will you please
none	none	 Certainly the Gardener promptly replied I always please Never displeases nobody There you are 
3819-134145-0028	train-other-500	And he flung the door open and let us out upon the dusty high road We soon found our way to the bush which had so mysteriously sunk into the ground and here
3819-134145-0029	train-other-500	Sylvie drew the Magic Locket from its hiding place turned it over with a thoughtful air and at last appealed to Bruno in a rather helpless way What was it we had to do with it Bruno
3819-134145-0030	train-other-500	It s all gone out of my head Kiss it was Bruno s invariable recipe in cases of doubt and difficulty Sylvie kissed it but no result followed
none	none	 Rub it the wrong way 
3819-134145-0031	train-other-500	was Bruno s next suggestion Which is the wrong way Sylvie most reasonably enquired The obvious plan was to try both ways Rubbing from left to right had no visible effect whatever
none	none	 From right to left Oh stop Sylvie Bruno cried in sudden alarm Whatever is going to happen 
3819-134145-0032	train-other-500	For a number of trees on the neighbouring hillside were moving slowly upwards in solemn procession while a mild little brook that had been rippling at our feet a moment before
none	none	 began to swell and foam 
3819-134145-0033	train-other-500	and hiss and bubble
none	none	 in a truly alarming fashion Rub it some other way cried Bruno Try up and down Quick It was a happy thought 
3819-134145-0034	train-other-500	Up and down did it and the landscape which had been showing signs of mental aberration in various directions returned to its normal condition of sobriety with the exception of a small yellowish brown mouse
3819-134145-0035	train-other-500	which continued to run wildly up and down the road lashing its tail like a little lion Let s follow it said Sylvie
none	none	 and this also turned out a happy thought 
3819-134145-0036	train-other-500	The mouse at once settled down into a business like jog trot with which we could easily keep pace The only phenomenon that gave me any uneasiness
3819-134145-0037	train-other-500	was the rapid increase in the size of the little creature we were following which became every moment more and more like a real lion
none	none	 Soon the transformation was complete and a noble lion stood patiently waiting for us to come up with it No thought of fear seemed to occur to the children who patted and stroked it as if it had been a Shetland pony Help me up cried Bruno And in another moment Sylvie had lifted him upon the broad back of the gentle beast 
3819-134145-0038	train-other-500	and seated herself behind him pillion fashion Bruno took a good handful of mane in each hand
none	none	 and made believe to guide this new kind of steed Gee up seemed quite sufficient by way of verbal direction 
3819-134145-0039	train-other-500	the lion at once broke into an easy canter and we soon found ourselves in the depths of the forest I say we for I am certain that I accompanied them
3819-134145-0040	train-other-500	though how I managed to keep up with a cantering lion I am wholly unable to explain But I was certainly one of the party when we came upon an old beggar man cutting sticks at whose feet
3819-134145-0041	train-other-500	the lion made a profound obeisance Sylvie and Bruno at the same moment dismounting and leaping in to the arms of their father
none	none	 From bad to worse 
3819-134145-0042	train-other-500	the old man said to himself dreamily when the children had finished their rather confused account of the Ambassador s visit gathered no doubt from general report as they had not seen him themselves From bad to worse
3819-134145-0043	train-other-500	That is their destiny I see it but I cannot alter it The selfishness of a mean and crafty man the selfishness of an ambitious and silly woman the selfishness of a spiteful and loveless child
3819-134145-0044	train-other-500	all tend one way from bad to worse And you my darlings must suffer it awhile I fear Yet when things are at their worst you can come to me
none	none	 I can do but little as yet 
3819-134145-0045	train-other-500	Gathering up a handful of dust and scattering it in the air he slowly and solemnly pronounced some words that sounded like a charm the children looking on in awe struck silence
none	none	 Let craft 
3819-134145-0046	train-other-500	ambition spite Be quenched in Reason s night
none	none	 Till weakness turn to might 
3819-134145-0047	train-other-500	Till what is dark be light Till what is wrong
none	none	 be right The cloud of dust spread itself out through the air as if it were alive forming curious shapes that were for ever changing into others It makes letters It makes words Bruno whispered as he clung half frightened to Sylvie Only I ca n t make them out Read them Sylvie I ll try Sylvie gravely replied Wait a minute if only I could see that word I should be very ill 
3819-134145-0048	train-other-500	a discordant voice yelled in our ears Were
none	none	 I to swallow this he said I should be very ill 
3819-134146-0000	train-other-500	CHAPTER nine A JESTER AND A BEAR Yes we were in the garden once more and to escape that horrid discordant voice we hurried indoors and found ourselves in the library
none	none	 Uggug blubbering 
3819-134146-0001	train-other-500	the Professor standing by with a bewildered air and my Lady with her arms clasped round her son s neck repeating over and over again and did they give him nasty lessons to learn My
none	none	 own pretty pet 
3819-134146-0002	train-other-500	What s all this noise about the Vice warden angrily enquired as he strode into the room And who put the hat stand here And he hung his hat up on Bruno
3819-134146-0003	train-other-500	who was standing in the middle of the room too much astonished by the sudden change of scene to make any attempt at removing it though it came down to his shoulders making him look something like a small candle
3819-134146-0004	train-other-500	with a large extinguisher over it The Professor mildly explained that His Highness had been graciously pleased to say he wouldn t do his lessons
none	none	 Do your lessons this instant you young cub 
3819-134146-0005	train-other-500	thundered the Vice Warden And take this and a resounding box on the ear made the unfortunate Professor reel across the room
none	none	 Save me faltered the poor old man 
3819-134146-0006	train-other-500	as he sank half fainting at my Lady s feet Shave you Of
none	none	 course I will my Lady replied as she lifted him into a chair and pinned an anti macassar round his neck Where s the razor The Vice Warden meanwhile had got hold of Uggug and was belabouring him with his umbrella Who left this loose nail in the floor 
3819-134146-0007	train-other-500	he shouted Hammer it in I say Hammer it
none	none	 in 
3819-134146-0008	train-other-500	Blow after blow
none	none	 fell on the writhing Uggug till he dropped howling to the floor Then his father turned to the shaving scene which was being enacted and roared with laughter Excuse me dear I ca n t help it he said as soon as he could speak You are such an utter donkey Kiss me Tabby 
3819-134146-0009	train-other-500	And he flung his arms round the neck of the terrified Professor who raised a wild shriek but whether he received the threatened kiss or not I was unable to see as Bruno who had by this time released himself from his extinguisher
none	none	 rushed headlong out of the room followed by Sylvie and I was so fearful of being left alone among all these crazy creatures 
3819-134146-0010	train-other-500	that I hurried after them We must go to Father Sylvie panted as they ran down the garden
none	none	 I m sure things are at their worst 
3819-134146-0011	train-other-500	I ll ask the Gardener to let us out again
none	none	 But we ca n t walk all the way Bruno whimpered How I wiss we had a coach and four like Uncle And shrill and wild rang through the air the familiar voice He thought he saw a Coach and Four That stood beside his bed He looked again and found it was A Bear without a Head Poor thing he said poor silly thing It s waiting to be fed No I ca n t let you out again he said before the children could speak The Vice warden gave it me he did for letting you out last time So be off with you And turning away from them he began digging frantically in the middle of a gravel walk singing over and over again Poor thing he said poor silly thing It s waiting to be fed but in a more musical tone than the shrill screech in which he had begun The music grew fuller and richer at every moment other manly voices joined in the refrain and soon I heard the heavy thud that told me the boat had touched the beach and the harsh grating of the shingle as the men dragged it up I roused myself 
3819-134146-0012	train-other-500	and after lending them a hand in hauling up their boat I lingered yet awhile to watch them disembark a goodly assortment of the hard won treasures of the deep When at last I reached our lodgings I was tired and sleepy
3819-134146-0013	train-other-500	and glad enough to settle down again into the easy chair while Arthur hospitably went to his cupboard to get me out some cake and wine without which he declared he could not as a doctor permit my going to bed
3819-134146-0014	train-other-500	And how that cupboard door did creak It surely could not be Arthur who was opening and shutting it so often moving so restlessly about and muttering like the soliloquy of a tragedy queen No
3819-134146-0015	train-other-500	it was a female voice Also the figure half hidden by the cupboard door was a female figure massive and in flowing robes Could it be the landlady The door opened
3819-134146-0016	train-other-500	and a strange man entered the room What is that donkey doing he said to himself pausing aghast on the threshold The lady thus rudely referred to was his wife
3819-134146-0017	train-other-500	She had got one of the cupboards open and stood with her back to him smoothing down a sheet of brown paper on one of the shelves and whispering to herself So so Deftly done
3819-134146-0018	train-other-500	Craftily contrived Her loving husband stole behind her on tiptoe and tapped her on the head Boh he playfully shouted at her ear
none	none	 Never tell me again I ca n t say boh to a goose 
3819-134146-0019	train-other-500	My Lady wrung her hands
none	none	 Discovered 
3819-134146-0020	train-other-500	she groaned Yet no he is one of us Reveal it not oh Man
none	none	 Let it bide its time Reveal what not 
3819-134146-0021	train-other-500	her husband testily replied dragging out the sheet of brown paper What
none	none	 are you hiding here my Lady 
3819-134146-0022	train-other-500	I insist upon knowing My Lady cast down her eyes and spoke in the littlest of little voices
none	none	 Don t make fun of it Benjamin 
3819-134146-0023	train-other-500	she pleaded It s it s don t you understand It s a
none	none	 DAGGER And what s that for 
3819-134146-0024	train-other-500	sneered His Excellency We ve only got to make people think he s dead
none	none	 We haven t got to kill 
3819-134146-0025	train-other-500	him And made of tin too he snarled contemptuously bending the blade round his thumb Now Madam you ll be good enough to explain First what
none	none	 do you call me Benjamin for It s part of the Conspiracy Love 
3819-134146-0026	train-other-500	One must have an alias you know Oh
none	none	 an alias is it Well And next 
3819-134146-0027	train-other-500	what did you get this dagger for Come no evasions You ca n t deceive me
none	none	 I got it for for for 
3819-134146-0028	train-other-500	the detected Conspirator stammered trying her best to put on the assassin expression that she had been practising at the looking glass
none	none	 For For what Madam Well for eighteenpence if you must know dearest 
3819-134146-0029	train-other-500	That s what I got it for
none	none	 on my Now don t say your Word and Honour 
3819-134146-0030	train-other-500	groaned the other Conspirator Why they aren t worth half the money put together On my birthday my Lady concluded in a meek whisper One must have a dagger you know It s
none	none	 part of the 
3819-134146-0031	train-other-500	Oh don t talk of Conspiracies her husband savagely interrupted as he tossed the dagger into the cupboard
none	none	 You know about as much how to manage a Conspiracy as if you were a chicken Why the first thing is to get a disguise 
3819-134146-0032	train-other-500	Now just look at this And with pardonable pride he fitted on the cap and bells
none	none	 and the rest of the Fool s dress 
3819-134146-0033	train-other-500	and winked at her and put his tongue in his cheek Is that the sort of thing now he demanded My Lady s eyes flashed with all a Conspirator s enthusiasm
none	none	 The very thing 
3819-134146-0034	train-other-500	she exclaimed clapping her hands You do look
none	none	 oh such a perfect Fool 
3819-134146-0035	train-other-500	The Fool smiled a doubtful smile
none	none	 He was not quite clear whether it was a compliment or not to express it so plainly 
3819-134146-0036	train-other-500	You mean a Jester Yes that s what I intended And what do you think your disguise is to be And he proceeded to unfold the parcel the lady watching him in rapture
none	none	 Oh how lovely she cried 
3819-134146-0037	train-other-500	when at last the dress was unfolded
none	none	 What a splendid disguise An Esquimaux peasant woman An Esquimaux peasant indeed growled the other Here put it on and look at yourself in the glass Why it s a Bear ca n t you use your eyes He checked himself suddenly 
3819-134146-0038	train-other-500	as a harsh voice yelled through the room
none	none	 He looked again and found it was A Bear without a Head 
3819-134146-0039	train-other-500	But it was only the Gardener singing under the open window The Vice Warden stole on tip toe to the window and closed it noiselessly before he ventured to go on Yes Lovey
3819-134146-0040	train-other-500	a Bear but not without a head I hope
none	none	 You re the Bear and me the Keeper 
3819-134146-0041	train-other-500	And if any one knows us they ll have sharp eyes that s all
none	none	 I shall have to practise the steps a bit 
3819-134146-0042	train-other-500	my Lady said looking out through the Bear s mouth
none	none	 one ca n t help being rather human just at first you know And of course you ll say Come up Bruin won t you Yes of course replied the Keeper 
3819-134146-0043	train-other-500	laying hold of the chain that hung from the Bear s collar with one hand while with the other he cracked a little whip
none	none	 Now go round the room in a sort of a dancing attitude Very good my dear very good Come up Bruin Come up I say He roared out the last words for the benefit of Uggug 
3819-134146-0044	train-other-500	who had just come into the room and was now standing with his hands spread out and eyes and mouth wide open the very picture of stupid amazement
none	none	 Oh my 
3819-134146-0045	train-other-500	was all he could gasp out The Keeper pretended to be adjusting the bear s collar
none	none	 which gave him an opportunity of whispering unheard by Uggug 
3819-134146-0046	train-other-500	my fault I m afraid Quite forgot to fasten the door Plot s ruined if he finds it out Keep it up a minute or two longer Be savage Then while seeming to pull it back with all his strength
3819-134146-0047	train-other-500	he let it advance upon the scared boy my Lady with admirable presence of mind kept up what she no doubt intended for a savage growl though it was more like the purring of a cat
none	none	 and Uggug backed out of the room with such haste that he tripped over the mat and was heard to fall heavily outside 
3819-134146-0048	train-other-500	an accident to which even his doting mother paid no heed in the excitement of the moment The Vice Warden shut and bolted the door Off with the disguises he panted
none	none	 There s not a moment to lose He s sure to fetch the Professor and we couldn t take him in you know 
3819-134146-0049	train-other-500	And in another minute the disguises were stowed away in the cupboard the door unbolted and the two Conspirators seated lovingly side by side on the sofa
3819-134146-0050	train-other-500	earnestly discussing a book the Vice Warden had hastily snatched off the table which proved to be the City Directory of the capital of Outland The door opened very slowly and cautiously and the Professor peeped in
none	none	 Uggug s stupid face being just visible behind him It is a beautiful arrangement 
3819-134146-0051	train-other-500	the Vice warden was saying with enthusiasm You see my precious one that there are fifteen houses in Green Street before you turn into West Street
none	none	 Fifteen houses Is it possible my Lady replied I thought it was fourteen 
3819-134146-0052	train-other-500	And so intent were they on this interesting question that neither of them even looked up till the Professor
none	none	 leading Uggug by the hand 
3819-134146-0053	train-other-500	stood close before them My Lady was the first to notice their approach Why here s the Professor she exclaimed in her blandest tones And my precious child too Are lessons over
none	none	 A strange thing has happened 
3819-134146-0054	train-other-500	the Professor began in a trembling tone
none	none	 His Exalted Fatness this was one of Uggug s many titles tells me he has just seen in this very room a Dancing Bear 
3819-134146-0055	train-other-500	and a Court Jester The Vice Warden and his wife shook with well acted merriment Not in this room darling said the fond mother
3819-134146-0056	train-other-500	We ve been sitting here this hour or more reading here she referred to the book lying on her lap reading the the City Directory Let me feel your pulse my boy
3819-134146-0057	train-other-500	said the anxious father Now put out your tongue Ah I thought so He s a little feverish Professor
none	none	 and has had a bad dream 
3819-134146-0058	train-other-500	Put him to bed at once and give him a cooling draught I ain t been dreaming his Exalted Fatness remonstrated as the Professor led him away Bad grammar Sir
3819-134146-0059	train-other-500	his father remarked with some sternness Kindly attend to that little matter Professor as soon as you have corrected the feverishness And by the way Professor
3819-134146-0060	train-other-500	The Professor left his distinguished pupil standing at the door and meekly returned There is a rumour afloat that the people wish to elect an
none	none	 in point of fact an you understand that I mean an Not another Professor the poor old man exclaimed in horror 
3819-134146-0061	train-other-500	No Certainly not
none	none	 the Vice Warden eagerly explained Merely an Emperor you understand An Emperor cried the astonished Professor holding his head between his hands as if he expected it to come to pieces with the shock What will the Warden Why the Warden will most likely be the new Emperor my Lady explained Where could we find a better Unless perhaps 
3819-134146-0062	train-other-500	she glanced at her husband
none	none	 Where indeed 
3819-134146-0063	train-other-500	the Professor fervently responded quite failing to take the hint The Vice Warden resumed the thread of his discourse The reason I mentioned it Professor
none	none	 was to ask you to be so kind as to preside at the Election You see 
3819-134146-0064	train-other-500	it would make the thing respectable no suspicion of anything underhand
none	none	 I fear I ca n t your Excellency 
3819-134146-0065	train-other-500	the old man faltered
none	none	 What will the Warden True true 
3819-134146-0066	train-other-500	the Vice Warden interrupted Your position as Court Professor makes it awkward I admit
none	none	 Well well Then the Election shall be held without you Better so than if it were held within me the Professor murmured with a bewildered air as if he hardly knew what he was saying Bed I think your Highness said 
3819-134146-0067	train-other-500	and a cooling draught
none	none	 And he wandered dreamily back to where Uggug sulkily awaited him I followed them out of the room and down the passage the Professor murmuring to himself all the time as a kind of aid to his feeble memory C C C Couch Cooling Draught Correct Grammar till in turning a corner he met Sylvie and Bruno so suddenly that the startled Professor let go of his fat pupil who instantly took to his heels CHAPTER ten THE OTHER PROFESSOR We were looking for you cried Sylvie in a tone of great relief We do want you so much you ca n t think What is it dear children the Professor asked beaming on them with a very different look from what Uggug ever got from him We want you to speak to the Gardener for us Sylvie said as she and Bruno took the old man s hands and led him into the hall He s ever so unkind Bruno mournfully added They s all unkind to us now that Father s gone The Lion were much nicer But you must explain to me please the Professor said with an anxious look which is the Lion and which is the Gardener It s most important not to get two such animals confused together And one s very liable to do it in their case both having mouths you know Doos oo always confuses two animals together Bruno asked Pretty often I m afraid the Professor candidly confessed Now for instance there s the rabbit hutch and the hall clock The Professor pointed them out One gets a little confused with them both having doors you know Now only yesterday would you believe it I put some lettuces into the clock and tried to wind up the rabbit Did the rabbit go after oo wounded it up said Bruno The Professor clasped his hands on the top of his head and groaned Go I should think it did go Why it s gone And where ever it s gone to that s what I ca n t find out I ve done my best I ve read all the article Rabbit in the great dictionary Come in Only the tailor Sir with your little bill said a meek voice outside the door Ah well I can soon settle his business the Professor said to the children if you ll just wait a minute How much is it this year my man The tailor had come in while he was speaking Well it s been a doubling so many years you see the tailor replied a little gruffly and I think I d like the money now It s two thousand pound it is Oh that s nothing the Professor carelessly remarked feeling in his pocket as if he always carried at least that amount about with him But wouldn t you like to wait just another year and make it four thousand Just think how rich you d be Why you might be a King if you liked I don t know as I d care about being a King the man said thoughtfully But it dew sound a powerful sight o money Well I think I ll wait Of course you will said the Professor There s good sense in you I see Good day to you my man Will you ever have to pay him that four thousand pounds Sylvie asked as the door closed on the departing creditor Never my child the Professor replied emphatically He ll go on doubling it till he dies You see it s always worth while waiting another year to get twice as much money And now what would you like to do my little friends Shall I take you to see the Other Professor This would be an excellent opportunity for a visit he said to himself glancing at his watch he generally takes a short rest of fourteen minutes and a half about this time Bruno hastily went round to Sylvie who was standing at the other side of the Professor and put his hand into hers I thinks we d like to go he said doubtfully only please let s go all together It s best to be on the safe side oo know Why you talk as if you were Sylvie exclaimed the Professor I know I did Bruno replied very humbly I quite forgotted I wasn t Sylvie Only I fought he might be rarver fierce The Professor laughed a jolly laugh Oh he s quite tame he said He never bites He s only a little a little dreamy you know He took hold of Bruno s other hand and led the children down a long passage I had never noticed before not that there was anything remarkable in that I was constantly coming on new rooms and passages in that mysterious Palace and very seldom succeeded in finding the old ones again Near the end of the passage the Professor stopped This is his room he said pointing to the solid wall We ca n t get in through there Bruno exclaimed Sylvie said nothing till she had carefully examined whether the wall opened anywhere Then she laughed merrily You re playing us a trick you dear old thing she said There s no door here There isn t any door to the room said the Professor We shall have to climb in at the window So we went into the garden and soon found the window of the Other Professor s room It was a ground floor window and stood invitingly open the Professor first lifted the two children in and then he and I climbed in after them The Other Professor was seated at a table with a large book open before him on which his forehead was resting he had clasped his arms round the book and was snoring heavily He usually reads like that the Professor remarked when the book s very interesting and then sometimes it s very difficult to get him to attend This seemed to be one of the difficult times the Professor lifted him up once or twice and shook him violently but he always returned to his book the moment he was let go of and showed by his heavy breathing that the book was as interesting as ever How dreamy he is the Professor exclaimed He must have got to a very interesting part of the book And he rained quite a shower of thumps on the Other Professor s back shouting Hoy Hoy all the time Isn t it wonderful that he should be so dreamy he said to Bruno If he s always as sleepy as that Bruno remarked a course he s dreamy But what are we to do said the Professor You see he s quite wrapped up in the book Suppose oo shuts the book Bruno suggested That s it cried the delighted Professor Of course that ll do it And he shut up the book so quickly that he caught the Other Professor s nose between the leaves and gave it a severe pinch The Other Professor instantly rose to his feet and carried the book away to the end of the room where he put it back in its place in the book case I ve been reading for eighteen hours and three quarters he said and now I shall rest for fourteen minutes and a half Is the Lecture all ready Very nearly the Professor humbly replied I shall ask you to give me a hint or two there will be a few little difficulties And Banquet I think you said Oh yes The Banquet comes first of course People never enjoy Abstract Science you know when they re ravenous with hunger And then there s the Fancy Dress Ball Oh there ll be lots of entertainment Where will the Ball come in said the Other Professor I think it had better come at the beginning of the Banquet it brings people together so nicely you know Yes that s the right order First the Meeting then the Eating then the Treating for I m sure any Lecture you give us will be a treat said the Other Professor who had been standing with his back to us all this time occupying himself in taking the books out one by one and turning them upside down An easel with a black board on it stood near him and every time that he turned a book upside down he made a mark on the board with a piece of chalk And as to the Pig Tale which you have so kindly promised to give us the Professor went on thoughtfully rubbing his chin I think that had better come at the end of the Banquet then people can listen to it quietly Shall I sing it the Other Professor asked with a smile of delight If you can the Professor replied cautiously Let me try said the Other Professor seating himself at the pianoforte For the sake of argument let us assume that it begins on A flat And he struck the note in question La la la I think that s within an octave of it He struck the note again and appealed to Bruno who was standing at his side Did I sing it like that my child No oo didn t Bruno replied with great decision It were more like a duck Single notes are apt to have that effect the Other Professor said with a sigh Let me try a whole verse There was a Pig that sat alone Beside a ruined Pump By day and night he made his moan It would have stirred a heart of stone To see him wring his hoofs and groan Because he could not jump Would you call that a tune Professor he asked when he had finished The Professor considered a little Well he said at last some of the notes are the same as others and some are different but I should hardly call it a tune Let me try it a bit by myself said the Other Professor And he began touching the notes here and there and humming to himself like an angry bluebottle How do you like his singing the Professor asked the children in a low voice It isn t very beautiful Sylvie said hesitatingly It s very extremely ugly Bruno said without any hesitation at all All extremes are bad the Professor said very gravely For instance Sobriety is a very good thing when practised in moderation but even Sobriety when carried to an extreme has its disadvantages What are its disadvantages was the question that rose in my mind and as usual Bruno asked it for me What are its lizard bandages Well this is one of them said the Professor When a man s tipsy that s one extreme you know he sees one thing as two But when he s extremely sober that s the other extreme he sees two things as one It s equally inconvenient whichever happens What does illconvenient mean Bruno whispered to Sylvie The difference between convenient and inconvenient is best explained by an example said the Other Professor who had overheard the question If you ll just think over any Poem that contains the two words such as The Professor put his hands over his ears with a look of dismay If you once let him begin a Poem he said to Sylvie he ll never leave off again He never does Did he ever begin a Poem and not leave off again Sylvie enquired Three times said the Professor Bruno raised himself on tiptoe till his lips were on a level with Sylvie s ear What became of them three Poems he whispered Is he saying them all now Hush said Sylvie The Other Professor is speaking I ll say it very quick murmured the Other Professor with downcast eyes and melancholy voice which contrasted oddly with his face as he had forgotten to leave off smiling At least it wasn t exactly a smile as Sylvie said afterwards it looked as if his mouth was made that shape Go on then said the Professor What must be must be Remember that Sylvie whispered to Bruno It s a very good rule for whenever you hurt yourself And it s a very good rule for whenever I make a noise said the saucy little fellow So you remember it too Miss Whatever do you mean said Sylvie trying to frown a thing she never managed particularly well Oftens and oftens said Bruno haven t oo told me There mustn t be so much noise Bruno when I ve tolded oo There must Why there isn t no rules at all about There mustn t But oo never believes me As if any one could believe you you wicked wicked boy said Sylvie The words were severe enough but I am of opinion that when you are really anxious to impress a criminal with a sense of his guilt you ought not to pronounce the sentence with your lips quite close to his cheek since a kiss at the end of it however accidental weakens the effect terribly CHAPTER eleven PETER AND PAUL
3825_134148_000001_000000	train-clean-360	 As I was saying the other Professor resumed if you ll just think over any Poem that contains the words such as 
3825_134148_000002_000000	train-clean-360	 Peter is poor said noble Paul And I have always been his friend And though my means to give are small At least I can afford to lend How few in this cold age of greed Do good except on selfish grounds But I can feel for Peter s need And I WILL LEND HIM FIFTY POUNDS 
none	none	How great was Peter s joy to find His friend in such a genial vein How cheerfully the bond he signed To pay the money back again We ca n t said Paul be too precise Tis best to fix the very day So by a learned friend s advice I ve made it Noon the Fourth of May But this is April 
3825_134148_000005_000001	train-clean-360	Peter said The First of April as I think Five little weeks will soon be fled One scarcely will have time to wink Give me a year to speculate To buy and sell to drive a trade Said Paul I cannot change the date On May the Fourth it must be paid 
3825_134148_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 Well well said Peter with a sigh Hand me the cash and I will go I ll form a Joint Stock Company And turn an honest pound or so I m grieved said Paul to seem unkind The money shalt of course be lent But for a week or two I find It will not be convenient 
3825_134148_000007_000000	train-clean-360	So week by week poor Peter came And turned in heaviness away For still the answer was the same I cannot manage it to day And now the April showers were dry The five short weeks were nearly spent Yet still he got the old reply It is not quite convenient 
3825_134148_000008_000000	train-clean-360	The Fourth arrived and punctual Paul Came with his legal friend at noon I thought it best said he to call One cannot settle things too soon Poor Peter shuddered in despair His flowing locks he wildly tore And very soon his yellow hair Was lying all about the floor 
none	none	The legal friend was standing by With sudden pity half unmanned The tear drop trembled in his eye The signed agreement in his hand But when at length the legal soul Resumed its customary force The Law he said we ca n t control Pay or the Law must take its course 
3825_134148_000010_000000	train-clean-360	Said Paul How bitterly I rue That fatal morning when I called Consider Peter what you do You won t be richer when you re bald Think you by rending curls away To make your difficulties less Forbear this violence I pray You do but add to my distress 
none	none	Not willingly would I inflict Said Peter on that noble heart One needless pang 
3825_134148_000012_000001	train-clean-360	Yet why so strict Is this to act a friendly part However legal it may be To pay what never has been lent This style of business seems to me Extremely inconvenient 
none	none	No Nobleness of soul have I Like some that in this Age are found Paul blushed in sheer humility And cast his eyes upon the ground This debt will simply swallow all And make my life a life of woe Nay nay nay Peter answered Paul You must not rail on Fortune so You have enough to eat and drink You are respected in the world And at the barber s as I think You often get your whiskers curled Though Nobleness you ca n t attain To any very great extent The path of Honesty is plain However inconvenient Tis true said Peter I m alive I keep my station in the world Once in the week I just contrive To get my whiskers oiled and curled But my assets are very low My little income s overspent To trench on capital you know Is always inconvenient
3825_134148_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 But pay your debts cried honest Paul My gentle Peter pay your debts What matter if it swallows all That you describe as your assets Already you re an hour behind Yet Generosity is best It pinches me but never mind I WILL NOT CHARGE YOU INTEREST 
none	none	How good 
3825_134148_000017_000001	train-clean-360	How great poor Peter cried Yet I must sell my Sunday wig The scarf pin that has been my pride My grand piano and my pig Full soon his property took wings And daily as each treasure went He sighed to find the state of things Grow less and less convenient 
3825_134148_000018_000000	train-clean-360	Weeks grew to months and months to years Peter was worn to skin and bone And once he even said with tears Remember Paul that promised Loan Said Paul I ll lend you when I can All the spare money I have got Ah Peter you re a happy man Yours is an enviable lot 
none	none	I m getting stout as you may see It is but seldom I am well I cannot feel my ancient glee In listening to the dinner bell But you you gambol like a boy Your figure is so spare and light The dinner bell s a note of joy To such a healthy appetite 
3825_134148_000021_000000	train-clean-360	Said Peter I am well aware Mine is a state of happiness And yet how gladly could I spare Some of the comforts I possess What you call healthy appetite I feel as Hunger s savage tooth And when no dinner is in sight The dinner bell s a sound of ruth 
3825_134148_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 No scare crow would accept this coat Such boots as these you seldom see Ah Paul a single five pound note Would make another man of me Said Paul It fills me with surprise To hear you talk in such a tone I fear you scarcely realise The blessings that are all your own 
none	none	You re safe from being overfed You re sweetly picturesque in rags You never know the aching head That comes along with money bags And you have time to cultivate That best of qualities Content For which you ll find your present state Remarkably convenient 
3825_134148_000024_000000	train-clean-360	Said Peter Though I cannot sound The depths of such a man as you Yet in your character I ve found An inconsistency or two You seem to have long years to spare When there s a promise to fulfil And yet how punctual you were In calling with that little bill 
3825_134148_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 One can t be too deliberate Said Paul in parting with one s pelf With bills as you correctly state I m punctuality itself A man may surely claim his dues But when there s money to be lent A man must be allowed to choose Such times as are convenient 
3825_134148_000026_000000	train-clean-360	It chanced one day as Peter sat Gnawing a crust his usual meal Paul bustled in to have a chat And grasped his hand with friendly zeal I knew said he your frugal ways So that I might not wound your pride By bringing strangers in to gaze I ve left my legal friend outside 
3825_134148_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 You well remember I am sure When first your wealth began to go And people sneered at one so poor I never used my Peter so And when you d lost your little all And found yourself a thing despised I need not ask you to recall How tenderly I sympathised 
3825_134148_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 Then the advice I ve poured on you So full of wisdom and of wit All given gratis though tis true I might have fairly charged for it But I refrain from mentioning Full many a deed I might relate For boasting is a kind of thing That I particularly hate 
none	none	How vast the total sum appears Of all the kindnesses I ve done From Childhood s half forgotten years Down to that Loan of April One That Fifty Pounds 
3825_134148_000030_000001	train-clean-360	You little guessed How deep it drained my slender store But there s a heart within this breast And I WILL LEND YOU FIFTY MORE 
3825_134148_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 Not so was Peter s mild reply His cheeks all wet with grateful tears No man recalls so well as I Your services in bygone years And this new offer I admit Is very very kindly meant Still to avail myself of it Would not be quite convenient 
3825_134148_000032_000000	train-clean-360	You ll see in a moment what the difference is between convenient and inconvenient You quite understand it now don t you he added looking kindly at Bruno who was sitting at Sylvie s side on the floor 
3825_134148_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes said Bruno very quietly 
3825_134148_000033_000001	train-clean-360	Such a short speech was very unusual for him but just then he seemed I fancied a little exhausted 
3825_134148_000033_000002	train-clean-360	In fact he climbed up into Sylvie s lap as he spoke and rested his head against her shoulder 
none	none	What a many verses it was he whispered CHAPTER twelve A MUSICAL GARDENER The Other Professor regarded him with some anxiety
4148_134149_000002_000001	train-clean-360	 The smaller animal ought to go to bed at once he said with an air of authority 
4148_134149_000003_000000	train-clean-360	 Why at once said the Professor 
4148_134149_000004_000000	train-clean-360	 Because he can t go at twice said the Other Professor 
4148_134149_000005_000000	train-clean-360	The Professor gently clapped his hands 
none	none	Isn t he wonderful he said to Sylvie
4148_134149_000005_000002	train-clean-360	 Nobody else could have thought of the reason so quick 
none	none	Why of course he ca n t go at twice 
4148_134149_000005_000004	train-clean-360	It would hurt him to be divided 
4148_134149_000006_000000	train-clean-360	This remark woke up Bruno suddenly and completely 
4148_134149_000006_000001	train-clean-360	 I don t want to be divided he said decisively 
4148_134149_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 It does very well on a diagram said the Other Professor 
4148_134149_000007_000001	train-clean-360	 I could show it you in a minute only the chalk s a little blunt 
4148_134149_000008_000000	train-clean-360	 Take care Sylvie anxiously exclaimed as he began rather clumsily to point it 
4148_134149_000008_000001	train-clean-360	 You ll cut your finger off if you hold the knife so 
none	none	If oo cuts it off will oo give it to me please 
4148_134149_000009_000001	train-clean-360	Bruno thoughtfully added 
4148_134149_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 It s like this said the Other Professor hastily drawing a long line upon the black board and marking the letters A B at the two ends and C in the middle let me explain it to you 
none	none	If AB were to be divided into two parts at C
4148_134149_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 It would be drownded Bruno pronounced confidently 
4148_134149_000012_000000	train-clean-360	The Other Professor gasped 
4148_134149_000012_000001	train-clean-360	 What would be drownded 
4148_134149_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 Why the bumble bee of course said Bruno 
4148_134149_000013_000001	train-clean-360	 And the two bits would sink down in the sea 
4148_134149_000014_000000	train-clean-360	Here the Professor interfered as the Other Professor was evidently too much puzzled to go on with his diagram 
4148_134149_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 When I said it would hurt him I was merely referring to the action of the nerves 
4148_134149_000016_000000	train-clean-360	The Other Professor brightened up in a moment 
4148_134149_000016_000001	train-clean-360	 The action of the nerves he began eagerly is curiously slow in some people 
none	none	I had a friend once that if you burnt him with a red hot poker it would take years and years before he felt it
4148_134149_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 And if you only pinched him queried Sylvie 
4148_134149_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 Then it would take ever so much longer of course 
4148_134149_000018_000001	train-clean-360	In fact I doubt if the man himself would ever feel it at all 
4148_134149_000018_000002	train-clean-360	His grandchildren might 
4148_134149_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 I wouldn t like to be the grandchild of a pinched grandfather would you Mister Sir Bruno whispered 
4148_134149_000019_000001	train-clean-360	 It might come just when you wanted to be happy 
4148_134149_000020_000000	train-clean-360	That would be awkward I admitted taking it quite as a matter of course that he had so suddenly caught sight of me 
4148_134149_000020_000001	train-clean-360	 But don t you always want to be happy Bruno 
4148_134149_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 Not always Bruno said thoughtfully 
4148_134149_000021_000001	train-clean-360	 Sometimes when I s too happy I wants to be a little miserable 
none	none	Then I just tell Sylvie about it oo know and Sylvie sets me some lessons 
4148_134149_000021_000003	train-clean-360	Then it s all right 
4148_134149_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 I m sorry you don t like lessons I said 
none	none	You should copy Sylvie She s always as busy as the day is long
4148_134149_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 Well so am I said Bruno 
none	none	No no Sylvie corrected him
4148_134149_000025_000001	train-clean-360	 You re as busy as the day is short 
4148_134149_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 Well what s the difference Bruno asked 
4148_134149_000026_000001	train-clean-360	 Mister Sir isn t the day as short as it s long 
4148_134149_000026_000002	train-clean-360	I mean isn t it the same length 
4148_134149_000027_000000	train-clean-360	Never having considered the question in this light I suggested that they had better ask the Professor and they ran off in a moment to appeal to their old friend 
4148_134149_000027_000001	train-clean-360	The Professor left off polishing his spectacles to consider 
4148_134149_000027_000002	train-clean-360	 My dears he said after a minute the day is the same length as anything that is the same length as it And he resumed his never ending task of polishing 
4148_134149_000028_000000	train-clean-360	The children returned slowly and thoughtfully to report his answer Isn t he wise 
4148_134149_000029_000000	train-clean-360	Sylvie asked in an awestruck whisper 
none	none	If I was as wise as that I should have a head ache all day long I know I should
4148_134149_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 You appear to be talking to somebody that isn t here the Professor said turning round to the children 
4148_134149_000030_000001	train-clean-360	 Who is it 
none	none	Bruno looked puzzled
4148_134149_000031_000001	train-clean-360	 I never talks to nobody when he isn t here he replied 
none	none	It isn t good manners Oo should always wait till he comes before oo talks to him 
4148_134149_000032_000000	train-clean-360	The Professor looked anxiously in my direction and seemed to look through and through me without seeing me 
4148_134149_000032_000001	train-clean-360	 Then who are you talking to he said 
none	none	There isn t anybody here you know except the Other Professor and he isn t here he added wildly turning round and round like a teetotum Children 
4148_134149_000032_000004	train-clean-360	Help to look for him 
none	none	Quick 
4148_134149_000032_000006	train-clean-360	He s got lost again 
4148_134149_000033_000000	train-clean-360	The children were on their feet in a moment 
4148_134149_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 Where shall we look said Sylvie 
4148_134149_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 Anywhere shouted the excited Professor 
4148_134149_000035_000001	train-clean-360	 Only be quick about it And he began trotting round and round the room lifting up the chairs and shaking them 
4148_134149_000036_000000	train-clean-360	Bruno took a very small book out of the bookcase opened it and shook it in imitation of the Professor 
4148_134149_000036_000001	train-clean-360	 He isn t here he said 
none	none	He ca n t be there Bruno Sylvie said indignantly Course he ca n t said Bruno
4148_134149_000038_000001	train-clean-360	 I should have shooked him out if he d been in there 
4148_134149_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 Has he ever been lost before Sylvie enquired turning up a corner of the hearth rug and peeping under it 
4148_134149_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 Once before said the Professor he once lost himself in a wood 
4148_134149_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 And couldn t he find his self again said Bruno 
4148_134149_000041_000001	train-clean-360	 Why didn t he shout He d be sure to hear his self cause he couldn t be far off oo know 
4148_134149_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 Lets try shouting said the Professor 
4148_134149_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 What shall we shout said Sylvie 
4148_134149_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 On second thoughts don t shout the Professor replied 
4148_134149_000044_000001	train-clean-360	 The Vice Warden might hear you 
4148_134149_000044_000002	train-clean-360	He s getting awfully strict 
4148_134149_000045_000000	train-clean-360	This reminded the poor children of all the troubles about which they had come to their old friend 
4148_134149_000045_000001	train-clean-360	Bruno sat down on the floor and began crying 
4148_134149_000045_000002	train-clean-360	 He is so cruel he sobbed 
4148_134149_000045_000003	train-clean-360	 And he lets Uggug take away all my toys 
none	none	And such horrid meals What did you have for dinner to day said the Professor
4148_134149_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 A little piece of a dead crow was Bruno s mournful reply 
4148_134149_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 He means rook pie Sylvie explained 
none	none	It were a dead crow Bruno persisted
4148_134149_000049_000001	train-clean-360	 And there were a apple pudding and Uggug ate it all and I got nuffin but a crust 
none	none	And I asked for a orange and didn t get it And the poor little fellow buried his face in Sylvie s lap who kept gently stroking his hair as she went on
4148_134149_000049_000003	train-clean-360	 It s all true Professor dear 
none	none	They do treat my darling Bruno very badly And they re not kind to me either she added in a lower tone as if that were a thing of much less importance The Professor got out a large red silk handkerchief and wiped his eyes I wish I could help you dear children he said
4148_134149_000050_000001	train-clean-360	 But what can I do 
4148_134149_000051_000000	train-clean-360	 We know the way to Fairyland where Father s gone quite well said Sylvie if only the Gardener would let us out 
4148_134149_000052_000000	train-clean-360	 Won t he open the door for you said the Professor 
4148_134149_000053_000000	train-clean-360	 Not for us said Sylvie but I m sure he would for you 
4148_134149_000053_000001	train-clean-360	Do come and ask him Professor dear 
4148_134149_000054_000000	train-clean-360	 I ll come this minute said the Professor 
4148_134149_000055_000000	train-clean-360	Bruno sat up and dried his eyes 
4148_134149_000055_000001	train-clean-360	 Isn t he kind Mister Sir 
4148_134149_000056_000000	train-clean-360	 He is indeed said I But the Professor took no notice of my remark He had put on a beautiful cap with a long tassel and was selecting one of the Other Professor s walking sticks from a stand in the corner of the room 
4148_134149_000056_000001	train-clean-360	 A thick stick in one s hand makes people respectful he was saying to himself 
4148_134149_000056_000002	train-clean-360	 Come along dear children And we all went out into the garden together 
4148_134149_000057_000000	train-clean-360	 I shall address him first of all the Professor explained as we went along with a few playful remarks on the weather 
4148_134149_000057_000001	train-clean-360	I shall then question him about the Other Professor 
4148_134149_000057_000002	train-clean-360	This will have a double advantage 
none	none	First it will open the conversation you can t even drink a bottle of wine without opening it first and secondly if he s seen the Other Professor we shall find him that way and if he hasn t we sha n t 
4148_134149_000058_000000	train-clean-360	On our way we passed the target at which Uggug had been made to shoot during the Ambassador s visit 
4148_134149_000059_000000	train-clean-360	 See said the Professor pointing out a hole in the middle of the bull s eye 
4148_134149_000059_000001	train-clean-360	 His Imperial Fatness had only one shot at it and he went in just here 
4148_134149_000060_000000	train-clean-360	Bruno carefully examined the hole 
none	none	Couldn t go in there he whispered to me He are too fat We had no sort of difficulty in finding the Gardener Though he was hidden from us by some trees that harsh voice of his served to direct us and as we drew nearer the words of his song became more and more plainly audible
4148_134149_000062_000000	train-clean-360	 He thought he saw an Albatross That fluttered round the lamp He looked again and found it was A Penny Postage Stamp You d best be getting home he said The nights are very damp 
4148_134149_000074_000000	train-clean-360	 The nights are very damp 
4148_134149_000064_000000	train-clean-360	 Would it be afraid of catching cold said Bruno 
4148_134149_000065_000000	train-clean-360	 If it got very damp Sylvie suggested it might stick to something you know 
none	none	And that somefin would have to go by the post what ever it was Bruno eagerly exclaimed
4148_134149_000066_000001	train-clean-360	 Suppose it was a cow 
4148_134149_000066_000002	train-clean-360	Wouldn t it be dreadful for the other things 
none	none	And all these things happened to him said the Professor
4148_134149_000067_000001	train-clean-360	 That s what makes the song so interesting 
4148_134149_000068_000000	train-clean-360	 He must have had a very curious life said Sylvie 
4148_134149_000069_000000	train-clean-360	 You may say that the Professor heartily rejoined 
4148_134149_000070_000000	train-clean-360	 Of course she may cried Bruno 
4148_134149_000071_000000	train-clean-360	By this time we had come up to the Gardener who was standing on one leg as usual and busily employed in watering a bed of flowers with an empty watering can 
4148_134149_000072_000000	train-clean-360	 It hasn t got no water in it Bruno explained to him pulling his sleeve to attract his attention 
4148_134149_000073_000000	train-clean-360	 It s lighter to hold said the Gardener 
4148_134149_000073_000001	train-clean-360	 A lot of water in it makes one s arms ache And he went on with his work singing softly to himself 
none	none	The nights are very damp
4148_134149_000075_000000	train-clean-360	 In digging things out of the ground which you probably do now and then the Professor began in a loud voice in making things into heaps which no doubt you often do and in kicking things about with one heel which you seem never to leave off doing have you ever happened to notice another Professor something like me but different 
none	none	Never shouted the Gardener so loudly and violently that we all drew back in alarm
4148_134149_000076_000001	train-clean-360	 There ain t such a thing 
4148_134149_000077_000000	train-clean-360	 We will try a less exciting topic the Professor mildly remarked to the children 
4148_134149_000077_000001	train-clean-360	 You were asking 
4148_134149_000078_000000	train-clean-360	 We asked him to let us through the garden door said Sylvie but he wouldn t but perhaps he would for you 
4148_134149_000079_000000	train-clean-360	The Professor put the request very humbly and courteously 
4148_134149_000080_000000	train-clean-360	 I wouldn t mind letting you out said the Gardener 
none	none	But I mustn t open the door for children D you think I d disobey the Rules 
4148_134149_000080_000003	train-clean-360	Not for one and sixpence 
4148_134149_000081_000000	train-clean-360	The Professor cautiously produced a couple of shillings 
4148_134149_000082_000000	train-clean-360	 That ll do it the Gardener shouted as he hurled the watering can across the flower bed and produced a handful of keys one large one and a number of small ones 
4148_134149_000083_000000	train-clean-360	 But look here Professor dear whispered Sylvie 
4148_134149_000083_000001	train-clean-360	 He needn t open the door for us at all 
4148_134149_000083_000002	train-clean-360	We can go out with you 
4148_134149_000084_000000	train-clean-360	 True dear child the Professor thankfully replied as he replaced the coins in his pocket 
4148_134149_000084_000001	train-clean-360	 That saves two shillings And he took the children s hands that they might all go out together when the door was opened 
none	none	This however did not seem a very likely event though the Gardener patiently tried all the small keys over and over again At last the Professor ventured on a gentle suggestion
4148_134149_000085_000001	train-clean-360	 Why not try the large one 
none	none	I have often observed that a door unlocks much more nicely with its own key The very first trial of the large key proved a success the Gardener opened the door and held out his hand for the money The Professor shook his head You are acting by Rule he explained in opening the door for me 
4148_134149_000087_000002	train-clean-360	And now it s open we are going out by Rule the Rule of Three 
4148_134149_000088_000000	train-clean-360	The Gardener looked puzzled and let us go out but as he locked the door behind us we heard him singing thoughtfully to himself 
4148_134149_000089_000000	train-clean-360	 He thought he saw a Garden Door That opened with a key He looked again and found it was A Double Rule of Three And all its mystery he said Is clear as day to me 
4148_134149_000090_000000	train-clean-360	 I shall now return said the Professor when we had walked a few yards you see it s impossible to read here for all my books are in the house 
4148_134149_000091_000000	train-clean-360	But the children still kept fast hold of his hands 
4148_134149_000091_000001	train-clean-360	 Do come with us Sylvie entreated with tears in her eyes 
none	none	Well well said the good natured old man
4148_134149_000092_000001	train-clean-360	 Perhaps I ll come after you some day soon 
4148_134149_000092_000002	train-clean-360	But I must go back now 
4148_134149_000092_000003	train-clean-360	You see I left off at a comma and it s so awkward not knowing how the sentence finishes Besides you ve got to go through Dogland first and I m always a little nervous about dogs 
4148_134149_000092_000004	train-clean-360	But it ll be quite easy to come as soon as I ve completed my new invention for carrying one s self you know 
none	none	It wants just a little more working out Won t that be very tiring to carry yourself Sylvie enquired
4148_134149_000094_000000	train-clean-360	 Well no my child 
4148_134149_000094_000001	train-clean-360	You see whatever fatigue one incurs by carrying one saves by being carried 
none	none	Good bye dears 
4148_134149_000094_000003	train-clean-360	Good bye Sir he added to my intense surprise giving my hand an affectionate squeeze 
none	none	Good bye Professor I replied but my voice sounded strange and far away and the children took not the slightest notice of our farewell Evidently they neither saw me nor heard me as with their arms lovingly twined round each other they marched boldly on CHAPTER thirteen A VISIT TO DOGLAND There s a house away there to the left said Sylvie after we had walked what seemed to me about fifty miles Let s go and ask for a night s lodging It looks a very comfable house Bruno said as we turned into the road leading up to it I doos hope the Dogs will be kind to us I is so tired and hungry A Mastiff dressed in a scarlet collar and carrying a musket was pacing up and down like a sentinel in front of the entrance He started on catching sight of the children and came forwards to meet them keeping his musket pointed straight at Bruno who stood quite still though he turned pale and kept tight hold of Sylvie s hand while the Sentinel walked solemnly round and round them and looked at them from all points of view Oobooh hooh boohooyah He growled at last Woobah yahwah oobooh Bow wahbah woobooyah Bow wow he asked Bruno severely Of course Bruno understood all this easily enough All Fairies understand Doggee that is Dog language But as you may find it a little difficult just at first I had better put it into English for you Humans I verily believe A couple of stray Humans What Dog do you belong to What do you want We don t belong to a Dog Bruno began in Doggee Peoples never belongs to Dogs he whispered to Sylvie But Sylvie hastily checked him for fear of hurting the Mastiff s feelings Please we want a little food and a night s lodging if there s room in the house she added timidly Sylvie spoke Doggee very prettily but I think it s almost better for you to give the conversation in English The house indeed growled the Sentinel Have you never seen a Palace in your life Come along with me His Majesty must settle what s to be done with you They followed him through the entrance hall down a long passage and into a magnificent Saloon around which were grouped dogs of all sorts and sizes Two splendid Blood hounds were solemnly sitting up one on each side of the crown bearer Two or three Bull dogs whom I guessed to be the Body Guard of the King were waiting in grim silence in fact the only voices at all plainly audible were those of two little dogs who had mounted a settee and were holding a lively discussion that looked very like a quarrel Lords and Ladies in Waiting and various Court Officials our guide gruffly remarked as he led us in Of me the Courtiers took no notice whatever but Sylvie and Bruno were the subject of many inquisitive looks and many whispered remarks of which I only distinctly caught one made by a sly looking Dachshund to his friend Bah wooh wahyah hoobah Oobooh hah bah She s not such a bad looking Human is she Leaving the new arrivals in the centre of the Saloon the Sentinel advanced to a door at the further end of it which bore an inscription painted on it in Doggee Royal Kennel scratch and Yell Before doing this the Sentinel turned to the children and said Give me your names We d rather not Bruno exclaimed pulling Sylvie away from the door We want them ourselves Come back Sylvie Come quick Nonsense said Sylvie very decidedly and gave their names in Doggee Then the Sentinel scratched violently at the door and gave a yell that made Bruno shiver from head to foot Hooyah wah said a deep voice inside That s Doggee for Come in It s the King himself the Mastiff whispered in an awestruck tone Take off your wigs and lay them humbly at his paws What we should call at his feet Sylvie was just going to explain very politely that really they couldn t perform that ceremony because their wigs wouldn t come off when the door of the Royal Kennel opened and an enormous Newfoundland Dog put his head out Bow wow was his first question When His Majesty speaks to you the Sentinel hastily whispered to Bruno you should prick up your ears Bruno looked doubtfully at Sylvie I d rather not please he said It would hurt It doesn t hurt a bit the Sentinel said with some indignation Look It s like this And he pricked up his ears like two railway signals Sylvie gently explained matters I m afraid we ca n t manage it she said in a low voice I m very sorry but our ears haven t got the right she wanted to say machinery in Doggee but she had forgotten the word and could only think of steam engine The Sentinel repeated Sylvie s explanation to the King Can t prick up their ears without a steam engine His Majesty exclaimed They must be curious creatures I must have a look at them And he came out of his Kennel and walked solemnly up to the children What was the amazement nor to say the horror of the whole assembly when Sylvie actually patted His Majesty on the head while Bruno seized his long ears and pretended to tie them together under his chin The Sentinel groaned aloud a beautiful Greyhound who appeared to be one of the Ladies in Waiting fainted away and all the other Courtiers hastily drew back and left plenty of room for the huge Newfoundland to spring upon the audacious strangers and tear them limb from limb Only he didn t On the contrary his Majesty actually smiled so far as a Dog can smile and the other Dogs couldn t believe their eyes but it was true all the same his Majesty wagged his tail Yah Hooh hahwooh that is Well I never was the universal cry His Majesty looked round him severely and gave a slight growl which produced instant silence Conduct my friends to the banqueting hall he said laying such an emphasis on my friends that several of the dogs rolled over helplessly on their backs and began to lick Bruno s feet A procession was formed but I only ventured to follow as far as the door of the banqueting hall so furious was the uproar of barking dogs within So I sat down by the King who seemed to have gone to sleep and waited till the children returned to say good night when His Majesty got up and shook himself Time for bed he said with a sleepy yawn The attendants will show you your room he added aside to Sylvie and Bruno Bring lights And with a dignified air he held out his paw for them to kiss But the children were evidently not well practised in Court manners Sylvie simply stroked the great paw Bruno hugged it the Master of the Ceremonies looked shocked All this time Dog waiters in splendid livery were running up with lighted candles but as fast as they put them upon the table other waiters ran away with them so that there never seemed to be one for me though the Master kept nudging me with his elbow and repeating I ca n t let you sleep here You re not in bed you know I made a great effort and just succeeded in getting out the words I know I m not I m in an arm chair Well forty winks will do you no harm the Master said and left me I could scarcely hear his words and no wonder he was leaning over the side of a ship that was miles away from the pier on which I stood The ship passed over the horizon and I sank back into the arm chair The next thing I remember is that it was morning breakfast was just over Sylvie was lifting Bruno down from a high chair and saying to a Spaniel who was regarding them with a most benevolent smile Yes thank you we ve had a very nice breakfast Haven t we Bruno There was too many bones in the Bruno began but Sylvie frowned at him and laid her finger on her lips for at this moment the travelers were waited on by a very dignified officer the Head Growler whose duty it was first to conduct them to the King to bid him farewell and then to escort them to the boundary of Dogland The great Newfoundland received them most affably but instead of saying good bye he startled the Head growler into giving three savage growls by announcing that he would escort them himself It is a most unusual proceeding your Majesty the Head Growler exclaimed almost choking with vexation at being set aside for he had put on his best Court suit made entirely of cat skins for the occasion I shall escort them myself his Majesty repeated gently but firmly laying aside the Royal robes and changing his crown for a small coronet and you may stay at home I are glad Bruno whispered to Sylvie when they had got well out of hearing He were so welly cross And he not only patted their Royal escort but even hugged him round the neck in the exuberance of his delight His Majesty calmly wagged the Royal tail It s quite a relief he said getting away from that Palace now and then Royal Dogs have a dull life of it I can tell you Would you mind this to Sylvie in a low voice and looking a little shy and embarrassed would you mind the trouble of just throwing that stick for me to fetch Sylvie was too much astonished to do anything for a moment it sounded such a monstrous impossibility that a King should wish to run after a stick But Bruno was equal to the occasion and with a glad shout of Hi then Fetch it good Doggie he hurled it over a clump of bushes The next moment the Monarch of Dogland had bounded over the bushes and picked up the stick and came galloping back to the children with it in his mouth Bruno took it from him with great decision Beg for it he insisted and His Majesty begged Paw commanded Sylvie and His Majesty gave his paw In short the solemn ceremony of escorting the travelers to the boundaries of Dogland became one long uproarious game of play But business is business the Dog King said at last And I must go back to mine I couldn t come any further he added consulting a dog watch which hung on a chain round his neck not even if there were a Cat insight They took an affectionate farewell of His Majesty and trudged on That were a dear dog Bruno exclaimed Has we to go far Sylvie I s tired Not much further darling Sylvie gently replied Do you see that shining just beyond those trees I m almost sure it s the gate of Fairyland I know it s all golden Father told me so and so bright so bright she went on dreamily It dazzles said Bruno shading his eyes with one little hand while the other clung tightly to Sylvie s hand as if he were half alarmed at her strange manner For the child moved on as if walking in her sleep her large eyes gazing into the far distance and her breath coming and going in quick pantings of eager delight I knew by some mysterious mental light that a great change was taking place in my sweet little friend for such I loved to think her and that she was passing from the condition of a mere Outland Sprite into the true Fairy nature Upon Bruno the change came later but it was completed in both before they reached the golden gate through which I knew it would be impossible for me to follow I could but stand outside and take a last look at the two sweet children ere they disappeared within and the golden gate closed with a bang And with such a bang It never will shut like any other cupboard door Arthur explained There s something wrong with the hinge However here s the cake and wine And you ve had your forty winks So you really must get off to bed old man You re fit for nothing else Witness my hand Arthur Forester M D By this time I was wide awake again Not quite yet I pleaded Really I m not sleepy now And it isn t midnight yet Well I did want to say another word to you Arthur replied in a relenting tone as he supplied me with the supper he had prescribed Only I thought you were too sleepy for it to night We took our midnight meal almost in silence for an unusual nervousness seemed to have seized on my old friend What kind of a night is it he asked rising and undrawing the window curtains apparently to change the subject for a minute I followed him to the window and we stood together looking out in silence When I first spoke to you about Arthur began after a long and embarrassing silence that is when we first talked about her for I think it was you that introduced the subject my own position in life forbade me to do more than worship her from a distance and I was turning over plans for leaving this place finally and settling somewhere out of all chance of meeting her again That seemed to be my only chance of usefulness in life Would that have been wise I said To leave yourself no hope at all There was no hope to leave Arthur firmly replied though his eyes glittered with tears as he gazed upwards into the midnight sky from which one solitary star the glorious Vega blazed out in fitful splendour through the driving clouds She was like that star to me bright beautiful and pure but out of reach out of reach He drew the curtains again and we returned to our places by the fireside What I wanted to tell you was this he resumed I heard this evening from my solicitor I can t go into the details of the business but the upshot is that my worldly wealth is much more than I thought and I am or shall soon be in a position to offer marriage without imprudence to any lady even if she brought nothing I doubt if there would be anything on her side the Earl is poor I believe But I should have enough for both even if health failed I wish you all happiness in your married life I cried Shall you speak to the Earl to morrow Not yet awhile said Arthur He is very friendly but I dare not think he means more than that as yet And as for as for Lady Muriel try as I may I cannot read her feelings towards me If there is love she is hiding it No I must wait I must wait I did not like to press any further advice on my friend whose judgment I felt was so much more sober and thoughtful than my own and we parted without more words on the subject that had now absorbed his thoughts nay his very life The next morning a letter from my solicitor arrived summoning me to town on important business CHAPTER fourteen FAIRY SYLVIE For a full month the business for which I had returned to London detained me there and even then it was only the urgent advice of my physician that induced me to leave it unfinished and pay another visit to Elveston Arthur had written once or twice during the month but in none of his letters was there any mention of Lady Muriel Still I did not augur ill from his silence to me it looked like the natural action of a lover who even while his heart was singing She is mine would fear to paint his happiness in the cold phrases of a written letter but would wait to tell it by word of mouth Yes I thought I am to hear his song of triumph from his own lips The night I arrived we had much to say on other matters and tired with the journey I went to bed early leaving the happy secret still untold Next day however as we chatted on over the remains of luncheon I ventured to put the momentous question Well old friend you have told me nothing of Lady Muriel nor when the happy day is to be The happy day Arthur said looking unexpectedly grave is yet in the dim future We need to know or rather she needs to know me better I know her sweet nature thoroughly by this time But I dare not speak till I am sure that my love is returned Don t wait too long I said gaily Faint heart never won fair lady It is faint heart perhaps But really I dare not speak just yet But meanwhile I pleaded you are running a risk that perhaps you have not thought of Some other man No said Arthur firmly She is heart whole I am sure of that Yet if she loves another better than me so be it I will not spoil her happiness The secret shall die with me But she is my first and my only love That is all very beautiful sentiment I said but it is not practical It is not like you He either fears his fate too much Or his desert is small Who dares not put it to the touch To win or lose it all I dare not ask the question whether there is another he said passionately It would break my heart to know it Yet is it wise to leave it unasked You must not waste your life upon an if I tell you I dare not May I find it out for you I asked with the freedom of an old friend No no he replied with a pained look I entreat you to say nothing Let it wait As you please I said and judged it best to say no more just then But this evening I thought I will call on the Earl I may be able to see how the land lies without so much as saying a word It was a very hot afternoon too hot to go for a walk or do anything or else it wouldn t have happened I believe In the first place I want to know dear Child who reads this why Fairies should always be teaching us to do our duty and lecturing us when we go wrong and we should never teach them anything You can t mean to say that Fairies are never greedy or selfish or cross or deceitful because that would be nonsense you know Well then don t you think they might be all the better for a little lecturing and punishing now and then I really don t see why it shouldn t be tried and I m almost sure that if you could only catch a Fairy and put it in the corner and give it nothing but bread and water for a day or two you d find it quite an improved character it would take down its conceit a little at all events The next question is what is the best time for seeing Fairies I believe I can tell you all about that The first rule is that it must be a very hot day that we may consider as settled and you must be just a little sleepy but not too sleepy to keep your eyes open mind Well and you ought to feel a little what one may call fairyish the Scotch call it eerie and perhaps that s a prettier word if you don t know what it means I m afraid I can hardly explain it you must wait till you meet a Fairy and then you ll know And the last rule is that the crickets should not be chirping I can t stop to explain that you must take it on trust for the present So if all these things happen together you have a good chance of seeing a Fairy or at least a much better chance than if they didn t The first thing I noticed as I went lazily along through an open place in the wood was a large Beetle lying struggling on its back and I went down upon one knee to help the poor thing to its feet again In some things you know you ca n t be quite sure what an insect would like for instance I never could quite settle supposing I were a moth whether I would rather be kept out of the candle or be allowed to fly straight in and get burnt or again supposing I were a spider I m not sure if I should be quite pleased to have my web torn down and the fly let loose but I feel quite certain that if I were a beetle and had rolled over on my back I should always be glad to be helped up again So as I was saying I had gone down upon one knee and was just reaching out a little stick to turn the Beetle over when I saw a sight that made me draw back hastily and hold my breath for fear of making any noise and frightening the little creature a way Not that she looked as if she would be easily frightened she seemed so good and gentle that I m sure she would never expect that any one could wish to hurt her She was only a few inches high and was dressed in green so that you really would hardly have noticed her among the long grass and she was so delicate and graceful that she quite seemed to belong to the place almost as if she were one of the flowers I may tell you besides that she had no wings I don t believe in Fairies with wings and that she had quantities of long brown hair and large earnest brown eyes and then I shall have done all I can to give you an idea of her Sylvie I found out her name afterwards had knelt down just as I was doing to help the Beetle but it needed more than a little stick for her to get it on its legs again it was as much as she could do with both arms to roll the heavy thing over and all the while she was talking to it half scolding and half comforting as a nurse might do with a child that had fallen down There there You needn t cry so much about it You re not killed yet though if you were you couldn t cry you know and so it s a general rule against crying my dear And how did you come to tumble over But I can see well enough how it was I needn t ask you that walking over sand pits with your chin in the air as usual Of course if you go among sand pits like that you must expect to tumble You should look The Beetle murmured something that sounded like I did look and Sylvie went on again But I know you didn t You never do You always walk with your chin up you re so dreadfully conceited Well let s see how many legs are broken this time Why none of them I declare And what s the good of having six legs my dear if you can only kick them all about in the air when you tumble Legs are meant to walk with you know Now don t begin putting out your wings yet I ve more to say Go to the frog that lives behind that buttercup give him my compliments Sylvie s compliments can you say compliments The Beetle tried and I suppose succeeded Yes that s right And tell him he s to give you some of that salve I left with him yesterday And you d better get him to rub it in for you He s got rather cold hands but you mustn t mind that I think the Beetle must have shuddered at this idea for Sylvie went on in a graver tone Now you needn t pretend to be so particular as all that as if you were too grand to be rubbed by a frog The fact is you ought to be very much obliged to him Suppose you could get nobody but a toad to do it how would you like that There was a little pause and then Sylvie added Now you may go Be a good beetle and don t keep your chin in the air And then began one of those performances of humming and whizzing and restless banging about such as a beetle indulges in when it has decided on flying but hasn t quite made up its mind which way to go At last in one of its awkward zigzags it managed to fly right into my face and by the time I had recovered from the shock the little Fairy was gone I looked about in all directions for the little creature but there was no trace of her and my eerie feeling was quite gone off and the crickets were chirping again merrily so I knew she was really gone And now I ve got time to tell you the rule about the crickets They always leave off chirping when a Fairy goes by because a Fairy s a kind of queen over them I suppose at all events it s a much grander thing than a cricket so whenever you re walking out and the crickets suddenly leave off chirping you may be sure that they see a Fairy I walked on sadly enough you may be sure However I comforted myself with thinking It s been a very wonderful afternoon so far I ll just go quietly on and look about me and I shouldn t wonder if I were to come across another Fairy somewhere Peering about in this way I happened to notice a plant with rounded leaves and with queer little holes cut in the middle of several of them Ah the leafcutter bee I carelessly remarked you know I am very learned in Natural History for instance I can always tell kittens from chickens at one glance and I was passing on when a sudden thought made me stoop down and examine the leaves Then a little thrill of delight ran through me for I noticed that the holes were all arranged so as to form letters there were three leaves side by side with B R and U marked on them and after some search I found two more which contained an N and an O And then all in a moment a flash of inner light seemed to illumine a part of my life that had all but faded into oblivion the strange visions I had experienced during my journey to Elveston and with a thrill of delight I thought Those visions are destined to be linked with my waking life By this time the eerie feeling had come back again and I suddenly observed that no crickets were chirping so I felt quite sure that Bruno was somewhere very near And so indeed he was so near that I had very nearly walked over him without seeing him which would have been dreadful always supposing that Fairies can be walked over my own belief is that they are something of the nature of Will o the wisps and there s no walking over them Think of any pretty little boy you know with rosy cheeks large dark eyes and tangled brown hair and then fancy him made small enough to go comfortably into a coffee cup and you ll have a very fair idea of him What s your name little one I began in as soft a voice as I could manage And by the way why is it we always begin by asking little children their names Is it because we fancy a name will help to make them a little bigger You never thought of asking a real large man his name now did you But however that may be I felt it quite necessary to know his name so as he didn t answer my question I asked it again a little louder What s your name my little man What s oors he said without looking up I told him my name quite gently for he was much too small to be angry with Duke of Anything he asked just looking at me for a moment and then going on with his work Not Duke at all I said a little ashamed of having to confess it Oo re big enough to be two Dukes said the little creature I suppose oo re Sir Something then No I said feeling more and more ashamed I haven t got any title The Fairy seemed to think that in that case I really wasn t worth the trouble of talking to for he quietly went on digging and tearing the flowers to pieces After a few minutes I tried again Please tell me what your name is Bruno the little fellow answered very readily Why didn t oo say please before That s something like what we used to be taught in the nursery I thought to myself looking back through the long years about a hundred of them since you ask the question to the time when I was a little child And here an idea came into my head and I asked him Aren t you one of the Fairies that teach children to be good Well we have to do that sometimes said Bruno and a dreadful bother it is As he said this he savagely tore a heartsease in two and trampled on the pieces What are you doing there Bruno I said Spoiling Sylvie s garden was all the answer Bruno would give at first But as he went on tearing up the flowers he muttered to himself The nasty cross thing wouldn t let me go and play this morning said I must finish my lessons first lessons indeed I ll vex her finely though Oh Bruno you shouldn t do that I cried Don t you know that s revenge And revenge is a wicked cruel dangerous thing River edge said Bruno What a funny word I suppose oo call it cruel and dangerous cause if oo wented too far and tumbleded in oo d get drownded No not river edge I explained revenge saying the word very slowly But I couldn t help thinking that Bruno s explanation did very well for either word Oh said Bruno opening his eyes very wide but without trying to repeat the word Come Try and pronounce it Bruno I said cheerfully Re venge re venge But Bruno only tossed his little head and said he couldn t that his mouth wasn t the right shape for words of that kind And the more I laughed the more sulky the little fellow got about it Well never mind my little man I said Shall I help you with that job Yes please Bruno said quite pacified Only I wiss I could think of somefin to vex her more than this Oo don t know how hard it is to make her angry Now listen to me Bruno and I ll teach you quite a splendid kind of revenge Somefin that ll vex her finely he asked with gleaming eyes Something that will vex her finely First we ll get up all the weeds in her garden See there are a good many at this end quite hiding the flowers But that won t vex her said Bruno After that I said without noticing the remark we ll water this highest bed up here You see it s getting quite dry and dusty Bruno looked at me inquisitively but he said nothing this time Then after that I went on the walks want sweeping a bit and I think you might cut down that tall nettle it s so close to the garden that it s quite in the way What is oo talking about Bruno impatiently interrupted me All that won t vex her a bit Won t it I said innocently Then after that suppose we put in some of these coloured pebbles just to mark the divisions between the different kinds of flowers you know That ll have a very pretty effect Bruno turned round and had another good stare at me At last there came an odd little twinkle into his eyes and he said with quite a new meaning in his voice That ll do nicely Let s put em in rows all the red together and all the blue together That ll do capitally I said and then what kind of flowers does Sylvie like best Bruno had to put his thumb in his mouth and consider a little before he could answer Violets he said at last There s a beautiful bed of violets down by the brook Oh let s fetch em cried Bruno giving a little skip into the air Here Catch hold of my hand and I ll help oo along The grass is rather thick down that way I couldn t help laughing at his having so entirely forgotten what a big creature he was talking to No not yet Bruno I said we must consider what s the right thing to do first You see we ve got quite a business before us Yes let s consider said Bruno putting his thumb into his mouth again and sitting down upon a dead mouse What do you keep that mouse for I said You should either bury it or else throw it into the brook Why it s to measure with cried Bruno How ever would oo do a garden without one We make each bed three mouses and a half long and two mouses wide I stopped him as he was dragging it off by the tail to show me how it was used for I was half afraid the eerie feeling might go off before we had finished the garden and in that case I should see no more of him or Sylvie I think the best way will be for you to weed the beds while I sort out these pebbles ready to mark the walks with That s it cried Bruno And I ll tell oo about the caterpillars while we work Ah let s hear about the caterpillars I said as I drew the pebbles together into a heap and began dividing them into colours And Bruno went on in a low rapid tone more as if he were talking to himself Yesterday I saw two little caterpillars when I was sitting by the brook just where oo go into the wood They were quite green and they had yellow eyes and they didn t see me And one of them had got a moth s wing to carry a great brown moth s wing oo know all dry with feathers So he couldn t want it to eat I should think perhaps he meant to make a cloak for the winter Perhaps I said for Bruno had twisted up the last word into a sort of question and was looking at me for an answer One word was quite enough for the little fellow and he went on merrily Well and so he didn t want the other caterpillar to see the moth s wing oo know so what must he do but try to carry it with all his left legs and he tried to walk on the other set Of course he toppled over after that After what I said catching at the last word for to tell the truth I hadn t been attending much He toppled over Bruno repeated very gravely and if oo ever saw a caterpillar topple over oo d know it s a welly serious thing and not sit grinning like that and I sha n t tell oo no more Indeed and indeed Bruno I didn t mean to grin See I m quite grave again now But Bruno only folded his arms and said Don t tell me I see a little twinkle in one of oor eyes just like the moon Why do you think I m like the moon Bruno I asked Oor face is large and round like the moon Bruno answered looking at me thoughtfully It doosn t shine quite so bright but it s more cleaner I couldn t help smiling at this You know I sometimes wash my face Bruno The moon never does that Oh doosn t she though cried Bruno and he leant forwards and added in a solemn whisper The moon s face gets dirtier and dirtier every night till it s black all across And then when it s dirty all over so he passed his hand across his own rosy cheeks as he spoke then she washes it Then it s all clean again isn t it Not all in a moment said Bruno What a deal of teaching oo wants She washes it little by little only she begins at the other edge oo know By this time he was sitting quietly on the dead mouse with his arms folded and the weeding wasn t getting on a bit so I had to say Work first pleasure afterwards no more talking till that bed s finished CHAPTER fifteen BRUNO S REVENGE After that we had a few minutes of silence while I sorted out the pebbles and amused myself with watching Bruno s plan of gardening It was quite a new plan to me he always measured each bed before he weeded it as if he was afraid the weeding would make it shrink and once when it came out longer than he wished he set to work to thump the mouse with his little fist crying out There now It s all gone wrong again Why don t oo keep oor tail straight when I tell oo I ll tell you what I ll do Bruno said in a half whisper as we worked Oo like Fairies don t oo Yes I said of course I do or I shouldn t have come here I should have gone to some place where there are no Fairies Bruno laughed contemptuously Why oo might as well say oo d go to some place where there wasn t any air supposing oo didn t like air This was a rather difficult idea to grasp I tried a change of subject You re nearly the first Fairy I ever saw Have you ever seen any people besides me Plenty said Bruno We see em when we walk in the road But they ca n t see you How is it they never tread on you Ca n t tread on us said Bruno looking amused at my ignorance Why suppose oo re walking here so making little marks on the ground and suppose there s a Fairy that s me walking here Very well then oo put one foot here and one foot here so oo doosn t tread on the Fairy This was all very well as an explanation but it didn t convince me Why shouldn t I put one foot on the Fairy I asked I don t know why the little fellow said in a thoughtful tone But I know oo wouldn t Nobody never walked on the top of a Fairy Now I ll tell oo what I ll do as oo re so fond of Fairies I ll get oo an invitation to the Fairy King s dinner party I know one of the head waiters I couldn t help laughing at this idea Do the waiters invite the guests I asked Oh not to sit down Bruno said But to wait at table Oo d like that wouldn t oo To hand about plates and so on Well but that s not so nice as sitting at the table is it Of course it isn t Bruno said in a tone as if he rather pitied my ignorance but if oo re not even Sir Anything oo ca n t expect to be allowed to sit at the table oo know I said as meekly as I could that I didn t expect it but it was the only way of going to a dinner party that I really enjoyed And Bruno tossed his head and said in a rather offended tone that I might do as I pleased there were many he knew that would give their ears to go Have you ever been yourself Bruno They invited me once last week Bruno said very gravely It was to wash up the soup plates no the cheese plates I mean that was grand enough And I waited at table And I didn t hardly make only one mistake What was it I said You needn t mind telling me Only bringing scissors to cut the beef with Bruno said carelessly But the grandest thing of all was I fetched the King a glass of cider That was grand I said biting my lip to keep myself from laughing Wasn t it said Bruno very earnestly Oo know it isn t every one that s had such an honour as that This set me thinking of the various queer things we call an honour in this world but which after all haven t a bit more honour in them than what Bruno enjoyed when he took the King a glass of cider I don t know how long I might not have dreamed on in this way if Bruno hadn t suddenly roused me Oh come here quick he cried in a state of the wildest excitement Catch hold of his other horn I ca n t hold him more than a minute He was struggling desperately with a great snail clinging to one of its horns and nearly breaking his poor little back in his efforts to drag it over a blade of grass I saw we should have no more gardening if I let this sort of thing go on so I quietly took the snail away and put it on a bank where he couldn t reach it We ll hunt it afterwards Bruno I said if you really want to catch it But what s the use of it when you ve got it What s the use of a fox when oo ve got it said Bruno I know oo big things hunt foxes I tried to think of some good reason why big things should hunt foxes and he should not hunt snails but none came into my head so I said at last Well I suppose one s as good as the other I ll go snail hunting myself some day I should think oo wouldn t be so silly said Bruno as to go snail hunting by oor self Why oo d never get the snail along if oo hadn t somebody to hold on to his other horn Of course I sha n t go alone I said quite gravely By the way is that the best kind to hunt or do you recommend the ones without shells Oh no we never hunt the ones without shells Bruno said with a little shudder at the thought of it They re always so cross about it and then if oo tumbles over them they re ever so sticky By this time we had nearly finished the garden I had fetched some violets and Bruno was just helping me to put in the last when he suddenly stopped and said I m tired Rest then I said I can go on without you quite well Bruno needed no second invitation he at once began arranging the dead mouse as a kind of sofa And I ll sing oo a little song he said as he rolled it about Do said I I like songs very much Which song will oo choose Bruno said as he dragged the mouse into a place where he could get a good view of me Ting ting ting is the nicest There was no resisting such a strong hint as this however I pretended to think about it for a moment and then said Well I like Ting ting ting best of all That shows oo re a good judge of music Bruno said with a pleased look How many hare bells would oo like And he put his thumb into his mouth to help me to consider As there was only one cluster of hare bells within easy reach I said very gravely that I thought one would do this time and I picked it and gave it to him Bruno ran his hand once or twice up and down the flowers like a musician trying an instrument producing a most delicious delicate tinkling as he did so I had never heard flower music before I don t think one can unless one s in the eerie state and I don t know quite how to give you an idea of what it was like except by saying that it sounded like a peal of bells a thousand miles off When he had satisfied himself that the flowers were in tune he seated himself on the dead mouse he never seemed really comfortable anywhere else and looking up at me with a merry twinkle in his eyes he began By the way the tune was rather a curious one and you might like to try it for yourself so here are the notes Rise oh rise The daylight dies The owls are hooting ting ting ting Wake oh wake Beside the lake The elves are fluting ting ting ting Welcoming our Fairy King We sing sing sing He sang the first four lines briskly and merrily making the hare bells chime in time with the music but the last two he sang quite slowly and gently and merely waved the flowers backwards and forwards Then he left off to explain The Fairy King is Oberon and he lives across the lake and sometimes he comes in a little boat and we go and meet him and then we sing this song you know And then you go and dine with him I said mischievously Oo shouldn t talk Bruno hastily said it interrupts the song so I said I wouldn t do it again I never talk myself when I m singing he went on very gravely so oo shouldn t either Then he tuned the hare bells once more and sang Hear oh hear From far and near The music stealing ting ting ting Fairy belts adown the dells Are merrily pealing ting ting ting Welcoming our Fairy King We ring ring ring See oh see On every tree What lamps are shining ting ting ting They are eyes of fiery flies To light our dining ting ting ting Welcoming our Fairy King They swing swing swing Haste oh haste to take and taste The dainties waiting ting ting ting Honey dew is stored Hush Bruno I interrupted in a warning whisper She s coming Bruno checked his song and as she slowly made her way through the long grass he suddenly rushed out headlong at her like a little bull shouting Look the other way Look the other way Which way Sylvie asked in rather a frightened tone as she looked round in all directions to see where the danger could be That way said Bruno carefully turning her round with her face to the wood Now walk backwards walk gently don t be frightened oo sha n t trip But Sylvie did trip notwithstanding in fact he led her in his hurry across so many little sticks and stones that it was really a wonder the poor child could keep on her feet at all But he was far too much excited to think of what he was doing I silently pointed out to Bruno the best place to lead her to so as to get a view of the whole garden at once it was a little rising ground about the height of a potato and when they had mounted it I drew back into the shade that Sylvie mightn t see me I heard Bruno cry out triumphantly Now oo may look and then followed a clapping of hands but it was all done by Bruno himself Sylvie was silent she only stood and gazed with her hands clasped together and I was half afraid she didn t like it after all Bruno too was watching her anxiously and when she jumped down off the mound and began wandering up and down the little walks he cautiously followed her about evidently anxious that she should form her own opinion of it all without any hint from him And when at last she drew a long breath and gave her verdict in a hurried whisper and without the slightest regard to grammar It s the loveliest thing as I never saw in all my life before the little fellow looked as well pleased as if it had been given by all the judges and juries in England put together And did you really do it all by yourself Bruno said Sylvie And all for me I was helped a bit Bruno began with a merry little laugh at her surprise We ve been at it all the afternoon I thought oo d like and here the poor little fellow s lip began to quiver and all in a moment he burst out crying and running up to Sylvie he flung his arms passionately round her neck and hid his face on her shoulder There was a little quiver in Sylvie s voice too as she whispered Why what s the matter darling and tried to lift up his head and kiss him But Bruno only clung to her sobbing and wouldn t be comforted till he had confessed I tried to spoil oor garden first but I ll never never and then came another burst of tears which drowned the rest of the sentence At last he got out the words I liked putting in the flowers for oo Sylvie and I never was so happy before And the rosy little face came up at last to be kissed all wet with tears as it was Sylvie was crying too by this time and she said nothing but Bruno dear and I never was so happy before though why these two children who had never been so happy before should both be crying was a mystery to me I felt very happy too but of course I didn t cry big things never do you know we leave all that to the Fairies Only I think it must have been raining a little just then for I found a drop or two on my cheeks After that they went through the whole garden again flower by flower as if it were a long sentence they were spelling out with kisses for commas and a great hug by way of a full stop when they got to the end Doos oo know that was my river edge Sylvie Bruno solemnly began Sylvie laughed merrily What do you mean she said And she pushed back her heavy brown hair with both hands and looked at him with dancing eyes in which the big teardrops were still glittering Bruno drew in a long breath and made up his mouth for a great effort I mean revenge he said now oo under tand And he looked so happy and proud at having said the word right at last that I quite envied him I rather think Sylvie didn t under tand at all but she gave him a little kiss on each cheek which seemed to do just as well So they wandered off lovingly together in among the buttercups each with an arm twined round the other whispering and laughing as they went and never so much as once looked back at poor me Yes once just before I quite lost sight of them Bruno half turned his head and nodded me a saucy little good bye over one shoulder And that was all the thanks I got for my trouble The very last thing I saw of them was this Sylvie was stooping down with her arms round Bruno s neck and saying coaxingly in his ear Do you know Bruno I ve quite forgotten that hard word Do say it once more Come Only this once dear But Bruno wouldn t try it again CHAPTER sixteen A CHANGED CROCODILE The Marvellous the Mysterious had quite passed out of my life for the moment and the Common place reigned supreme I turned in the direction of the Earl s house as it was now the witching hour of five and I knew I should find them ready for a cup of tea and a quiet chat 
3819-134153-0000	train-other-500	Lady Muriel and her father gave me a delightfully warm welcome They were not of the folk we meet in fashionable drawing rooms who conceal all such feelings as they may chance to possess beneath
3819-134153-0001	train-other-500	the impenetrable mask of a conventional placidity
none	none	 The Man with the Iron Mask was no doubt a rarity and a marvel in his own age in modern London no one would turn his head to give him a second look No these were real people 
3819-134153-0002	train-other-500	When they looked pleased it meant that they were pleased and when Lady Muriel said with a bright smile I m very glad to see you again I knew that it was true
3819-134153-0003	train-other-500	Still I did not venture to disobey the injunctions crazy as I felt them to be of the lovesick young Doctor by so much as alluding to his existence
3819-134153-0004	train-other-500	and it was only after they had given me full details of a projected picnic to which they invited me that Lady Muriel exclaimed almost as an after thought
none	none	 and do if you can 
3819-134153-0005	train-other-500	bring Doctor Forester with you I m sure a day in the country would do him good I m afraid he studies too much
none	none	 It was on the tip of my tongue to quote the words 
3819-134153-0006	train-other-500	His only books are woman s looks but I checked myself just in time
none	none	 with something of the feeling of one who has crossed a street 
3819-134153-0007	train-other-500	and has been all but run over by a passing Hansom and I think he has too lonely a life she went on with a gentle earnestness that left no room whatever to suspect a double meaning
3819-134153-0008	train-other-500	Do get him to come And don t forget the day Tuesday week We can drive you over It would be a pity to go by rail there is so much pretty scenery on the road
3819-134153-0009	train-other-500	And our open carriage just holds four Oh I ll persuade him to come I said with confidence thinking it would take all my powers of persuasion to keep him away The picnic
3819-134153-0010	train-other-500	was to take place in ten days
none	none	 and though Arthur readily accepted the invitation I brought him 
3819-134153-0011	train-other-500	nothing that I could say would induce him to call either with me or without me on the Earl and his daughter in the meanwhile No he feared to wear out his welcome he said
3819-134153-0012	train-other-500	they had seen enough of him for one while and when at last the day for the expedition arrived he was so childishly nervous and uneasy that I thought it best so to arrange our plans
3819-134153-0013	train-other-500	that we should go separately to the house my intention being to arrive some time after him so as to give him time to get over a meeting With this object
3819-134153-0014	train-other-500	I purposely made a considerable circuit on my way to the Hall as we called the Earl s house and if I could only manage to lose my way a bit I thought to myself that would suit me capitally
3819-134153-0015	train-other-500	In this I succeeded better and sooner than I had ventured to hope for The path through the wood had been made familiar to me by many a solitary stroll in my former visit to Elveston
3819-134153-0016	train-other-500	and how I could have so suddenly and so entirely lost it even though I was so engrossed in thinking of Arthur and his lady love that I heeded little else was a mystery to me
3819-134153-0017	train-other-500	And this open place I said to myself seems to have some memory about it I cannot distinctly recall surely it is the very spot where I saw those Fairy Children
3819-134153-0018	train-other-500	But I hope there are no snakes about I mused aloud taking my seat on a fallen tree I certainly do not like snakes and I don t suppose Bruno likes them either
3819-134153-0019	train-other-500	No he doesn t like them said a demure little voice at my side He s not afraid of them you know But he doesn t like them He says they re too waggly
3819-134153-0020	train-other-500	Words fail me to describe the beauty of the little group couched on a patch of moss on the trunk of the fallen tree
none	none	 that met my eager gaze Sylvie reclining with her elbow buried in the moss and her rosy cheek resting in the palm of her hand and Bruno stretched at her feet with his head in her lap Too waggly was all I could say in so sudden an emergency I m not praticular Bruno said carelessly but I do like straight animals best 
3819-134153-0021	train-other-500	But you like a dog when it wags its tail Sylvie interrupted
none	none	 You know you do Bruno But there s more of a dog isn t there Mister Sir 
3819-134153-0022	train-other-500	Bruno appealed to me You wouldn t like to have a dog if it hadn t got nuffin but a head and a tail I admitted that a dog of that kind would be uninteresting
3819-134153-0023	train-other-500	There isn t such a dog as that Sylvie thoughtfully remarked But there would be cried Bruno if the Professor shortened it up for us
3819-134153-0024	train-other-500	Shortened it up I said
none	none	 That s something new How does he do it 
3819-134153-0025	train-other-500	He s got a curious machine Sylvie was beginning to explain A welly curious machine Bruno broke in not at all willing to have the story thus taken out of his mouth
none	none	 and if oo puts in some finoruvver at one end oo know and he turns the handle and it comes out at the uvver end oh ever so short As short as short 
3819-134153-0026	train-other-500	Sylvie echoed And one day when we was in Outland oo know before we came to Fairyland
none	none	 me and Sylvie took him a big Crocodile And he shortened it up for us And it did look so funny And it kept looking round and saying wherever is the rest of me got to 
3819-134153-0027	train-other-500	And then its eyes looked unhappy Not both its eyes Sylvie interrupted Course not said the little fellow
none	none	 Only the eye that couldn t see wherever the rest of it had got to But the eye that could see wherever How short was the crocodile 
3819-134153-0028	train-other-500	I asked as the story was getting a little complicated Half as short again as when we caught it so long said Bruno spreading out his arms to their full stretch
3819-134153-0029	train-other-500	I tried to calculate what this would come to but it was too hard for me Please make it out for me dear Child who reads this
none	none	 But you didn t leave the poor thing so short as that did you Well no 
3819-134153-0030	train-other-500	Sylvie and me took it back again and we got it stretched to to how much was it Sylvie Two times and a half and a little bit more said Sylvie
none	none	 It wouldn t like that better than the other way I m afraid Oh but it did though Bruno put in eagerly It were proud of its new tail Oo never saw a Crocodile so proud Why it could go round and walk on the top of its tail and along its back all the way to its head Not quite all the way said Sylvie It couldn t you know Ah but it did once Bruno cried triumphantly Oo weren t looking but I watched it And it walked on tippiety toe so as it wouldn t wake itself cause it thought it were asleep And it got both its paws on its tail And it walked and it walked all the way along its back And it walked and it walked on its forehead And it walked a tiny little way down its nose There now This was a good deal worse than the last puzzle Please dear Child help again 
3819-134153-0031	train-other-500	I don t believe no Crocodile never walked along its own forehead Sylvie cried
none	none	 too much excited by the controversy to limit the number of her negatives Oo don t know the reason why it did it 
3819-134153-0032	train-other-500	Bruno scornfully retorted It had a welly good reason I heerd it say Why shouldn t I walk on my own
none	none	 forehead 
3819-134153-0033	train-other-500	So a course it did oo know If that s a good reason Bruno I said
none	none	 why shouldn t you get up that tree Shall in a minute 
3819-134153-0034	train-other-500	said Bruno soon as we ve done talking
none	none	 Only two peoples ca n t talk comfably togevver when one s getting up a tree and the other isn t 
3819-134153-0035	train-other-500	It appeared to me that a conversation would scarcely be comfable while trees were being climbed even if both the peoples were doing it
3819-134153-0036	train-other-500	but it was evidently dangerous to oppose any theory of Bruno s so I thought it best to let the question drop and to ask for an account of the machine that made things longer This time
3819-134153-0037	train-other-500	Bruno was at a loss and left it to Sylvie It s like a mangle she said if things are put in
none	none	 they get squoze Squeezeled Bruno interrupted Yes 
3819-134153-0038	train-other-500	Sylvie accepted the correction but did not attempt to pronounce the word which was evidently new to her
none	none	 They get 
3819-134153-0039	train-other-500	like that and they come out oh ever so long Once Bruno began again Sylvie and me writed
none	none	 Wrote 
3819-134153-0040	train-other-500	Sylvie whispered Well we wroted a Nursery Song and the Professor mangled it longer for us It were There was a little Man And he had a little gun
3819-134153-0041	train-other-500	And the bullets I know the rest I interrupted But would you say it long I mean the way that it came out of the mangle We ll get the Professor to sing it for you said Sylvie
3819-134153-0042	train-other-500	It would spoil it to say it I would like to meet the Professor I said
none	none	 And I would like to take you all with me to see some friends of mine that live near here Would you like to come 
3819-134153-0043	train-other-500	I don t think the Professor would like to come said Sylvie He s very shy But we d like it very much Only we d better not come this size you know
3819-134153-0044	train-other-500	The difficulty had occurred to me already and I had felt that
none	none	 perhaps there would be a slight awkwardness in introducing two such tiny friends into Society 
3819-134153-0045	train-other-500	What size will you be I enquired
none	none	 We d better come as 
3819-134153-0046	train-other-500	common children Sylvie thoughtfully replied That s the easiest size to manage Could you come to day I said thinking then we could have you at the picnic
3819-134153-0047	train-other-500	Sylvie considered a little Not to day she replied We haven t got the things ready We ll come on Tuesday next if you like
3819-134153-0048	train-other-500	And now really Bruno you must come and do your lessons
none	none	 I wiss oo wouldn t say really Bruno the little fellow pleaded with pouting lips that made him look prettier than ever It always show s there s something horrid coming And I won t kiss you if you re so unkind Ah but you have kissed me Sylvie exclaimed in merry triumph Well then I ll unkiss you 
3819-134153-0049	train-other-500	And he threw his arms round her neck for this novel but apparently not very painful operation It s very like kissing Sylvie remarked
none	none	 as soon as her lips were again free for speech Oo don t know nuffin about it It were just the conkery 
3819-134153-0050	train-other-500	Bruno replied with much severity as he marched away Sylvie turned her laughing face to me Shall we come on Tuesday she said Very well I said let it be Tuesday next
none	none	 But where is the Professor Did he come with you to Fairyland No said Sylvie But he promised he d come and see us some day He s getting his Lecture ready So he has to stay at home At home I said dreamily not feeling quite sure what she had said Yes Sir His Lordship and Lady Muriel are at home Please to walk this way CHAPTER seventeen THE THREE BADGERS Still more dreamily I found myself following this imperious voice into a room where the Earl his daughter and Arthur were seated So you re come at last said Lady Muriel in a tone of playful reproach I was delayed I stammered Though what it was that had delayed me I should have been puzzled to explain Luckily no questions were asked The carriage was ordered round the hamper containing our contribution to the Picnic was duly stowed away and we set forth There was no need for me to maintain the conversation Lady Muriel and Arthur were evidently on those most delightful of terms where one has no need to check thought after thought as it rises to the lips with the fear this will not be appreciated this will give offence this will sound too serious this will sound flippant like very old friends in fullest sympathy their talk rippled on Why shouldn t we desert the Picnic and go in some other direction she suddenly suggested A party of four is surely self sufficing And as for food our hamper Why shouldn t we What a genuine lady s argument laughed Arthur A lady never knows on which side the onus probandi the burden of proving lies Do men always know she asked with a pretty assumption of meek docility With one exception the only one I can think of doctor Watts who has asked the senseless question Why should I deprive my neighbour Of his goods against his will Fancy that as an argument for Honesty His position seems to be I m only honest because I see no reason to steal And the thief s answer is of course complete and crushing I deprive my neighbour of his goods because I want them myself And I do it against his will because there s no chance of getting him to consent to it I can give you one other exception I said an argument I heard only to day and not by a lady Why shouldn t I walk on my own forehead What a curious subject for speculation said Lady Muriel turning to me with eyes brimming over with laughter May we know who propounded the question And did he walk on his own forehead I ca n t remember who it was that said it I faltered Nor where I heard it Whoever it was I hope we shall meet him at the Picnic said Lady Muriel It s a far more interesting question than Isn t this a picturesque ruin Aren t those autumn tints lovely I shall have to answer those two questions ten times at least this afternoon That s one of the miseries of Society said Arthur Why ca n t people let one enjoy the beauties of Nature without having to say so every minute Why should Life be one long Catechism It s just as bad at a picture gallery the Earl remarked I went to the R A last May with a conceited young artist and he did torment me I wouldn t have minded his criticizing the pictures himself but I had to agree with him or else to argue the point which would have been worse It was depreciatory criticism of course said Arthur I don t see the of course at all Why did you ever know a conceited man dare to praise a picture The one thing he dreads next to not being noticed is to be proved fallible If you once praise a picture your character for infallibility hangs by a thread Suppose it s a figure picture and you venture to say draws well Somebody measures it and finds one of the proportions an eighth of an inch wrong You are disposed of as a critic Did you say he draws well your friends enquire sarcastically while you hang your head and blush No The only safe course if any one says draws well is to shrug your shoulders Draws well you repeat thoughtfully Draws well Humph That s the way to become a great critic Thus airily chatting after a pleasant drive through a few miles of beautiful scenery we reached the rendezvous a ruined castle where the rest of the picnic party were already assembled We spent an hour or two in sauntering about the ruins gathering at last by common consent into a few random groups seated on the side of a mound which commanded a good view of the old castle and its surroundings The momentary silence that ensued was promptly taken possession of or more correctly taken into custody by a Voice a voice so smooth so monotonous so sonorous that one felt with a shudder that any other conversation was precluded and that unless some desperate remedy were adopted we were fated to listen to a Lecture of which no man could foresee the end The speaker was a broadly built man whose large flat pale face was bounded on the North by a fringe of hair on the East and West by a fringe of whisker and on the South by a fringe of beard the whole constituting a uniform halo of stubbly whitey brown bristles His features were so entirely destitute of expression that I could not help saying to myself helplessly as if in the clutches of a night mare they are only penciled in no final touches as yet And he had a way of ending every sentence with a sudden smile which spread like a ripple over that vast blank surface and was gone in a moment leaving behind it such absolute solemnity that I felt impelled to murmur it was not he it was somebody else that smiled Do you observe such was the phrase with which the wretch began each sentence Do you observe the way in which that broken arch at the very top of the ruin stands out against the clear sky It is placed exactly right and there is exactly enough of it A little more or a little less and all would be utterly spoiled Oh gifted architect murmured Arthur inaudibly to all but Lady Muriel and myself Foreseeing the exact effect his work would have when in ruins centuries after his death And do you observe where those trees slope down the hill indicating them with a sweep of the hand and with all the patronising air of the man who has himself arranged the landscape how the mists rising from the river fill up exactly those intervals where we need indistinctness for artistic effect Here in the foreground a few clear touches are not amiss but a back ground without mist you know It is simply barbarous Yes we need indistinctness The orator looked so pointedly at me as he uttered these words that I felt bound to reply by murmuring something to the effect that I hardly felt the need myself and that I enjoyed looking at a thing better when I could see it Quite so the great man sharply took me up From your point of view that is correctly put But for anyone who has a soul for Art such a view is preposterous Nature is one thing Art is another Nature shows us the world as it is But Art as a Latin author tells us Art you know the words have escaped my memory Ars est celare Naturam Arthur interposed with a delightful promptitude Quite so the orator replied with an air of relief I thank you Ars est celare Naturam but that isn t it And for a few peaceful moments the orator brooded frowningly over the quotation The welcome opportunity was seized and another voice struck into the silence What a lovely old ruin it is cried a young lady in spectacles the very embodiment of the March of Mind looking at Lady Muriel as the proper recipient of all really original remarks And don t you admire those autumn tints on the trees I do intensely Lady Muriel shot a meaning glance at me but replied with admirable gravity Oh yes indeed indeed So true And isn t strange said the young lady passing with startling suddenness from Sentiment to Science that the mere impact of certain coloured rays upon the Retina should give us such exquisite pleasure You have studied Physiology then a certain young Doctor courteously enquired Oh yes Isn t it a sweet Science Arthur slightly smiled It seems a paradox does it not he went on that the image formed on the Retina should be inverted It is puzzling she candidly admitted Why is it we do not see things upside down You have never heard the Theory then that the Brain also is inverted No indeed What a beautiful fact But how is it proved Thus replied Arthur with all the gravity of ten Professors rolled into one What we call the vertex of the Brain is really its base and what we call its base is really its vertex it is simply a question of nomenclature This last polysyllable settled the matter How truly delightful the fair Scientist exclaimed with enthusiasm I shall ask our Physiological Lecturer why he never gave us that exquisite Theory I d give something to be present when the question is asked Arthur whispered to me as at a signal from Lady Muriel we moved on to where the hampers had been collected and devoted ourselves to the more substantial business of the day We waited on ourselves as the modern barbarism combining two good things in such a way as to secure the discomforts of both and the advantages of neither of having a picnic with servants to wait upon you had not yet reached this out of the way region and of course the gentlemen did not even take their places until the ladies had been duly provided with all imaginable creature comforts Then I supplied myself with a plate of something solid and a glass of something fluid and found a place next to Lady Muriel It had been left vacant apparently for Arthur as a distinguished stranger but he had turned shy and had placed himself next to the young lady in spectacles whose high rasping voice had already cast loose upon Society such ominous phrases as Man is a bundle of Qualities the Objective is only attainable through the Subjective Arthur was bearing it bravely but several faces wore a look of alarm and I thought it high time to start some less metaphysical topic In my nursery days I began when the weather didn t suit for an out of doors picnic we were allowed to have a peculiar kind that we enjoyed hugely The table cloth was laid under the table instead of upon it we sat round it on the floor and I believe we really enjoyed that extremely uncomfortable kind of dinner more than we ever did the orthodox arrangement I ve no doubt of it Lady Muriel replied There s nothing a well regulated child hates so much as regularity I believe a really healthy boy would thoroughly enjoy Greek Grammar if only he might stand on his head to learn it And your carpet dinner certainly spared you one feature of a picnic which is to me its chief drawback The chance of a shower I suggested No the chance or rather the certainty of live things occurring in combination with one s food Spiders are my bugbear Now my father has no sympathy with that sentiment have you dear For the Earl had caught the word and turned to listen To each his sufferings all are men he replied in the sweet sad tones that seemed natural to him each has his pet aversion But you ll never guess his Lady Muriel said with that delicate silvery laugh that was music to my ears I declined to attempt the impossible He doesn t like snakes she said in a stage whisper Now isn t that an unreasonable aversion Fancy not liking such a dear coaxingly clingingly affectionate creature as a snake Not like snakes I exclaimed Is such a thing possible No he doesn t like them she repeated with a pretty mock gravity He s not afraid of them you know But he doesn t like them He says they re too waggly I was more startled than I liked to show There was something so uncanny in this echo of the very words I had so lately heard from that little forest sprite that it was only by a great effort I succeeded in saying carelessly Let us banish so unpleasant a topic Won t you sing us something Lady Muriel I know you do sing without music The only songs I know without music are desperately sentimental I m afraid Are your tears all ready Quite ready Quite ready came from all sides and Lady Muriel not being one of those lady singers who think it de rigueur to decline to sing till they have been petitioned three or four times and have pleaded failure of memory loss of voice and other conclusive reasons for silence began at once There be three Badgers on a mossy stone Beside a dark and covered way Each dreams himself a monarch on his throne And so they stay and stay Though their old Father languishes alone They stay and stay and stay There be three Herrings loitering around Longing to share that mossy seat Each Herring tries to sing what she has found That makes Life seem so sweet Thus with a grating and uncertain sound They bleat and bleat and bleat The Mother Herring on the salt sea wave Sought vainly for her absent ones The Father Badger writhing in a cave Shrieked out Return my sons You shalt have buns he shrieked if you ll behave Yea buns and buns and buns I fear said she your sons have gone astray My daughters left me while I slept Yes m the Badger said it s as you say They should be better kept Thus the poor parents talked the time away And wept and wept and wept Here Bruno broke off suddenly The Herrings Song wants anuvver tune Sylvie he said And I ca n t sing it not wizout oo plays it for me Instantly Sylvie seated herself upon a tiny mushroom that happened to grow in front of a daisy as if it were the most ordinary musical instrument in the world and played on the petals as if they were the notes of an organ And such delicious tiny music it was Such teeny tiny music Bruno held his head on one side and listened very gravely for a few moments until he had caught the melody Then the sweet childish voice rang out once more Oh dear beyond our dearest dreams Fairer than all that fairest seems To feast the rosy hours away To revel in a roundelay How blest would be A life so free Ipwergis Pudding to consume And drink the subtle Azzigoom And if in other days and hours Mid other fluffs and other flowers The choice were given me how to dine Name what thou wilt it shalt be thine Oh then I see The life for me Ipwergis Pudding to consume And drink the subtle Azzigoom Oo may leave off playing now Sylvie I can do the uvver tune much better wizout a compliment He means without accompaniment Sylvie whispered smiling at my puzzled look and she pretended to shut up the stops of the organ The Badgers did not care to talk to Fish They did not dote on Herrings songs They never had experienced the dish To which that name belongs And oh to pinch their tails this was their wish With tongs yea tongs and tongs I ought to mention that he marked the parenthesis in the air with his finger It seemed to me a very good plan You know there s no sound to represent it any more than there is for a question Suppose you have said to your friend You are better to day and that you want him to understand that you are asking him a question what can be simpler than just to make a in the air with your finger He would understand you in a moment And are not these the Fish the Eldest sighed Whose Mother dwells beneath the foam They are the Fish the Second one replied And they have left their home Oh wicked Fish the Youngest Badger cried To roam yea roam and roam Gently the Badgers trotted to the shore The sandy shore that fringed the bay Each in his mouth a living Herring bore Those aged ones waxed gay Clear rang their voices through the ocean s roar Hooray hooray hooray So they all got safe home again Bruno said after waiting a minute to see if I had anything to say he evidently felt that some remark ought to be made And I couldn t help wishing there were some such rule in Society at the conclusion of a song that the singer herself should say the right thing and not leave it to the audience Suppose a young lady has just been warbling with a grating and uncertain sound Shelley s exquisite lyric I arise from dreams of thee how much nicer it would be instead of your having to say Oh thank you thank you for the young lady herself to remark as she draws on her gloves while the impassioned words Oh press it to thine own or it will break at last are still ringing in your ears but she wouldn t do it you know So it did break at last And I knew it would she added quietly as I started at the sudden crash of broken glass You ve been holding it sideways for the last minute and letting all the champagne run out Were you asleep I wonder I m so sorry my singing has such a narcotic effect CHAPTER eighteen QUEER STREET NUMBER FORTY Lady Muriel was the speaker And for the moment that was the only fact I could clearly realise But how she came to be there and how I came to be there and how the glass of champagne came to be there all these were questions which I felt it better to think out in silence and not commit myself to any statement till I understood things a little more clearly First accumulate a mass of Facts and then construct a Theory That I believe is the true Scientific Method I sat up rubbed my eyes and began to accumulate Facts A smooth grassy slope bounded at the upper end by venerable ruins half buried in ivy at the lower by a stream seen through arching trees a dozen gaily dressed people seated in little groups here and there some open hampers the debris of a picnic such were the Facts accumulated by the Scientific Researcher And now what deep far reaching Theory was he to construct from them The Researcher found himself at fault Yet stay One Fact had escaped his notice While all the rest were grouped in twos and in threes Arthur was alone while all tongues were talking his was silent while all faces were gay his was gloomy and despondent Here was a Fact indeed The Researcher felt that a Theory must be constructed without delay Lady Muriel had just risen and left the party Could that be the cause of his despondency The Theory hardly rose to the dignity of a Working Hypothesis Clearly more Facts were needed The Researcher looked round him once more and now the Facts accumulated in such bewildering profusion that the Theory was lost among them For Lady Muriel had gone to meet a strange gentleman just visible in the distance and now she was returning with him both of them talking eagerly and joyfully like old friends who have been long parted and now she was moving from group to group introducing the new hero of the hour and he young tall and handsome moved gracefully at her side with the erect bearing and firm tread of a soldier Verily the Theory looked gloomy for Arthur His eye caught mine and he crossed to me He is very handsome I said Abominably handsome muttered Arthur then smiled at his own bitter words Lucky no one heard me but you Doctor Forester said Lady Muriel who had just joined us let me introduce to you my cousin Eric Lindon Captain Lindon I should say Arthur shook off his ill temper instantly and completely as he rose and gave the young soldier his hand I have heard of you he said I m very glad to make the acquaintance of Lady Muriel s cousin Yes that s all I m distinguished for as yet said Eric so we soon got to call him with a winning smile And I doubt glancing at Lady Muriel if it even amounts to a good conduct badge But it s something to begin with You must come to my father Eric said Lady Muriel I think he s wandering among the ruins And the pair moved on The gloomy look returned to Arthur s face and I could see it was only to distract his thoughts that he took his place at the side of the metaphysical young lady and resumed their interrupted discussion Talking of Herbert Spencer he began do you really find no logical difficulty in regarding Nature as a process of involution passing from definite coherent homogeneity to indefinite incoherent heterogeneity Amused as I was at the ingenious jumble he had made of Spencer s words I kept as grave a face as I could No physical difficulty she confidently replied but I haven t studied Logic much Would you state the difficulty Well said Arthur do you accept it as self evident Is it as obvious for instance as that things that are greater than the same are greater than one another To my mind she modestly replied it seems quite as obvious I grasp both truths by intuition But other minds may need some logical I forget the technical terms For a complete logical argument Arthur began with admirable solemnity we need two prim Misses Of course she interrupted I remember that word now And they produce A Delusion said Arthur Ye es she said dubiously I don t seem to remember that so well But what is the whole argument called A Sillygism Ah yes I remember now But I don t need a Sillygism you know to prove that mathematical axiom you mentioned Nor to prove that all angles are equal I suppose Why of course not One takes such a simple truth as that for granted Here I ventured to interpose and to offer her a plate of strawberries and cream I felt really uneasy at the thought that she might detect the trick and I contrived unperceived by her to shake my head reprovingly at the pseudo philosopher Equally unperceived by her Arthur slightly raised his shoulders and spread his hands abroad as who should say What else can I say to her and moved away leaving her to discuss her strawberries by involution or any other way she preferred By this time the carriages that were to convey the revelers to their respective homes had begun to assemble outside the Castle grounds and it became evident now that Lady Muriel s cousin had joined our party that the problem how to convey five people to Elveston with a carriage that would only hold four must somehow be solved The Honorable Eric Lindon who was at this moment walking up and down with Lady Muriel might have solved it at once no doubt by announcing his intention of returning on foot Of this solution there did not seem to be the very smallest probability The next best solution it seemed to me was that I should walk home and this I at once proposed You re sure you don t mind said the Earl I m afraid the carriage wont take us all and I don t like to suggest to Eric to desert his cousin so soon So far from minding it I said I should prefer it It will give me time to sketch this beautiful old ruin I ll keep you company Arthur suddenly said And in answer to what I suppose was a look of surprise on my face he said in a low voice I really would rather I shall be quite de trop in the carriage I think I ll walk too said the Earl You ll have to be content with Eric as your escort he added to Lady Muriel who had joined us while he was speaking You must be as entertaining as Cerberus three gentlemen rolled into one Lady Muriel said to her companion It will be a grand military exploit A sort of Forlorn Hope the Captain modestly suggested You do pay pretty compliments laughed his fair cousin Good day to you gentlemen three or rather deserters three And the two young folk entered the carriage and were driven away How long will your sketch take said Arthur Well I said I should like an hour for it Don t you think you had better go without me I ll return by train I know there s one in about an hour s time Perhaps that would be best said the Earl The Station is quite close So I was left to my own devices and soon found a comfortable seat at the foot of a tree from which I had a good view of the ruins It is a very drowsy day I said to myself idly turning over the leaves of the sketch book to find a blank page Why I thought you were a mile off by this time For to my surprise the two walkers were back again I came back to remind you Arthur said that the trains go every ten minutes Nonsense I said It isn t the Metropolitan Railway It is the Metropolitan Railway the Earl insisted This is a part of Kensington Why do you talk with your eyes shut said Arthur Wake up I think it s the heat makes me so drowsy I said hoping but not feeling quite sure that I was talking sense Am I awake now I think not the Earl judicially pronounced What do you think Doctor He s only got one eye open And he s snoring like anything cried Bruno Do wake up you dear old thing And he and Sylvie set to work rolling the heavy head from side to side as if its connection with the shoulders was a matter of no sort of importance And at last the Professor opened his eyes and sat up blinking at us with eyes of utter bewilderment Would you have the kindness to mention he said addressing me with his usual old fashioned courtesy whereabouts we are just now and who we are beginning with me I thought it best to begin with the children This is Sylvie Sir and this is Bruno Ah yes I know them well enough the old man murmured Its myself I m most anxious about And perhaps you ll be good enough to mention at the same time how I got here A harder problem occurs to me I ventured to say and that is how you re to get back again True true the Professor replied That s the Problem no doubt Viewed as a Problem outside of oneself it is a most interesting one Viewed as a portion of one s own biography it is I must admit very distressing He groaned but instantly added with a chuckle As to myself I think you mentioned that I am Oo re the Professor Bruno shouted in his ear Didn t oo know that Oo ve come from Outland And it s ever so far away from here The Professor leapt to his feet with the agility of a boy Then there s no time to lose he exclaimed anxiously I ll just ask this guileless peasant with his brace of buckets that contain apparently water if he ll be so kind as to direct us Guileless peasant he proceeded in a louder voice Would you tell us the way to Outland The guileless peasant turned with a sheepish grin Hey was all he said The way to Outland the Professor repeated The guileless peasant set down his buckets and considered Ah dunnot I ought to mention the Professor hastily put in that whatever you say will be used in evidence against you The guileless peasant instantly resumed his buckets Then ah says nowt he answered briskly and walked away at a great pace The children gazed sadly at the rapidly vanishing figure He goes very quick the Professor said with a sigh But I know that was the right thing to say I ve studied your English Laws However let s ask this next man that s coming He is not guileless and he is not a peasant but I don t know that either point is of vital importance It was in fact the Honourable Eric Lindon who had apparently fulfilled his task of escorting Lady Muriel home and was now strolling leisurely up and down the road outside the house enjoying a solitary cigar Might I trouble you Sir to tell us the nearest way to Outland Oddity as he was in outward appearance the Professor was in that essential nature which no outward disguise could conceal a thorough gentleman And as such Eric Lindon accepted him instantly He took the cigar from his mouth and delicately shook off the ash while he considered The name sounds strange to me he said I doubt if I can help you It is not very far from Fairyland the Professor suggested Eric Lindon s eye brows were slightly raised at these words and an amused smile which he courteously tried to repress flitted across his handsome face A trifle cracked he muttered to himself But what a jolly old patriarch it is Then he turned to the children And ca n t you help him little folk he said with a gentleness of tone that seemed to win their hearts at once Surely you know all about it How many miles to Babylon Three score miles and ten Can I get there by candlelight Yes and back again To my surprise Bruno ran forwards to him as if he were some old friend of theirs seized the disengaged hand and hung on to it with both of his own and there stood this tall dignified officer in the middle of the road gravely swinging a little boy to and fro while Sylvie stood ready to push him exactly as if a real swing had suddenly been provided for their pastime We don t want to get to Babylon oo know Bruno explained as he swung And it isn t candlelight it s daylight Sylvie added giving the swing a push of extra vigour which nearly took the whole machine off its balance By this time it was clear to me that Eric Lindon was quite unconscious of my presence Even the Professor and the children seemed to have lost sight of me and I stood in the midst of the group as unconcernedly as a ghost seeing but unseen How perfectly isochronous the Professor exclaimed with enthusiasm He had his watch in his hand and was carefully counting Bruno s oscillations He measures time quite as accurately as a pendulum Yet even pendulums the good natured young soldier observed as he carefully released his hand from Bruno s grasp are not a joy for ever Come that s enough for one bout little man Next time we meet you shall have another Meanwhile you d better take this old gentleman to Queer Street Number We ll find it cried Bruno eagerly as they dragged the Professor away We are much indebted to you the Professor said looking over his shoulder Don t mention it replied the officer raising his hat as a parting salute What number did you say the Professor called from the distance The officer made a trumpet of his two hands Forty he shouted in stentorian tones And not piano by any means he added to himself It s a mad world my masters a mad world He lit another cigar and strolled on towards his hotel What a lovely evening I said joining him as he passed me Lovely indeed he said Where did you come from Dropped from the clouds I m strolling your way I said and no further explanation seemed necessary Have a cigar Thanks I m not a smoker Is there a Lunatic Asylum near here Not that I know of Thought there might be Met a lunatic just now Queer old fish as ever I saw And so in friendly chat we took our homeward ways and wished each other good night at the door of his hotel Left to myself I felt the eerie feeling rush over me again and saw standing at the door of Number Forty the three figures I knew so well Then it s the wrong house Bruno was saying No no It s the right house the Professor cheerfully replied but it s the wrong street That s where we ve made our mistake Our best plan now will be to It was over The street was empty Commonplace life was around me and the eerie feeling had fled CHAPTER nineteen HOW TO MAKE A PHLIZZ The week passed without any further communication with the Hall as Arthur was evidently fearful that we might wear out our welcome but when on Sunday morning we were setting out for church I gladly agreed to his proposal to go round and enquire after the Earl who was said to be unwell Eric who was strolling in the garden gave us a good report of the invalid who was still in bed with Lady Muriel in attendance Are you coming with us to church I enquired Thanks no he courteously replied It s not exactly in my line you know It s an excellent institution for the poor When I m with my own folk I go just to set them an example But I m not known here so I think I ll excuse myself sitting out a sermon Country preachers are always so dull Arthur was silent till we were out of hearing Then he said to himself almost inaudibly Where two or three are gathered together in my name there am I in the midst of them Yes I assented no doubt that is the principle on which church going rests And when he does go he continued our thoughts ran so much together that our conversation was often slightly elliptical I suppose he repeats the words I believe in the Communion of Saints But by this time we had reached the little church into which a goodly stream of worshipers consisting mainly of fishermen and their families was flowing The service would have been pronounced by any modern aesthetic religionist or religious aesthete which is it to be crude and cold to me coming fresh from the ever advancing developments of a London church under a soi disant Catholic Rector it was unspeakably refreshing There was no theatrical procession of demure little choristers trying their best not to simper under the admiring gaze of the congregation the people s share in the service was taken by the people themselves unaided except that a few good voices judiciously posted here and there among them kept the singing from going too far astray There was no murdering of the noble music contained in the Bible and the Liturgy by its recital in a dead monotone with no more expression than a mechanical talking doll No the prayers were prayed the lessons were read and best of all the sermon was talked and I found myself repeating as we left the church the words of Jacob when he awaked out of his sleep Surely the Lord is in this place This is none other but the house of God and this is the gate of heaven Yes said Arthur apparently in answer to my thoughts those high services are fast becoming pure Formalism More and more the people are beginning to regard them as performances in which they only assist in the French sense And it is specially bad for the little boys They d be much less self conscious as pantomime fairies With all that dressing up and stagy entrances and exits and being always en evidence no wonder if they re eaten up with vanity the blatant little coxcombs When we passed the Hall on our return we found the Earl and Lady Muriel sitting out in the garden Eric had gone for a stroll We joined them and the conversation soon turned on the sermon we had just heard the subject of which was selfishness What a change has come over our pulpits Arthur remarked since the time when Paley gave that utterly selfish definition of virtue the doing good to mankind in obedience to the will of God and for the sake of everlasting happiness Lady Muriel looked at him enquiringly but she seemed to have learned by intuition what years of experience had taught me that the way to elicit Arthur s deepest thoughts was neither to assent nor dissent but simply to listen At that time he went on a great tidal wave of selfishness was sweeping over human thought Right and Wrong had somehow been transformed into Gain and Loss and Religion had become a sort of commercial transaction We may be thankful that our preachers are beginning to take a nobler view of life But is it not taught again and again in the Bible I ventured to ask Not in the Bible as a whole said Arthur In the Old Testament no doubt rewards and punishments are constantly appealed to as motives for action That teaching is best for children and the Israelites seem to have been mentally utter children We guide our children thus at first but we appeal as soon as possible to their innate sense of Right and Wrong and when that stage is safely past we appeal to the highest motive of all the desire for likeness to and union with the Supreme Good I think you will find that to be the teaching of the Bible as a whole beginning with that thy days may be long in the land and ending with be ye perfect even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect We were silent for awhile and then Arthur went off on another tack Look at the literature of Hymns now How cankered it is through and through with selfishness There are few human compositions more utterly degraded than some modern Hymns I quoted the stanza Whatever Lord we tend to Thee Repaid a thousandfold shall be Then gladly will we give to Thee Giver of all Yes he said grimly that is the typical stanza And the very last charity sermon I heard was infected with it After giving many good reasons for charity the preacher wound up with and for all you give you will be repaid a thousandfold Oh the utter meanness of such a motive to be put before men who do know what self sacrifice is who can appreciate generosity and heroism Talk of Original Sin he went on with increasing bitterness Can you have a stronger proof of the Original Goodness there must be in this nation than the fact that Religion has been preached to us as a commercial speculation for a century and that we still believe in a God It couldn t have gone on so long Lady Muriel musingly remarked if the Opposition hadn t been practically silenced put under what the French call la cloture Surely in any lecture hall or in private society such teaching would soon have been hooted down I trust so said Arthur and though I don t want to see brawling in church legalised I must say that our preachers enjoy an enormous privilege which they ill deserve and which they misuse terribly We put our man into a pulpit and we virtually tell him Now you may stand there and talk to us for half an hour We won t interrupt you by so much as a word You shall have it all your own way And what does he give us in return Shallow twaddle that if it were addressed to you over a dinner table you would think Does the man take me for a fool The return of Eric from his walk checked the tide of Arthur s eloquence and after a few minutes talk on more conventional topics we took our leave Lady Muriel walked with us to the gate You have given me much to think about she said earnestly as she gave Arthur her hand I m so glad you came in And her words brought a real glow of pleasure into that pale worn face of his On the Tuesday as Arthur did not seem equal to more walking I took a long stroll by myself having stipulated that he was not to give the whole day to his books but was to meet me at the Hall at about tea time On my way back I passed the Station just as the afternoon train came in sight and sauntered down the stairs to see it come in But there was little to gratify my idle curiosity and when the train was empty and the platform clear I found it was about time to be moving on if I meant to reach the Hall by five As I approached the end of the platform from which a steep irregular wooden staircase conducted to the upper world I noticed two passengers who had evidently arrived by the train but who oddly enough had entirely escaped my notice though the arrivals had been so few They were a young woman and a little girl the former so far as one could judge by appearances was a nursemaid or possibly a nursery governess in attendance on the child whose refined face even more than her dress distinguished her as of a higher class than her companion The child s face was refined but it was also a worn and sad one and told a tale or so I seemed to read it of much illness and suffering sweetly and patiently borne She had a little crutch to help herself along with and she was now standing looking wistfully up the long staircase and apparently waiting till she could muster courage to begin the toilsome ascent There are some things one says in life as well as things one does which come automatically by reflex action as the physiologists say meaning no doubt action without reflection just as lucus is said to be derived a non lucendo Closing one s eyelids when something seems to be flying into the eye is one of those actions and saying May I carry the little girl up the stairs was another It wasn t that any thought of offering help occurred to me and that then I spoke the first intimation I had of being likely to make that offer was the sound of my own voice and the discovery that the offer had been made The servant paused doubtfully glancing from her charge to me and then back again to the child Would you like it dear she asked her But no such doubt appeared to cross the child s mind she lifted her arms eagerly to be taken up Please was all she said while a faint smile flickered on the weary little face I took her up with scrupulous care and her little arm was at once clasped trustfully round my neck She was a very light weight so light in fact that the ridiculous idea crossed my mind that it was rather easier going up with her in my arms than it would have been without her and when we reached the road above with its cart ruts and loose stones all formidable obstacles for a lame child I found that I had said I d better carry her over this rough place before I had formed any mental connection between its roughness and my gentle little burden Indeed it s troubling you too much Sir the maid exclaimed She can walk very well on the flat But the arm that was twined about my neck clung just an atom more closely at the suggestion and decided me to say She s no weight really I ll carry her a little further I m going your way The nurse raised no further objection and the next speaker was a ragged little boy with bare feet and a broom over his shoulder who ran across the road and pretended to sweep the perfectly dry road in front of us Give us a ap ny the little urchin pleaded with a broad grin on his dirty face Don t give him a ap ny said the little lady in my arms The words sounded harsh but the tone was gentleness itself He s an idle little boy And she laughed a laugh of such silvery sweetness as I had never yet heard from any lips but Sylvie s To my astonishment the boy actually joined in the laugh as if there were some subtle sympathy between them as he ran away down the road and vanished through a gap in the hedge But he was back in a few moments having discarded his broom and provided himself from some mysterious source with an exquisite bouquet of flowers Buy a posy buy a posy Only a ap ny he chanted with the melancholy drawl of a professional beggar Don t buy it was Her Majesty s edict as she looked down with a lofty scorn that seemed curiously mixed with tender interest on the ragged creature at her feet But this time I turned rebel and ignored the royal commands Such lovely flowers and of forms so entirely new to me were not to be abandoned at the bidding of any little maid however imperious I bought the bouquet and the little boy after popping the halfpenny into his mouth turned head over heels as if to ascertain whether the human mouth is really adapted to serve as a money box With wonder that increased every moment I turned over the flowers and examined them one by one there was not a single one among them that I could remember having ever seen before At last I turned to the nursemaid Do these flowers grow wild about here I never saw but the speech died away on my lips The nursemaid had vanished You can put me down now if you like Sylvie quietly remarked I obeyed in silence and could only ask myself Is this a dream on finding Sylvie and Bruno walking one on either side of me and clinging to my hands with the ready confidence of childhood You re larger than when I saw you last I began Really I think we ought to be introduced again There s so much of you that I never met before you know Very well Sylvie merrily replied This is Bruno It doesn t take long He s only got one name There s another name to me Bruno protested with a reproachful look at the Mistress of the Ceremonies And it s Esquire Oh of course I forgot said Sylvie Bruno Esquire And did you come here to meet me my children I enquired You know I said we d come on Tuesday Sylvie explained Are we the proper size for common children Quite the right size for children I replied adding mentally though not common children by any means But what became of the nursemaid It are gone Bruno solemnly replied Then it wasn t solid like Sylvie and you No Oo couldn t touch it oo know If oo walked at it oo d go right froo I quite expected you d find it out once said Sylvie Bruno ran it against a telegraph post by accident And it went in two halves But you were looking the other way I felt that I had indeed missed an opportunity to witness such an event as a nursemaid going in two halves does not occur twice in a life time When did oo guess it were Sylvie Bruno enquired I didn t guess it till it was Sylvie I said But how did you manage the nursemaid Bruno managed it said Sylvie It s called a Phlizz And how do you make a Phlizz Bruno The Professor teached me how said Bruno First oo takes a lot of air Oh Bruno Sylvie interposed The Professor said you weren t to tell But who did her voice I asked Indeed it s troubling you too much Sir She can walk very well on the flat Bruno laughed merrily as I turned hastily from side to side looking in all directions for the speaker That were me he gleefully proclaimed in his own voice She can indeed walk very well on the flat I said And I think I was the Flat By this time we were near the Hall This is where my friends live I said Will you come in and have some tea with them Bruno gave a little jump of joy and Sylvie said Yes please You d like some tea Bruno wouldn t you He hasn t tasted tea she explained to me since we left Outland And that weren t good tea said Bruno It were so welly weak CHAPTER twenty LIGHT COME LIGHT GO Lady Muriel s smile of welcome could not quite conceal the look of surprise with which she regarded my new companions I presented them in due form This is Sylvie Lady Muriel And this is Bruno Any surname she enquired her eyes twinkling with fun No I said gravely No surname She laughed evidently thinking I said it in fun and stooped to kiss the children a salute to which Bruno submitted with reluctance Sylvie returned it with interest While she and Arthur who had arrived before me supplied the children with tea and cake I tried to engage the Earl in conversation but he was restless and distrait and we made little progress At last by a sudden question he betrayed the cause of his disquiet Would you let me look at those flowers you have in your hand Willingly I said handing him the bouquet Botany was I knew a favourite study of his and these flowers were to me so entirely new and mysterious that I was really curious to see what a botanist would say of them They did not diminish his disquiet On the contrary he became every moment more excited as he turned them over These are all from Central India he said laying aside part of the bouquet They are rare even there and I have never seen them in any other part of the world These two are Mexican This one He rose hastily and carried it to the window to examine it in a better light the flush of excitement mounting to his very forehead is I am nearly sure but I have a book of Indian Botany here He took a volume from the book shelves and turned the leaves with trembling fingers Yes Compare it with this picture It is the exact duplicate This is the flower of the Upas tree which usually grows only in the depths of forests and the flower fades so quickly after being plucked that it is scarcely possible to keep its form or colour even so far as the outskirts of the forest Yet this is in full bloom Where did you get these flowers he added with breathless eagerness I glanced at Sylvie who gravely and silently laid her finger on her lips then beckoned to Bruno to follow her and ran out into the garden and I found myself in the position of a defendant whose two most important witnesses have been suddenly taken away Let me give you the flowers I stammered out at last quite at my wit s end as to how to get out of the difficulty You know much more about them than I do I accept them most gratefully But you have not yet told me the Earl was beginning when we were interrupted to my great relief by the arrival of Eric Lindon To Arthur however the new comer was I saw clearly anything but welcome His face clouded over he drew a little back from the circle and took no further part in the conversation which was wholly maintained for some minutes by Lady Muriel and her lively cousin who were discussing some new music that had just arrived from London Do just try this one he pleaded The music looks easy to sing at sight and the song s quite appropriate to the occasion Then I suppose it s Five o clock tea Ever to thee Faithful I ll be Five o clock tea laughed Lady Muriel as she sat down to the piano and lightly struck a few random chords Not quite and yet it is a kind of ever to thee faithful I ll be It s a pair of hapless lovers he crosses the briny deep and she is left lamenting That is indeed appropriate she replied mockingly as he placed the song before her And am I to do the lamenting And who for if you please She played the air once or twice through first in quick and finally in slow time and then gave us the whole song with as much graceful ease as if she had been familiar with it all her life He stept so lightly to the land All in his manly pride He kissed her cheek he pressed her hand Yet still she glanced aside Too gay he seems she darkly dreams Too gallant and too gay To think of me poor simple me When he is far away I bring my Love this goodly pearl Across the seas he said A gem to deck the dearest girl That ever sailor wed She clasps it tight her eyes are bright Her throbbing heart would say He thought of me he thought of me When he was far away The ship has sailed into the West Her ocean bird is flown A dull dead pain is in her breast And she is weak and lone Yet there s a smile upon her face A smile that seems to say He ll think of me he ll think of me When he is far away Though waters wide between us glide Our lives are warm and near No distance parts two faithful hearts Two hearts that love so dear And I will trust my sailor lad For ever and a day To think of me to think of me When he is far away The look of displeasure which had begun to come over Arthur s face when the young Captain spoke of Love so lightly faded away as the song proceeded and he listened with evident delight But his face darkened again when Eric demurely remarked Don t you think my soldier lad would have fitted the tune just as well Why so it would Lady Muriel gaily retorted Soldiers sailors tinkers tailors what a lot of words would fit in I think my tinker lad sounds best Don t you To spare my friend further pain I rose to go just as the Earl was beginning to repeat his particularly embarrassing question about the flowers You have not yet Yes I ve had some tea thank you I hastily interrupted him And now we really must be going Good evening Lady Muriel And we made our adieux and escaped while the Earl was still absorbed in examining the mysterious bouquet Lady Muriel accompanied us to the door You couldn t have given my father a more acceptable present she said warmly He is so passionately fond of Botany I m afraid I know nothing of the theory of it but I keep his Hortus Siccus in order I must get some sheets of blotting paper and dry these new treasures for him before they fade That won t be no good at all said Bruno who was waiting for us in the garden Why won t it said I You know I had to give the flowers to stop questions Yes it ca n t be helped said Sylvie but they will be sorry when they find them gone But how will they go Well I don t know how But they will go The nosegay was only a Phlizz you know Bruno made it up These last words were in a whisper as she evidently did not wish Arthur to hear But of this there seemed to be little risk he hardly seemed to notice the children but paced on silent and abstracted and when at the entrance to the wood they bid us a hasty farewell and ran off he seemed to wake out of a day dream The bouquet vanished as Sylvie had predicted and when a day or two afterwards Arthur and I once more visited the Hall we found the Earl and his daughter with the old housekeeper out in the garden examining the fastenings of the drawing room window We are holding an Inquest Lady Muriel said advancing to meet us and we admit you as Accessories before the Fact to tell us all you know about those flowers The Accessories before the Fact decline to answer any questions I gravely replied And they reserve their defence Well then turn Queen s Evidence please The flowers have disappeared in the night she went on turning to Arthur and we are quite sure no one in the house has meddled with them Somebody must have entered by the window But the fastenings have not been tampered with said the Earl It must have been while you were dining my Lady said the housekeeper That was it said the Earl The thief must have seen you bring the flowers turning to me and have noticed that you did not take them away And he must have known their great value they are simply priceless he exclaimed in sudden excitement And you never told us how you got them said Lady Muriel Some day I stammered I may be free to tell you Just now would you excuse me The Earl looked disappointed but kindly said Very well we will ask no questions But we consider you a very bad Queen s Evidence Lady Muriel added playfully as we entered the arbour We pronounce you to be an accomplice and we sentence you to solitary confinement and to be fed on bread and butter Do you take sugar It is disquieting certainly she resumed when all creature comforts had been duly supplied to find that the house has been entered by a thief in this out of the way place If only the flowers had been eatables one might have suspected a thief of quite another shape You mean that universal explanation for all mysterious disappearances the cat did it said Arthur Yes she replied What a convenient thing it would be if all thieves had the same shape It s so confusing to have some of them quadrupeds and others bipeds It has occurred to me said Arthur as a curious problem in Teleology the Science of Final Causes he added in answer to an enquiring look from Lady Muriel And a Final Cause is Well suppose we say the last of a series of connected events each of the series being the cause of the next for whose sake the first event takes place But the last event is practically an effect of the first isn t it And yet you call it a cause of it Arthur pondered a moment The words are rather confusing I grant you he said Will this do The last event is an effect of the first but the necessity for that event is a cause of the necessity for the first That seems clear enough said Lady Muriel Now let us have the problem It s merely this What object can we imagine in the arrangement by which each different size roughly speaking of living creatures has its special shape For instance the human race has one kind of shape bipeds Another set ranging from the lion to the mouse are quadrupeds Go down a step or two further and you come to insects with six legs hexapods a beautiful name is it not But beauty in our sense of the word seems to diminish as we go down the creature becomes more I won t say ugly of any of God s creatures more uncouth And when we take the microscope and go a few steps lower still we come upon animalculae terribly uncouth and with a terrible number of legs The other alternative said the Earl would be a diminuendo series of repetitions of the same type Never mind the monotony of it let s see how it would work in other ways Begin with the race of men and the creatures they require let us say horses cattle sheep and dogs we don t exactly require frogs and spiders do we Muriel Lady Muriel shuddered perceptibly it was evidently a painful subject We can dispense with them she said gravely Well then we ll have a second race of men half a yard high who would have one source of exquisite enjoyment not possessed by ordinary men Arthur interrupted What source said the Earl Why the grandeur of scenery Surely the grandeur of a mountain to me depends on its size relative to me Double the height of the mountain and of course it s twice as grand Halve my height and you produce the same effect Happy happy happy Small Lady Muriel murmured rapturously None but the Short none but the Short none but the Short enjoy the Tall But let me go on said the Earl We ll have a third race of men five inches high a fourth race an inch high They couldn t eat common beef and mutton I m sure Lady Muriel interrupted True my child I was forgetting Each set must have its own cattle and sheep And its own vegetation I added What could a cow an inch high do with grass that waved far above its head That is true We must have a pasture within a pasture so to speak The common grass would serve our inch high cows as a green forest of palms while round the root of each tall stem would stretch a tiny carpet of microscopic grass Yes I think our scheme will work fairly well And it would be very interesting coming into contact with the races below us What sweet little things the inch high bull dogs would be I doubt if even Muriel would run away from one of them Don t you think we ought to have a crescendo series as well said Lady Muriel Only fancy being a hundred yards high One could use an elephant as a paper weight and a crocodile as a pair of scissors And would you have races of different sizes communicate with one another I enquired Would they make war on one another for instance or enter into treaties War we must exclude I think When you could crush a whole nation with one blow of your fist you couldn t conduct war on equal terms But anything involving a collision of minds only would be possible in our ideal world for of course we must allow mental powers to all irrespective of size Perhaps the fairest rule would be that the smaller the race the greater should be its intellectual development Do you mean to say said Lady Muriel that these manikins of an inch high are to argue with me Surely surely said the Earl An argument doesn t depend for its logical force on the size of the creature that utters it She tossed her head indignantly I would not argue with any man less than six inches high she cried I d make him work What at said Arthur listening to all this nonsense with an amused smile Embroidery she readily replied What lovely embroidery they would do Yet if they did it wrong I said you couldn t argue the question I don t know why but I agree that it couldn t be done The reason is said Lady Muriel one couldn t sacrifice one s dignity so far Of course one couldn t echoed Arthur Any more than one could argue with a potato It would be altogether excuse the ancient pun infra dig I doubt it said I Even a pun doesn t quite convince me Well if that is not the reason said Lady Muriel what reason would you give I tried hard to understand the meaning of this question but the persistent humming of the bees confused me and there was a drowsiness in the air that made every thought stop and go to sleep before it had got well thought out so all I could say was That must depend on the weight of the potato I felt the remark was not so sensible as I should have liked it to be But Lady Muriel seemed to take it quite as a matter of course In that case she began but suddenly started and turned away to listen Don t you hear him she said He s crying We must go to him somehow And I said to myself That s very strange I quite thought it was Lady Muriel talking to me Why it s Sylvie all the while And I made another great effort to say something that should have some meaning in it Is it about the potato CHAPTER twenty one THROUGH THE IVORY DOOR I don t know said Sylvie Hush I must think I could go to him by myself well enough But I want you to come too Let me go with you I pleaded I can walk as fast as you can I m sure Sylvie laughed merrily What nonsense she cried Why you ca n t walk a bit You re lying quite flat on your back You don t understand these things I can walk as well as you can I repeated And I tried my best to walk a few steps but the ground slipped away backwards quite as fast as I could walk so that I made no progress at all Sylvie laughed again There I told you so You ve no idea how funny you look moving your feet about in the air as if you were walking Wait a bit I ll ask the Professor what we d better do And she knocked at his study door The door opened and the Professor looked out What s that crying I heard just now he asked Is it a human animal It s a boy Sylvie said I m afraid you ve been teasing him No indeed I haven t Sylvie said very earnestly I never tease him Well I must ask the Other Professor about it He went back into the study and we heard him whispering small human animal says she hasn t been teasing him the kind that s called Boy Ask her which Boy said a new voice The Professor came out again Which Boy is it that you haven t been teasing Sylvie looked at me with twinkling eyes You dear old thing she exclaimed standing on tiptoe to kiss him while he gravely stooped to receive the salute How you do puzzle me Why there are several boys I haven t been teasing The Professor returned to his friend and this time the voice said Tell her to bring them here all of them I ca n t and I won t Sylvie exclaimed the moment he reappeared It s Bruno that s crying and he s my brother and please we both want to go he ca n t walk you know he s he s dreaming you know this in a whisper for fear of hurting my feelings Do let s go through the Ivory Door I ll ask him said the Professor disappearing again He returned directly He says you may Follow me and walk on tip toe The difficulty with me would have been just then not to walk on tip toe It seemed very hard to reach down far enough to just touch the floor as Sylvie led me through the study The Professor went before us to unlock the Ivory Door I had just time to glance at the Other Professor who was sitting reading with his back to us before the Professor showed us out through the door and locked it behind us Bruno was standing with his hands over his face crying bitterly What s the matter darling said Sylvie with her arms round his neck Hurted mine self welly much sobbed the poor little fellow I m so sorry darling How ever did you manage to hurt yourself so Course I managed it said Bruno laughing through his tears Doos oo think nobody else but oo ca n t manage things Matters were looking distinctly brighter now Bruno had begun to argue Come let s hear all about it I said My foot took it into its head to slip Bruno began A foot hasn t got a head Sylvie put in but all in vain I slipted down the bank And I tripted over a stone And the stone hurted my foot And I trod on a Bee And the Bee stinged my finger Poor Bruno sobbed again The complete list of woes was too much for his feelings And it knewed I didn t mean to trod on it he added as the climax That Bee should be ashamed of itself I said severely and Sylvie hugged and kissed the wounded hero till all tears were dried My finger s quite unstung now said Bruno Why doos there be stones Mister Sir doos oo know They re good for something I said even if we don t know what What s the good of dandelions now Dindledums said Bruno Oh they re ever so pretty And stones aren t pretty one bit Would oo like some dindledums Mister Sir Bruno Sylvie murmured reproachfully You mustn t say Mister and Sir both at once Remember what I told you You telled me I were to say Mister when I spoked about him and I were to say Sir when I spoked to him Well you re not doing both you know Ah but I is doing bofe Miss Praticular Bruno exclaimed triumphantly I wishted to speak about the Gemplun and I wishted to speak to the Gemplun So a course I said Mister Sir That s all right Bruno I said Course it s all right said Bruno Sylvie just knows nuffin at all There never was an impertinenter boy said Sylvie frowning till her bright eyes were nearly invisible And there never was an ignoranter girl retorted Bruno Come along and pick some dindledums That s all she s fit for he added in a very loud whisper to me But why do you say Dindledums Bruno Dandelions is the right word It s because he jumps about so Sylvie said laughing Yes that s it Bruno assented Sylvie tells me the words and then when I jump about they get shooken up in my head till they re all froth I expressed myself as perfectly satisfied with this explanation But aren t you going to pick me any dindledums after all Course we will cried Bruno Come along Sylvie And the happy children raced away bounding over the turf with the fleetness and grace of young antelopes Then you didn t find your way back to Outland I said to the Professor Oh yes I did he replied We never got to Queer Street but I found another way I ve been backwards and forwards several times since then I had to be present at the Election you know as the author of the new Money act The Emperor was so kind as to wish that I should have the credit of it Let come what come may I remember the very words of the Imperial Speech if it should turn out that the Warden is alive you will bear witness that the change in the coinage is the Professor s doing not mine I never was so glorified in my life before Tears trickled down his cheeks at the recollection which apparently was not wholly a pleasant one Is the Warden supposed to be dead Well it s supposed so but mind you I don t believe it The evidence is very weak mere hear say A wandering Jester with a Dancing Bear they found their way into the Palace one day has been telling people he comes from Fairyland and that the Warden died there I wanted the Vice Warden to question him but most unluckily he and my Lady were always out walking when the Jester came round Yes the Warden s supposed to be dead And more tears trickled down the old man s cheeks But what is the new Money Act The Professor brightened up again The Emperor started the thing he said He wanted to make everybody in Outland twice as rich as he was before just to make the new Government popular Only there wasn t nearly enough money in the Treasury to do it So I suggested that he might do it by doubling the value of every coin and bank note in Outland It s the simplest thing possible I wonder nobody ever thought of it before And you never saw such universal joy The shops are full from morning to night Everybody s buying everything And how was the glorifying done A sudden gloom overcast the Professor s jolly face They did it as I went home after the Election he mournfully replied It was kindly meant but I didn t like it They waved flags all round me till I was nearly blind and they rang bells till I was nearly deaf and they strewed the road so thick with flowers that I lost my way And the poor old man sighed deeply How far is it to Outland I asked to change the subject About five days march But one must go back occasionally You see as Court Professor I have to be always in attendance on Prince Uggug The Empress would be very angry if I left him even for an hour But surely every time you come here you are absent ten days at least Oh more than that the Professor exclaimed A fortnight sometimes But of course I keep a memorandum of the exact time when I started so that I can put the Court time back to the very moment Excuse me I said I don t understand Silently the Professor drew front his pocket a square gold watch with six or eight hands and held it out for my inspection This he began is an Outlandish Watch So I should have thought which has the peculiar property that instead of its going with the time the time goes with it I trust you understand me now Hardly I said Permit me to explain So long as it is let alone it takes its own course Time has no effect upon it I have known such watches I remarked It goes of course at the usual rate Only the time has to go with it Hence if I move the hands I change the time To move them forwards in advance of the true time is impossible but I can move them as much as a month backwards that is the limit And then you have the events all over again with any alterations experience may suggest What a blessing such a watch would be I thought in real life To be able to unsay some heedless word to undo some reckless deed Might I see the thing done With pleasure said the good natured Professor When I move this hand back to here pointing out the place History goes back fifteen minutes Trembling with excitement I watched him push the hand round as he described Hurted mine self welly much Shrilly and suddenly the words rang in my ears and more startled than I cared to show I turned to look for the speaker Yes There was Bruno standing with the tears running down his cheeks just as I had seen him a quarter of an hour ago and there was Sylvie with her arms round his neck I had not the heart to make the dear little fellow go through his troubles a second time so hastily begged the Professor to push the hands round into their former position In a moment Sylvie and Bruno were gone again and I could just see them in the far distance picking dindledums Wonderful indeed I exclaimed It has another property yet more wonderful said the Professor You see this little peg That is called the Reversal Peg If you push it in the events of the next hour happen in the reverse order Do not try it now I will lend you the Watch for a few days and you can amuse yourself with experiments Thank you very much I said as he gave me the Watch I ll take the greatest care of it why here are the children again We could only but find six dindledums said Bruno putting them into my hands cause Sylvie said it were time to go back And here s a big blackberry for ooself We couldn t only find but two Thank you it s very nice I said And I suppose you ate the other Bruno No I didn t Bruno said carelessly Aren t they pretty dindledums Mister Sir Yes very but what makes you limp so my child Mine foot s come hurted again Bruno mournfully replied And he sat down on the ground and began nursing it The Professor held his head between his hands an attitude that I knew indicated distraction of mind Better rest a minute he said It may be better then or it may be worse If only I had some of my medicines here I m Court Physician you know he added aside to me Shall I go and get you some blackberries darling Sylvie whispered with her arms round his neck and she kissed away a tear that was trickling down his cheek Bruno brightened up in a moment That are a good plan he exclaimed I thinks my foot would come quite unhurted if I eated a blackberry two or three blackberries six or seven blackberries Sylvie got up hastily I d better go she said aside to me before he gets into the double figures Let me come and help you I said I can reach higher up than you can Yes please said Sylvie putting her hand into mine and we walked off together Bruno loves blackberries she said as we paced slowly along by a tall hedge that looked a promising place for them and it was so sweet of him to make me eat the only one Oh it was you that ate it then Bruno didn t seem to like to tell me about it No I saw that said Sylvie He s always afraid of being praised But he made me eat it really I would much rather he oh what s that And she clung to my hand half frightened as we came in sight of a hare lying on its side with legs stretched out just in the entrance to the wood It s a hare my child Perhaps it s asleep No it isn t asleep Sylvie said timidly going nearer to look at it it s eyes are open Is it is it her voice dropped to an awestruck whisper is it dead do you think Yes it s quite dead I said after stooping to examine it Poor thing I think it s been hunted to death I know the harriers were out yesterday But they haven t touched it Perhaps they caught sight of another and left it to die of fright and exhaustion Hunted to death Sylvie repeated to herself very slowly and sadly I thought hunting was a thing they played at like a game Bruno and I hunt snails but we never hurt them when we catch them Sweet angel I thought How am I to get the idea of Sport into your innocent mind And as we stood hand in hand looking down at the dead hare I tried to put the thing into such words as she could understand You know what fierce wild beasts lions and tigers are Sylvie nodded Well in some countries men have to kill them to save their own lives you know Yes said Sylvie if one tried to kill me Bruno would kill it if he could Well and so the men the hunters get to enjoy it you know the running and the fighting and the shouting and the danger Yes said Sylvie Bruno likes danger Well but in this country there aren t any lions and tigers loose so they hunt other creatures you see I hoped but in vain that this would satisfy her and that she would ask no more questions They hunt foxes Sylvie said thoughtfully And I think they kill them too Foxes are very fierce I daresay men don t love them Are hares fierce No I said A hare is a sweet gentle timid animal almost as gentle as a lamb But if men love hares why why her voice quivered and her sweet eyes were brimming over with tears I m afraid they don t love them dear child All children love them Sylvie said All ladies love them I m afraid even ladies go to hunt them sometimes Sylvie shuddered Oh no not ladies she earnestly pleaded Not Lady Muriel No she never does I m sure but this is too sad a sight for you dear Let s try and find some But Sylvie was not satisfied yet In a hushed solemn tone with bowed head and clasped hands she put her final question Does GOD love hares Yes I said I m sure He does He loves every living thing Even sinful men How much more the animals that cannot sin I don t know what sin means said Sylvie And I didn t try to explain it Come my child I said trying to lead her away Wish good bye to the poor hare and come and look for blackberries Good bye poor hare Sylvie obediently repeated looking over her shoulder at it as we turned away And then all in a moment her self command gave way Pulling her hand out of mine she ran back to where the dead hare was lying and flung herself down at its side in such an agony of grief as I could hardly have believed possible in so young a child Oh my darling my darling she moaned over and over again And God meant your life to be so beautiful Sometimes but always keeping her face hidden on the ground she would reach out one little hand to stroke the poor dead thing and then once more bury her face in her hands and sob as if her heart would break I was afraid she would really make herself ill still I thought it best to let her weep away the first sharp agony of grief and after a few minutes the sobbing gradually ceased and Sylvie rose to her feet and looked calmly at me though tears were still streaming down her cheeks I did not dare to speak again just yet but simply held out my hand to her that we might quit the melancholy spot Yes I ll come now she said Very reverently she kneeled down and kissed the dead hare then rose and gave me her hand and we moved on in silence A child s sorrow is violent but short and it was almost in her usual voice that she said after a minute Oh stop stop Here are some lovely blackberries We filled our hands with fruit and returned in all haste to where the Professor and Bruno were seated on a bank awaiting our return Just before we came within hearing distance Sylvie checked me Please don t tell Bruno about the hare she said Very well my child But why not Tears again glittered in those sweet eyes and she turned her head away so that I could scarcely hear her reply He s he s very fond of gentle creatures you know And he d he d be so sorry I don t want him to be made sorry And your agony of sorrow is to count for nothing then sweet unselfish child I thought to myself But no more was said till we had reached our friends and Bruno was far too much engrossed in the feast we had brought him to take any notice of Sylvie s unusually grave manner I m afraid it s getting rather late Professor I said Yes indeed said the Professor I must take you all through the Ivory Door again You ve stayed your full time Mightn t we stay a little longer pleaded Sylvie Just one minute added Bruno But the Professor was unyielding It s a great privilege coming through at all he said We must go now And we followed him obediently to the Ivory Door which he threw open and signed to me to go through first You re coming too aren t you I said to Sylvie Yes she said but you won t see us after you ve gone through But suppose I wait for you outside I asked as I stepped through the doorway In that case said Sylvie I think the potato would be quite justified in asking your weight I can quite imagine a really superior kidney potato declining to argue with any one under fifteen stone With a great effort I recovered the thread of my thoughts We lapse very quickly into nonsense I said CHAPTER twenty two CROSSING THE LINE Let us lapse back again said Lady Muriel Take another cup of tea I hope that s sound common sense And all that strange adventure I thought has occupied the space of a single comma in Lady Muriel s speech A single comma for which grammarians tell us to count one I felt no doubt that the Professor had kindly put back the time for me to the exact point at which I had gone to sleep When a few minutes afterwards we left the house Arthur s first remark was certainly a strange one We ve been there just twenty minutes he said and I ve done nothing but listen to you and Lady Muriel talking and yet somehow I feel exactly as if I had been talking with her for an hour at least And so he had been I felt no doubt only as the time had been put back to the beginning of the tete a tete he referred to the whole of it had passed into oblivion if not into nothingness But I valued my own reputation for sanity too highly to venture on explaining to him what had happened For some cause which I could not at the moment divine Arthur was unusually grave and silent during our walk home It could not be connected with Eric Lindon I thought as he had for some days been away in London so that having Lady Muriel almost all to himself for I was only too glad to hear those two conversing to have any wish to intrude any remarks of my own he ought theoretically to have been specially radiant and contented with life Can he have heard any bad news I said to myself And almost as if he had read my thoughts he spoke He will be here by the last train he said in the tone of one who is continuing a conversation rather than beginning one Captain Lindon do you mean Yes Captain Lindon said Arthur I said he because I fancied we were talking about him The Earl told me he comes tonight though to morrow is the day when he will know about the Commission that he s hoping for I wonder he doesn t stay another day to hear the result if he s really so anxious about it as the Earl believes he is He can have a telegram sent after him I said but it s not very soldier like running away from possible bad news He s a very good fellow said Arthur but I confess it would be good news for me if he got his Commission and his Marching Orders all at once I wish him all happiness with one exception Good night We had reached home by this time I m not good company to night better be alone It was much the same next day Arthur declared he wasn t fit for Society and I had to set forth alone for an afternoon stroll I took the road to the Station and at the point where the road from the Hall joined it I paused seeing my friends in the distance seemingly bound for the same goal Will you join us the Earl said after I had exchanged greetings with him and Lady Muriel and Captain Lindon This restless young man is expecting a telegram and we are going to the Station to meet it There is also a restless young woman in the case Lady Muriel added That goes without saying my child said her father Women are always restless For generous appreciation of all one s best qualities his daughter impressively remarked there s nothing to compare with a father is there Eric Cousins are not in it said Eric and then somehow the conversation lapsed into two duologues the younger folk taking the lead and the two old men following with less eager steps And when are we to see your little friends again said the Earl They are singularly attractive children I shall be delighted to bring them when I can I said But I don t know myself when I am likely to see them again I m not going to question you said the Earl but there s no harm in mentioning that Muriel is simply tormented with curiosity We know most of the people about here and she has been vainly trying to guess what house they can possibly be staying at Some day I may be able to enlighten her but just at present Thanks She must bear it as best she can I tell her it s a grand opportunity for practising patience But she hardly sees it from that point of view Why there are the children So indeed they were waiting for us apparently at a stile which they could not have climbed over more than a few moments as Lady Muriel and her cousin had passed it without seeing them On catching sight of us Bruno ran to meet us and to exhibit to us with much pride the handle of a clasp knife the blade having been broken off which he had picked up in the road And what shall you use it for Bruno I said Don t know Bruno carelessly replied must think A child s first view of life the Earl remarked with that sweet sad smile of his is that it is a period to be spent in accumulating portable property That view gets modified as the years glide away And he held out his hand to Sylvie who had placed herself by me looking a little shy of him But the gentle old man was not one with whom any child human or fairy could be shy for long and she had very soon deserted my hand for his Bruno alone remaining faithful to his first friend We overtook the other couple just as they reached the Station and both Lady Muriel and Eric greeted the children as old friends the latter with the words So you got to Babylon by candlelight after all Yes and back again cried Bruno Lady Muriel looked from one to the other in blank astonishment What you know them Eric she exclaimed This mystery grows deeper every day Then we must be somewhere in the Third Act said Eric You don t expect the mystery to be cleared up till the Fifth Act do you But it s such a long drama was the plaintive reply We must have got to the Fifth Act by this time Third Act I assure you said the young soldier mercilessly Scene a railway platform Lights down Enter Prince in disguise of course and faithful Attendant This is the Prince taking Bruno s hand and here stands his humble Servant What is your Royal Highness next command And he made a most courtier like low bow to his puzzled little friend Oo re not a Servant Bruno scornfully exclaimed Oo re a Gemplun Servant I assure your Royal Highness Eric respectfully insisted Allow me to mention to your Royal Highness my various situations past present and future What did oo begin wiz Bruno asked beginning to enter into the jest Was oo a shoe black Lower than that your Royal Highness Years ago I offered myself as a Slave as a Confidential Slave I think it s called he asked turning to Lady Muriel But Lady Muriel heard him not something had gone wrong with her glove which entirely engrossed her attention Did oo get the place said Bruno Sad to say Your Royal Highness I did not So I had to take a situation as as Waiter which I have now held for some years haven t I He again glanced at Lady Muriel Sylvie dear do help me to button this glove Lady Muriel whispered hastily stooping down and failing to hear the question And what will oo be next said Bruno My next place will I hope be that of Groom And after that Don t puzzle the child so Lady Muriel interrupted What nonsense you talk after that Eric persisted I hope to obtain the situation of Housekeeper which Fourth Act he proclaimed with a sudden change of tone Lights turned up Red lights Green lights Distant rumble heard Enter a passenger train And in another minute the train drew up alongside of the platform and a stream of passengers began to flow out from the booking office and waiting rooms Did you ever make real life into a drama said the Earl Now just try I ve often amused myself that way Consider this platform as our stage Good entrances and exits on both sides you see Capital background scene real engine moving up and down All this bustle and people passing to and fro must have been most carefully rehearsed How naturally they do it With never a glance at the audience And every grouping is quite fresh you see No repetition It really was admirable as soon as I began to enter into it from this point of view Even a porter passing with a barrow piled with luggage seemed so realistic that one was tempted to applaud He was followed by an angry mother with hot red face dragging along two screaming children and calling to some one behind John Come on Enter John very meek very silent and loaded with parcels And he was followed in his turn by a frightened little nursemaid carrying a fat baby also screaming All the children screamed Capital byplay said the old man aside Did you notice the nursemaid s look of terror It was simply perfect You have struck quite a new vein I said To most of us Life and its pleasures seem like a mine that is nearly worked out Worked out exclaimed the Earl For any one with true dramatic instincts it is only the Overture that is ended The real treat has yet to begin You go to a theatre and pay your ten shillings for a stall and what do you get for your money Perhaps it s a dialogue between a couple of farmers unnatural in their overdone caricature of farmers dress more unnatural in their constrained attitudes and gestures most unnatural in their attempts at ease and geniality in their talk Go instead and take a seat in a third class railway carriage and you ll get the same dialogue done to the life Front seats no orchestra to block the view and nothing to pay Which reminds me said Eric There is nothing to pay on receiving a telegram Shall we enquire for one And he and Lady Muriel strolled off in the direction of the Telegraph Office I wonder if Shakespeare had that thought in his mind I said when he wrote All the world s a stage The old man sighed And so it is he said look at it as you will Life is indeed a drama a drama with but few encores and no bouquets he added dreamily We spend one half of it in regretting the things we did in the other half And the secret of enjoying it he continued resuming his cheerful tone is intensity But not in the modern aesthetic sense I presume Like the young lady in Punch who begins a conversation with Are you intense By no means replied the Earl What I mean is intensity of thought a concentrated attention We lose half the pleasure we might have in Life by not really attending Take any instance you like it doesn t matter how trivial the pleasure may be the principle is the same Suppose A and B are reading the same second rate circulating library novel A never troubles himself to master the relationships of the characters on which perhaps all the interest of the story depends he skips over all the descriptions of scenery and every passage that looks rather dull he doesn t half attend to the passages he does read he goes on reading merely from want of resolution to find another occupation for hours after he ought to have put the book aside and reaches the FINIS in a state of utter weariness and depression B puts his whole soul into the thing on the principle that whatever is worth doing is worth doing well he masters the genealogies he calls up pictures before his mind s eye as he reads about the scenery best of all he resolutely shuts the book at the end of some chapter while his interest is yet at its keenest and turns to other subjects so that when next he allows himself an hour at it it is like a hungry man sitting down to dinner and when the book is finished he returns to the work of his daily life like a giant refreshed But suppose the book were really rubbish nothing to repay attention Well suppose it said the Earl My theory meets that case I assure you A never finds out that it is rubbish but maunders on to the end trying to believe he s enjoying himself B quietly shuts the book when he s read a dozen pages walks off to the Library and changes it for a better I have yet another theory for adding to the enjoyment of Life that is if I have not exhausted your patience I m afraid you find me a very garrulous old man No indeed I exclaimed earnestly And indeed I felt as if one could not easily tire of the sweet sadness of that gentle voice It is that we should learn to take our pleasures quickly and our pains slowly But why I should have put it the other way myself By taking artificial pain which can be as trivial as you please slowly the result is that when real pain comes however severe all you need do is to let it go at its ordinary pace and it s over in a moment Very true I said but how about the pleasure Why by taking it quick you can get so much more into life It takes you three hours and a half to hear and enjoy an opera Suppose I can take it in and enjoy it in half an hour Why I can enjoy seven operas while you are listening to one Always supposing you have an orchestra capable of playing them I said And that orchestra has yet to be found The old man smiled I have heard an air played he said and by no means a short one played right through variations and all in three seconds When And how I asked eagerly with a half notion that I was dreaming again It was done by a little musical box he quietly replied After it had been wound up the regulator or something broke and it ran down as I said in about three seconds But it must have played all the notes you know Did you enjoy it I asked with all the severity of a cross examining barrister No I didn t he candidly confessed But then you know I hadn t been trained to that kind of music I should much like to try your plan I said and as Sylvie and Bruno happened to run up to us at the moment I left them to keep the Earl company and strolled along the platform making each person and event play its part in an extempore drama for my especial benefit What is the Earl tired of you already I said as the children ran past me No Sylvie replied with great emphasis He wants the evening paper So Bruno s going to be a little news boy Mind you charge a good price for it I called after them Returning up the platform I came upon Sylvie alone Well child I said where s your little news boy Couldn t he get you an evening paper He went to get one at the book stall at the other side said Sylvie and he s coming across the line with it oh Bruno you ought to cross by the bridge for the distant thud thud of the Express was already audible Suddenly a look of horror came over her face Oh he s fallen down on the rails she cried and darted past me at a speed that quite defied the hasty effort I made to stop her But the wheezy old Station Master happened to be close behind me he wasn t good for much poor old man but he was good for this and before I could turn round he had the child clasped in his arms saved from the certain death she was rushing to So intent was I in watching this scene that I hardly saw a flying figure in a light grey suit who shot across from the back of the platform and was on the line in another second So far as one could take note of time in such a moment of horror he had about ten clear seconds before the Express would be upon him in which to cross the rails and to pick up Bruno Whether he did so or not it was quite impossible to guess the next thing one knew was that the Express had passed and that whether for life or death all was over When the cloud of dust had cleared away and the line was once more visible we saw with thankful hearts that the child and his deliverer were safe All right Eric called to us cheerfully as he recrossed the line He s more frightened than hurt He lifted the little fellow up into Lady Muriel s arms and mounted the platform as gaily as if nothing had happened but he was as pale as death and leaned heavily on the arm I hastily offered him fearing he was about to faint I ll just sit down a moment he said dreamily where s Sylvie Sylvie ran to him and flung her arms round his neck sobbing as if her heart would break Don t do that my darling Eric murmured with a strange look in his eyes Nothing to cry about now you know But you very nearly got yourself killed for nothing For Bruno the little maiden sobbed And he would have done it for me Wouldn t you Bruno Course I would Bruno said looking round with a bewildered air Lady Muriel kissed him in silence as she put him down out of her arms Then she beckoned Sylvie to come and take his hand and signed to the children to go back to where the Earl was seated Tell him she whispered with quivering lips tell him all is well Then she turned to the hero of the day I thought it was death she said Thank God you are safe Did you see how near it was I saw there was just time Eric said lightly A soldier must learn to carry his life in his hand you know I m all right now Shall we go to the telegraph office again I daresay it s come by this time I went to join the Earl and the children and we waited almost in silence for no one seemed inclined to talk and Bruno was half asleep on Sylvie s lap till the others joined us No telegram had come I ll take a stroll with the children I said feeling that we were a little de trop and I ll look in in the course of the evening We must go back into the wood now Sylvie said as soon as we were out of hearing We ca n t stay this size any longer Then you will be quite tiny Fairies again next time we meet Yes said Sylvie but we ll be children again some day if you ll let us Bruno s very anxious to see Lady Muriel again She are welly nice said Bruno I shall be very glad to take you to see her again I said Hadn t I better give you back the Professor s Watch It ll be too large for you to carry when you re Fairies you know Bruno laughed merrily I was glad to see he had quite recovered from the terrible scene he had gone through Oh no it won t he said When we go small it ll go small And then it ll go straight to the Professor Sylvie added and you won t be able to use it anymore so you d better use it all you can now We must go small when the sun sets Good bye Good bye cried Bruno But their voices sounded very far away and when I looked round both children had disappeared And it wants only two hours to sunset I said as I strolled on I must make the best of my time CHAPTER twenty three AN OUTLANDISH WATCH 
3825_134160_000002_000000	train-clean-360	As I entered the little town I came upon two of the fishermen s wives interchanging that last word which never was the last and it occurred to me as an experiment with the Magic Watch to wait till the little scene was over and then to encore it 
none	none	Well good night t ye And ye winna forget to send us word when your Martha writes Nay ah winna forget An if she isn t suited she can but coom back Good night t ye 
3825_134160_000005_000000	train-clean-360	A casual observer might have thought and there ends the dialogue That casual observer would have been mistaken 
3825_134160_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 Ah she ll like em I war n ye 
3825_134160_000006_000001	train-clean-360	They ll not treat her bad yer may depend 
none	none	They re varry canny fowk Good night Ay they are that Good night Good night 
3825_134160_000008_000001	train-clean-360	And ye ll send us word if she writes 
none	none	Aye ah will yer may depend Good night t ye 
3825_134160_000010_000000	train-clean-360	And at last they parted 
3825_134160_000010_000001	train-clean-360	I waited till they were some twenty yards apart and then put the Watch a minute back 
3825_134160_000010_000002	train-clean-360	The instantaneous change was startling the two figures seemed to flash back into their former places 
none	none	isn t suited she can but coom back Good night t ye one of them was saying and so the whole dialogue was repeated and when they had parted for the second time I let them go their several ways and strolled on through the town
3825_134160_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 But the real usefulness of this magic power I thought would be to undo some harm some painful event some accident 
3825_134160_000013_000000	train-clean-360	I had not long to wait for an opportunity of testing this property also of the Magic Watch for even as the thought passed through my mind the accident I was imagining occurred 
3825_134160_000013_000001	train-clean-360	A light cart was standing at the door of the Great Millinery Depot of Elveston laden with card board packing cases which the driver was carrying into the shop one by one One of the cases had fallen into the street but it scarcely seemed worth while to step forward and pick it up as the man would be back again in a moment 
none	none	Yet in that moment a young man riding a bicycle came sharp round the corner of the street and in trying to avoid running over the box upset his machine and was thrown headlong against the wheel of the spring cart The driver ran out to his assistance and he and I together raised the unfortunate cyclist and carried him into the shop His head was cut and bleeding and one knee seemed to be badly injured and it was speedily settled that he had better be conveyed at once to the only Surgery in the place 
3825_134160_000013_000005	train-clean-360	I helped them in emptying the cart and placing in it some pillows for the wounded man to rest on and it was only when the driver had mounted to his place and was starting for the Surgery that I bethought me of the strange power I possessed of undoing all this harm 
none	none	Now is my time I said to myself as I moved back the hand of the Watch and saw almost without surprise this time all things restored to the places they had occupied at the critical moment when I had first noticed the fallen packing case 
3825_134160_000015_000000	train-clean-360	Instantly I stepped out into the street picked up the box and replaced it in the cart in the next moment the bicycle had spun round the corner passed the cart without let or hindrance and soon vanished in the distance in a cloud of dust 
3825_134160_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 Delightful power of magic I thought 
3825_134160_000016_000001	train-clean-360	 How much of human suffering I have not only relieved but actually annihilated And in a glow of conscious virtue I stood watching the unloading of the cart still holding the Magic Watch open in my hand as I was curious to see what would happen when we again reached the exact time at which I had put back the hand 
none	none	The result was one that if only I had considered the thing carefully I might have foreseen as the hand of the Watch touched the mark the spring cart which had driven off and was by this time half way down the street was back again at the door and in the act of starting while oh woe for the golden dream of world wide benevolence that had dazzled my dreaming fancy the wounded youth was once more reclining on the heap of pillows his pale face set rigidly in the hard lines that told of pain resolutely endured
3825_134160_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh mocking Magic Watch I said to myself as I passed out of the little town and took the seaward road that led to my lodgings 
none	none	The good I fancied I could do is vanished like a dream the evil of this troublesome world is the only abiding reality And now I must record an experience so strange that I think it only fair before beginning to relate it to release my much enduring reader from any obligation he may feel to believe this part of my story I would not have believed it I freely confess if I had not seen it with my own eyes then why should I expect it of my reader who quite possibly has never seen anything of the sort I was passing a pretty little villa which stood rather back from the road in its own grounds with bright flower beds in front creepers wandering over the walls and hanging in festoons about the bow windows an easy chair forgotten on the lawn with a newspaper lying near it a small pug dog couchant before it resolved to guard the treasure even at the sacrifice of life and a front door standing invitingly half open
3825_134160_000020_000001	train-clean-360	 Here is my chance I thought for testing the reverse action of the Magic Watch I pressed the reversal peg and walked in 
none	none	In another house the entrance of a stranger might cause surprise perhaps anger even going so far as to expel the said stranger with violence but here I knew nothing of the sort could happen The ordinary course of events first to think nothing about me then hearing my footsteps to look up and see me and then to wonder what business I had there would be reversed by the action of my Watch 
3825_134160_000020_000003	train-clean-360	They would first wonder who I was then see me then look down and think no more about me 
3825_134160_000020_000004	train-clean-360	And as to being expelled with violence that event would necessarily come first in this case 
3825_134160_000020_000005	train-clean-360	 So if I can once get in I said to myself all risk of expulsion will be over 
none	none	The pug dog sat up as a precautionary measure as I passed but as I took no notice of the treasure he was guarding he let me go by without even one remonstrant bark
3825_134160_000022_000001	train-clean-360	 He that takes my life he seemed to be saying wheezily to himself takes trash But he that takes the Daily Telegraph But this awful contingency I did not face 
none	none	The party in the drawing room I had walked straight in you understand without ringing the bell or giving any notice of my approach consisted of four laughing rosy children of ages from about fourteen down to ten who were apparently all coming towards the door I found they were really walking backwards while their mother seated by the fire with some needlework on her lap was saying just as I entered the room Now girls you may get your things on for a walk To my utter astonishment for I was not yet accustomed to the action of the Watch all smiles ceased as Browning says on the four pretty faces and they all got out pieces of needle work and sat down No one noticed me in the least as I quietly took a chair and sat down to watch them 
3825_134160_000025_000000	train-clean-360	When the needle work had been unfolded and they were all ready to begin their mother said Come that s done at last 
3825_134160_000025_000001	train-clean-360	You may fold up your work girls But the children took no notice whatever of the remark on the contrary they set to work at once sewing if that is the proper word to describe an operation such as I had never before witnessed 
3825_134160_000025_000002	train-clean-360	Each of them threaded her needle with a short end of thread attached to the work which was instantly pulled by an invisible force through the stuff dragging the needle after it the nimble fingers of the little sempstress caught it at the other side but only to lose it again the next moment 
none	none	And so the work went on steadily undoing itself and the neatly stitched little dresses or whatever they were steadily falling to pieces 
3825_134160_000025_000004	train-clean-360	Now and then one of the children would pause as the recovered thread became inconveniently long wind it on a bobbin and start again with another short end 
3825_134160_000026_000000	train-clean-360	At last all the work was picked to pieces and put away and the lady led the way into the next room walking backwards and making the insane remark Not yet dear we must get the sewing done first 
3825_134160_000026_000001	train-clean-360	After which I was not surprised to see the children skipping backwards after her exclaiming Oh mother it is such a lovely day for a walk 
none	none	In the dining room the table had only dirty plates and empty dishes on it However the party with the addition of a gentleman as good natured and as rosy as the children seated themselves at it very contentedly You have seen people eating cherry tart and every now and then cautiously conveying a cherry stone from their lips to their plates Well something like that went on all through this ghastly or shall we say ghostly banquet An empty fork is raised to the lips there it receives a neatly cut piece of mutton and swiftly conveys it to the plate where it instantly attaches itself to the mutton already there Soon one of the plates furnished with a complete slice of mutton and two potatoes was handed up to the presiding gentleman who quietly replaced the slice on the joint and the potatoes in the dish Their conversation was if possible more bewildering than their mode of dining It began by the youngest girl suddenly and without provocation addressing her eldest sister Oh you wicked story teller she said I expected a sharp reply from the sister but instead of this she turned laughingly to her father and said in a very loud stage whisper To be a bride The father in order to do his part in a conversation that seemed only fit for lunatics replied Whisper it to me dear But she didn t whisper these children never did anything they were told she said quite loud Of course not Everybody knows what Dotty wants And little Dolly shrugged her shoulders and said with a pretty pettishness Now Father you re not to tease You know I don t want to be bride s maid to anybody And Dolly s to be the fourth was her father s idiotic reply Here Number Three put in her oar Oh it is settled Mother dear really and truly Mary told us all about it It s to be next Tuesday four weeks and three of her cousins are coming to be bride s maids and She doesn t forget it Minnie the Mother laughingly replied I do wish they d get it settled I don t like long engagements And Minnie wound up the conversation if so chaotic a series of remarks deserves the name with Only think We passed the Cedars this morning just exactly as Mary Davenant was standing at the gate wishing good bye to Mister I forget his name Of course we looked the other way By this time I was so hopelessly confused that I gave up listening and followed the dinner down into the kitchen But to you O hypercritical reader resolute to believe no item of this weird adventure what need to tell how the mutton was placed on the spit and slowly unroasted how the potatoes were wrapped in their skins and handed over to the gardener to be buried how when the mutton had at length attained to rawness the fire which had gradually changed from red heat to a mere blaze died down so suddenly that the cook had only just time to catch its last flicker on the end of a match or how the maid having taken the mutton off the spit carried it backwards of course out of the house to meet the butcher who was coming also backwards down the road 
3825_134160_000040_000000	train-clean-360	The longer I thought over this strange adventure the more hopelessly tangled the mystery became and it was a real relief to meet Arthur in the road and get him to go with me up to the Hall to learn what news the telegraph had brought 
3825_134160_000040_000001	train-clean-360	I told him as we went what had happened at the Station but as to my further adventures I thought it best for the present to say nothing 
none	none	The Earl was sitting alone when we entered I am glad you are come in to keep me company he said
3825_134160_000041_000002	train-clean-360	 Muriel is gone to bed the excitement of that terrible scene was too much for her and Eric has gone to the hotel to pack his things to start for London by the early train 
none	none	Then the telegram has come I said
3825_134160_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 Did you not hear 
3825_134160_000043_000001	train-clean-360	Oh I had forgotten it came in after you left the Station 
3825_134160_000043_000002	train-clean-360	Yes it s all right Eric has got his commission and now that he has arranged matters with Muriel he has business in town that must be seen to at once 
none	none	What arrangement do you mean I asked with a sinking heart as the thought of Arthur s crushed hopes came to my mind
3825_134160_000044_000001	train-clean-360	 Do you mean that they are engaged 
none	none	They have been engaged in a sense for two years the old man gently replied that is he has had my promise to consent to it so soon as he could secure a permanent and settled line in life 
3825_134160_000045_000001	train-clean-360	I could never be happy with my child married to a man without an object to live for without even an object to die for 
3825_134160_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 I hope they will be happy a strange voice said 
none	none	The speaker was evidently in the room but I had not heard the door open and I looked round in some astonishment The Earl seemed to share my surprise
3825_134160_000046_000003	train-clean-360	 Who spoke he exclaimed 
none	none	It was I said Arthur looking at us with a worn haggard face and eyes from which the light of life seemed suddenly to have faded And let me wish you joy also dear friend he added looking sadly at the Earl and speaking in the same hollow tones that had startled us so much
3825_134160_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 Thank you the old man said simply and heartily 
3825_134160_000049_000000	train-clean-360	A silence followed then I rose feeling sure that Arthur would wish to be alone and bade our gentle host Good night Arthur took his hand but said nothing nor did he speak again as we went home till we were in the house and had lit our bed room candles 
none	none	Then he said more to himself than to me The heart knoweth its own bitterness 
3825_134160_000049_000002	train-clean-360	I never understood those words till now 
3825_134160_000050_000000	train-clean-360	The next few days passed wearily enough 
3825_134160_000050_000001	train-clean-360	I felt no inclination to call by myself at the Hall still less to propose that Arthur should go with me it seemed better to wait till Time that gentle healer of our bitterest sorrows should have helped him to recover from the first shock of the disappointment that had blighted his life 
none	none	Business however soon demanded my presence in town and I had to announce to Arthur that I must leave him for a while
3825_134160_000051_000001	train-clean-360	 But I hope to run down again in a month I added 
3825_134160_000051_000002	train-clean-360	 I would stay now if I could 
none	none	I don t think it s good for you to be alone No I ca n t face solitude here for long said Arthur
3825_134160_000052_000001	train-clean-360	 But don t think about me 
3825_134160_000052_000002	train-clean-360	I have made up my mind to accept a post in India that has been offered me 
none	none	Out there I suppose I shall find something to live for I ca n t see anything at present
3825_134160_000052_000004	train-clean-360	 This life of mine I guard as God s high gift from scathe and wrong Not greatly care to lose 
none	none	Yes I said your name sake bore as heavy a blow and lived through it A far heavier one than mine said Arthur The woman he loved proved false There is no such cloud as that on my memory of of He left the name unuttered and went on hurriedly
3825_134160_000054_000003	train-clean-360	 But you will return will you not 
none	none	Yes I shall come back for a short time
3825_134160_000056_000000	train-clean-360	 Do said Arthur and you shall write and tell me of our friends 
none	none	I ll send you my address when I m settled down CHAPTER twenty four THE FROGS BIRTHDAY TREAT And so it came to pass that just a week after the day when my Fairy friends first appeared as Children I found myself taking a farewell stroll through the wood in the hope of meeting them once more I had but to stretch myself on the smooth turf and the eerie feeling was on me in a moment Put oor ear welly low down said Bruno and I ll tell oo a secret It s the Frogs Birthday Treat and we ve lost the Baby What Baby I said quite bewildered by this complicated piece of news The Queen s Baby a course said Bruno Titania s Baby And we s welly sorry Sylvie she s oh so sorry How sorry is she I asked mischievously Three quarters of a yard Bruno replied with perfect solemnity And I m a little sorry too he added shutting his eyes so as not to see that he was smiling And what are you doing about the Baby Well the soldiers are all looking for it up and down everywhere The soldiers I exclaimed Yes a course said Bruno When there s no fighting to be done the soldiers doos any little odd jobs oo know I was amused at the idea of its being a little odd job to find the Royal Baby But how did you come to lose it I asked We put it in a flower Sylvie who had just joined us explained with her eyes full of tears Only we ca n t remember which She says us put it in a flower Bruno interrupted cause she doosn t want I to get punished But it were really me what put it there Sylvie were picking Dindledums You shouldn t say us put it in a flower Sylvie very gravely remarked Well hus then said Bruno I never can remember those horrid H s Let me help you to look for it I said So Sylvie and I made a voyage of discovery among all the flowers but there was no Baby to be seen What s become of Bruno I said when we had completed our tour He s down in the ditch there said Sylvie amusing a young Frog I went down on my hands and knees to look for him for I felt very curious to know how young Frogs ought to be amused After a minute s search I found him sitting at the edge of the ditch by the side of the little Frog and looking rather disconsolate How are you getting on Bruno I said nodding to him as he looked up Ca n t amuse it no more Bruno answered very dolefully cause it won t say what it would like to do next I ve showed it all the duck weeds and a live caddis worm but it won t say nuffin What would oo like he shouted into the ear of the Frog but the little creature sat quite still and took no notice of him It s deaf I think Bruno said turning away with a sigh And it s time to get the Theatre ready Who are the audience to be Only but Frogs said Bruno But they haven t comed yet They wants to be drove up like sheep Would it save time I suggested if I were to walk round with Sylvie to drive up the Frogs while you get the Theatre ready That are a good plan cried Bruno But where are Sylvie I m here said Sylvie peeping over the edge of the bank I was just watching two Frogs that were having a race Which won it Bruno eagerly inquired Sylvie was puzzled He does ask such hard questions she confided to me And what s to happen in the Theatre I asked First they have their Birthday Feast Sylvie said then Bruno does some Bits of Shakespeare then he tells them a Story I should think the Frogs like the Feast best Don t they Well there s generally very few of them that get any They will keep their mouths shut so tight And it s just as well they do she added because Bruno likes to cook it himself and he cooks very queerly Now they re all in Would you just help me to put them with their heads the right way We soon managed this part of the business though the Frogs kept up a most discontented croaking all the time What are they saying I asked Sylvie They re saying Fork Fork It s very silly of them You re not going to have forks she announced with some severity Those that want any Feast have just got to open their mouths and Bruno ll put some of it in At this moment Bruno appeared wearing a little white apron to show that he was a Cook and carrying a tureen full of very queer looking soup I watched very carefully as he moved about among the Frogs but I could not see that any of them opened their mouths to be fed except one very young one and I m nearly sure it did it accidentally in yawning However Bruno instantly put a large spoonful of soup into its mouth and the poor little thing coughed violently for some time So Sylvie and I had to share the soup between us and to pretend to enjoy it for it certainly was very queerly cooked I only ventured to take one spoonful of it Sylvie s Summer Soup Bruno said it was and must candidly confess that it was not at all nice and I could not feel surprised that so many of the guests had kept their mouths shut up tight What s the soup made of Bruno said Sylvie who had put a spoonful of it to her lips and was making a wry face over it And Bruno s answer was anything but encouraging Bits of things The entertainment was to conclude with Bits of Shakespeare as Sylvie expressed it which were all to be done by Bruno Sylvie being fully engaged in making the Frogs keep their heads towards the stage after which Bruno was to appear in his real character and tell them a Story of his own invention Will the Story have a Moral to it I asked Sylvie while Bruno was away behind the hedge dressing for the first Bit I think so Sylvie replied doubtfully There generally is a Moral only he puts it in too soon And will he say all the Bits of Shakespeare No he ll only act them said Sylvie He knows hardly any of the words When I see what he s dressed like I ve to tell the Frogs what character it is They re always in such a hurry to guess Don t you hear them all saying What What And so indeed they were it had only sounded like croaking till Sylvie explained it but I could now make out the Wawt Wawt quite distinctly But why do they try to guess it before they see it I don t know Sylvie said but they always do Sometimes they begin guessing weeks and weeks before the day So now when you hear the Frogs croaking in a particularly melancholy way you may be sure they re trying to guess Bruno s next Shakespeare Bit Isn t that interesting However the chorus of guessing was cut short by Bruno who suddenly rushed on from behind the scenes and took a flying leap down among the Frogs to re arrange them For the oldest and fattest Frog who had never been properly arranged so that he could see the stage and so had no idea what was going on was getting restless and had upset several of the Frogs and turned others round with their heads the wrong way And it was no good at all Bruno said to do a Bit of Shakespeare when there was nobody to look at it you see he didn t count me as anybody So he set to work with a stick stirring them up very much as you would stir up tea in a cup till most of them had at least one great stupid eye gazing at the stage Oo must come and sit among them Sylvie he said in despair I ve put these two side by side with their noses the same way ever so many times but they do squarrel so So Sylvie took her place as Mistress of the Ceremonies and Bruno vanished again behind the scenes to dress for the first Bit Hamlet was suddenly proclaimed in the clear sweet tones I knew so well The croaking all ceased in a moment and I turned to the stage in some curiosity to see what Bruno s ideas were as to the behaviour of Shakespeare s greatest Character According to this eminent interpreter of the Drama Hamlet wore a short black cloak which he chiefly used for muffling up his face as if he suffered a good deal from toothache and turned out his toes very much as he walked To be or not to be Hamlet remarked in a cheerful tone and then turned head over heels several times his cloak dropping off in the performance I felt a little disappointed Bruno s conception of the part seemed so wanting in dignity Won t he say any more of the speech I whispered to Sylvie I think not Sylvie whispered in reply He generally turns head over heels when he doesn t know any more words Bruno had meanwhile settled the question by disappearing from the stage and the Frogs instantly began inquiring the name of the next Character You ll know directly cried Sylvie as she adjusted two or three young Frogs that had struggled round with their backs to the stage Macbeth she added as Bruno re appeared Macbeth had something twisted round him that went over one shoulder and under the other arm and was meant I believe for a Scotch plaid He had a thorn in his hand which he held out at arm s length as if he were a little afraid of it Is this a dagger Macbeth inquired in a puzzled sort of tone and instantly a chorus of Thorn Thorn arose from the Frogs I had quite learned to understand their croaking by this time It s a dagger Sylvie proclaimed in a peremptory tone Hold your tongues And the croaking ceased at once Shakespeare has not told us so far as I know that Macbeth had any such eccentric habit as turning head over heels in private life but Bruno evidently considered it quite an essential part of the character and left the stage in a series of somersaults However he was back again in a few moments having tucked under his chin the end of a tuft of wool probably left on the thorn by a wandering sheep which made a magnificent beard that reached nearly down to his feet Shylock Sylvie proclaimed No I beg your pardon she hastily corrected herself King Lear I hadn t noticed the crown Bruno had very cleverly provided one which fitted him exactly by cutting out the centre of a dandelion to make room for his head King Lear folded his arms to the imminent peril of his beard and said in a mild explanatory tone Ay every inch a king and then paused as if to consider how this could best be proved And here with all possible deference to Bruno as a Shakespearian critic I must express my opinion that the poet did not mean his three great tragic heroes to be so strangely alike in their personal habits nor do I believe that he would have accepted the faculty of turning head over heels as any proof at all of royal descent Yet it appeared that King Lear after deep meditation could think of no other argument by which to prove his kingship and as this was the last of the Bits of Shakespeare We never do more than three Sylvie explained in a whisper Bruno gave the audience quite a long series of somersaults before he finally retired leaving the enraptured Frogs all crying out More More which I suppose was their way of encoring a performance But Bruno wouldn t appear again till the proper time came for telling the Story When he appeared at last in his real character I noticed a remarkable change in his behaviour He tried no more somersaults It was clearly his opinion that however suitable the habit of turning head over heels might be to such petty individuals as Hamlet and King Lear it would never do for Bruno to sacrifice his dignity to such an extent But it was equally clear that he did not feel entirely at his ease standing all alone on the stage with no costume to disguise him and though he began several times There were a Mouse he kept glancing up and down and on all sides as if in search of more comfortable quarters from which to tell the Story Standing on one side of the stage and partly overshadowing it was a tall foxglove which seemed as the evening breeze gently swayed it hither and thither to offer exactly the sort of accommodation that the orator desired Having once decided on his quarters it needed only a second or two for him to run up the stem like a tiny squirrel and to seat himself astride on the topmost bend where the fairy bells clustered most closely and from whence he could look down on his audience from such a height that all shyness vanished and he began his Story merrily Once there were a Mouse and a Crocodile and a Man and a Goat and a Lion I had never heard the dramatis personae tumbled into a story with such profusion and in such reckless haste and it fairly took my breath away Even Sylvie gave a little gasp and allowed three of the Frogs who seemed to be getting tired of the entertainment to hop away into the ditch without attempting to stop them And the Mouse found a Shoe and it thought it were a Mouse trap So it got right in and it stayed in ever so long Why did it stay in said Sylvie Her function seemed to be much the same as that of the Chorus in a Greek Play she had to encourage the orator and draw him out by a series of intelligent questions Cause it thought it couldn t get out again Bruno explained It were a clever mouse It knew it couldn t get out of traps But why did it go in at all said Sylvie and it jamp and it jamp Bruno proceeded ignoring this question and at last it got right out again And it looked at the mark in the Shoe And the Man s name were in it So it knew it wasn t its own Shoe Had it thought it was said Sylvie Why didn t I tell oo it thought it were a Mouse trap the indignant orator replied Please Mister Sir will oo make Sylvie attend Sylvie was silenced and was all attention in fact she and I were most of the audience now as the Frogs kept hopping away and there were very few of them left So the Mouse gave the Man his Shoe And the Man were welly glad cause he hadn t got but one Shoe and he were hopping to get the other Here I ventured on a question Do you mean hopping or hoping Bofe said Bruno And the Man took the Goat out of the Sack We haven t heard of the sack before I said Nor you won t hear of it again said Bruno And he said to the Goat Oo will walk about here till I comes back And he went and he tumbled into a deep hole And the Goat walked round and round And it walked under the Tree And it wug its tail And it looked up in the Tree And it sang a sad little Song Oo never heard such a sad little Song Can you sing it Bruno I asked Iss I can Bruno readily replied And I sa n t It would make Sylvie cry It wouldn t Sylvie interrupted in great indignation And I don t believe the Goat sang it at all It did though said Bruno It singed it right froo I sawed it singing with its long beard It couldn t sing with its beard I said hoping to puzzle the little fellow a beard isn t a voice Well then oo couldn t walk with Sylvie Bruno cried triumphantly Sylvie isn t a foot I thought I had better follow Sylvie s example and be silent for a while Bruno was too sharp for us And when it had singed all the Song it ran away for to get along to look for the Man oo know And the Crocodile got along after it for to bite it oo know And the Mouse got along after the Crocodile Wasn t the Crocodile running Sylvie enquired She appealed to me Crocodiles do run don t they I suggested crawling as the proper word He wasn t running said Bruno and he wasn t crawling He went struggling along like a portmanteau And he held his chin ever so high in the air What did he do that for said Sylvie cause he hadn t got a toofache said Bruno Ca n t oo make out nuffin wizout I splain it Why if he d had a toofache a course he d have held his head down like this and he d have put a lot of warm blankets round it If he d had any blankets Sylvie argued Course he had blankets retorted her brother Doos oo think Crocodiles goes walks wizout blankets And he frowned with his eyebrows And the Goat was welly flightened at his eyebrows I d never be afraid of eyebrows exclaimed Sylvie I should think oo would though if they d got a Crocodile fastened to them like these had And so the Man jamp and he jamp and at last he got right out of the hole Sylvie gave another little gasp this rapid dodging about among the characters of the Story had taken away her breath And he runned away for to look for the Goat oo know And he heard the Lion grunting Lions don t grunt said Sylvie This one did said Bruno And its mouth were like a large cupboard And it had plenty of room in its mouth And the Lion runned after the Man for to eat him oo know And the Mouse runned after the Lion But the Mouse was running after the Crocodile I said he couldn t run after both Bruno sighed over the density of his audience but explained very patiently He did runned after bofe cause they went the same way And first he caught the Crocodile and then he didn t catch the Lion And when he d caught the Crocodile what doos oo think he did cause he d got pincers in his pocket I ca n t guess said Sylvie Nobody couldn t guess it Bruno cried in high glee Why he wrenched out that Crocodile s toof Which tooth I ventured to ask But Bruno was not to be puzzled The toof he were going to bite the Goat with a course He couldn t be sure about that I argued unless he wrenched out all its teeth Bruno laughed merrily and half sang as he swung himself backwards and forwards He did wrenched out all its teef Why did the Crocodile wait to have them wrenched out said Sylvie It had to wait said Bruno I ventured on another question But what became of the Man who said You may wait here till I come back He didn t say Oo may Bruno explained He said Oo will Just like Sylvie says to me Oo will do oor lessons till twelve o clock Oh I wiss he added with a little sigh I wiss Sylvie would say Oo may do oor lessons This was a dangerous subject for discussion Sylvie seemed to think She returned to the Story But what became of the Man Well the Lion springed at him But it came so slow it were three weeks in the air Did the Man wait for it all that time I said Course he didn t Bruno replied gliding head first down the stem of the fox glove for the Story was evidently close to its end He sold his house and he packed up his things while the Lion were coming And he went and he lived in another town So the Lion ate the wrong man This was evidently the Moral so Sylvie made her final proclamation to the Frogs The Story s finished And whatever is to be learned from it she added aside to me I m sure I don t know I did not feel quite clear about it myself so made no suggestion but the Frogs seemed quite content Moral or no Moral and merely raised a husky chorus of Off Off as they hopped away CHAPTER twenty five LOOKING EASTWARD It s just a week I said three days later to Arthur since we heard of Lady Muriel s engagement I think I ought to call at any rate and offer my congratulations Won t you come with me A pained expression passed over his face When must you leave us he asked By the first train on Monday Well yes I will come with you It would seem strange and unfriendly if I didn t But this is only Friday Give me till Sunday afternoon I shall be stronger then Shading his eyes with one hand as if half ashamed of the tears that were coursing down his cheeks he held the other out to me It trembled as I clasped it I tried to frame some words of sympathy but they seemed poor and cold and I left them unspoken Good night was all I said Good night dear friend he replied There was a manly vigour in his tone that convinced me he was wrestling with and triumphing over the great sorrow that had so nearly wrecked his life and that on the stepping stone of his dead self he would surely rise to higher things There was no chance I was glad to think as we set out on Sunday afternoon of meeting Eric at the Hall as he had returned to town the day after his engagement was announced His presence might have disturbed the calm the almost unnatural calm with which Arthur met the woman who had won his heart and murmured the few graceful words of sympathy that the occasion demanded Lady Muriel was perfectly radiant with happiness sadness could not live in the light of such a smile and even Arthur brightened under it and when she remarked You see I m watering my flowers though it is the Sabbath Day his voice had almost its old ring of cheerfulness as he replied Even on the Sabbath Day works of mercy are allowed But this isn t the Sabbath Day The Sabbath day has ceased to exist I know it s not Saturday Lady Muriel replied but isn t Sunday often called the Christian Sabbath It is so called I think in recognition of the spirit of the Jewish institution that one day in seven should be a day of rest But I hold that Christians are freed from the literal observance of the Fourth Commandment Then where is our authority for Sunday observance We have first the fact that the seventh day was sanctified when God rested from the work of Creation That is binding on us as Theists Secondly we have the fact that the Lord s Day is a Christian institution That is binding on us as Christians And your practical rules would be First as Theists to keep it holy in some special way and to make it so far as is reasonably possible a day of rest Secondly as Christians to attend public worship And what of amusements I would say of them as of all kinds of work whatever is innocent on a week day is innocent on Sunday provided it does not interfere with the duties of the day Then you would allow children to play on Sunday Certainly I should Why make the day irksome to their restless natures I have a letter somewhere said Lady Muriel from an old friend describing the way in which Sunday was kept in her younger days I will fetch it for you I had a similar description viva voce years ago Arthur said when she had left us from a little girl It was really touching to hear the melancholy tone in which she said On Sunday I mustn t play with my doll On Sunday I mustn t run on the sands On Sunday I mustn t dig in the garden Poor child She had indeed abundant cause for hating Sunday Here is the letter said Lady Muriel returning Let me read you a piece of it When as a child I first opened my eyes on a Sunday morning a feeling of dismal anticipation which began at least on the Friday culminated I knew what was before me and my wish if not my word was Would God it were evening It was no day of rest but a day of texts of catechisms Watts of tracts about converted swearers godly charwomen and edifying deaths of sinners saved Up with the lark hymns and portions of Scripture had to be learned by heart till eight o clock when there were family prayers then breakfast which I was never able to enjoy partly from the fast already undergone and partly from the outlook I dreaded At nine came Sunday School and it made me indignant to be put into the class with the village children as well as alarmed lest by some mistake of mine I should be put below them The Church Service was a veritable Wilderness of Zin I wandered in it pitching the tabernacle of my thoughts on the lining of the square family pew the fidgets of my small brothers and the horror of knowing that on the Monday I should have to write out from memory jottings of the rambling disconnected extempore sermon which might have had any text but its own and to stand or fall by the result This was followed by a cold dinner at one servants to have no work Sunday School again from two to four and Evening Service at six The intervals were perhaps the greatest trial of all from the efforts I had to make to be less than usually sinful by reading books and sermons as barren as the Dead Sea There was but one rosy spot in the distance all that day and that was bed time which never could come too early Such teaching was well meant no doubt said Arthur but it must have driven many of its victims into deserting the Church Services altogether I m afraid I was a deserter this morning she gravely said I had to write to Eric Would you would you mind my telling you something he said about prayer It had never struck me in that light before In what light said Arthur Why that all Nature goes by fixed regular laws Science has proved that So that asking God to do anything except of course praying for spiritual blessings is to expect a miracle and we ve no right to do that I ve not put it as well as he did but that was the outcome of it and it has confused me Please tell me what you can say in answer to it I don t propose to discuss Captain Lindon s difficulties Arthur gravely replied specially as he is not present But if it is your difficulty his voice unconsciously took a tenderer tone then I will speak It is my difficulty she said anxiously Then I will begin by asking Why did you except spiritual blessings Is not your mind a part of Nature Yes but Free Will comes in there I can choose this or that and God can influence my choice Then you are not a Fatalist Oh no she earnestly exclaimed Thank God Arthur said to himself but in so low a whisper that only I heard it You grant then that I can by an act of free choice move this cup suiting the action to the word this way or that way Yes I grant it Well let us see how far the result is produced by fixed laws The cup moves because certain mechanical forces are impressed on it by my hand My hand moves because certain forces electric magnetic or whatever nerve force may prove to be are impressed on it by my brain This nerve force stored in the brain would probably be traceable if Science were complete to chemical forces supplied to the brain by the blood and ultimately derived from the food I eat and the air I breathe But would not that be Fatalism Where would Free Will come in In choice of nerves replied Arthur The nerve force in the brain may flow just as naturally down one nerve as down another We need something more than a fixed Law of Nature to settle which nerve shall carry it That something is Free Will Her eyes sparkled I see what you mean she exclaimed Human Free Will is an exception to the system of fixed Law Eric said something like that And then I think he pointed out that God can only influence Nature by influencing Human Wills So that we might reasonably pray give us this day our daily bread because many of the causes that produce bread are under Man s control But to pray for rain or fine weather would be as unreasonable as she checked herself as if fearful of saying something irreverent In a hushed low tone that trembled with emotion and with the solemnity of one in the presence of death Arthur slowly replied Shalt he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct him Shall we the swarm that in the noontide beam were born feeling in ourselves the power to direct this way or that the forces of Nature of Nature of which we form so trivial a part shall we in our boundless arrogance in our pitiful conceit deny that power to the Ancient of Days Saying to our Creator Thus far and no further Thou madest but thou canst not rule Lady Muriel had covered her face in her hands and did not look up She only murmured Thanks thanks again and again We rose to go Arthur said with evident effort One word more If you would know the power of Prayer in anything and everything that Man can need try it Ask and it shall be given you I have tried it I know that God answers prayer Our walk home was a silent one till we had nearly reached the lodgings then Arthur murmured and it was almost an echo of my own thoughts What knowest thou O wife whether thou shalt save thy husband The subject was not touched on again We sat on talking while hour after hour of this our last night together glided away unnoticed He had much to tell me about India and the new life he was going to and the work he hoped to do And his great generous soul seemed so filled with noble ambition as to have no space left for any vain regret or selfish repining Come it is nearly morning Arthur said at last rising and leading the way upstairs The sun will be rising in a few minutes and though I have basely defrauded you of your last chance of a night s rest here I m sure you ll forgive me for I really couldn t bring myself to say Good night sooner And God knows whether you ll ever see me again or hear of me Hear of you I am certain I shall I warmly responded and quoted the concluding lines of that strange poem Waring Oh never star Was lost here but it rose afar Look East where whole new thousands are In Vishnu land what Avatar Aye look Eastward Arthur eagerly replied pausing at the stair case window which commanded a fine view of the sea and the eastward horizon The West is the fitting tomb for all the sorrow and the sighing all the errors and the follies of the Past for all its withered Hopes and all its buried Loves From the East comes new strength new ambition new Hope new Life new Love Look Eastward Aye look Eastward His last words were still ringing in my ears as I entered my room and undrew the window curtains just in time to see the sun burst in glory from his ocean prison and clothe the world in the light of a new day So may it be for him and me and all of us I mused All that is evil and dead and hopeless fading with the Night that is past All that is good and living and hopeful rising with the dawn of Day Fading with the Night the chilly mists and the noxious vapours and the heavy shadows and the wailing gusts and the owl s melancholy hootings rising with the Day the darting shafts of light and the wholesome morning breeze and the warmth of a dawning life and the mad music of the lark Look Eastward Fading with the Night the clouds of ignorance and the deadly blight of sin and the silent tears of sorrow and ever rising higher higher with the Day the radiant dawn of knowledge and the sweet breath of purity and the throb of a world s ecstasy Look Eastward Fading with the Night the memory of a dead love and the withered leaves of a blighted hope and the sickly repinings and moody regrets that numb the best energies of the soul and rising broadening rolling upward like a living flood the manly resolve and the dauntless will and the heavenward gaze of faith the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen Look Eastward Aye look Eastward PREFACE One little picture in this book the Magic Locket at p seventy seven was drawn by Miss Alice Havers I did not state this on the title page since it seemed only due to the artist of all these to my mind wonderful pictures that his name should stand there alone The descriptions at pp three hundred eighty six three hundred eighty seven of Sunday as spent by children of the last generation are quoted verbatim from a speech made to me by a child friend and a letter written to me by a lady friend The Chapters headed Fairy Sylvie and Bruno s Revenge are a reprint with a few alterations of a little fairy tale which I wrote in the year eighteen sixty seven at the request of the late missus Gatty for Aunt Judy s Magazine which she was then editing It was in eighteen seventy four I believe that the idea first occurred to me of making it the nucleus of a longer story As the years went on I jotted down at odd moments all sorts of odd ideas and fragments of dialogue that occurred to me who knows how with a transitory suddenness that left me no choice but either to record them then and there or to abandon them to oblivion Sometimes one could trace to their source these random flashes of thought as being suggested by the book one was reading or struck out from the flint of one s own mind by the steel of a friend s chance remark but they had also a way of their own of occurring a propos of nothing specimens of that hopelessly illogical phenomenon an effect without a cause Such for example was the last line of The Hunting of the Snark which came into my head as I have already related in The Theatre for April eighteen eighty seven quite suddenly during a solitary walk and such again have been passages which occurred in dreams and which I cannot trace to any antecedent cause whatever There are at least two instances of such dream suggestions in this book one my Lady s remark it often runs in families just as a love for pastry does at p eighty eight the other Eric Lindon s badinage about having been in domestic service at p three hundred thirty two And thus it came to pass that I found myself at last in possession of a huge unwieldy mass of litterature if the reader will kindly excuse the spelling which only needed stringing together upon the thread of a consecutive story to constitute the book I hoped to write Only The task at first seemed absolutely hopeless and gave me a far clearer idea than I ever had before of the meaning of the word chaos and I think it must have been ten years or more before I had succeeded in classifying these odds and ends sufficiently to see what sort of a story they indicated for the story had to grow out of the incidents not the incidents out of the story I am telling all this in no spirit of egoism but because I really believe that some of my readers will be interested in these details of the genesis of a book which looks so simple and straight forward a matter when completed that they might suppose it to have been written straight off page by page as one would write a letter beginning at the beginning and ending at the end It is no doubt possible to write a story in that way and if it be not vanity to say so I believe that I could myself if I were in the unfortunate position for I do hold it to be a real misfortune of being obliged to produce a given amount of fiction in a given time that I could fulfil my task and produce my tale of bricks as other slaves have done One thing at any rate I could guarantee as to the story so produced that it should be utterly commonplace should contain no new ideas whatever and should be very very weary reading This species of literature has received the very appropriate name of padding which might fitly be defined as that which all can write and none can read That the present volume contains no such writing I dare not avow sometimes in order to bring a picture into its proper place it has been necessary to eke out a page with two or three extra lines but I can honestly say I have put in no more than I was absolutely compelled to do My readers may perhaps like to amuse themselves by trying to detect in a given passage the one piece of padding it contains While arranging the slips into pages I found that the passage whichnow extends from the top of p thirty five to the middle of p thirty eight was three lines too short I supplied the deficiency not by interpolating a word here and a word there but by writing in three consecutive lines Now can my readers guess which they are A harder puzzle if a harder be desired would be to determine as to the Gardener s Song in which cases if any the stanza was adapted to the surrounding text and in which if any the text was adapted to the stanza Perhaps the hardest thing in all literature at least I have found it so by no voluntary effort can I accomplish it I have to take it as it come s is to write anything original And perhaps the easiest is when once an original line has been struck out to follow it up and to write any amount more to the same tune I do not know if Alice in Wonderland was an original story I was at least no conscious imitator in writing it but I do know that since it came out something like a dozen story books have appeared on identically the same pattern The path I timidly explored believing myself to be the first that ever burst into that silent sea is now a beaten high road all the way side flowers have long ago been trampled into the dust and it would be courting disaster for me to attempt that style again Hence it is that in Sylvie and Bruno I have striven with I know not what success to strike out yet another new path be it bad or good it is the best I can do It is written not for money and not for fame but in the hope of supplying for the children whom I love some thoughts that may suit those hours of innocent merriment which are the very life of Childhood and also in the hope of suggesting to them and to others some thoughts that may prove I would fain hope not wholly out of harmony with the graver cadences of Life If I have not already exhausted the patience of my readers I would like to seize this opportunity perhaps the last I shall have of addressing so many friends at once of putting on record some ideas that have occurred to me as to books desirable to be written which I should much like to attempt but may not ever have the time or power to carry through in the hope that if I should fail and the years are gliding away very fast to finish the task I have set myself other hands may take it up First a Child s Bible The only real essentials of this would be carefully selected passages suitable for a child s reading and pictures One principle of selection which I would adopt would be that Religion should be put before a child as a revelation of love no need to pain and puzzle the young mind with the history of crime and punishment On such a principle I should for example omit the history of the Flood The supplying of the pictures would involve no great difficulty no new ones would be needed hundreds of excellent pictures already exist the copyright of which has long ago expired and which simply need photo zincography or some similar process for their successful reproduction The book should be handy in size with a pretty attractive looking cover in a clear legible type and above all with abundance of pictures pictures pictures Secondly a book of pieces selected from the Bible not single texts but passages of from ten to twenty verses each to be committed to memory Such passages would be found useful to repeat to one s self and to ponder over on many occasions when reading is difficult if not impossible for instance when lying awake at night on a railway journey when taking a solitary walk in old age when eye sight is failing of wholly lost and best of all when illness while incapacitating us for reading or any other occupation condemns us to lie awake through many weary silent hours at such a time how keenly one may realise the truth of David s rapturous cry O how sweet are thy words unto my throat yea sweeter than honey unto my mouth I have said passages rather than single texts because we have no means of recalling single texts memory needs links and here are none one may have a hundred texts stored in the memory and not be able to recall at will more than half a dozen and those by mere chance whereas once get hold of any portion of a chapter that has been committed to memory and the whole can be recovered all hangs together Thirdly a collection of passages both prose and verse from books other than the Bible There is not perhaps much in what is called un inspired literature a misnomer I hold if Shakespeare was not inspired one may well doubt if any man ever was that will bear the process of being pondered over a hundred times still there are such passages enough I think to make a goodly store for the memory These two books of sacred and secular passages for memory will serve other good purposes besides merely occupying vacant hours they will help to keep at bay many anxious thoughts worrying thoughts uncharitable thoughts unholy thoughts Let me say this in better words than my own by copying a passage from that most interesting book Robertson s Lectures on the Epistles to the Corinthians Lecture XLIX If a man finds himself haunted by evil desires and unholy images which will generally be at periodical hours let him commit to memory passages of Scripture or passages from the best writers in verse or prose Let him store his mind with these as safeguards to repeat when he lies awake in some restless night or when despairing imaginations or gloomy suicidal thoughts beset him Let these be to him the sword turning everywhere to keep the way of the Garden of Life from the intrusion of profaner footsteps Fourthly a Shakespeare for girls that is an edition in which everything not suitable for the perusal of girls of say from ten to seventeen should be omitted Few children under ten would be likely to understand or enjoy the greatest of poets and those who have passed out of girlhood may safely be left to read Shakespeare in any edition expurgated or not that they may prefer but it seems a pity that so many children in the intermediate stage should be debarred from a great pleasure for want of an edition suitable to them Neither Bowdler s Chambers s Brandram s nor Cundell s Boudoir Shakespeare seems to me to meet the want they are not sufficiently expurgated Bowdler s is the most extraordinary of all looking through it I am filled with a deep sense of wonder considering what he has left in that he should have cut anything out Besides relentlessly erasing all that is unsuitable on the score of reverence or decency I should be inclined to omit also all that seems too difficult or not likely to interest young readers The resulting book might be slightly fragmentary but it would be a real treasure to all British maidens who have any taste for poetry If it be needful to apologize to any one for the new departure I have taken in this story by introducing along with what will I hope prove to be acceptable nonsense for children some of the graver thoughts of human life it must be to one who has learned the Art of keeping such thoughts wholly at a distance in hours of mirth and careless ease To him such a mixture will seem no doubt ill judged and repulsive And that such an Art exists I do not dispute with youth good health and sufficient money it seems quite possible to lead for years together a life of unmixed gaiety with the exception of one solemn fact with which we are liable to be confronted at any moment even in the midst of the most brilliant company or the most sparkling entertainment A man may fix his own times for admitting serious thought for attending public worship for prayer for reading the Bible all such matters he can defer to that convenient season which is so apt never to occur at all but he cannot defer for one single moment the necessity of attending to a message which may come before he has finished reading this page this night shalt thy soul be required of thee The ever present sense of this grim possibility has been in all ages Note At the moment when I had written these words there was a knock at the door and a telegram was brought me announcing the sudden death of a dear friend an incubus that men have striven to shake off Few more interesting subjects of enquiry could be found by a student of history than the various weapons that have been used against this shadowy foe Saddest of all must have been the thoughts of those who saw indeed an existence beyond the grave but an existence far more terrible than annihilation an existence as filmy impalpable all but invisible spectres drifting about through endless ages in a world of shadows with nothing to do nothing to hope for nothing to love In the midst of the gay verses of that genial bon vivant Horace there stands one dreary word whose utter sadness goes to one s heart It is the word exilium in the well known passage Omnes eodem cogimur omnium Versatur urna serius ocius Sors exitura et nos in aeternum Exilium impositura cymbae Yes to him this present life spite of all its weariness and all its sorrow was the only life worth having all else was exile Does it not seem almost incredible that one holding such a creed should ever have smiled And many in this day I fear even though believing in an existence beyond the grave far more real than Horace ever dreamed of yet regard it as a sort of exile from all the joys of life and so adopt Horace s theory and say let us eat and drink for to morrow we die We go to entertainments such as the theatre I say we for I also go to the play whenever I get a chance of seeing a really good one and keep at arm s length if possible the thought that we may not return alive Yet how do you know dear friend whose patience has carried you through this garrulous preface that it may not be your lot when mirth is fastest and most furious to feel the sharp pang or the deadly faintness which heralds the final crisis to see with vague wonder anxious friends bending over you to hear their troubled whispers perhaps yourself to shape the question with trembling lips Is it serious and to be told Yes the end is near and oh how different all Life will look when those words are said how do you know I say that all this may not happen to you this night And dare you knowing this say to yourself Well perhaps it is an immoral play perhaps the situations are a little too risky the dialogue a little too strong the business a little too suggestive I don t say that conscience is quite easy but the piece is so clever I must see it this once I ll begin a stricter life to morrow To morrow and to morrow and tomorrow Who sins in hope who sinning says Sorrow for sin God s judgement stays Against God s Spirit he lies quite stops Mercy with insult dares and drops Like a scorch d fly that spins in vain Upon the axis of its pain Then takes its doom to limp and crawl Blind and forgot from fall to fall Let me pause for a moment to say that I believe this thought of the possibility of death if calmly realised and steadily faced would be one of the best possible tests as to our going to any scene of amusement being right or wrong If the thought of sudden death acquires for you a special horror when imagined as happening in a theatre then be very sure the theatre is harmful for you however harmless it may be for others and that you are incurring a deadly peril in going Be sure the safest rule is that we should not dare to live in any scene in which we dare not die But once realise what the true object is in life that it is not pleasure not knowledge not even fame itself that last infirmity of noble minds but that it is the development of character the rising to a higher nobler purer standard the building up of the perfect Man and then so long as we feel that this is going on and will we trust go on for evermore death has for us no terror it is not a shadow but a light not an end but a beginning One other matter may perhaps seem to call for apology that I should have treated with such entire want of sympathy the British passion for Sport which no doubt has been in by gone days and is still in some forms of it an excellent school for hardihood and for coolness in moments of danger But I am not entirely without sympathy for genuine Sport I can heartily admire the courage of the man who with severe bodily toil and at the risk of his life hunts down some man eating tiger and I can heartily sympathize with him when he exults in the glorious excitement of the chase and the hand to hand struggle with the monster brought to bay But I can but look with deep wonder and sorrow on the hunter who at his ease and in safety can find pleasure in what involves for some defenceless creature wild terror and a death of agony deeper if the hunter be one who has pledged himself to preach to men the Religion of universal Love deepest of all if it be one of those tender and delicate beings whose very name serves as a symbol of Love thy love to me was wonderful passing the love of women whose mission here is surely to help and comfort all that are in pain or sorrow Farewell farewell but this I tell To thee thou Wedding Guest He prayeth well who loveth well Both man and bird and beast He prayeth best who loveth best All things both great and small For the dear God who loveth us He made and loveth
