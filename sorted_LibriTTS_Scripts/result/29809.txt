Illustration The two shark faced creatures were dragging at my arms and legs Sidenote To save Imee s race of Men Who Returned To The Sea two Land Men answer the challenge of the dreaded Rorn corsairs of the under seas I read the telegram for the second time Then I folded it up put it in my pocket and pressed the little button on my desk My mind was made up Miss Fentress I m leaving this afternoon on an extended trip The Florida address will reach me after Thursday Tell Wade and Bennett to carry on I think you have everything in hand Is everything clear to you Yes mister Taylor Miss Fentress was not in the least surprised She was used to my sudden trips The outfit got along perfectly without me sometimes I think my frequent absences are good for the business The boys work like the devil to make a fine showing while I m away And Miss Fentress is a perfect gem of a secretary I had nothing to worry about there Fine Will you get my diggings on the phone I hurriedly put my few papers in place and signed a couple of letters Then Josef was on the wire Josef Pack my bags right away will you For Florida The usual things Yes right away I ll be leaving by noon Yes driving through That was that There were a few more letters to sign a few hasty instructions to be given regarding one or two matters that were hanging fire Then on my way to my bachelor apartments I read the telegram through again THINK IT WORTH WHILE IF YOU FEEL ADVENTUROUS AND HAVE NOTHING PRESSING TO COME TO THE MONSTROSITY STOP MAKE YOUR WILL FIRST STOP SHALL LOOK FOR YOU ANY DAY AS I KNOW YOU ARE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR EXCITEMENT AND NEVER HAVE ANYTHING IMPORTANT TO DO SO DON T BOTHER TO WIRE STOP PERHAPS WE SHALL SEE HER AGAIN MERCER I smiled at Mercer s frank opinion of my disposition and my importance to my business But I frowned over the admonition to make my will and the last telling statement in the wire Perhaps we shall see her again I knew whom he meant by her Josef had my bags waiting for me A few hurried instructions most of them shouted over my shoulder and I was purring down the main drag my duffel in the rumble and the roadster headed due south Perhaps we shall see her again Those words from the telegram kept coming before my eyes Mercer knew what he was about if he wanted my company when he put that line in his wire I have already told the story of our first meeting with the strange being from the ocean s depths that wounded and senseless had been flung up on the beach near Warren Mercer s Florida estate In all the history of civilization no stranger bit of flotsam had ever been cast up by a storm Neither of us would ever forget that slim white creature swathed in her veil of long light golden hair as she crouched on the bottom of Mercer s swimming pool and pictured for us by means of Mercer s thought telegraph my own name for the device he has a long and scientific title for it with as many joints as a centipede the story of her people They had lived in a country of steaming mist when the world was very young They had been forced into the sea to obtain food and after many generations they had gone back to the sea as man once emerged from it They had grown webs on their hands and feet and they breathed oxygen dissolved in water as fishes do instead of taking it from the atmosphere And under the mighty Atlantic somewhere were their villages The girl had pictured all these things for us and then nearly a year ago now she had pleaded with us to let her return to her people And so we had put her back into the sea and she had bade us farewell But just before she disappeared she had done a strange thing She had pointed under the water out towards the depth and then with a broad sweeping motion of her arm she had indicated the shore as though to promise it seemed to me that she intended to return And now Mercer said we might see her again How Mercer conservative and scientific was not the man to make rash promises But how The best way to solve the riddle was to reach Mercer and I broke the speed laws of five states three days running I did not even stop at my own little shack It was only four miles from there to the huge rather neglected estate built in boom times by some newly rich promoter and dubbed by Mercer The Monstrosity Hardly bothering to slow down I turned off the concrete onto the long weed grown gravel drive and shot between the two massive stuccoed pillars that guarded the drive Their corroded bronze plates bearing the original title of the estate The Billows were a promise that my long hard drive was nearly at an end As soon as the huge rambling structure was fairly in sight I pressed the flat of my hand on the horn button By the time I came to a locked wheel halt with the gravel rattling on my fenders Mercer was there to greet me It s ten o clock he grinned as he shook hands I d set noon as the hour of your arrival You certainly must have made time Taylor I did I nodded rather grimly recalling one or two narrow squeaks But who wouldn t with a wire like this I produced the crumpled telegram rather dramatically You ve got a lot to explain I know it Mercer was quite serious now Come on in and we ll mix highballs with the story Locked arm in arm we entered the house together and settled ourselves in the huge living room Mercer I could see at a glance was thinner and browner than when we had parted but otherwise he was the same lithe soft mannered little scientist I had known for years dark eyed with an almost beautiful mouth outlined by a slim closely cropped and very black moustache Well here s to our lady from the sea proposed Mercer when Carson his man had brought the drinks and departed I nodded and we both sipped our highballs Briefly said my friend this is the story You and I know that somewhere beneath the Atlantic there are a people who went back to whence they came We have seen one of those people I propose that since they cannot come to us we go to them I have made preparations to go to them and I wanted you to have the opportunity of going with me if you wish But how Mercer And what He interrupted with a quick nervous gesture I ll show you presently I believe it can be done It will be a dangerous adventure though I was not joking when I advised you to make your will An uncertain venture too But I believe most wonderfully worth while His eyes were shining now with all the enthusiasm of the scientist the dreamer It sounds mighty appealing I said But how Finish your drink and I ll show you I downed what was left of my highball in two mighty gulps Lead me to it Mercer He smiled his quiet smile and led the way to what had been the billiard room of The Billows but which was the laboratory of The Monstrosity The first thing my eyes fell upon were two gleaming metal objects suspended from chains let into the ceiling Diving suits explained Mercer Rather different from anything you ve ever seen They were different The body was a perfect globe as was the head piece The legs were cylindrical jointed at knee and thigh with huge discs The feet were solid metal curved rocker like on the bottom and at the ends of the arms were three hooked talons the concave sides of two talons facing the concave side of the third The arms were hinged at the elbow just as the legs were hinged but there was a huge ball and socket joint at the shoulder But Mercer I protested No human being could even stand up with that weight of metal on and around him You re mistaken Taylor smiled Mercer That is not solid metal you see And it is an aluminum alloy that is not nearly as heavy as it looks There are two walls slightly over an inch apart braced by innumerable trusses The fabric is nearly as strong as that much solid metal and infinitely lighter They work all right Taylor I know because I ve tried them And this hump on the back I asked walking around the odd dangling figures hanging like bloated metal skeletons from their chains I had thought the bodies were perfect globes I could see now that at the rear there was a humplike excrescence across the shoulders Air explained Mercer There are two other tanks inside the globular body That shape was adopted by the way because a globe can withstand more pressure than any other shape And we may have to go where pressures are high And so I said we don these things and stroll out into the Atlantic looking for the girl and her friends Hardly They re not quite the apparel for so long a stroll You haven t seen all the marvels yet Come along He led the way through the patio beside the pool in which our strange visitor from the depths had lived during her brief stay with us and out into the open again As we neared the sea I became aware for the first time of a faint muffled hammering sound and I glanced at Mercer inquiringly Just a second he smiled Then there she is Taylor I stood still and stared In a little cove cradled in a cunning spidery structure of wood a submarine rested upon the ways Good Lord I exclaimed You re going into this right Mercer Yes Because I think it s immensely worth while But come along and let me show you the Santa Maria named after the flagship of Columbus little fleet Come on Two men with army automatics strapped significantly to their belts nodded courteously as we came up They were the only men in sight but from the hammering going on inside there must have been quite a sizeable crew busy in the interior A couple of raw pine shacks some little distance away provided quarters for I judged twenty or thirty men Had her shipped down in pieces explained Mercer The boat that brought it lay to off shore and we lightered the parts ashore A tremendous job But she ll be ready for the water in a week ten days at the latest You re a wonder I said and I meant it Mercer patted the red leaded side of the submarine affectionately Later he said I ll take you inside but they re busy as the devil in there and the sound of the hammers fairly makes your head ring You ll see it all later anyway if you feel you d like to share the adventure with me Listen I grinned as we turned back towards the house it ll take more than those two lads with the pop guns to keep me out of the Santa Maria when she sails or dives or whatever it is she s supposed to do Mercer laughed softly and we walked the rest of the way in silence I imagine we were both pretty busy with our thoughts I know that I was And several times as we walked along I looked back over my shoulder towards the ungainly red monster straddling on her spindling wooden legs and towards the smiling Atlantic glistening serenely in the sun Mercer was so busy with a thousand and one details that I found myself very much in the way if I followed him around so I decided to loaf For weeks after we had put our strange girl visitor back into the sea from whence Mercer had taken her I had watched from a comfortable seat well above the high water mark that commanded that section of shore For I had felt sure by that last strange gesture of hers that she meant to return I located my old seat and I found that it had been used a great deal since I had left it There were whole winnows of cigarette butts some of them quite fresh all around Mercer cold blooded scientist as he was had hoped against hope that she would return too It was a very comfortable seat in the shade of a little cluster of palms and for the next several days I spent most of my time there reading and smoking and watching No matter how interesting the book I found myself every few seconds lifting my eyes to search the beach and the sea I am not sure but I think it was the eighth day after my arrival that I looked up and saw for the first time something besides the smiling beach and the ceaseless procession of incoming rollers For an instant I doubted what I saw then with a cry that stuck in my throat I dropped my book unheeded to the sand and raced towards the shore She was there White and slim her pale gold hair clinging to her body and gleaming like polished metal in the sun she stood for a moment while the spray frothed at her thighs Behind her crouching below the surface I could distinguish two other forms She had returned and not alone One long slim arm shot out toward me held level with the shoulder the well remembered gesture of greeting Then she too crouched below the surface that she might breathe As I ran out onto the wet sand the waves splashing around my ankles all unheeded she rose again and now I could see her lovely smile and her dark glowing eyes I was babbling I do not know what Before I could reach her she smiled and sank again below the surface I waded on out laughing excitedly and as I came close to her she bobbed up again out of the spray and we greeted each other in the manner of her people hands outstretched each gripping the shoulder of the other She made a quick motion then with both hands as though she placed a cap upon the shining glory of her head and I understood in an instant what she wished the antenna of Mercer s thought telegraph by the aid of which she had told us the story of herself and her people I nodded and smiled and pointed to the spot where she stood trying to show her by my expression that I understood and by my gesture that she was to wait here for me She smiled and nodded in return and crouched again below the surface of the heaving sea As I turned toward the beach I caught a momentary glimpse of the two who had come with her They were a man and a woman watching me with wide half curious half frightened eyes I recognized them instantly from the picture she had impressed upon my mind nearly a year ago She had brought with her on her journey her mother and her father Stumbling my legs shaking with excitement I ran through the water With my wet trousers flapping against my ankles I sprinted towards the house I found Mercer in the laboratory He looked up as I came rushing in wet from the shoulders down and I saw his eyes grow suddenly wide I opened my mouth to speak but I was breathless And Mercer took the words from my mouth before I could utter them She s come back he cried She s come back Taylor she has He gripped me his fingers like steel clamps shaking me with his amazing strength Yes I found my breath and my voice at the same instant She s there just where we put her into the sea and there are two others with her her mother and her father Come on Mercer and bring your thought gadget I can t he groaned I ve built an improvement on it into the diving armor and a central instrument on the sub but the old apparatus is strewn all over the table here just as it was when we used it the other time We ll have to bring her here Get a basin then I said We ll carry her back to the pool just as we took her from it Hurry And we did just that Mercer snatched up a huge glass basin used in his chemistry experiments and we raced down to the shore As well as we could we explained our wishes and she smiled her quick smile of understanding Crouching beneath the water she turned to her companions and I could see her throat move as she spoke to them They seemed to protest dubious and frightened but in the end she seemed to reassure them and we picked her up swathed in her hair as in a silken gown and carried her her head immersed in the basin of water that she might breathe in comfort to the pool It all took but a few minutes but it seemed hours Mercer s hands were shaking as he handed me the antenna for the girl and another for myself and his teeth were chattering as he spoke Hurry Taylor he said I ve set the switch so that she can do the sending while we receive Quickly man I leaped into the pool and adjusted the antenna on her head making sure that the four electrodes of the crossed curved members pressed against the front and back and both sides of her head Then hastily I climbed out of the pool seated myself on its edge and put on my own antenna Perhaps I should say at this time that Mercer s device for conveying thought could do no more than convey what was in the mind of the person sending Mercer and I could convey actual words and sentences because we understood each other s language and by thinking in words we conveyed our thoughts in words One received the impression almost of having heard actual speech We could not communicate with the girl in this fashion however for we did not understand her speech She had to convey her thoughts to us by means of mental pictures which told her story And this is the story of her pictures unfolded First in sketchy half formed pictures I saw her return to the village of her people her welcome there with curious crowds around her questioning her Their incredulous expressions as she told them of her experience were ludicrous Her meeting with her father and mother brought a little catch to my throat and I looked across the pool at Mercer I knew that he too was glad that we bad put her back into the sea when she wished to go These pictures faded hastily and for a moment there was only the circular swirling as of gray mist that was the symbol she adopted to denote the passing of time Then slowly the picture cleared It was the same village I had seen before with its ragged warped narrow streets and its row of dome shaped houses for all the world like Eskimo igloos but made of coral and various forms of vegetation At the outskirts of the village I could see the gently moving shadowy forms of weird submarine growths and the quick darting shapes of innumerable fishes Some few people were moving along the streets walking with oddly springy steps Others a larger number darted here and there above the roofs some hovering in the water as gulls hover in the air lazily but the majority apparently on business or work to be executed with dispatch Suddenly into the midst of this peaceful scene three figures came darting They were not like the people of the village for they were smaller and instead of being gracefully slim they were short and powerful in build They were not white like the people of the girl s village but swarthy and they were dressed in a sort of tight fitting shirt of gleaming leather shark skin I learned later They carried tucked through a sort of belt made of twisted vegetation two long slim knives of pointed stone or bone But it was not until they seemed to come close to me that I saw the great point of difference Their faces were scarcely human The nose had become rudimentary leaving a large blank expanse in the middle of their faces that gave them a peculiarly hideous expression Their eyes were almost perfectly round and very fierce and their mouths huge and fishlike Beneath their sharp jutting jaws between the angle of the jaws and a spot beneath the ears were huge longitudinal slits that intermittently showed blood red like fresh gashes cut in the sides of their throats I could see even the hard bony cover that protected these slits and I realized that these were gills Here were representatives of a people that had gone back to the sea ages before the people of the girl s village Their coming caused a sort of panic in the village and the three noseless creatures strode down the principal street grinning hugely glancing from right to left and showing their sharp pointed teeth They looked more like sharks than like human beings A committee of five gray old men met the visitors and conducted them into one of the larger houses Insolently the leader of the three shark faced creatures made demands and the scene changed swiftly to make clear the nature of those demands The village was to give a number of its finest young men and women to the shark faced people about fifty of each sex I gathered to be servants slaves to the noseless ones The scene shifted quickly to the interior of the house The old men were shaking their heads protesting explaining There was fear on their faces but there was determination too One of the three envoys snarled and came closer to the five old men lifting a knife threateningly I thought for an instant that he was about to strike down one of the villagers then the picture dissolved into another and I saw that he was but threatening them with what he could cause to happen The fate of the village and the villagers were the demands of the three refused was a terrible one Hordes of the noseless creatures came swarming They tore the houses apart and with their long slim white weapons they killed the old men and women and the children The villagers fought desperately but they were outnumbered The shark skin kirtles of the invaders turned their knives like armor and the sea grew red with swirling blood that spread like scarlet smoke through the water Then this too faded and I saw the old men cowering pleading with the three terrible envoys The leader of the three shark faced creatures spoke again He would give them time a short revolving swirl of gray that indicated only a brief time apparently and return for an answer Grinning evilly the three turned away left the dome shaped house and darted away over the roofs of the village into the dim darkness of the distant waters I saw the girl then talking to the elders They smiled sadly and shook their heads hopelessly She argued with them earnestly painting a picture for them Mercer and myself as she viewed us tall and very strong and with great wisdom in our faces We too walked along the streets of the village The hordes of shark faced ones came like a swarm of monstrous sharks and the picture was very vague and nebulous now we put them to rout She wished us to help her she had convinced the elders that we could She her mother and father started out from the village Three times they had fought with sharks and each time they had killed them They had found the shore the very spot where we had put her back into the sea Then there was a momentary flash of the picture she had called up of Mercer and I putting the shark faced hordes to rout and then startlingly I was conscious of that high pleading sound the sound that I had heard once before when she had begged us to return her to her people The sound that I knew was her word for Please There was a little click Mercer had turned the switch He would transmit now she and I would listen In the center of the village how vaguely and clumsily he pictured it rested the Santa Maria From a trap in the bottom two bulging gleaming figures emerged Rushing up a glimpse through the face plates revealed Mercer and myself The shark faced hordes descended and Mercer waved something something like a huge bottle towards them None of the villagers were in sight The noseless ones swooped down on us fearlessly knives drawn pointed teeth revealed in fiendish grins But they did not reach us By dozens by scores they went limp and floated slowly to the floor of the ocean Their bodies covered the streets they sprawled across the roofs of the houses And in a few seconds there was not one alive of all the hundreds who had come I looked down at the girl She was smiling up at me through the clear water and once again I felt the strange strong tug at my heart strings Her great dark eyes glowed with a perfect confidence a supreme faith We had made her a promise I wondered if it would be possible to keep it In the day following the Santa Maria was launched Two days later trial trips and final adjustments completed we submerged for the great adventure It sounds very simple when recorded thus in a few brief lines It was not however such a simple matter Those three days were full of hectic activity Mercer and I did not sleep more than four hours any of those three nights We were too busy to talk Mercer worked frantically in his laboratory slaving feverishly beside the big hood I overlooked the tests of the submarine and the loading of the necessary supplies The girl we had taken back to her parents giving her to understand that she was to wait They went away but every few hours returned as though to urge us to greater haste And at last we were ready and the girl and her two companions seated themselves on the tiny deck of the Santa Maria just forward of the conning tower holding themselves in place by the chains We had already instructed the girl in her duties we would move slowly and she should guide us by pointing either to the right or the left I will confess I gave a last long lingering look at the shore before the hatch of the conning tower was clamped down I was not exactly afraid but I wondered if I would ever step foot on solid land again Standing in the conning tower beside Mercer I watched the sea rise at an angle to meet us and I dodged instinctively as the first green wave pelted against the thick porthole through which I was looking An instant later the water closed over the top of the conning tower and at a gentle angle we nosed towards the bottom of the sea An account of the trip itself perhaps does not belong in this record It was not a pleasant adventure in itself for the Santa Maria like every undersea craft I suppose was close smelly and cramped We proceeded very slowly for only by so doing could our guide keep her bearings and how she found the way was a mystery to all of us We could see but very little despite the clearness of the water It was by no means a sight seeing trip For various reasons Mercer had cut our crew to the minimum We had two navigating officers experienced submarine men both and five sailors also experienced in undersea work With such a short crew Mercer and I were both kept busy Bonnett the captain was a tall dark chap stooped from years in the low cramped quarters of submarines Duke our second officer was a youngster hardly out of his teens and as clever as they come And although both of them and the crew as well must have been agog with questions neither by word nor look did they express their feelings Mercer had paid for obedience without curiosity and he got it We spent the first night on the bottom for the simple reason that had we come to the surface we might have come down into territory unfamiliar to our guide As soon as the first faint light began to filter down however we proceeded and Mercer and I crowded together into the conning tower We re close said Mercer See how excited they are all three of them The three strange creatures were holding onto the chains and staring over the bulging side of the ship Every few seconds the girl turned and looked back at us smiling her eyes shining with excitement Suddenly she pointed straight down and held out her arm in unmistakable gesture We were to stop Mercer conveyed the order instantly to Bonnett at the controls and all three of our guides dived gracefully off the ship and disappeared into the depths below Let her settle to the bottom Bonnett ordered Mercer Slowly slowly Bonnett handled the ship neatly keeping her nicely trimmed We came to rest on the bottom in four or five seconds and as Mercer and I stared out eagerly through the round glass ports of the conning tower we could see very dimly a cluster of dark rounded projections cropping out from the bed of the ocean We were only a few yards from the edge of the girl s village The scene was exactly as we had pictured it save that it was not nearly as clear and well lighted I realized that our eyes were not accustomed to the gloom as were those of the girl and her people but I could distinguish the vague outlines of the houses and the slowly swaying shapes of monstrous growths Well Taylor said Mercer his voice shaking with excitement here we are And here peering out through the glass covered port again are her people The whole village was swarming around us White bodies hovered around us as moths around a light Faces pressed against the ports and stared in at us with great amazed eyes Then suddenly the crowd of curious creatures parted and the girl came darting up with the five ancients she had showed us before They were evidently the council responsible for the government of the village or something of the sort for the other villagers bowed their heads respectfully as they passed The girl came close to the port through which I was looking and gestured earnestly Her face was tense and anxious and from time to time she glanced over her shoulder as though she feared the coming of an enemy Our time s short I take it if we are to be of service said Mercer Come on Taylor into the diving suits I signaled the girl that we understood and would hurry Then I followed Mercer into our tiny stateroom Remember what I ve told you he said as we slipped into the heavy woolen undergarments we were to wear inside the suits You understand how to handle your air I believe and you ll have no difficulty getting around in the suit if you ll just remember to go slowly Your job is to get the whole village to get away when the enemy is sighted Get them to come this way from the village towards the ship understand The current comes from this direction the way the vegetation bends shows that And keep the girl s people away until I signal you to let them return And remember to take your electric lantern Don t burn it more than is necessary the batteries are not large and the bulb draws a lot of current Ready I was but I was shaking a little as the men helped me into the mighty armor that was to keep the pressure of several atmospheres from crushing my body The helmet was the last piece to be donned when it was screwed in place I stood there like a mummy almost completely rigid Quickly we were put into the air lock together with a large iron box containing a number of things Mercer needed Darkness and water rushed in on us The water closed over my head I became aware of the soft continuous popping sounds of the air bubbles escaping from the relief valve of the head piece For a moment I was dizzy and more than a little nauseated I could feel the cold sweat pricking my forehead Then there was a sudden glow of light from before me and I started walking towards it I found I could walk now not easily but after I caught the trick of it without much difficulty I could move my arms too and the interlocking hooks that served me for fingers When my real fingers closed upon a little cross bar at the end of the armored arms and pulled the bars towards me the steel claws outside came together like a thumb and two fingers In a moment we stood upon the bottom of the ocean I turned my head inside the helmet and there beside me was the sleek smooth side of the Santa Maria On my other side was Mercer a huge dim figure in his diving armor He made an awkward gesture towards his head and I suddenly remembered something Before me where I could operate it with a thrusting movement of my chin was a toggle switch I snapped it over and heard Mercer s voice n t forget everything I tell him I know it I said mentally to him I was rather rattled O K now however Anything I can do Yes Help me with this box and then get the girl to put on the antenna you ll find there Don t forget the knife and the light Right I bent over the box with him and we both came near falling We opened the lid however and I hooked the knife and the light into their proper places outside my armor Then with the antenna for the girl so that we could establish connections with her and through her with the villagers I moved off This antenna was entirely different from the one used in previous experiments The four cross members that clasped the head were finer and at their junction was a flat black circular box from which rose a black rod some six inches in height and topped by a black sphere half the size of my fist These perfected thought telegraphs I shall continue to use my own designation for them as clearer and more understandable than Mercer s did not need connecting wires they conveyed their impulses by Hertzian waves to a master receiver on the Santa Maria which amplified them and re broadcast them so that each of us could both send and receive at any time As I turned I found the girl beside me waiting anxiously Behind her were the five ancients I slipped the antenna over her head and instantly she began telling me that danger was imminent To facilitate matters I shall describe her messages as though she spoke indeed her pictures were as clear almost as speech in my native tongue And at times she did use certain sound words it was in this way that I learned by inference that her name was Imee that her people were called Teemorn this may have been the name of the community or perhaps it was interchangeable I am not sure and that the shark faced people were the Rorn The Rorn come she said quickly Two days past the three came again and our old men refused to give up the slaves Today they will return these Rorn and my people the Teemorn will all be made dead Then I told her what Mercer had said that she and every one of her people must flee swiftly and hide beyond the boat a distance beyond the village Mercer and I would wait here and when the Rorn came it was they who would be made dead as we had promised Although how I admitted to myself being careful to hide the thought that she might not sense it I didn t know We had been too busy since the girl s arrival to go into details She turned and spoke quickly to the old men They looked at me doubtfully and she urged them vehemently They turned back towards the village and in a moment the Teemorn were stalking by obediently losing their slim white forms in the gloom behind the dim bulk of the Santa Maria resting so quietly on the sand They were hardly out of sight when suddenly Mercer spoke through the antenna fitted inside my helmet They re coming he cried Look above and to your right The Rorn as Imee calls them have arrived I looked up and beheld a hundred no a thousand shadowy forms darting down on the village upon us They too were just as the girl had pictured them short swart beings with but the suggestion of a nose and with pulsing gill covers under the angles of their jaws Each one gripped a long slim white knife in either hand and their tight fitting shark skin armor gleamed darkly as they swooped down upon us Eagerly I watched my friend In the clasping talons of his left hand he held a long slim flask that glinted even in that dim confusing twilight Two others mates to the first dangled at his waist Lifting it high above his head he swung his metal clad right arm and shattered the flask he held in his taloned left hand For an instant nothing happened save that flittering bits of broken glass shimmered their way to the sand Then the horde of noseless ones seemed to dissolve as hundreds of limp and sprawling bodies sank to the sand Perhaps a half of that great multitude seemed struck dead Hydrocyanic acid Taylor cried Mercer exultantly Even diluted by the sea water it kills almost instantly Go back and make sure that none of the girl s people come back before the current has washed this away or they ll go in the same fashion Warn her to keep them back I hurried toward the Santa Maria thinking urgent warnings for Imee s benefit Stay back Stay back Imee The Rorn are falling to the sand we have made many of them dead but the danger for you and your people is still here Stay back Truly do the Rorn become dead I would like to see that with my own eyes Be careful that they do not make you dead also and your friend for they have large brains these Rorn Do not come to see with your own eyes or you will be as the Rorn I hurried around the submarine to keep her back by force if that were necessary You must Help Taylor cut in a voice Mercer s These devils have got me Right with you I turned and hurried back as swiftly as I could stumbling over the bodies of dead Rorn that had settled everywhere on the clean yellow sand I found Mercer in the grip of six of the shark faced creatures They were trying desperately to stab him but their knives bent and broke against the metal of his armor So busy were they with him that they did not notice me coming up but finding their weapons useless they suddenly snatched him up one at either arm and either leg and two grasping him by the head piece and darted away with him carrying his bulging metal body between them like a battering ram while he kicked and struggled impotently They are taking him to the Place of Darkness cried Imee suddenly having read my impressions of the scene Oh go quickly quickly toward the direction of your best hand to your right I shall follow No No Stay back I warned her frantically All but these six Rorn had fallen victims of Mercer s hellish poison and while they seemed to be suffering no ill effects I thought it more than likely that some sly current might bring the deadly poison to the girl did she come this way and kill her as surely as it had killed these hundreds of Rorn To the right she had said Towards the Place of Darkness I hurried out of the village in the direction she indicated towards the distant gleam of Mercer s armor rapidly being lost in the gloom I m coming Mercer I called to him Delay them as much as you can You re going faster than I can I can t help myself much replied Mercer Doing what I can Strong they re devilish strong Taylor And at close range I can see you were right They have true gill covers their noses are rudimentary and The devil take your scientific observations Drag Slow them down I m losing sight of you For heaven s sake drag I m doing what I can Damn you if I could only get a hand free I realized that this last was directed at his captors and plunged on Huge monstrous growths swirled around me like living things My feet crunched on shelled things and sank into soft and slimy creeping things on the bottom I cursed the water that held me back so gently yet so firmly I cursed the armor that made it so hard for me to move my legs But I kept on and at last I began to gain on them I could see them quite distinctly bending over Mercer working on him Do your best Taylor urged Mercer desperately We re on the edge of a sort of cliff a fault in the structure of the ocean bed They re tying me with strong cords of leather Tying a huge stone to my body I think they I had a momentary flash of the scene as Mercer saw it at that instant the horrid noseless face close to his the swart bodies moving with amazing agility And at his very feet a yawning precipice holding nothing but darkness leading down and down into nothingness Run quickly It was Imee She too had seen what I had seen That is the Place of Darkness where we take those whom the Five deem worthy of the Last Punishment They will tie the stone to him and bear him out above the Blackness and then they will let him go Quickly Quickly I was almost upon them now and one of the six turned and saw me Three of them darted towards me while the others held Mercer flat upon the edge of the precipice If they had only realized that by rolling his armored body a foot or two he would sink without the stone But they did not Their brains had little reasoning power apparently The attaching of a stone was necessary in their experience it was necessary now With my left hand I unhooked my light I already gripped my knife in my right hand Swinging the light sharply against my leg I struck the toggle switch and a beam of intense brilliancy shot through the gloom It aided me as I had thought it would it blinded these large eyed denizens of the deep Swiftly I struck out with the knife It hacked harmlessly into the shark skin garment of one of the men and I stabbed out again Two of the men leaped for my right arm but the knife found this time the throat of the third My beam of light showed palely red for a moment and the body of the Rorn toppled slowly to the bed of the ocean The two shark faced creatures were hammering at me with their fists dragging at my arms and legs but I plunged on desperately towards Mercer Myriads of fish all shapes and colors and sizes attracted by the light swarmed around us Good boy Mercer commended See if you can break this last flask of acid here at my waist See With a last desperate plunge fairly dragging the two Rorn who tugged at me I fell forward With the clenched steel talons of my right hand I struck at the silvery flask I could see dangling from Mercer s waist I hit it but only a glancing blow the flask did not shatter Again commanded Mercer It s heavy annealed glass hydrocyanic acid terrible stuff even the fumes I paid but slight heed The two Rorn dragged me back but I managed to crawl forward on my knees and with all my strength I struck at the flask again This time it shattered and I lay where I fell sobbing with weakness looking out through the side window of my head piece The five Rorn seemed to suddenly lose their strength They struggled limply for a moment and then floated down to the waiting sand beneath us Finish remarked Mercer coolly And just in time Let s see if we can find our way back to the Santa Maria We were weary and we plodded along slowly twin trails of air bubbles like plumes waving behind us rushing upwards to the surface I felt strangely alone at the moment isolated cut off from all mankind on the bottom of the Atlantic Coming to meet you all of us Imee signaled us Be careful where you step so that you do not walk in a circle and find again the Place of Darkness It is very large Probably some uncharted deep threw in Mercer Only the larger ones have been located For my part I was too weary to think I just staggered on A crowd of slim darting white shapes surrounded us They swam before us showing the way The five patriarchs walked majestically before us and between us smiling at us through the thick lenses of our headpieces walked Imee Oh it was a triumphal procession and had I been less weary I presume I would have felt quite the hero Imee pictured for us as we went along the happiness the gratefulness of her people Already she informed us great numbers of young men were clearing away the bodies of the dead Rorn She was so happy she could hardly restrain herself A dim skeleton shape bulked up at my left I turned to look at it and Imee watching me through the lights of my head piece nodded and smiled Yes this was the very hulk by which she had been swimming when the shark had attacked her the shark which had been the cause of the accident She darted on to show me the very rib upon which her head had struck stunning her so that she had drifted unconscious and storm tossed to the shore of Mercer s estate I studied the wreck It was battered and tilted on its beam ends but I could still make out the high poop that marked it as a very old ship A Spanish galleon Mercer I conjectured I believe so And then in pictured form for Imee s benefit It has been here while much time passed Yes Imee came darting back to us smiling Since before the Teemorn my people were here A Rorn we made prisoner once told us his people discovered it first They went into this strange skeleton and inside were many blocks of very bright stone She pictured quite clearly bars of dully glinting bullion Evidently the captive had told his story well These stones which were so bright the Rorn took to their city which is three swims distant How far that might be I could not even guess A swim it seemed was the distance a Teemorn could travel before the need for rest became imperative There were many Rorn and they each took one stone And of them they made a house for their leader The leader as she pictured him being the most hideous travesty of a thing in semi human form that the mind could imagine incredibly old and wrinkled and ugly and gray his noseless face seamed with cunning his eyes red rimmed and terrible his teeth gleaming white and sharp like fangs A whole house except the roof she went on It is there now and it is gazed at with much admiration by all the Rorn All this our prisoner told us before we took him with a rock made fast to him out over the Place of Darkness He too was very proud of their leader s house Treasure I commented to Mercer If we could find the city of the Rorn we might make the trip pay for itself I could sense his wave of amusement I think he replied I d rather stand it myself These Rorn don t appeal to me It was over half an hour before we were at last free of our diving suits The first thing Captain Bonnett said We ve got to get to the surface and that quickly Our air supply is running damnably low By the time we blow out the tanks we ll be just about out And foul air will keep us here until we rot I m sorry sir but that s the way matters stand Mercer white faced and ill stared at him dazedly Air he repeated groggily I knew just how he felt We should have lots of air The specifications But we re dealing with facts not specifications sir said Captain Bonnett Another two hours here and we won t leave ever Then it can t be helped Captain muttered Mercer We ll go up And back For more compressed air We must remember to plot our course exactly You kept the record on the way out as I instructed you Yes sir said Captain Bonnett Just a minute then said Mercer Weakly he made his way forward to the little cubbyhole in which was housed the central station of his thought telegraph I didn t even inspect the gleaming maze of apparatus I merely watched him dully as he plugged in an antenna similar to the one we had left with Imee and adjusted the things on his head His eyes brightened instantly She s still wearing her antenna he said swiftly over his shoulder I ll tell her that something s happened we must leave but that we will return He sat there frowning intently for a moment and then dragged the antenna wearily from his head He touched a switch somewhere and several softly glowing bulbs turned slowly red and then dark You and I he groaned had better go to bed We overdid it She understands I think Terribly sorry terribly disappointed Some sort of celebration planned I gather Captain Bonnett Yes sir You may proceed now as you think best said Mercer We re retiring Be sure and chart the course back so we may locate this spot again Yes sir said Captain Bonnett When I awoke we were at anchor our deck barely awash before the deserted beach of Mercer s estate Still feeling none too well Mercer and I made our way to the narrow deck Captain Bonnett was waiting for us spruce in his blue uniform his shoulders bowed as always Good morning gentlemen he offered smiling crisply The open air seems good doesn t it It did There was a fresh breeze blowing in from the Atlantic and I filled my lungs gratefully I had not realized until that instant just how foul the air below had been Very fine Captain said Mercer nodding You have signaled the men on shore to send out a boat to take us off Yes sir I believe they re launching her now And the chart of our course did the return trip check with the other Perfectly sir Captain Bonnett reached in an inner pocket of his double breasted coat extracted two folded pages and extended them with a little bow to Mercer Just as Mercer s eager fingers touched the precious papers however the wind whisked them from Bonnett s grasp and whirled them into the water Bonnett gasped and gazed after them for a split second then barely pausing to tear off his coat he plunged over the side He tried desperately but before he could reach either one of the tossing white specks they were washed beneath the surface and disappeared Ten minutes later his uniform bedraggled and shapeless he pulled himself on deck I m sorry sir he gasped out of breath Sorrier than I can say I tried Mercer white faced and struggling with his emotions looked down and turned away You don t remember the bearings I suppose he ventured tonelessly I m sorry no Thank you Captain for trying so hard to recover the papers said Mercer You d better change at once the wind is sharp The captain bowed and disappeared down the conning tower Then Mercer turned to me and a smile struggled for life Well Taylor we helped her out anyway he said slowly I m sorry that that Imee will misunderstand when we don t come back But Mercer I said swiftly perhaps we ll be able to find our way back to her You thought before you know that But I can see now what an utterly wild goose chase it would have been Mercer shook his head slowly No old friend it would be impossible And Imee will not come again to guide us she will think we have deserted her And he smiled slowly up into my eyes perhaps it is as well After all the photographs and the data I wanted would do the world no practical good We did Imee and her people a good turn let s content ourselves with that I for one am satisfied And I old timer I said placing my hand affectionately upon his shoulder Here s the boat Shall we go ashore We did go ashore silently And as we got out of the boat and set foot again upon the sand we both turned and looked out across the smiling Atlantic dancing brightly in the sun The mighty mysterious Atlantic home of Imee and her people Murder Madness BEGINNING A FOUR PART NOVEL By Murray Leinster Illustration The heads leveled the revolver in spite of him while he flung his head from side to side in a frantic attempt to disturb their aim Sidenote Murder Madness Seven Secret Service men had completely disappeared Another had been found a screaming homicidal maniac whose fingers writhed like snakes So Bell of the secret Trade plunges into South America after The Master the mighty unknown octopus of power whose diabolical poison threatens a continent CHAPTER I The engines of the Almirante Gomez were going dead slow Away up beside her monster funnels her siren blew dismally Whoo oo oo oo and was silent for the regulation period and blew desolately again into the clinging gray mist that ringed her all about Her decks were wet and glistening Droplets of water stood upon the deck stanchions and dripped from the outer edge of the roof above the promenade deck A thin swirling fog lay soggily upon the water and the big steamer went dead slow upon her course sending dismal and depressing blasts from her horn from time to time It was barely possible to see from one side of the ship to the other It was surely impossible to see the bow from a point half astern Charley Bell went forward along the promenade deck He passed Senor Ortiz ex Minister of the Interior of the Argentine Republic Ortiz bowed to him punctiliously but Bell had a sudden impression that the Argentine s face was gray and ghastly He checked himself and looked back The little man was climbing the companion ladder toward the wireless room Bell slipped on toward the bow He did not want to give an impression of furtiveness but the Almirante Gomez was twelve days out of New York and Bell was still entirely ignorant of why he was on board He had been called into the office of his chief in the State Department and told curtly that his request for leave of absence had been granted And Bell had not asked for a leave of absence But at just that moment he saw a rubber band on the desk of his immediate superior a fairly thick rubber band which had been tied into a certain intricate knot And Bell had kept quiet He went to his apartment found his bags packed and tickets to Rio via the Almirante Gomez in an envelope on his dressing table and went out and caught a train to the ship Illustration And that was all he knew The siren up above blared dolefully into the fog It was damp and soggy and depressing The other passengers were under cover and the decks seemed to be deserted From the saloon came the sound of music Bell pulled the collar of his light topcoat about his throat and strolled on toward the bow He faced a row of steamer chairs There was a figure curled up in one of them Paula Canalejas muffled up against the dampness and staring somberly out into the mist Bell had met her in Washington and liked her a great deal but he swore softly at sight of her in his way The afternoon before he had seen a stoker on the Almirante Gomez pick up a bit of rope and absently tie knots in it while he exchanged Rabelasian humor with his fellows He had not looked at Bell at all but the knots he tied were the same that Bell had last seen tied in a rubber band on a desk in the State Department in Washington And Bell knew a recognition signal when he saw one The stoker would be off watch just now and by all the rules of reason he ought to be out there on the forecastle waiting for Bell to turn up and receive instructions But Bell paused lit a cigarette carefully and strolled forward mister Bell He stopped and beamed fatuously at her It would have been logical for him to fall in love with her and it is always desirable to seem logical He had striven painstakingly to give the impression that he had fallen in love with her and then had striven even more painstakingly to keep from doing it Hullo he said in bland surprise What are you doing out on deck Brown eyes regarded him speculatively Thinking she said succinctly About you mister Bell Bell beamed Thinking he confided is usually a bad habit especially in a girl But if you must think I approve of your choice of subjects What were you thinking about me The brown eyes regarded him still more speculatively I was wondering said Paula glancing to either side I was wondering if you happen to be er a member of the United States Secret Service Bell laughed with entire naturalness Good Lord no he said amusedly I have a desk in the State Department building and I read consular reports all day long and write letters bedeviling the consuls for not including unavailable statistics in their communications That s my work I m on leave now She looked skeptical and it may be disappointed You look as if you didn t believe me said Bell smiling I give you my word of honor I m not a member of the United States Secret Service Will that do to relieve your suspicions I believe you she said slowly but it does not relieve my mind I shall think about other people I have something important to tell a member of the United States Secret Service Bell shrugged I m sorry he said amiably that I can t oblige you by tipping one of them off That s what you wanted me to do isn t it She nodded and the gesture was very much like a dismissal Bell frowned hesitated and went on He was anxious to meet the stoker but this The siren droned dismally over his head Fog lay deep about the ship The washing of the waves and dripping of water on the decks was depressing It seemed to be getting thicker Four stanchions ahead the mist was noticeable He found that he could count five six seven The eighth was indefinite But a bar materialized in the fog before him and the grayness drew away before him and closed in behind When he was at the forward end of the promenade looking down upon the forecastle deck he was isolated He heard footsteps some distance overhead The watch officer up on the bridge Bell glanced up and saw him as an indistinct figure He waited until the officer paced over to the opposite side of the bridge The air throbbed and shook with the roaring of the siren Bell slipped over the edge of the rail and swung swiftly down the little ladder of iron bars set into the ship s structure In seconds he had landed and was down upon that terra incognita of all passengers the deck reserved for the use of the crew A mast loomed overhead with its heavy clumsy derrick booms A winch was by his side Oddments of deck machinery inexplicable to a landsman formed themselves vaguely in the mist The fog was thicker naturally since the deck was closer to the water s edge Hey growled a voice close beside him Passengers ain t allowed down here An unshaven soot smeared figure loomed up Bell could not see the man save as a blur in the mist but he said cheerfully I know it but I wanted to look Seafaring s a trade I d like to know something about The figure grunted Bell had just given his word of honor that he wasn t a member of the Secret Service He wasn t But he was in the Trade which has no official existence anywhere And the use of the word in his first remark was a recognition signal What is your trade anyways growled the figure skeptically I sharpen serpents teeth from time to time offered Bell amiably He recognized the man suddenly Hullo Jamison you look like the devil Jamison drew nearer He grunted softly I know it Listen closely Bell Your job is getting some information from Canalejas Minister of War in Rio He sent word up to Washington that he d something important to say It isn t treachery to Brazil because he s a decent man Seven Secret Service men have disappeared in South America within three months They ve found the eighth and he s crazy Something has driven him mad and they say it s a devilish poison He s a homicidal maniac returning to the United States in a straight jacket Canalejas knows what s happened to the Service men He said so and he s going to tell us His daughter brought the news to Washington and then instead of going on to Europe as she was supposed to do she started back to Rio You re to get this formation and pass it on to me then try to keep your skin whole and act innocent You were picked out because as a State Department man hell could be raised if you vanished Understand Bell nodded Something horrible is going on Secret Service can t do anything The man in Asuncion isn t dead he s been seen but he s cut loose And Service men don t often do that He don t report That means the Service code may have been turned over and hell to pay generally It s up to the Trade I ve got it said Bell Here are two items for you Miss Canalejas just said she suspected I was Secret Service I convinced her I wasn t She says she has important information for a Service man The brawny figure of the stoker growled Damn women She was told somebody d be sent to see her father She was shown a recognition knot with the outsider s variation Given one for father That ll identify you to him But she shouldn t have talked Now be careful As nearly as we know that chap in the straight jacket was given some poison that drove him insane There are hellish drugs down there Maybe the same thing happened to others Look out for yourself and give me the information Canalejas gives you as quickly as God will let you If anything happens to you we want the stuff to get back Understand Of course said Bell He carefully did not shiver as he realized what Jamison meant by anything happening to him The other item is that Ortiz ex Minister of the Interior of the Argentine is scared to death about something Sending radios right and left Umph growled Jamison One of our men vanished in Buenos Aires Watch him You re friendly Yes Get friendlier See what he s got Now shoo Bell swung up the ladder again Mist opened before him and closed again behind He climbed over the rail to the promenade deck and felt a little flare of irritation There was a figure watching him He slipped to the deck and grinned sheepishly at Paula Canalejas She stood with her hands in the pockets of her little sport coat regarding him very gravely I suppose said Charley Bell sheepishly that I look like a fool But I ve always wanted to climb up and down that ladder I suppose it s a survival from the age of childhood At the age of seven I longed to be a fireman I wonder said Paula quietly mister Bell she stepped close to him I am taking a desperate chance For the sake of my father I wish certain things known I think that you are an honorable man and I think that you lied to me just now Go and see Senor Ortiz Your government will want to know what happens to him Go and see him quickly Bell felt the same flare of irritation as before Women do not follow rules They will not follow rules They depend upon intuition which is sometimes right but sometimes leads to ungodly errors Paula was right this time but she could have been wholly and hopelessly wrong If she had talked to anyone else My child said Bell paternally he was at least two years older than Paula you should be careful I did not lie to you just now I am not Secret Service But I happen to know that you have a tiny piece of string to give your father and I beg of you not to show that to anyone else And well you are probably watched You must not talk seriously to me He lifted his hat and started astern He was more than merely irritated He was almost frightened Because the Trade officially does not exist at all and everybody in the Trade is working entirely on his own and because those people who suspect that there is a Trade and dislike it are not on their own but have plenty of resources behind them And yet it is requisite that the Trade shall succeed in its various missions Always The Government of the United States you understand will admit that it has a Secret Service which it strives to identify solely with the pursuit of counterfeiters postal thieves and violators of the prohibition laws Strongly pressed it will admit that some members of the Secret Service work abroad the official explanation being that they work abroad to forestall smugglers And at a pinch and in confidence it may concede the existence of diplomatic secret agents But there is no such thing as the Trade Not at all The funds which members of the Trade expend are derived by very devious bookkeeping from the appropriations allotted to an otherwise honestly conducted Department of the United States Government Therefore the Trade does not really exist You might say that there is a sort of conspiracy among certain people to do certain things Some of them are government officials major and minor Some of them are private citizens reputable and otherwise One or two of them are in jail both here and abroad But as far as the Government of the United States is concerned certain fortunate coincidences that happen now and then are purely coincidences And the Trade which arranges for them does not exist But it has a good many enemies The fog horn howled dismally overhead Mist swirled past the ship and an oily swell surged vaguely overside and disappeared into a gray oblivion half a ship s length away Bell moved on toward the stern It was his intention to go into the smoking room and idle ostentatiously Perhaps he would enter into another argument with that Brazilian air pilot who had so much confidence in Handley Page wing slots Bell had in Washington a small private plane that he explained had been given him by a wealthy aunt who hoped he would break his neck in it He considered that wing slots interfered with stunting He had picked out the door with his eye when he espied a small figure standing by the rail It was Ortiz the Argentine ex Cabinet Minister staring off into the grayness and seeming to listen with all his ears Bell slowed up The little stout man turned and nodded to him and then put out his hand Senor Bell he said quietly tell me Do you hear airplane motors Bell listened The drip drip drip of condensed mist The shuddering of the ship with her motors going dead slow The tinkling muted notes of the piano inside the saloon The washing and hissing of the waves overside That was all Why no said Bell I don t Sound travels freakishly in fog though One might be quite close and we couldn t hear it But we re a hundred and fifty miles off the Venezuelan coast aren t we Ortiz turned and faced him Bell was shocked at the expression on the small man s face It was drained of all blood and its look was ghastly But the rather fine dark eyes were steady We are agreed Ortiz very steadily indeed but I I have received a radiogram that some airplane should fly near this ship and it would amuse me to hear it Bell frowned at the fog I ve done a good bit of flying he observed and if I were flying out at sea right now I d dodge this fog bank It would be practically suicide to try to alight in a mist like this Ortiz regarded him carefully It seemed to Bell that sweat was coming out upon the other man s forehead You mean he said quietly that an airplane could not land It might try said Bell with a shrug But you couldn t judge your height above the water You might crash right into it and dive under Matter of fact you probably would Ortiz s nostrils quivered a little I told them he said steadily I told them it was not wise to risk He stopped He looked suddenly at his hands clenched upon the rail A depth of pallor even greater than his previous terrible paleness seemed to leave even his lips without blood He wavered on his feet as if he were staggering You re sick said Bell sharply Instinctively he moved forward The fine dark eyes regarded him oddly And Ortiz suddenly took his hands from the railing of the promenade deck He looked at his fingers detachedly And Bell could see them writhing opening and closing in a horribly sensate fashion as if they were possessed of devils and altogether beyond the control of their owner And he suddenly realized that the steady grim regard with which Ortiz looked at his hands was exactly like the look he had seen upon a man s face once when that man saw a venomous snake crawling toward him and had absolutely no weapon Ortiz was looking at his fingers as a man might look at cobras at the ends of his wrists Very calmly but with a still stunned horror He lifted his eyes to Bell I have no control over them he said quietly My hands are useless to me Senor Bell I wonder if you will be good enough to assist me to my cabin Again that deadly pallor flashed across his face Bell caught at his arm What is the matter he demanded anxiously Of course I ll help you Ortiz smiled very faintly If any airplane arrives in time he said steadily something may be done But you have rid me of even that hope I have been poisoned Senor Bell But the ship s doctor Ortiz walking rather stiffly beside Bell shrugged He can do nothing Will you be good enough to open this door for me And his voice was hoarse for an instant assist me to put my hands in my pockets I cannot But I would not like them to be seen Bill took hold of the writhing fingers He saw sweat standing out upon Ortiz s forehead And the fingers closed savagely upon Bell s hands tearing at them Ortiz looked at him with a ghastly supplication Now he said with difficulty if you will open the door Senor Bell Bell slid the door aside They went in together People were making the best of boresome weather within frankly yawning most of them But the card room would be full and the smoking room steward would be busy My cabin is upon the next deck below said Ortiz through stiff lips We we will descend the stairs Bell went with him his face expressionless My cabin should be unlocked said Ortiz It was Ortiz entered and with his hands still in his pockets indicated a steamer trunk Please open that He licked his lips I I had thought I would have warning enough It has not been so severe before Right at the top Bell flung the top back A pair of bright and shiny handcuffs lay on top of a dress shirt Yes said Ortiz steadily Put them upon my wrists please The poison that has been given to me is peculiar I believe that one of your compatriots has experienced its effects Bell started slightly Ortiz eyed him steadily Precisely Ortiz with his face a gray mask of horror spoke with a steadiness Bell could never have accomplished A poison Senor Bell which has made a member of the Secret Service of the United States a homicidal maniac It has been given to me I have been hoping for its antidote but Quick Senor Bell Quick The handcuffs CHAPTER II The throbbing of the engines went on at an unvarying tempo There was the slight almost infinitesimal tremor of their vibration The electric light in the cabin wavered rhythmically with its dynamo From the open porthole came the sound of washing water Now and then a disconnected sound of laughter or of speech came down from the main saloon Ortiz lay upon the bed exhausted It is perhaps humorous Senor Bell he said presently in the same steady voice he had used upon the deck It is undoubtedly humorous that I should call upon you I believe that you are allied with the Secret Service of your government Bell started to shake his head but was still He said nothing I am poisoned said Ortiz He tried to smile but it was ghastly It is a poison which makes a man mad in a very horrible fashion If I could use my hands and could trust them I would undoubtedly shoot myself It would be entirely preferable Instead I hope He broke off short and listened intently His forehead beaded Is that an airplane motor Bell went to the port and listened The washing of waves The throbbing of the ship s engines The dismal long drawn out moaning of the fog horn Nothing else Yes A dim and distant muttering It drew nearer and died away again That is a plane said Bell Yes It s out of hearing now Ortiz clamped his jaws together I was about to speak he said steadily to tell you many things Which your government should know Instead I ask you to go to the wireless room and have the wireless operator try to get in touch with that plane It is a two motored seaplane and it has a wireless outfit It will answer the call M S T R Ask him to use his directional wireless and try to guide it to the ship It brings the antidote to the poison which affects me Bell made for the door Ortiz raised his head with a ghastly smile Close the door tightly he said quietly I I feel as if I shall be unpleasant Closing the door behind him Bell felt rather like a man in a nightmare He made for the stairway bolted for the deck and fairly darted up the ladder to the wireless room Ortiz sent me he said to the operator You heard that plane just now See if you can get it The operator looked up at him beneath a green eyeshade and grinned crookedly Talking to em now he said The key flicked up and down and a tiny dancing spark leaped into being and vanished beneath its contact point The wireless room was dark save for the bright shaded light above the sending table A file of sent messages by an elbow A pad for messages received was by a hand Stray wreaths of tobacco smoke floated about the room leaping into view as they drifted beneath the lamp Is he bad asked the operator fascinatedly his eyes fixed on his key Bell felt his eyelids flicker Very bad he said shortly They tell me said the operator and shuddered your hands get working and you can t stop em I m playing I am I m playing The Master s game The key stopped He listened They re going to try to swoop over the ship and drop it he said a moment later I don t think they can But tell Ortiz they re going to try Bell s eyes were narrow It is not customary for a radio operator on a passenger ship to speak of an ex Cabinet Minister of the Argentine Republic by his surname only It bespeaks either impertinence or a certain very peculiar association Bell frowned imperceptibly for an instant thinking You ve had it he asked sharply God no I never took the chance I saw the red spots once and I went to Rib Say You got a password He was staring up at Bell Bell shrugged I m trying to help Senor Ortiz now The operator continued to stare his eyes full of suspicion Then he grimaced All right Go tell him they re going to drop it Bell went out Gray fog and washing seas and the big ship ploughing steadily on toward the south The horn blared startlingly loud and unspeakably doleful Bell listened for other sounds There were none Down the steep ladder to the promenade deck Paula Canalejas nodded to him I saw you speak to Senor Ortiz she said quietly You see Bell was beginning to have a peculiar horrible suspicion It was incredible but it was inevitable I think I see he said harshly But I don t dare believe it Keep quiet and don t speak to me unless I give you some sign it s safe It s hellish He went inside and swiftly down the stairs He found a steward hesitating outside the door of Ortiz s cabin He touched Bell s arm anxiously as he was about to go in Beg pardon sir he said and stammered I I heard mister Ortiz making some very strange noises sir I I thought he was sick He is said Bell grimly He told me he does not want a doctor though I m looking after him He closed the door behind him and Ortiz grinned at him It was a horrible a terrible grin and Ortiz fought it from his face with a terrific effort of will There was foam about his lips Dios It was it was devilish he gasped Senor Bell amigo mio for the love of the good God get my revolver from my trunk Give it to me Bell said shortly The airplane just radioed that it s going to try to swoop overhead and drop a package on board the steamer It doesn t dare alight in this fog I think gasped Ortiz I think it would be well to tie my feet Tie them fast If if the package comes if I if I am unpleasant knock me unconscious and pour it into my mouth I fear it is too late now But try it Through the port came the muttering of a seaplane s engines The noise died away Almost instantly the siren boomed hoarsely Ah Dios said Ortiz unsteadily There it is Senor Bell I think it is too late Would you would you assist me to go out on deck where I might fling myself overboard I think I can control my legs so long Steady said Bell wrenched by the sight of the man before him fighting against unnameable horror Tell me It is poison said Ortiz his features fixed in a terrible effort of will A ghastly a horrible poison of the Indios of Matto Grosso in Brazil It drives a man mad murder mad It is as if he were possessed by a devil His hands first refuse to obey him His feet next And then his body It is as if a devil had seized hold of his body and carried it about doing murder with it A part of the brain is driven insane and a man goes about shrieking with the horror of what crimes his body commits until the poison reaches that portion of his brain as well Then he is mad forever That is what I face amigo mio That is why I beg you I implore you to kill me or assist me to the side of the ship so that I may fling myself overboard The Master had it administered to me secretly and demanded treason as the price of the antidote He deman Steady and strong rising from a muttering to a steady roar the sound of airplane motors came through the port Bell started up Hold fast he snapped savagely I ll go get that package when it lands Hold fast I tell you Fight it He flung out of the cabin and raced up the stairs The door to the deck was open He crowded through a group of passengers who had discounted the dampness for the sake of a novelty an airplane far out at sea and raced up to the upper deck The roaring noise was receding The siren roared hoarsely Then the noise came back For minutes then the ship seemed to play hide and seek with the invisible fliers The roaring noise overhead circled about now near now seeming very far away And the siren sent its dismal blasts out into the grayness all about Then for an instant a swiftly scudding shadow was visible overhead It banked steeply and vanished and seemed to have turned and come lower when it reappeared a moment later It was not distinct at first It was merely a silhouette of darker gray against the all enveloping mist But its edges sharpened and became clear One could make out struts an aileron s trailing edge Got nerve anyhow said Bell grimly It swept across the ship and disappeared but the noise of its engines did not dwindle more than a little The blast of the siren seemed to summon it back again Once more it came in sight and this time it dived steeply flashed across the forecastle deck amid a hideous uproar desperately horribly close to the dangling derrick cables and was gone Bell had seen it more clearly than anyone else on the ship perhaps He saw a man in the pilot s cockpit between wings and tail reach high and fling something downward something with a long streamer attached to it Bell had an instant s glimpse of the goggled face Then he was darting forward watching the thing that fell It took only a second Two at most But the thing seemed to fall with infinite deliberation the streamer shivering out behind it It fell at a steep slant the forward momentum of the plane s speed added to its own drop It swooped down slanting toward the rail Bell groaned It struck the rail itself and bounced A sailor flung himself toward it The streamer slipped from his fingers and slithered over the side Bell was at the railing just in time to see it drop into the water He opened his mouth to shout and saw it sink The last of the streamer followed the dropped object down into the green water when it was directly below him His hands clenched Bell stared sickly at the spot where it had vanished An instant later he had whirled and was thrusting wide the wireless room door The operator was returning to his key grinning crookedly He looked up sidewise Tell them it went overside snapped Bell Tell them to try it again Ortiz is in hell To try again He s dying The operator looked up fascinatedly his fingers working his key Is he bad he asked with a shuddering interest He s dying snarled Bell in a rage because of his helplessness He had forgotten everything but the fact that a man below decks was facing the most horrible fate that can overtake a man and facing it with a steadfast gameness that made Bell s heart go out to him They don t die said the operator He shuddered They don t die of it His key stopped He listened His key clicked again They only had two packages he said a moment later They don t dare risk the other one They say the fog ends twenty miles farther on They re going to land up there and taxi back on the surface of the water It shouldn t be more than half an hour He pushed himself back from the table with an air of finality That s all They ve signed off Bell felt rage sweeping over him The operator grinned crookedly Better go down and tie him up he said and licked his lips with the fascinated air of one thinking of a known and terrifying thing Better tie him up tight It ll be half an hour more Bell went down the companion ladder The promenade was crowded with passengers now asking questions of each other Some frowning portentously thought the plane an unscheduled ocean flier who had lost his way in the fog Paula Canalejas was close to Bell as he shouldered his way through the crowd That was for him she asked without moving her lips Bell nodded Tell him she said quietly I pray for him Bell nodded abruptly and went into the saloon It was nearly empty He wiped the sweat off his face It was horrible to have to go down to Ortiz and tell him that at best it would be half an hour more Then there was a sudden scream below him and then a shot Bell jumped for the stairs his heart in his throat and saw Ortiz coming out of his stateroom door His eyes were wide and agonized His body Even in the incredibly short time before he reached the bottom of the steps Bell had time to receive the ghastly impression that Ortiz was sane but that his body had gone mad Ortiz s face was white and horrified His hands and arms were writhing savagely working at the handcuffs on his wrists His legs were carrying him at a curious padding trot down the hallway One of the hands held a glittering revolver A steward was crouched behind a couch his face white and filled with stark terror And Ortiz held his head back as if struggling to hold back and control his body which was under the control of a malignant demon Out of the way cried Ortiz in a voice of terrible despair Get someone to shoot me Kill me I cannot ah Dios The hands leveled the revolver in spite of him while he flung his head from side to side in a frantic attempt to disturb their aim Close your eyes panted Bell and hurled himself upon whom It was not Ortiz It was Ortiz s body gone mad and raging The manacled arms flailed about frenziedly The gun went off Again Again Bell struck He knocked the Thing that possessed Ortiz s body off its feet The hands groped for him They clubbed at him with the revolver The feet kicked Keep your eyes closed gasped Bell struggling to get the gun away from those horrible hands It it can t see when you keep your eyes closed Fighting insanely as the Thing was fighting he could not identify it with Ortiz himself One of the hands unclosed from about the revolver and clawed at his throat It seemed to abandon that effort and attacked Ortiz s face in a frenzy of rage struggling to claw his eyes open The other held the weapon fast with maniacal strength At the horror of feeling one of his own manacled hands attacking his face savagely as if it were itself a sensate thing Ortiz opened his eyes They were wide with despair The hand with the revolver made a sudden movement and Bell flung his weight upon it as the clutching hand pulled the trigger There was a deafening report The body seemed to weaken suddenly in Bell s grip It fought less and less terribly though with no lessening of its savagery He managed to get the revolver away from the hands that shook with unspeakable rage He flung it away and stood panting There was a crowd of people suddenly all about the place Staring stunned incredulous people who regarded Bell with a dawning damning suspicion Ortiz spoke suddenly His voice was weak but it was steady and it was full of a desperate relief I wish to make a statement he said sharply I I wished to commit suicide for personal reasons Senor Bell tried to dissuade me The handcuffs upon my wrists were placed there with my consent Senor Bell is my friend and has done me no wrong I shot myself with intention Bell beckoned to the ship s doctor Get him bandaged up he ordered harshly There s no need for him to die The body was writhing only feebly now Ortiz looked up at him and managed a smile Again there was that incredible impression of the body not belonging to Ortiz or Ortiz as a sane and whole and honorable admirable man and the feebly writhing body with its clutching hands as some evil thing that had properly been defeated and killed The doctor bent down It was useless of course He made futile movements I wish to speak to my friend Senor Bell said Ortiz weakly I I have not long Bell knelt beside him The Master s deputy in Rio panted Ortiz weakly almost in a whisper is is Ribiera In Buenos Aires I I do not know There was a man the one who poisoned me but I killed him Secretly I do not think the Master knows I pray that He stopped He could not speak again But he smiled and a few seconds later Bell clenched his hands Ortiz was gone Someone touched his arm Paula Canalejas He stared down at her and managed to smile It was not a very successful smile He drew a deep breath I would like said Bell wryly to think that when I die I will die as well as this man did But I m afraid I shan t But Paula said The airplane can be heard outside It seems to be moving on the surface And ten minutes later the plane loomed up out of the mist queerly ungainly on the surface of the water Its motors roared impatiently as if held in leash It swung clumsily about heading off out of sight in the fog to turn It came back sliding along the top of the water with its wing tip floats leaving alternate streaks of white foam behind them A man stood up in its after cockpit Bell crowded to the rail The man goggled and masked held up a package as if to fling it on board Bell watched grimly But he saw that the pilot checked himself and looked up at the upper deck Bell craned his neck The wireless operator was waving wildly to the seaplane He writhed his hands and held his hand to his head is if blowing out his brains and waved the plane away frantically The pilot of the plane sat down A moment later its motors roared more thunderously It is not safe to alight on either land or water when fog hangs low but there is little danger in taking off The seaplane shot away into the mist its motors bellowing The sound of its going changed subtly It seemed to rise and grow more distant It died away Bell halted at the top of the companion ladder and saw the wireless operator with a crooked nervous grin upon his face CHAPTER III Bell saw what he was looking for out in the throng of traffic that filled the Avenida do Acre in Rio He d seen it over the heads of the crowd which was undersized as most Brazilian crowds are and he managed to get through the perpetual jam on the mosaic sidewalk and reach the curb He stood there and regarded the vehicles filling the broad avenue wearing exactly the indifferent half amused air of a tourist with no place in particular to go and a great deal of time in which to go there Taxis chuffed past disputing right of way with private cars which were engaged in more disputes with other cars all in the rather extraordinary bad temper and contentiousness which comes to the Latin American when he takes the wheel of an automobile As if coming to an unimportant decision Bell raised his hand to an approaching cab It had two men on the chauffeur s seat Of course All taxis in Rio carry two men in front One drives and the other lights his cigarettes makes witty comments upon passing ladies and helps in collecting the fares from recalcitrant passengers The extra man is called the secretary and he assists materially in giving an impression of haughty pride The taxi ground to the curb The secretary reached behind him indifferently and opened the door Bell did not glance at him He stepped inside and settled down languidly The Beira Mar he said listlessly The taxi started off with a jolt It is the invariable custom in Rio de Janeiro And besides it reminds the passenger that he is merely a customer admitted to the cab on suffrance and that he must be suitably meek to those who will presently blandly ignore the amount registered by the meter and demand a fare of from eight to twenty seven times the indicated amount The cab went shooting down the Avenida do Acre toward the harbor The Avenida do Acre is officially the Avenida Rio Blanco and it should be called by that name only people forget The Beira Mar however is named with entire propriety It is actually the edge of the sea and it is probably one of the two or three most beautiful driveways in the world The cab whirled past the crowded sidewalks Incredible numbers of people with an incredible variation in the shades of their complexions moved to and from with the peculiar aimlessness of a Brazilian crowd A stout and pompous negro politician from Bahia wearing an orchid in his button hole rubbed elbows with a striking blonde lady of the sidewalks on his left and forced a wizened little silk hatted parda approximately an octoroon to dodge about him in order to progress A young and languid person his clothes the very last expiring gasp of fashion fingered his stick patiently He wore the painstakingly cultivated expression of bored disillusionment your young Brazilian dandy considers aristocratic It was very probable that he shared a particularly undesirable bedroom with four or five other young men in order to purchase such clothing but then farenda fita making a picture is the national Brazilian sport Bell lighted a cigarette It was not wise to regard the secretary of this particular taxi too closely but if his face had been thickly smeared with coal dust and if he had had a two weeks beard and if he had been seen on the forecastle of the Almirante Gomez one would have deduced him to be a stoker who had not used the name of Jamison The cab reached the Beira Mar and turned to take the long route about the bay It is one of the most beautiful views to be found anywhere and tall apartment houses have been built along its whole length to capitalize the scenery True the more brightly colored ladies of the capital have established themselves in vast numbers among these apartment houses but in their languid promenades they add let us say the beauties of art to those of nature A voice spoke from the chauffeur s seat Bell Right said Bell without moving His eyes flickered however and he found the device Jamison had inserted A speaking tube of sorts Not especially efficient but inconspicuous enough He stirred listlessly and got his lips near it All right to talk he asked briefly Shoot said Jamison from the secretary s seat beside the chauffeur This man doesn t understand English and he thinks I m in a smuggling gang He expects to make some money out of me eventually Bell spoke curtly while the taxi rolled past the Morro da Gloria with its quaint old church and went along the winding really marvelous driveway past many beaches with the incredibly blue water beyond Canalejas is out of town he said It isn t known when he ll be back I met his daughter at a dance at our Embassy here and she told me We didn t dare to talk much but she s frightened Especially after what happened to Ortiz And I ve met Ribiera whom Ortiz named I ve been looking him up growled Jamison through the speaking tube Bell flicked the ash from his cigarette out the door and went on quietly He s trying to get friendly with me I ve promised to call at his house and have him take me out to the flying field He has two planes he tells me a big amphibian and a two seater Uses them for commuting between Rio and his place back inland He went out of his way to cultivate me I think he suspects I m trying to find out something Which you are said Jamison dryly You ve found out that Ortiz was right at least about Bell nodded and frowned at himself for having nodded He spoke into the mouthpiece by his head with an expressionless face He s practically fawned upon by a bunch of important officials and several high ranking army officers Suspecting what I do I think he s got hold of a devil of a lot of power Jamison scowled in a lordly fashion upon a mere pedestrian who threatened to impede the movement of the taxicab by making it run over him Ortiz said Bell quietly told me he d been poisoned and treason asked as the price of the antidote I ve heard that the Brazilian Minister for Foreign Affairs went insane six months ago I heard also that it was homicidal mania murder madness And I m wondering if these people who fawn upon Ribiera aren t paying a price for well antidotes or their equivalent The Minister for Foreign Affairs may have refused You re improving said Jamison dryly The taxi rounded a curve and a vista of sea and sand and royal palms spread out before it Yes you re improving But Ortiz spoke of Ribiera only as a deputy of The Master Who is The Master God knows said Bell He stared languidly out of the window for all the world to see A tourist regarding the boasted beauties of the Biera Mar A deputy said Jamison without emotion of some unknown person called The Master poisoned Ortiz in Buenos Aires And Ortiz was an important man in the Argentine Ribiera is merely the deputy of that same unknown Master in Rio and he has generals and state presidents and the big politicians paying court to him If deputies in two countries that we know of have so much power how much power has The Master Silence The taxi chugged steadily past unnoticed beauties and colorings Rio is really one of the most beautiful cities in the world It s like this said Jamison jerkily Seven Service men vanish and one goes mad You get two tips that the fate of Ortiz is the fate of the seven men eight in fact We find that two men dispense a certain ghastly poison in two certain cities at the orders of a man they call The Master We find that those two men wield an astounding lot of power and we know they re only deputies only subordinates of the Master We know also that the Service men vanished all over the whole continent not in just those two cities How many deputies has The Master What s it all about He wanted treason of Ortiz we know What does he want of the other men his deputies have enslaved Why did he poison the Service men And why especially why do two honorable men officials of two important nations want to tip off the United States Government about the ghastly business What s it got to do with our nation Bell flung away his cigarette That last question has occurred to me too he observed and carefully repressed a slight shiver I have made a guess which is probably insane I m going to see Ribiera this afternoon He already suspects you know too much said Jamison without expression I am Bell managed the ghost of a mirthless smile I am uncomfortably aware of it And I may need an antidote as badly as Ortiz If I do and can t help myself I ll depend on you Jamison growled I simply mean said Bell very quietly that I d really rather not be er left alive if I m mad That s all But Ortiz knew what was the matter with him before he got bad off I know it s a risk I m goose flesh all over But somebody s got to take the risk The guess I ve made may be insane but if it s right one or two lives will be cheap enough as a price for the information Suppose you chaps turn around and take me to Ribiera s house There was a long pause Then Jamison spoke in Portuguese to his companion The taxi checked swerved and began to retrace its route You re a junior in the Trade said Jamison painstakingly I can t order you to do it Bell fumbled with his cigarette case The Trade doesn t exist Jamison he said dryly And besides nobody gives orders in The Trade There are only suggestions Now shut up a while I want to try to remember some consular reports I read once from the consul at Puerto Pachecho What The consul there said Bell smiling faintly was an amateur botanist He filled up his consular reports with accounts of native Indian medicinal plants and drugs with copious notes and clinical observations I had to reprove him severely for taking up space with such matters and not going fully into the exact number of hides wet and dry that passed through the markets in his district His information will be entirely useless in this present emergency but I m going to try to remember as much of it as I can Now shut up When the taxi swung off the Biera Mar to thread its way through many tree lined streets it is a misdemeanor punishable by fine to cut down a tree in Rio de Janeiro it carried a young American with the air of an accomplished idler who has been mildly bored by the incomparable view from the waterside boulevard When it stopped at the foot of one of the slum covered morros that dot all Rio and a liveried doorman came out of a splendid residence to ask the visitor his name the taxi discharged a young American who seemed to feel the heat in spite of the swift motion of the cab He wiped off his forehead with his handkerchief as he was assured that the Senhor Ribiera had given orders he was to be admitted night or day When the taxi drove off it carried two men on the chauffeur s seat of whom one had lost temporarily the manner of haughty insolence which is normally inseparable from the secretary of a taxicab chauffeur But though he wiped his forehead with his handkerchief Bell actually felt rather cold when he followed his guide through ornately furnished rooms which seemed innumerable and was at last left to wait in an especially luxurious salon There was a pause A rather long wait A distinctly long wait Bell lighted a cigarette and seemed to become mildly bored He regarded a voluptuous small statuette with every appearance of pleased interest A subtly decadent painting seemed to amuse him considerably He did not seem to notice that no windows at all were visible and that shaded lamps lit this room even in broad daylight Two servants came in a footman in livery and the major domo Your average Carioca servant is either fawning or covertly insolent These two were obsequious The footman carried a tray with a bottle glass ice and siphon The Senhor Ribiera announced the major domo obsequiously begs that the Senhor Bell will oblige him by waiting for the shortest of moments until the Senhor Ribiera can relieve himself of a business matter It will be but the shortest of moments Bell felt a little instinctive chill at sight of the bottle and glasses Oh very well he said idly You may put the tray there The footman lifted the siphon expectantly Bell regarded it indifferently The wait before the arrival of this drink had been longer than would be required merely for the announcing of a caller and the tending of a tray especially if such a tray were a custom of the place And the sending of a single bottle only without inquiry into his preferences No soda said Bell He poured out a drink into the tinier glass He lifted it toward his lips hesitated vaguely and drew out his handkerchief again He sneezed explosively and the drink spilled He swore irritably put down the glass and plied his handkerchief vigorously A moment later he was standing up and pouring the drink out afresh from the bottle in one hand to the glass in the other He up tilted the glass Get rid of this for me he said annoyedly of the handkerchief He saw a nearly imperceptible glance pass between the footman and the major domo They retired and Bell moved about the room exactly like a young man who has been discomfited by the necessity of sneezing before servants Anywhere else in the world of course such a pose would not have been convincing But your Brazilian not only adopts fazenda fita as his own avocation but also suspects it to be everybody else s too And a young Brazilian of the leisure class would be horribly annoyed at being forced to so plebeian an exhibition in public He moved restlessly about the room staring at the picture Presently he blinked uncertainly and gazed about less definitely He went rather uncertainly to the chair he had first occupied and sat down He poured or seemed to pour another drink Again he sneered and looked mortified He put down the glass with an air of finality But he looked puzzledly about him Then he sank back in his chair and gradually seemed to sink into a sort of apathetic indifference He looked then like a very bored young man on the verge of dozing off But actually he was very much alert indeed He had the feeling of eyes upon him for a while Then that sensation ceased and he settled himself to wait And meantime he felt a particular peculiar gratitude to the late American consul at Puerto Pachecho for his interest in medicinal plants That gentleman had gone into the subject with the passionate enthusiasm of the amateur He had described icus uirari and timbo He had particularized upon makaka nimbi and hervamoura And he had gone into a wealth of detail concerning yague on account of its probable value if used in criminology As consul at Puerto Pachecho he was not altogether a success in some ways but he had invented an entirely original method of experimentation upon those drugs and poisons which did not require to be introduced into the blood stream His method was simplicity itself An alcoholic solution carried a minute quantity of the drug in its vapor just as an alcoholic solution carries a minute quantity of perfuming essential oil He inhaled the odor of the alcoholic solution The effect was immediately strictly temporary and not dangerous He was enabled to describe the odors in some cases the tastes and in a few instances the effects of the substances he listed from personal experience And Bell had used his method as an unpromising but possible test for a drug in the drink that had been brought him He inhaled the strangling odor of the spilled liquor on his handkerchief And there was a drug involved For an instant he was dizzy and for an instant he saw the room through a vivid blue haze And something clicked in his brain and said It s yague And the relief of dealing with something which he knew if only at second hand was so enormous that he felt almost weak Yague you see is an extract from the leaves of a plant which is not yet included in materia medica It has nearly the effect of scopolamine once famous in connection with twilight sleep and produces a daze of blue light an intolerable sleepiness and practically all the effects of hypnotism A person under yague as under scopolamine or hypnosis will seem to slumber and yet will obey any order by whomever given He will answer any question without reserve or any concealment And on awakening he will remember nothing done under the influence of the potion The effects are not particularly harmful Bell then sat in an apparent half daze half slumber in the salon in which he waited for Ribiera to appear He knew exactly what he was expected to do Ribiera wanted to find out what he knew or suspected about Ortiz s death Ribiera wanted to know many things and he would believe what Bell told him because he thought Bell had taken enough yague to be practically an hypnotic subject Let Ribiera believe what he was told When he came into the room bland and smiling Bell did not stir He was literally crawling inside with an unspeakable repulsion to the man and the things for which he stood But he seemed dazed and dull and when Ribiera began to ask questions he babbled his answers in a toneless flat voice He babbled very satisfactorily in Ribiera s view When Ribiera shook him roughly by the shoulder he started and let his eyes clear Ribiera was laughing heartily Senhor Senhor said Ribiera jovially My hospitality is at fault You come to be my guest and I allow you to be so bored that you drop off to sleep I was detained for five minutes and came in to find you slumbering Bell stared ruefully about him and rubbed his eyes I did for a fact he admitted apologetically I m sorry Up late last night and I was tired I dropped in to see those planes you suggested I d be interested in But I daresay it s late now Ribiera chuckled again He was in his late and corpulent forties and was something of a dandy If one were captious one might object to the thickness of his lips They suggested sensuality And there was a shade a bare shade more of pigment in his skin than the American passes altogether unquestioned And his hair was wavy But he could be a charming host We ll have a drink he said bluntly while the car s coming around to the door and then go out to the flying field No drink said Bell lifting his hand I feel squeamish now I say Haven t you changed the lamps or something Everything looks blue That was a lie Things looked entirely normal to Bell But he looked about him as if vaguely puzzled If he had drunk the liquor Ribiera had sent him things would have had a bluish tinge for some time after But as it was Ribiera chaffed him jovially on the way to the flying field And introducing him to fliers and officials of the field he told with gusto of Bell s falling asleep while waiting for him A very jolly companion Ribiera But Bell saw two or three men looking at him very queerly Almost sympathetically And he noticed a little later that a surprising number of fliers and officials of the airport seemed to be concealing an abject terror of Ribiera One or two of them seemed to hate him as well CHAPTER IV Bell stepped out of a tall French window to a terrace and from the terrace to the ground There was a dull muttering in the sky to the east and a speck appeared drew nearer swiftly grew larger and became a small army biplane It descended steeply to earth behind a tall planting of trees Bell lighted a cigarette and moved purposelessly down an elaborately formalized garden More victims he observed grimly to himself of the plane Ribiera lifted a pigmented hand to wave languidly from a shaded chair There were women about him three of them and it sickened Bell to see the frightened assiduity with which they flattered him Bell had met them of course Madame the wife of the State President of Bahia in the United States of Brazil the states have presidents instead of governors preferred the title of Madame because it was more foreign and consequently more aristocratic than Senhora And Madame the wife of the General Senhor called Ribiera blandly I have news for you Bell turned and went toward him with an air of pleased expectancy He noticed for the first time the third of the women Young in the first flush of youthful maturity but with an expression of stark terror lingering behind a palpably assumed animation An acquaintance of yours Senhor said Ribiera is to be my guests Bell steeled himself The Senhor Canalejas said Ribiera beaming and his daughter Bell seemed to frown and then seemed to remember Oh yes he said carelessly I met her in Washington She was on the Almirante Gomez coming down The next instant he saw Ribiera s expression and cursed himself for a fool Ribiera s eyes had narrowed sharply Then they half closed and he smiled She is charming said Ribiera in drowsy contentment and I had thought you would be glad to improve her acquaintance Especially since as my friend you may congratulate me A contract of marriage is under discussion Bell felt every muscle grow taut The fat pigmented man before him Indeed said Bell politely I do congratulate you Ribiera looked at him with an expression in which a sardonic admiration mingled with something else less pleasant You are clever Senhor Bell he said heavily seeming to sink more deeply into his chair Very clever He shifted his eyes to the women who stood about him You may go he said indifferently His tone was exactly that of a despot dismissing his slaves Two of them colored with instinctive resentment His eyes lingered an instant on the third Her face had showed only a passionate relief You Senhora he said heavily may wait nearby The terror returned to her features but she moved submissively to a spot a little out of earshot Bell found his jaws clenched There is a certain racial taint widespread in Brazil which leads to an intolerable arrogance when there is the slightest opportunity for its exercise Ribiera had the taint and Bell felt a sickening wrath at the terrified submission of the women Si said Ribiera suddenly adverting to insolence You are clever Senhor Bell Where did you learn of yague Bell inhaled leisurely His muscles were tense but he gave no outward sign Instead he sat down comfortably upon the arm of a chair facing Ribiera s The only way to meet insolence is with equal insolence and a greater calm Ah said Bell pleasantly So you found out it didn t work after all Ribiera s eyes contracted He became suddenly enraged You are trifling with me he said furiously Do you know the penalty for that Why yes said Bell and smiled amiably A dose of er poison of The Master s private brand It was a guess but based on a good deal of evidence Ribiera turned crimson then pale What do you know he demanded in a deadly quietness You cannot leave this place You are aware of that The people here guests and servants are my slaves the slaves of The Master You cannot leave this place except also as my slave I will have you bound and given yague so that you cannot fail to tell me anything that I wish to know I will have you tortured so that you will gladly say anything that I wish in return for death I will You will said Bell dryly drop dead with seven bullets in your body if you give a signal for anyone to attack me Ribiera stared at him as his hand rested negligently in his coat pocket And then quite suddenly Ribiera began to chuckle His rage vanished He laughed a monstrous gross cackling laughter You have been my guest for two days he gasped slapping his fat knees and you have not noticed that your pistol his been tampered with Senhor Bell Senhor Bell My uncle will be disappointed in you It seemed to impress him as a victory that Bell had been depending upon an utterly futile threat for safety It restored his good humor marvelously It does not matter he said jovially Presently you will tell me all that I wish to know More perhaps My uncle is pleased with you You recall your little talk with the wireless operator on the Almirante Gomez You tried to learn things from him Senhor He reported it Of course All our slaves report He sent his report to my uncle The Master and I did not have it until to day I will admit that you deceived me I knew you had talked with Ortiz who was a fool I thought that in his despair he might have spoken I gave you yague as I thought and informed my uncle that you knew nothing And he is very much pleased with you It was clever to deceive me about the yague My uncle has high praise for you He has told me that he desires your services Bell inhaled again There was no question but that Ribiera was totally unafraid of the threat he had made His gun must have been tampered with the firing pin filed off perhaps So Bell said placidly Well He desires my services Ribiera chuckled in his gross and horrible good humor He will have them Senhor He will have them When you observe your hands writhing at the ends of your wrists you will enter his service through me Of course And he will reward you richly Money much money such as I have And slaves such as I have The Senhora Ribiera looked at the terrified girl standing thirty or forty feet away He chuckled again My uncle desires that you should be induced to enter his service of your own will So Senhor you shall see first what my uncle s service offers And later when you know what pleasures you may some day possess as my uncle s deputy in your own nation why then the fact that your hands are writhing at the ends of your wrists will be merely an added inducement to come to me And I bear you no ill will for deceiving me You may go Bell rose And still he said dryly I suspect that you are deceived But now you deceive yourself He heard Ribiera chuckling as he walked away He heard him call amusedly Senhora He heard the little gasp of terror with which the girl obeyed He passed her stumbling toward the gross fat man with the light brown skin and curly hair Her eyes were literally pools of anguish Bell threw away his cigarette and began to fumble for another He was beginning to feel the first twinges of panic and fought them down Ribiera had not lied Bell had been at this fazenda of his which was almost a miniature Versailles three hundred miles from Rio for two days In all that time he had not seen one person besides himself who did not display the most abject terror of Ribiera Ribiera had made no idle boast when he said that everyone about guests and servants were slaves They were Slaves of a terror vastly greater than mere fear of death It Senhor Oh Dios It was the girl s voice in despair Ribiera laughed Bell felt a red mist come before his eyes He deliberately steadied his hands and lighted his cigarette He heard stumbling footsteps coming behind him A hand touched his arm He turned to see the girl Ribiera had pointed out her cheeks utterly chalky white trying desperately to smile Senhor she gasped Smile at me For the love of God smile at me In the fraction of a second Bell was mad with rage He understood and he hated Ribiera with a corrosive hatred past conception And then he was deathly calm and wholly detached and he smiled widely and turned and looked at Ribiera and Ribiera s whole gross bulk quivered as he chuckled Bell took the girl s arm with an excessive politeness and managed he never afterward understood how he managed it to grin at Ribiera Senhora he said in a low tone I think I understand Stop being afraid We can fool him Come and walk with me and talk The idea is that he must think you are trying to fascinate me is it not She spoke through stiffened lips Ah that I could die Bell had a horrible part to play while he walked the length of the formal garden with her and found a pathway leading out of it and led her out of sight He stopped Now he said sharply tell me I am not yet his slave He has ordered you She was staring before her with wide eyes that saw only despair I I am to persuade you to be my lover she said dully or I shall know the full wrath of The Master Bell asked questions crisply but as gently as he could We are his slaves she told him apathetically I and mi Arturo my husband Both of us She roused herself little under Bell s insistent questioning We were guests at his house at dinner Our friends people high in society and in the Republic were all about us We suspected nothing We had heard nothing But two weeks later Arturo became irritable He said that he saw red spots before his eyes I also Then Arturo s hands writhed at the ends of his wrists He could not control them His nerves were horrible And mine And we we have a tiny baby And Senhor Ribiera called upon my husband He was charming He observed my husband s hands He had a remedy he said He gave it to my husband He became normal again And then my hands writhed Senhor Ribiera told my husband that if he would bring me to him And I was relieved We were grateful We accepted the invitation of the Senhor Ribiera to this place And he showed us a man in chains He he went mad before our eyes He was a member of the United States Secret Service And then the Senhor Ribiera told us that we faced the same fate if we did not serve him Bell had thrust aside rage as useless now He was deliberately cold And so It is a poison she said unsteadily A deadly a horrible poison which drives men murder mad in two weeks from the time of its administration The Senhor Ribiera has an antidote for it But mixed with the antidote which acts at once is more of the horrible poison which will act in two weeks more So that we are entrapped If we disobey him Bell began to smile slowly and not at all mirthfully I think he said softly that I shall gain a great deal of pleasure from killing the Senhor Ribiera Dios She strangled upon the word Do you not see Senhor that if he dies we we She stopped and choked We have a tiny baby Senhor We we would Again sick rage surged up in Bell To kill Ribiera meant to drive his slaves mad and mad in the most horrible fashion that can be imagined To kill Ribiera meant to have these people duplicate the death of Ortiz as their greatest hope or to fill madhouses with snarling animals lusting to kill It is it is not only I Senhor said the girl before him She was utterly listless and in the agony of despair It is Arturo also The Senhor Ribiera has said that if I do not persuade you that both Arturo and I And our little baby Senhor Our families also will be entrapped some day He has said so He will give that poison to our baby And it will grow up either his slave or Her eyes were pools of panic Oh God said Bell very quietly And he s offering me this power He s trying to persuade me to become like him He s offering me pleasures He laughed unpleasantly And then he went sick with helplessness He could kill Ribiera perhaps and let only God know how many people go mad Perhaps Or perhaps Ribiera would merely be supplanted by another man Ortiz had said that he killed The Master s deputy in Buenos Aires but that another man had taken his place And the thing went on And The Master desired a deputy in the United States Somehow said Bell very softly this has got to be stopped Somehow Right away That devilish stuff Can you get hold of a bit of the antidote he asked abruptly The merest drop of it She shook her head No Senhor It is given in food in wine One never knows that one has had it It is tasteless and we have only Senhor Ribiera s word that it has been given Bell s hands clenched So devilish clever What are we going to do The girl stuffed the corner of her handkerchief into her mouth I am thinking of my little baby she said choking I must persuade you Senhor I I have been tearful I I am not attractive I will try If I am not attractive to you Bell cursed deeply and savagely It seemed to be the only possible thing to do And then he spoke coldly Listen to me Senhora Ribiera talked frankly to me just now He knows that so far I am not subdued If I escape he cannot blame you He cannot And I am going to attempt it If you will follow me There is no escape for me she said dully and if he thinks that I knew of your escape and did not tell him Follow me said Bell smiling queerly I shall take care that he does not suspect it He gazed about for an instant orienting himself The plane that had just landed the last of a dozen or more that had arrived in the past two days had dipped down on the private landing field to the north There was a beautifully kept way running from the landing field to the house and he went on through the thick shrubbery amid a labyrinth of paths choosing the turnings most likely to lead him to it He came out upon it suddenly and faced toward the field There were two men coming toward the house on foot One was a flying pilot still in his flying clothes The other was a tall man for a Brazilian with the lucent clarity of complexion that bespeaks uncontaminated white descent He was white haired and his face was queerly tired as if he were exhausted Bell looked sharply He seemed to see a resemblance to someone he knew in the tall man He spoke quickly to the girl beside him Who is the man to the left Senhor Canalejas said the girl drearily He is the Minister of War I suppose he too Bell drew a deep breath He walked on confidently As the two others drew near he said apologetically Senhores They halted with the instinctive at least surface courtesy of the Brazilian And Bell was fumbling with his handkerchief rather nervously tying a knot in it He held it out to Canalejas Observe It was of course a recognition knot such as may be given to an outsider by one in the Trade The tall man s face changed And Bell swung swiftly and suddenly and very accurately to the point of the other man s jaw He collapsed Senhor Canalejas said Bell politely I am about to go and steal an airplane to take what I have learned to my companion for transmission If you wish to go with me Canalejas stared for the fraction of a second Then he said quietly But of course He turned to retrace his steps Bell turned to the girl If you are wise he said gently you will go and give the alarm If you are kind you will delay it as much as you dare She regarded him in agonized doubt for a moment and nodded She fled Now said Bell casually I think we had better hasten And I hope Senhor Canalejas that you have a revolver We will need one Mine has been ruined Without a word the white haired man drew out a weapon and offered it to him I had intended he said very calmly to kill the Senhor Ribiera His last demand is for my daughter They went swiftly The plane Bell had seen alight some fifteen or twenty minutes before was just being approached by languid mechanics It was of course still warm Canalejas shouted and waved his arm imperiously It is probable that he gave the impression of a man returning for some forgotten thing left in the cockpit of the plane What happened then happened quickly A few crisp words in a low tone A minor hubbub began suddenly back at the house Canalejas climbed into the passenger s seat as if looking for something And Bell presented his now useless automatic pleasantly at the head of the nearest staring mechanic and while he froze in horror scrambled up into the pilot s cockpit Contact he snapped and turned on the switch The mechanic remained frozen with fear Damnation said Bell savagely I don t know the Portuguese for Turn her over He fumbled desperately about in the cockpit Something whirred The propeller went over Canalejas shot with painstaking accuracy twice The motor caught with a spluttering roar As a horde of running figures servants and guests running with the same desperation came plunging out on the flying field from the shrubbery Bell gave the motor the gun The fast little plane s tail came up off the ground as she darted forward Faster and faster with many bumpings The bumpings ceased She was clear And Bell zoomed suddenly to lift her over the racing fear ridden creatures who clutched desperately at the wheels and then the little ship shot ahead barely cleared the trees to the east of the field and began to roar at her topmost speed toward Rio CHAPTER V The Trade which does not exist has its obligations and its code but also it has its redeeming features When a man has finished his job he has finished it And as far as the Trade was concerned Bell had but little more to do But after that and his eyes burned smokily in their depths there was much that he intended to do He sat in one of the bondes of the Botanical Garden half of the street railway system of Rio and absent mindedly regarded the scenery This particular bonde was headed out toward the Lagoa Rodrigo de Freitas by which salty mass of water Bell would meet Paula Canalejas He would receive a package from her which he would deliver to Jamison And then he would be free and it was his private intention to engage in an enterprise which was very probably a form of suicide But there are some things one cannot dismiss with a sage reflection that they are not one s business This matter of Ribiera was definitely one of them The escape from Ribiera s fazenda had been relatively easy because so thoroughly unexpected The little plane had climbed to five thousand feet and found a stratum of cloud that stretched for very many miles Bell had emerged from it only twice in the first hour of flight and the second time the sky was clear all about him That he was pursued he had no doubt That Ribiera had wireless communications with Rio he knew And he knew that instant and imperative orders would have gone out for his capture Rio would not be a healthy place for him If Ribiera had power over high government officials he had surely indirect power over the police and a search for Bell would be in order at once Yet Canalejas assuredly expected to return to Rio A shouted question with the motor cut out and a nodded answer Bell headed for Petropolis which is Rio s only real summer resort and is high in the hills and only an hour and a half from it by train It was surprisingly satisfactory to be handling a swift plane again and Bell allowed himself what he knew was about the only pleasure he was likely to have for some time to come Something of his hatred of Ribiera however came back as he prepared to land He managed to crack the plane up very neatly so that it would be of no use to Ribiera any more And at the same time of course the cracking up provided an excellent excuse for Canalejas to continue on by train They talked very briefly by the puffing engine It is best said Canalejas for you Senhor to remain here overnight I believe Senhor Ribiera has given orders for us both to be looked for yet as a Cabinet Minister I am still immune from arrest by the ordinary police If I reach my home I shall be able to do all that is necessary And you will prepare a message for me to carry said Bell It is ready said Canalejas He smiled faintly No Senhor I have instructions to give my daughter She will deliver the information to you to morrow Let me see At the edge of the Lagao Rodrigo de Feitas at nine o clock She is the only messenger I can trust I think that is all Bell hesitated uncomfortably But you sir he said awkwardly You have been poisoned as Senor Ortiz was But certainly said Canalejas His smile was ironic as before But unlike Senor Ortiz I have no hope I have arranged for my daughter to conceal herself and escape from Brazil I have prepared for everything Senhor As you know I had intended to kill Senhor Ribiera In returning with you I have merely delayed my own death by a few hours Still smiling and with the air of one entering a train for the most casual of journeys Canalejas entered the coach And Bell sitting in the bonde next morning saw with an uncanny clarity the one weak point in Ribiera s hold upon his subjects When they had courage to fear nothing more than death they could defy him And not many could attain to that courage But a few I ll have some help anyway muttered Bell savagely to himself It is a long ride to the Botanical Gardens from which one half the surface lines of Rio take their name On the way out to the Lagao Rodrigo de Feitas which is close by the Garden itself Bell had time to work over for the thousandth time the information he possessed and realize its uselessness Two things only might be of service One was that Ribiera was the nephew of the person referred to as The Master and yet was evidently as much subjected to him as his own victims to himself The other was that the ultimate end of all the ghastly scheme was in some fashion political If wealth alone had been Ribiera s aim the gathering of his slaves would have had a different aspect The majority of them would have been rich men men of business men who could pay out hundreds of thousands a month in the desperate hope of being permitted to remain sane There would not have been politicians and officials and officers of the army The key men of the country growled Bell inaudibly enslaved to Ribiera They give him the power he s after more than cash And it s those key men who have more to lose than money There s such a thing as honor Three times the conductor stopped beside him and suggestively rattled the coins in his box Three times Bell absent mindedly paid the fare for the zone But the ride is a long one and he had had time to realize the hopelessness of any single handed attack upon the thing he faced long before the end Then he absently moved through the amazing collection of tropic and near tropic growths that is the Botanical Garden until he came at once to Paula and the Lagoa Rodrico de Freitas It was alive with birds and they hopped and pecked and squabbled without acrimony within feet of her seated figure Bell knew that she had been waiting for a long time He looked quickly at her face It was quite pale but entirely tearless Here is the message Senhor Bell she said quietly but I think I have been followed Bell growled in his throat I did not discover it until I reached this spot she said evenly And I did not know what to do If I left I would be seized and the message taken and I think that someone would have waited here for you So in part to gain time and in part because I hoped you might have some resource I remained How many of them asked Bell shortly Two she said quietly She looked at him her large eyes entirely calm and grave Give me the package said Bell briefly They ll be more anxious to get it back than to bother you And I ll either knock them cold or hold them in a scrap until you get away She reached in her pocket and handed him a small thick envelope He stuffed it in the side pocket of his coat I will walk away he observed and they ll follow me Can you arrange to give me some sign that you re safe By the gateway she told him My handkerchief I shall start as soon as you have vanished If I am followed I will drop this handkerchief as it is If I am not followed I will tie a knot But what can you do I ll do something said Bell coldly Something She smiled with the same odd bitterness her father had shown My father shot himself she said briefly I have no particular hope of doing better But I shall not be Ribiera s slave She remained quite still Bell moved away He hurried There was thick jungle ahead a section of the Gardens that is painstakingly preserved untouched and undisturbed that visitors to the capital of Brazil may observe a typical sample of the virgin interior He dived into that jungle as if in flight And very shortly after two men dived in after him They hesitated these men because your policeman of Rio does not like to injure his uniform and there are many thorns in jungle growths But they entered it having first drawn small glittering weapons And then from the jungle came silence It seemed to be silence But there may have been some small unusual noises It would not be easy to tell if they were unusual or not because there are peculiar flashes of charm in certain Brazilian institutions The preservation of the spot of jungle itself is one Another is the fact that in the Gardens all manner of wild things live at large and provide unexpected and delightful surprises to the usually foreign visitors So there were noises after a bit Such noises as some grunting wild thing might have made perhaps But they might also have been the gasping of a man as breath was choked out of him And there was a cracking sound a little later which might of course have been any one of any number of accidental and perfectly natural causes And it might have been a man upon whom another man had hurled himself when the second man landed on his jaw And thrashing noises a little later might have been anything But after what seemed a long time Bell emerged Alone He was breathing quickly and there were scratches on his face and hands which well which might have been made by thorns He went swiftly back toward the spot where Paula had waited He looked cautiously She was gone And then Bell went leisurely in the studious fashion of a person going through the Botanical Gardens because it was the thing to do toward the gateway and the surface cars As he neared the gate his eyes roved with apparent casualness all about He saw a tiny speck of white on the edge of the roadway It looked as if it had been flung from a car Bell picked it up It was Paula s handkerchief and there was no knot whatever in it In fact its lacy edge was torn They ve got her said Bell apparently unmoved He waited for a car A bulky figure wearing thick spectacles came placidly from the Gardens It waited also for the car The car arrived in its two sections of first and second class the first reserved for cavalhieros which is to say persons wearing coat shirt collar necktie hat shoes and socks and carrying no parcel larger than a brief case Lesser folk who lacked any of the sartorial requirements for admission to the first class section or wore tomancos instead of shoes heaped themselves into the second section and paid one third of the fare in the first Bell took his seat in the first section It was comfortably filled The bulky person with the thick spectacles wedged himself carefully into the space beside Bell He unfolded a copy of the Jornal do Commercio and began to regard the advertisements Presently he found what he was looking for O Bicho said medium sized type Beside it was a picture of a kangaroo The gentleman with the thick spectacles resignedly fished into his pockets and found a lottery ticket He tore it into scraps and threw them away Then he began to gaze disinterestedly at the scenery and the other passengers in the car Bell drummed on his knee With one s forefinger representing a dot and one s second finger serving as a dash it is surprising how naturally and absentmindedly one may convey a perfectly intelligible message to a man sitting within a reasonable distance When the man is alongside the matter is absurdly simple Presently the man with the thick lenses got out his paper again as if bored by vistas such as no other city in the world can offer His paper was in the pocket which pressed against Bell If in getting out his newspaper he also abstracted a thick fat envelope from Bell s pocket and placed it in his own and if all this took place under a sign even in the section reserved for cavalhieros of approved raiment solemnly warning passengers against batadores de carteiras or pickpockets well it was an ironical coincidence whose humor Bell did not see He was busily tapping out on his knee the briefest possible account of what he had learned at Ribiera s fazenda up country One chance for me he tapped off at the end If I can kidnap Ribiera I can make him talk Somehow He has big amphibian plane kept fueled and ready for long trip I think he is back in Rio to direct hunt for me Paula kidnapped My job finished On my own now The man with thick spectacles did not nod He seemed to be looking idly at his paper but it was folded at an article very discreetly phrased beneath a photograph of Senhor Teixeira Canalejas Minister of War who had very unfortunately been found dead that morning He had been depressed of late but there were certain circumstances which made it as yet impossible to determine whether he had killed himself or was the victim of an assassin Getting set for me tapped Bell grimly on his knee Ribiera told me too much The man with thick spectacles yawned and turned the paper over Under a smaller headline which would only find a place on a Brazilian sheet A Regrettable Incident an item of more direct importance was printed It told of an unnamed Senhor from the United States of the North America who as the guest of a widely known Brazilian gentleman had behaved most boorishly had stolen an airplane from his host and broken it to bits on landing unskilfully and had vanished with priceless heirlooms belonging to his host It read virtuously No names are mentioned because the American Senhor has been widely introduced in Rio society as a person with an official status in Washington It is understood that an inquiry is to be made of the Ambassador as to the status of the young man before any action is taken by the police It is to be expected however that he will at least be requested to leave the country Bell managed the barest flicker of a smile Arrest of course Detention most courteously arranged while the Ambassador was communicated with And Ribiera Give me dismiss he tapped on his knee The gentleman in the thick spectacles ran his finger thoughtfully about the edge of his collar In the Trade that is a signal of many varied meanings A hand across the throat in any fashion means Clear out your job is finished Save your skin as best you can and Get away without trying to help me according to circumstances In this case it relieved Bell of all future responsibility He yawned tapping his lips with the back of his hand signaled for a stop of the car and got out Five minutes later he had signaled a taxicab and given Ribiera s address In six minutes he was being whirled toward the one house in all Rio de Janeiro from which his chance of a safe departure was slightest In little more than half an hour he had dismissed the cab and was gazing placidly into the startled eyes of the doorman The doorman like all of Rio where Ribiera was known and feared knew that Bell was being hunted Bell handed over his card with an inscrutable air The Senhor Ribiera he said drily returned to the city last night Present my card and say that I would like to speak to him The doorman ushered him inside and summoned the major domo still blinking his amazement And the major domo blinked again But Bell followed with the air of an habitue as he was again ushered into the luxurious salon in which he had once been offered a drugged drink Again he sank down in a softly padded chair and surveyed the pictures and the minor objects of decadent art about him Again he lighted a cigarette with every appearance of ease and again had the impression of eyes upon him The major domo appeared somewhat agitated The Senhor Ribiera he said harshly will see you only if you are not armed He requires your word of honor Bell smiled lazily I ll do better than that he said languidly I haven t had time to buy a revolver But the automatic he had put out of commission is in my pocket Present it to him with my compliments He handed over the weapon butt first The major domo blinked and took it Bell sat down and smiled widely He had been expected to be uproarious to attempt to force the major domo to lead him to Ribiera And of course he would have been led past a perfectly planned ambush for his capture but he might have killed the major domo Which would not disturb Ribiera but had disturbed the servant Bell smoked comfortably And suddenly hangings parted and Ribiera came into the room He smiled nervously and then as Bell blew a puff of smoke at him and nodded casually he scowled I came said Bell deliberately to make a bargain Frankly I do not like to break my word I was under obligations to deliver a package from Senhor Canalejas to a certain messenger who will take it to my government I have done it But I am not Senhor Ribiera a member of the Secret Service I am entirely a free agent now and I am prepared to consider your proposals which I could not in honor do before He smiled pleasantly Effrontery properly managed is one of the most valuable of all qualities Especially in dealing with people who themselves are arrogant when they dare Ribiera purpled with rage and then controlled it Ah he rumbled You are prepared to consider my proposals There are no proposals The Master may be amused at your cleverness in escaping I do not know I do know that I am ordered to make you my slave and send you to The Master That I shall do Perhaps said Bell blandly but I can go without food and drink for several days which will delay the process And while I cannot honorably tell you how to stop the man bearing Senhor Canalejas package to my government still If I willingly accepted a dose of yague in token of my loyalty to The Master Ribiera s good humor returned He chuckled You actually mean he said jovially that you think you were given some of The Master s little compound and that you wish to make terms before your hands begin to writhe at the ends of your wrists Is not that your reason Bell s eyes flickered He had been horribly afraid of just that But Ribiera s amusement was reassuring Perhaps said Bell Perhaps I am Ribiera sat down and stretched his fat legs in front of him He surveyed Bell with an obscene horrible amusement Ah Senhor he chuckled some day we will laugh together over this You yet hope and do not yet know how much better it will be for you if you cease to hope and cultivate desires The Master is pleased with you You have just those qualities he knows are necessary in dealing with your nation He is not angry with you It is his intention to use you to extend his ah influence among the officials of your nation You know of course that in but a little more time I will hold all Brazil as I now hold this city in the hollow of my hand Four of the republics of this continent are already completely under the control of The Master s deputies and of the rest Brazil is not the most nearly subdued A year or two and The Master will become Emperor and his deputies viceroys And it is his whim to give you the opportunity of becoming the first deputy and the first viceroy of North America And you come to me and offer you Senhor to make terms I believe even The Master will laugh when he hears of it But said Bell practically do you accept my terms Ribiera chuckled again What are they Senhor That you release the daughter of the Senhor Canalejas and pledge your word of honor that she will not be enslaved Ribiera s word of honor of course would be worth rather less than the breath that was used to give it But his reception of the proposal would be informative He chuckled again No Senhor I do not accept But I will promise you as a favor because my uncle The Master admires you that within a few weeks you shall enjoy her charms I do not he added with amused candor find that any one woman diverts me for a very long time Oh said Bell very quietly He sat still for an instant and then shrugged and looked about as if for an ash tray in which to knock the ashes from his cigarette He stood up carrying the tube of tobacco gingerly and moved toward one by Ribiera s elbow He knocked off the ash and crushed out the tiny coal He fumbled in his pockets The next instant Ribiera choked with terror Let me explain said Bell softly I did not give your major domo my word that I was unarmed I merely gave him a weapon I got these from two policemen who tried to arrest me an hour or so ago And I also remind you Senhor that if the armed men you have posted to prevent my escape try to shoot me that the inevitable contraction of my muscles will send two bullets into your heart even if I am dead I am a dead man Senhor if you give the word but so are you if you give it Ribiera gasped His eyes rolled in his head Send for her said Bell very gently Send for her Senhor I estimate that she has been in this house for less than half an hour Have her brought here at once and if she has been harmed the three of us will perish very promptly and half of Rio will go mad after our death And the muzzles of two revolvers bored into the fat flesh of Ribiera s body and a gasp that was almost a wail of terror came from the watchers armed watchers who dared not kill the man they had been posted to guard Ribiera against Ribiera lifted his hand and croaked an order To be continued Advertisement Brigands of the Moon The Book of Gregg Haljan PART THREE OF A FOUR PART NOVEL By Ray Cummings Illustration Light rays and silent flashes seemed to envelop us Sidenote Gregg and Anita risk quick sure death in a desperate bluff on the ruthless Martian brigands WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE One day in twenty seventy five the Interplanetary Space Ship Planetara left the Earth for Mars I Gregg Haljan was third officer It was destined to be a tragic voyage For in our midst were unscrupulous brigands masquerading as harmless passengers intent on seizing the secret treasure of radium ore Johnny Grantline of the Grantline Expedition had dug from the Moon The Planetara was to stop on the Moon and pick the treasure up on her return trip from Mars Miko a giant Martian and his sister Moa were the ringleaders With them were as passengers Sir Arthur Coniston and Ob Hahn a Venus mystic The whole crew was in their pay Miko struck The captain was killed as were the officers Only Snap Dean the radio helio operator Venza a girl of Venus and I were left And of course Anita Prince who had captivated my heart upon my first glimpse of her The brigands abandoned the other passengers on a small asteroid and Miko signaled his space ship far off on Mars to meet him on the Moon I was forced to guide the Planetara to the Moon We sighted the huts of the Grantline Expedition and suddenly just as we started to descend the controls snapped and the Planetara tumbled like a spent rocket Desperately I tried to check her but only partially succeeded We crashed horribly against the barren gray rock of the Moon Anita Venza Snap and I lived through it but we could not find the bodies of Miko and Moa in the wreckage Evidently they were still alive somewhere We reached Johnny Grantline The Planetara was a complete wreck And speeding to us from Mars was Miko s brigand ship We were powerless without means of leaving the Moon and completely at the mercy of Miko s fast approaching brigands CHAPTER XXIII The Prowling Watchman Try it again Snap urged Good God Johnny we ve got to raise some Earth station Chance it Use your power run it up to the full Chance it We were gathered in Grantline s instrument room The duty man with blanched grim face sat at his senders The Grantline crew shoved close around us tense and silent Above everything we must make some Earth station aware of our plight Conditions were against us There were very few observers in the high powered Earth stations who knew that an exploring party was on the Moon Perhaps none of them The Government officials who had sanctioned the expedition and Halsey and his confreres in the Detective Bureau were not anticipating trouble now The Planetara was supposed to be well on her course to Ferrok Shahn It was when she was due to return that Halsey would be alert And it seemed too that nature was against us The bulging half Earth one hung poised near the zenith over our little crater Its rotation through the hours was clearly visible We timed our signals when the western hemisphere was facing us But nature was against us No clouds no faintest hint of mist could fog the airless Lunar surface But there were continuous clouds over the Americas Footnote one Between the half and the full illumined disc the complete Earth now was some ten days old Try it again Snap urged These bulging walls Grantline used his power far beyond the limits of safety He cut down his lights the telescope intensifiers were permanently disconnected the ventilators were momentarily stilled so that the air here in the little room crowded with men rapidly grew fetid All to save power pressure that the vital Erentz system might survive Even so it was strained to the danger point The walls seemed to bulge outward with the pressure of the room the aluminite braces straining and creaking And our heat was radiating away the deadly chill of space crept in Again ordered Grantline The duty man flung on the power in rhythmic pulses In the silence the tubes hissed The light sprang through the banks of rotating prisms intensified up the scale until with a vague almost invisible beam it left the last swaying mirror and leaped through our overhead dome into space Commander The duty man s voice carried an appeal These bulging walls If they cracked or even sprung a serious leak the camp would be uninhabitable Enough said Grantline Switch it off We ll let it go at that for now It seemed that every man in the room had been holding his breath in the darkness The lights came on again the Erentz motors accelerated to normal The strain on the walls eased up and the room began warming Had the Earth caught our signal We did not want to waste the power to find out Our receivers were disconnected If an answering signal came we could not know it One of the men said Let s assume they saw us He laughed but it was a high pitched tense laugh We don t dare even use the telescope Our rescue ship will be right overhead visible to the naked eye before we see it Three days more that s what I ll give it But the three days passed and no rescue ship came The Earth was almost at the full We tried signaling again Perhaps it got through we did not know But our power was weaker now The wall of one of the rooms sprang a leak and the men were hours repairing it I did not say so but never once did I feel that our signals were seen on Earth Those cursed clouds The Earth almost everywhere seemed to have poor visibility Four of our eight days of grace were all too soon passed The brigand ship must be half way here by now They were busy days for us If we could have captured Miko and his band our danger would have been less imminent With the treasure insulated so that its Gamma rays could not betray us and our camp in darkness the arriving brigand ship might never find us But Miko knew our location he would signal his oncoming ship when it was close and lead it to us Three times during those days and the days which followed them Grantline sent out searching parties But it was unavailing Miko Moa and Coniston with their five underlings could not be found We searched all the territory from the camp to the Planetara and off to the foot crags of Archimedes and a score of miles into the flatness of the Mare Imbrium There was no sign of the brigands Yet we knew they could be near here it was so easy to hide amid the tumbled crags the ravines the gullies the numberless craters and pit holes or underground in the vast honeycombed subterranean recesses We had at first hoped that the brigands might have perished But that was soon dispelled I went about the third day with the party that was sent to the Planetara We wanted to salvage such of its equipment its unbroken power units as might be available And Snap and I had worked out an idea which we thought might be of service We needed some of the Planetara s smaller gravity plate sections Those in Grantline s wrecked little Comet had stood so long that their radiations had gone dead But the Planetara s were still efficacious We secured the fragments of Newtonia two But our hope that Miko might have perished was dashed He too had returned to the Planetara The evidence was clear before us The vessel was stripped of all its power units save those which were dead and useless The last of the food and water stores was taken The weapons in the chart room the Benson curve lights bullet projectors and heat rays had vanished Footnote two An allusion to the element Newtonia named in memory of the great founder of celestial mechanics Sir Isaac Newton Artificially electronized this metal element may be charged either positively or negatively thus to attract or repell other masses of matter The gravity plates of all space ships were built of it Other days passed The Earth reached the full and began waning The twenty eight day Lunar night was in its last half No rescue ship came from Earth We had ceased our efforts to signal for we needed all our power to maintain ourselves The camp would be in a state of siege That was the best we could hope for We had a few short range weapons such as Bensons heat rays and rifles A few hundred feet of effective range was the most any of them could obtain The heat rays in giant form one of the most deadly weapons on Earth were only slowly efficacious on the airless Moon Striking an intensely cold surface their warming radiations without atmosphere to aid them were slow to act Even in a blasting heat beam a man in his Erentz helmet suit could withstand the ray for several minutes We were however well equipped with explosives Grantline had brought a large supply for his mining operations and much of it was still unused We had also an ample stock of oxygen fuses and a variety of oxygen light flares in small fragile glass globes It was to use these explosives against the brigands that Snap and I were working out our scheme with the gravity plates The brigand ship would come with giant projectors and with some thirty men If we could hold out against them for a time the fact that the Planetara was missing would bring us help from Earth A month said Grantline A month at the most If we can hold them off that long even in a week or two help may come Another day A tenseness fell on us all despite the absorption of our feverish activities To conserve the power the camp was almost dark we lived in dim chill rooms with just a few weak spots of light outside to mark the watchmen on their rounds We did not use the telescope three but there was scarcely an hour when one or the other of the men was not sitting on a cross piece up in the dome of the little instrument room casting tense searching gaze into the black starry firmament A ship might appear at any time now a rescue ship from Earth or the brigands from Mars Anita and Venza during these days could aid us very little save by their cheering words They moved about the rooms trying to inspire us so that all the men when they might have been humanly sullen and cursing their fate were turned to grim activity or grim laughter making a joke of this coming siege The morale of the camp now was perfect An improvement indeed over the inactivity of the former peaceful weeks Footnote three An old fashioned telescope of limited field and needing no electronic power would have been immensely serviceable to Grantline but his was of the more modern type Grantline mentioned it to me We ll put up a good fight Haljan These fellows from Mars will know they ve had a task before they ever sail off with this treasure I had many moments alone with Anita I need not mention them It seemed that our love was crossed by the stars with an adverse fate dooming it And Snap and Venza must have felt the same Among the men we were always quietly grimly active But alone I came upon Snap once with his arms around the little Venus girl I heard him say Accursed luck That you and I should find each other too late Venza We could have a mighty lot of fun in Great New York together Snap we will As I turned away I murmured And pray God so will Anita and I The girls slept together in a small room of the main building Often during the time of sleep when the camp was stilled except for the night watch Snap and I would sit in the corridor near the girls door grid talking of that time when we would all be back on our blessed Earth Our eight days of grace were passed The brigand ship was due now to morrow or the next day I recall that night my sleep was fitfully uneasy Snap and I had a cubby together We talked and made futile plans I went to sleep but awakened after a few hours Impending disaster lay heavily on me But there was nothing abnormal nor unusual in that Snap was asleep I was restless but I did not have the heart to awaken him He needed what little repose he could get I dressed left our cubby and wandered out into the corridor of the main building It was cold in the corridor and gloomy with the weak blue light An interior watchman passed me All as usual Haljan Nothing in sight No They re looking I went through the connecting corridor to the adjacent building In the instrument room several of the men were gathered scanning the vault overhead Nothing Haljan I stayed with them awhile then wandered away The outside man met me near the admission lock chambers of the main building The duty man here sat at his controls raising the air pressure in the locks through which the outside watchman was coming The relief sat here in his bloated suit with his helmet on his knees It was Wilks Nothing yet Haljan I m going up to the peak of the crater to see if anything is in sight I wish that damnable brigand ship would come and get it over with Instinctively we all spoke in half whispers the tenseness bearing in on us The outside man came out of his helmet He was white and grim but he grinned at Wilks All is usual He tried the familiar jest at Wilks but his voice was flat Don t let the Earthlight get you Wilks went out through the portes a process of no more than a minute I wandered away again through the corridors I suppose it was half an hour later that I chanced to be gazing through a corridor window The lights along the rocky cliff edge were tiny blue spots The head of the stairway leading down to the abyss of the crater floor was visible The bloated figure of Wilks was just coming up I watched him for a moment making his rounds He did not stop to inspect the lights That was routine I thought it queer that he passed them Another minute passed The figure of Wilks went with slow bounds over toward the back of the ledge where the glassite shelter housed the treasure It was all dark off there Wilks went into the gloom but before I lost sight of him he came back As though he had changed his mind he headed for the foot of the staircase which led up the cliff face to where at the peak of the little crater five hundred feet above us the narrow observatory platform was perched He climbed with easy bounds the light on his helmet bobbing in the gloom I stood watching I could not tell why there seemed to be something queer about Wilks actions But I was struck with it nevertheless I watched him disappear over the peak of the summit Another minute went by Wilks did not reappear I thought I could make out his light on the platform up there Then abruptly a tiny white beam was waving from the observatory platform It flashed once or twice then was extinguished And now I saw Wilks plainly standing in the Earthlight gazing down Queer actions Had the Earthlight touched him Or was that a local signal call which he had sent out Why should Wilks be signalling What was he doing with a hand helio Our watchmen I knew had no reason to carry one And to whom could Wilks be signalling across this Lunar desolation The answer stabbed at me to Miko s band I waited another moment No further light Wilks was still up there I went back to the lock entrance Spare suits and helmets were here beside the keeper He gazed at me inquiringly I m going out Franck just for a minute It struck me that perhaps I was a meddlesome fool Wilks of all Grantline s men was I knew most in his commander s trust The signal could have been some part of this night s ordinary routine for all I knew I was hastily donning an Erentz suit I added Let me out I just got the idea Wilks is acting queerly I laughed Maybe the Earthlight has touched him With my helmet on I went through the locks Once outside with the outer panel closed behind me I dropped the weights from my belt and shoes and extinguished my helmet light Wilks was still up there Apparently he had not moved I bounded off across the ledge to the foot of the ascending stairs Did Wilks see me coming I could not tell As I approached the stairs the platform was cut off from my line of vision I mounted with bounding leaps In my flexible gloved hand I carried my only weapon a small bullet projector with oxygen firing caps for use in this outside near vacuum The leaden bullet with its slight mass would nevertheless pierce a man at the distance of twenty feet I held the weapon behind me I would talk to Wilks first I went slowly up the last hundred feet Was Wilks still up there The summit was bathed in Earthlight The little metal observatory platform came into view above my head Wilks was not there Then I saw him standing on the rocks nearby motionless But in a moment he saw me coming I waved my left arm with a gesture of greeting It seemed to me that he started made as though to leap away then changed his mind and waited for me I sailed from the head of the staircase with a twenty foot leap and landed lightly beside him I gripped his arm for audiphone contact Wilks Through the visors his face was visible I saw him and he saw me And I heard his voice You Haljan How nice It was not Wilks but the brigand Coniston CHAPTER XXIV Imprisoned The duty man at the exit locks of the main building stood at his window and watched me curiously He saw me go up the spider stairs He could see the figure he thought was Wilks standing at the top He saw me join Wilks saw us locked together in combat For an instant the duty man stood amazed There were two fantastic misshapen figures swaying in the Earthlight five hundred feet above the camp fighting desperately at the very brink They were small dwarfed by distance alternately dim and bright as they swayed in and out of the shadows Soon the duty man could not tell one from the other Haljan and Wilks fighting to the death The duty man recovered himself and sprang into action An interior siren call was on the instrument panel near him He rang it alarming the camp The men came rushing to him Grantline among them What s this Good God Franck They saw the silent deadly combat up there on the cliff The two figures had fallen together from the observatory platform dropped twenty feet to a lower landing on the stairs They lay as though stunned for a moment then fought on Grantline stood stricken with amazement That s Wilks And Haljan the duty man gasped Went out something wrong with Wilks acting strangely The interior of the camp was in a turmoil The men awakened from sleep ran out into the corridors shouted questions An attack Is it an attack The brigands But it was Wilks and Haljan in a fight out there on the cliff The men crowded at the bulls eye windows And over all the confusion the alarm siren with no one thinking to shut it off was screaming with its electrical voice Grantline stricken for that moment of inactivity stood gazing One of the figures broke away from the other bounded up to the summit from the stair platform to which they had fallen The other followed They locked together swaying at the brink For an instant it seemed to Grantline that they would go over then they surged back momentarily out of sight Grantline found his wits Stop them I ll go out to stop them What fools He was hastily donning one of the Erentz suits which stood at the lock entrance Shut off that siren Franck Within a minute Grantline was ready The duty man called from the window Still at it By the infernal such fools They ll kill themselves The figures had swayed back into view then out of sight again Franck let me out Grantline was ready He stood helmet in hand I ll go with you Commander But the volunteer was not equipped Grantline would not wait I m going at once Hurry Franck The duty man turned to his panel The volunteer shoved a weapon at Grantline Here take this Grantline jammed on his helmet He moved the few steps into the small air chamber which was the first of the three pressure locks Its interior door panel swung open for him But the door did not close after him Cursing the duty man s slowness he waited a few seconds Then he turned to the corridor The duty man came running Grantline took off his helmet What in hell Broken Dead What Smashed from outside gasped the duty man Look there my tubes The control tubes of the portes had flashed into a close circuit and burned out The admission portes would not open And the pressure controls smashed Broken from outside There was no way now of getting out through these pressure locks The doors the entire pressure lock system was dead Had it been tampered with from outside As though to answer Grantline s amazed question there came a chorus of shouts from the men at the corridor windows Commander By God look A figure was outside close to the building Clothed in suit and helmet it stood bloated and gigantic It had evidently been lurking at the porte entrance had ripped out the wires there It moved past the windows saw the staring faces of the men and made off with giant bounds Grantline reached the window in time to see it vanish around the building corner It was a giant figure larger than a normal Earthman A Martian Up on the summit of the crater the two small figures were still fighting All this turmoil had taken no more than a minute or two A lurking Martian outside The brigand Miko More than ever Grantline was determined to get out He shouted to his men to don some of the other suits and called for some of the hand bullet projectors But he could not get out through these main admission portes He could have forced the panels open perhaps but with the pressure changing mechanisms broken it would merely let the air out of the corridor A rush of air probably uncontrollable How serious the damage was no one could tell as yet It would perhaps take hours to repair it Grantline was shouting Get those weapons That s a Martian outside The brigand leader probably Get into your suits anyone who wants to go with me We ll go by the manual emergency exit But the prowling Martian had found it Within a minute Grantline was there It was a smaller two lock gateway of manual control so that the person going out could operate it himself It was in a corridor at the other end of the main building But Grantline was too late The lever would not open the panels Had someone gone out this way and broken the mechanisms after him A traitor in the camp Or had someone come in from outside Or had the skulking Martian outside broken this lock as he had broken the other The questions surged on Grantline His men crowded around him The news spread The camp was a prison No one could get out And outside the skulking Martian had disappeared But Wilks and Haljan were still fighting Grantline could see the two figures up on the observatory platform They bounded apart then together again Crazily swaying bouncing striking the rail They went together in a great leap off the platform onto the rocks and rolled in a bright patch of Earthlight First one on top then the other they rolled unheeding to the brink Here beyond the midway ledge which held the camp it was a sheer drop of a thousand feet on down to the crater floor The figures were rolling then one shook himself loose rose up seized the other and with a desperate lunge shoved him The victorious figure drew back to safety The other fell hurtling down into the shadows past the camp level down out of sight in the darkness of the crater floor Snap who was in the group near Grantline at the windows gasped God Was that Gregg Haljan who fell No one could say No one answered Outside on the camp ledge another helmeted figure now became visible It was not far from the main building when Grantline first noticed it It was running fast bounding toward the spider staircase It began mounting And now still another figure became visible the giant Martian again He appeared from around the corner of the main Grantline building He evidently saw the winner of the combat on the cliff who now was standing in the Earthlight gazing down And he saw too no doubt the second figure mounting the stairs He stood quite near the window through which Grantline and his men were gazing with his back to the building looking up to the summit Then he ran with tremendous leaps toward the ascending staircase Was it Haljan standing up there on the summit Who was it climbing the staircase And was the third figure Miko Grantline s mind framed the questions But his attention was torn from them and torn even from the swift silent drama outside The corridor was ringing with shouts We re imprisoned Can t get out Was Haljan killed The brigands are outside And then an interior audiphone blared a call for Grantline Someone in the instrument room of the adjoining building was talking Commander I tried the telescope to see who got killed But he did not say who got killed for he had greater news Commander The brigand ship Miko s reinforcements from Mars had come CHAPTER XXV The Combat on the Crater top Not Wilks but Coniston His drawling British voice You Gregg Haljan How nice His voice broke off as he jerked his arm from me My hand with the bullet protector came up but with a sweeping blow he struck my wrist The weapon dropped to the rocks I fought instinctively those first moments my mind was whirling with the shock of surprise This was not Wilks but the brigand Coniston His blow wrenched him around Awkward fighting in the air puffed suits with only a body weight of some thirty pounds Coniston stumbled over the rocks I had still scarce recovered my wits but I avoided his outflung arms and stooping tried to recover my revolver It lay nearby But Coniston followed my scrambling steps and fell upon me My foot struck the weapon it slid away and fell down a crag into a six foot pit We locked together and when I rose erect he had me around the middle His voice jangled with broken syllables in my receiver Do for you now Haljan It was an eery combat We swayed shoving kicking wrestling His hold around my middle shut off the Erentz circulation the warning buzz rang in my ears to mingle with the rasp of his curses I flung him off and my tiny Erentz motors recovered He staggered away but in a great leap came at me again I was taller heavier and far stronger than Coniston But I found him crafty and where I was awkward in handling my lightness he seemed more skilfully agile I became aware that we were on the twenty foot square grid of the observatory platform It had a low metal railing We surged against it I caught a dizzying glimpse of the abyss Then it receded as we bounced the other way And then we fell to the grid His helmet bashed against mine striking as though butting with the side of his head to puncture my visor panel His gloved fingers were trying to rip at the fabric around my throat As we regained our feet I flung him off and bounded like a diver head first into him He went backward but skilfully kept his feet gripped me again and shoved me I was tottering at the head of the staircase falling But I clutched at him We fell some twenty or thirty feet to the next lower spider landing The impact must have dazed us both I recall my vague idea that we had fallen down the cliff my Erentz motors smashed my air shut off Then the air came again The roaring in my ears was stilled my head cleared and I found that we were on the landing fighting He presently broke away from me bounded to the summit with me after him In the close confines of the suit I was bathed in sweat and gasping I had had no thought to increase the oxygen content of my air But I sorely needed more oxygen for my laboring pounding heart and my panting breath I fumbled for the oxygen control lever I could not find it or it would not operate I realized I was fighting sluggishly almost aimlessly But so was Coniston It seemed dreamlike A phantasmagoria of blows and staggering steps A nightmare with only the horrible vision of this goggled helmet always before my eyes It seemed that we were rolling on the ground back on the summit The unshadowed Earthlight was clear and bright The abyss was beside me Coniston rolling was now on top now under me trying to shove me over the brink It was all like a dream as though I were asleep dreaming that I did not have enough air I strove to keep my senses He was struggling to roll me over the brink Ah that would not do But I was so tired One cannot fight without oxygen I suddenly knew that I had shaken him off and gained my feet He rose up swaying He was as tired confused half asphyxiated as I The brink of the abyss was behind us I lunged desperately shoving avoiding his clutch He went over and fell soundlessly his body whirling end over end down into the shadows far down I drew back My senses faded as I sank panting to the rocks But with inactivity my thumping heart quieted My respirations slowed The Erentz circulation gained on my poisoned air It purified That blessed oxygen My head cleared again Strength came to me I felt better Coniston had fallen to his death I was victor I went to the brink cautiously for I was still dizzy I could see far down there on the crater floor a little patch of Earthlight in which a mashed human figure was lying I staggered back again A moment or two must have passed while I stood there on the summit with my senses clearing and my strength renewed as the blood stream cleared in my veins I was victor Coniston was dead I saw now down on the lower staircase below the camp ledge another goggled figure lying huddled That was Wilks no doubt Coniston had doubtless caught him there surprised him killed him My attention as I stood gazing went down to the camp buildings Another figure was outside It bounded along the ledge reached the foot of the ascending staircase at the top of which I was standing With agile leaps it came mounting at me Another brigand Miko No it was not large enough to be Miko not nearly large enough I was still confused I thought of Hahn But that was absurd Hahn was in the wreck of the Planetara One of the stewards then The figure came up the staircase recklessly to assail me I took a step backward bracing myself to receive this new antagonist And then I saw Miko Unquestionably he for there was no mistaking his giant figure He was down on the camp ledge running toward the foot of the staircase coming up to help this other man in advance of him I thought of my revolver I turned to try and find it I was aware that the first of my assailants was at the stairhead I could not locate at once where the revolver had fallen I would be caught leaped upon from behind Should I run I swung back to see what the oncoming brigand was doing He had reached the summit His arms went up legs bent under him With a sailing leap he launched for me I could have bounded way but with a last look to locate the revolver I braced myself for the shock The figure hit me It was small and light in my clutching arms I recall I saw that Miko was half way up the staircase I gripped my assailant The audiphone contact brought a voice Gregg Is it you It was Anita clutching at me CHAPTER XXVI At Bay Gregg you re safe She had heard the camp corridors resounding with the shouts that Wilks and Haljan were fighting She had come upon a suit and helmet by the manual emergency lock had run out through the lock confused with her only idea to stop Wilks and me from fighting Then she had seen one of us killed Impulsive barely knowing what she was doing she mounted the stairs frantic to find if I were alive Anita Miko was coming She had not seen him for she had no thought of brigands only the belief that either Wilks or I had been killed But now as for an instant we stood together on the rocks near the observation platform I could see the towering figure of Miko nearing the top of the stairs Anita that s Miko We must run Then I saw my bullet projector It lay in a bowl like depression quite near us I jumped for it And as I tore loose from Anita she leaped down after me It was a broken bowl in the rocks some six feet deep It was open on the side facing the staircase a narrow ravinelike gully full of gray broken tumbled rock masses The little gully was littered with crags and boulders But I could see out through it Miko had come to the head of the staircase He stopped there his great figure etched sharply by the Earthlight I think he must have known that Coniston was the one who had fallen over the cliff as my helmet and Coniston s were different enough for him to recognize which was which He did not know who I was but he did know me for an enemy He stood now at the summit peering to see where we had gone He was no more than fifty feet from us Anita lie down I pulled her down on the rocks I took aim with the bullet projector But I had forgotten our helmet lights Miko must have seen them just as I pulled the trigger The flying bullet missed him as he jumped sidewise He dropped but I could see him moving in the shadows to where a jutting rock gave him shelter I fired again Gregg I had stood up to take aim I saw the bullet chip a bit of rock Anita pulled me sharply down beside her Gregg he s armed It was his turn to fire It came the familiar vague flash of the paralyzing ray It spat its tint of color on the rocks near us but could not reach us Miko rose a moment later and bounded to another rock I scrambled up and shot at him but missed Then he crouched and returned my fire from his new angle but Anita and I had shifted Time passed only a few moments I could not see Miko momentarily Perhaps he was crouching perhaps he had moved away again He was or had been on slightly higher ground than the bottom of our bowl It was dim down here where we were lying but I feared that every moment Miko might appear and strike at us His ray at any short range would penetrate our visor panes even though our suits might temporarily resist it Anita it s too dangerous here Had I been alone I might perhaps have leaped up to lure Miko But with Anita I did not dare chance it We ve got to get back to the camp I told her The audiphone brought her comment Perhaps he has gone But he had not We saw him again out in a distant patch of Earthlight He was further from us than before but on still higher ground We had extinguished our small helmet lights But he knew we were here and possibly he could see us His projector flashed again But we had again shifted and were untouched He was a hundred feet or more away now His weapon was of longer range than mine I did not answer his fire for I could not hope to hit him at such a distance and the flash of my weapon would help him with his aim I murmured to Anita We must get out of here Yet how did I dare take Anita from these concealing shadows Miko could reach us so easily as we bounded away in plain view in the Earthlight of the open summit We were caught at bay in this little bowl The camp from here was not visible But out through the broken gully beyond the staircase top a white beam of light suddenly came up from below Haljan It spelled the signal Haljan It was coming from the Grantline instrument room I knew I could answer it with my helmet light but I did not dare I hesitated Try it urged Anita We crouched where we thought we might be safe from Miko s fire My little light beam shot up from the bowl It was undoubtedly visible to the camp Yes I am Haljan And I added Help Send us help I did not mention Anita Miko could doubtless read these signals And in the camp they must have missed Anita by now They answered Cannot I lost the rest of it There came a flash from Miko s weapon But it gave us confidence He could not reach us at the moment The Grantline beam repeated Cannot come out Portes broken You cannot get in Stay where you are an hour or two We may be able to repair portes The portes were broken Stay here an hour or two But I could not hold this position against Miko that long Sooner or later he would find a place from where he could sweep this bowl beyond possibility of our hiding I saw him running now well beyond my range to ferret out another point of vantage I extinguished my light What use was it to tell Grantline anything further Besides my light was dangerous But the Grantline beam spelled another message The brigand ship is coming It will be here before we can get out to you No lights We will try and hide our location And the signal beam brought a last appeal to me Miko and his men will divulge where we are Unless you can stop them The beam vanished The lights of the Grantline camp made a faint glow that showed above the crater edge The glow died as the camp now was plunged into darkness CHAPTER XXVII Anita s Plan We crouched in the shadows the Earthlight filtering down to us The skulking figure of Miko had vanished but he was out there somewhere on the crags I was sure lurking maneuvering to where he could strike us with his ray Anita s metal gloved hand was on my arm in my ear diaphragm her voice sounded eager and unmistakable What was the signal Gregg She could not read the semaphore lights I told her Oh Gregg the Martian ship coming Her mind clung to that as the most important thing But not so myself To me there was only the realization that Anita was caught out here almost at the mercy of Miko s ray Grantline s men could not get out to help us nor could I get Anita into the camp She added Where do you suppose the ship is In telescopic view Yes twenty or thirty thousand miles up probably The stars and the Earth were visible over us Somewhere up there disclosed by Grantline s instrument but not yet discernible to the naked eye Miko s reinforcements were hovering I stood up cautiously to try and locate Miko Immediately I saw him He jumped as though fearing my coming bullet and I dropped back barely avoiding his flash which swept across the top of our bowl Gregg Gregg don t take such a chance We lay for a moment in silence It was horribly nerve straining Miko could be creeping up on us Would he dare chance my sudden fire Creeping or would he make a swift unexpected rush The feeling that he was upon us abruptly swept me I jumped to my feet against Anita s effort to hold me But again Miko had vanished Where was he now I sank back That ship will be here in a few hours I told her what Grantline s signal had suggested the ship was hovering overhead It must be fairly close for Grantline s telescope had revealed its identity as a bandit flyer unmarked by any of the standard code identification lights It was doubtless too far away as yet to have located the whereabouts of Grantline s camp The Martian brigands knew that we were in the vicinity of Archimedes but no more than that Searching this glowing Moon surface our little lights the tiny local semaphore beams we had momentarily been using could easily pass unnoticed But as the brigand ship approached now dropping close to Archimedes as it probably would our danger was that Miko and his men would then signal it join it and reveal the camp s location and the brigand attack would be upon us I told this now to Anita The signal said Unless you can stop them It was an appeal to me But how could I respond to it What could I do alone out here with Anita to cope with this enemy Anita made no comment I added That ship will land near Archimedes I imagine within an hour or two If Grantline can repair his portes and I can get you inside Again she made no comment Then suddenly she gripped me Gregg look there Out through the gully break in our bowl the figure of Miko showed He was running But not at us Circling the summit leaping to keep himself behind the upstanding crags He passed the head of the staircase he did not descend it but headed off along the summit of the curving crater rim I stood up to watch him He was making off Abandoning us He s going I let her stand up beside me cautiously at first for it occurred to me that this might be a ruse to cover some other of Miko s men who might be lurking up here But the summit seemed clear The figure of Miko was a thousand feet away now We could see the tiny blob of it bobbing over the rocks Then it plunged down not into the crater valley but out toward the open Moon surface Miko had abandoned his attack on us The reason seemed plain He had come here from his encampment with Coniston had sent Coniston ahead to lure and kill Wilks When this was done Coniston had flashed his brief signal to Miko who was hiding nearby It was not like the brigand leader to remain in the background Miko was no coward But Coniston could impersonate Wilks whereas Miko s giant stature at once would reveal his identity Miko had been engaged in smashing the portes He had looked up and seen me kill Coniston He had come up to assail me And then he had read Grantline s signal to me It was his first knowledge that his ship was at hand With the camp exits inoperative Grantline and his men were imprisoned Miko made an effort to kill me He did not know my companion was Anita The effort was taking too long with the Grantline camp imprisoned and his ship at hand it was Miko s best move to return to his own camp rejoin his men and await their opportunity to signal the ship At least so I reasoned it Anita and I stood alone What could we do We went to the brink of the cliff The unlighted Grantline buildings showed vaguely in the Earthlight I said We ll go down I ll leave you there You can wait at the porte They ll repair it soon perhaps and let you in And what will you do she demanded I was hurrying her down the stairs But suddenly she stopped What are you going to do Gregg I had not intended to tell her Hurry Anita Why She stood stock still Through the visors I could see her white face gazing at me rebelliously Why should I hurry Gregg Because I want to leave you at the porte I m going after Miko try and locate where he and his men are camping I had indeed no specific plan as yet But it seemed useless for me to sit at the porte waiting to be let in But he s gone Gregg She was right on that Miko was already a mile or more away down on the outer surface making off He would soon be out of sight It would be impossible to follow him Gregg let me go with you She jerked away from me and bounded back up the staircase I caught her on the summit Anita I m going with you You re going to stay here I m not This exasperating controversy And time was so precious Anita please I ll be safer with you than waiting here Gregg It almost decided me Perhaps she would It was only my intention to follow Miko at a distance And with much more of this delay here he would be lost to me And she added Besides I won t stay and you can t make me We ran along the crater top At its distant edge the lower plain spread before us Far down and far away on the distant broken surface the leaping figure of Miko showed We plunged down the broken outer slope reached the level Soon as we ran the little Grantline crater faded behind us Anita ran more skillfully than I Ten minutes or so passed We had seen Miko and the direction he was taking but down here on the plain we could no longer see him It struck me that this was purposeless and dangerous Suppose Miko were to see us following Suppose he stopped and lay in ambush to fire at us as we came leaping heedlessly by Anita wait I said checking her I drew her down amid a group of tumbled boulders And then abruptly she clung to me Gregg I know what we can do Gregg don t tell me you won t let me try it I listened to her plan Incredible Incredibly dangerous Yet as I pondered it the very daring of the thing seemed the measure of its possible success The brigands would never imagine we could be so rash But Anita Gregg you re stupid It was her turn to be exasperated In truth I was indeed in no mood for daring for my mind was obsessed with Anita s safety I had been planning that we might see the glow of Miko s encampment and then return to Grantline and hope that he would have the portes repaired But Gregg the safety of the treasure of all the Grantline men To the infernal with that It s you your safety My safety then If you put me in the camp and the brigands attack it and I am killed what then But this plan of mine if we can do it Gregg safety in the end for all of us And it seemed possible We crouched discussing it So daring a thing The brigand ship would come down near Archimedes That was fifty miles from Grantline The brigands from Mars would not have seen the dark Grantline buildings hidden in the little crater pit They would wait for Miko and his men to make their whereabouts known Miko s encampment was ahead of us now undoubtedly We had been following him toward the Mare Imbrium we were at its borders now Archimedes from here was also about fifty miles And Anita proposed that we go to Archimedes climb in slope and await the coming of the brigand ship Miko would be off in the Mare Imbrium Or at least we hoped so He would signal his ship But Anita and I closer to it would also signal it and posing as brigands could join it Remember Gregg I am Anita Prince George s sister Her voice trembled as she mentioned her dead brother They know that George was in Miko s pay and I am his sister It will help convince them This daring scheme If we could join the ship we might be able to persuade its leader that Miko s distant signals were merely a ruse of Grantline to lure the brigands in that direction A long range projector from the ship would kill Miko and his men as they came forward to join it And then we could falsely direct the brigands lead them away from Grantline and the treasure Gregg we must try it Heaven help me I yielded to her persuasion We turned at right angles and ran toward where the distant frowning walls of Archimedes loomed against the starlit sky CHAPTER XXVIII The Ascent of Archimedes The broken shaggy ramparts of the giant crater rose above us We toiled upward out of the foothills clinging now to the crags and pitted terraces of the main ascent An hour had passed since we turned from the borders of the Mare Imbrium Or was it two hours I could not tell I only know that we ran with desperate frantic haste Anita would not admit that she was tired She was more skilful than I in this leaping over the broken rock masses Yet I felt that her slight strength must give out It seemed miles up the undulating slopes of the foothills with the black and white ramparts of the massive crater close before us And then the main ascent There were places where like smooth black frozen ice the walls rose sheer We avoided them toiling aside plunging into gullies crossing pits where sometimes we perforce went downwards and then up again or sometimes we stood hot and breathless upon ledges recovering our strength selecting the best route upward This tumbled mass of rock Honeycombed everywhere with caves and passages leading into darkness impenetrable There were pits into which we might so easily have fallen ravines to span sometimes with a leap sometimes by a long and arduous detour Endless climb We came to a ledge with the plains of the Mare Imbrium stretching out beneath us We might have been upon this main ascent for an hour the plains were far down the broken surface down there smoothed now by the perspective of our height And yet still above us the brooding circular wall went up into the sky Ten thousand feet still above us I think it was at least that or more You re tired Anita We d better stay here No If we could only get to the top the ship may land on the other side they would see us if we were at the top There was as yet no sign of the brigand ship With every stop for rest we searched the starry vault The Earth hung over us flattened beyond the full The stars blazed to mingle with the Earthlight and illumine these massive crags of the Archimedes walls But no speck appeared to tell us that the ship was up there We were on the curving side of the Archimedes wall which fronted the Mare Imbrium to the North The plains lay like a great frozen sea congealed ripples shining in the light of the Earth with dark patches to mark the hollows Somewhere down there six or eight thousand feet below us now or even more than that for all I could tell Miko s encampment lay concealed We searched for lights of it but could see none Or had Miko rejoined his party left his camp and come here like ourselves to climb Archimedes Or was our assumption wholly wrong perhaps the brigand ship would not land near here at all Sweeping around from the Mare Imbrium the plains were less smooth the shattered crag littered crater scarred region beyond which the distant Apennines raised their terraced walls The little crater which concealed the Grantline camp was off that way There was nothing to mark it from here Gregg do you see anything up there There seems to be a blur Her sight sharper than mine had picked it out The descending brigand ship A faintest tiny blur against the stars a few of them occulted as though strangely an invisible shadow were upon them A growing shadow materializing into a blur a blob a shape faintly defined Then sharper until we were sure of what we saw It was the brigand ship It came dropping slowly silently down We crouched on the little ledge A cave mouth was behind us A gully was beside us a break in the ledge and at our feet the wall dropped sheer We had extinguished our little lights We crouched silently gazing up into the stars The ship when first we distinguished it was central over Archimedes We thought for a while that it might descend into the crater But it did not it came sailing forward I whispered into the audiphone whispering by instinct as though out here in all this airless desolation someone might overhear us It s coming over the crater Her hand pressed my arm in answer I recalled that when from the Planetara Miko had forced Snap to signal this brigand band on Mars Miko s only information as to the whereabouts of the Grantline camp was that it lay between Archimedes and the Apennines That was Grantline s first message to us and Miko had relayed it to his men The brigands from Mars now were following that information A tense interval passed We could see the ship plainly above us now a gray black shape among the stars up beyond the shaggy towering crater rim The vessel came upon a level keel hull down slowly circling looking for Miko s signal no doubt or for possible lights of Grantline They were also picking a landing place We saw it soon as a cylindrical cigarlike shape rather smaller than the Planetara but similar of design It bore lights now The ports of its hull were tiny rows of illumination and the glow of light under its rounding upper dome was faintly visible A bandit ship no doubt of that Its identification keel plate was empty of official pass code lights These brigands had not attempted to secure official sailing lights when leaving Ferrok Shahn It was an outlawed ship unmistakably And here upon the deserted Moon there was no need for secrecy Its lights were openly displayed that Miko might see it and join it It went slowly past us only a few thousand feet higher than our level We could see the whole outline of its pointed cylinder hull with the rounded dome on top And under the dome was its open deck space with a little cabin superstructure in the center I thought for a moment that by some fortunate chance it might land quite near us There was a wide ledge a quarter of a mile away Anita look But it went past And then I saw that it was heading for a level plateau like surface a few miles further on It dropped cautiously floating down There was still no sign of Miko But I realized that haste was necessary We must be the first to join the brigand ship I lifted Anita to her feet I don t think we should signal from here No Miko might see it We could not tell where he was Down on the plains perhaps Or up here somewhere in these miles of towering rocks Are you ready Anita Yes Gregg I stared through the visors at her white solemn face Yes I m ready she repeated Her hand pressure seemed to me suddenly like a farewell Were we plunging rashly into what was destined to mean our death Was this a farewell An instinct swept me not to do this thing Why in an hour or two I could have Anita back to the comparative safety of the Grantline buildings The exit portes would doubtless be repaired by now I could get her inside She had bounded away from me leaped down some thirty feet into the broken gully to cross it and then up on the other side I stood for an instant watching her fantastic shape with the great rounded goggled trunked helmet and the lump on her shoulders which held the little Erentz motors Then I made after her It did not take us long two or three miles of circling along the giant wall The ship lay only a few hundred feet above our level We stood at last on a buttelike pinnacle The hull porte lights of the ship were close over us And there were moving lights up there tiny moving spots on the adjacent rocks The brigands had come out prowling around to investigate their location No signal yet from Miko But it might come at any moment I ll flash now I whispered Yes The brigands had probably not yet seen us I took the lamp from my helmet My hand was trembling Suppose my signal were answered by a shot A flash from some giant projector mounted on the ship Anita crouched behind a rock as she had promised I stood with my torch and flung its switch My puny light beam shot up I waved it touched the ship with its faint glowing circle of illumination They saw me There was a sudden movement among the lights up there I semaphored I am from Miko Do not fire I used the open Universal Code In Martian first and then in English There was no answer but no attack I tried again This is Haljan once of the Planetara George Prince s sister is with me There has been disaster to Miko A small light beam came down from the brink of the overhead cliff beside the ship We read you I went steadily on Disaster the Planetara is wrecked All killed but me and George Prince s sister We want to join you I flashed off my light The answer came Where is the Grantline camp Near here The Mare Imbrium As though to answer my lie from down on the Earthlit plains ten miles or so from the crater base a tiny signal light shot up Anita saw it and gripped me There is Miko s light It spelled in Martian Come down Land Mare Imbrium Miko had seen the signalling up here and was joining it He repeated Land Mare Imbrium I flashed a protest up to the ship Beware That is Grantline Trickery From the ship the summons came Come up We had won this first encounter Miko must have realized his disadvantage His distant light went out Come Anita There was no retreat now But again I seemed to feel in the pressure of her hand that vague farewell Her voice whispered We must do our best act our best to be convincing In the white glow of a search beam we climbed the crags reached the broad upper ledge Helmeted figures rushed at us searched us for weapons seized our helmet lights The evil face of a giant Martian peered at me through the visors Two other monstrous towering figures seized Anita We were shoved toward the port locks at the base of the ship s hull Above the hull bulge I could see the grids of projectors mounted in the dome side and the figures of men standing on the deck peering down at us We went through the admission locks into a hull corridor up an incline passage and reached the lighted deck Our helmets were taken off The Martian brigands crowded around us CHAPTER XXIX On the Brigand Ship Anita s words echoed in my memory We must act our best to be convincing It was not her ability that I doubted as much as my own She had played the part of George Prince cleverly unmasked only by an evil chance I steeled myself to face the searching glances of the brigands as they shoved around us This was a desperate game into which we had plunged For all our acting how easy it would be for some small chance thing abruptly to undo us I realized it and now as I gazed into the peering faces of these men from Mars I cursed my witless rashness which had brought Anita into this The brigands some ten or fifteen of them here on the deck stood in a ring around us They were all big men nearly of a seven foot average dressed in leather jerkins and short leather breeches with bare knees and flaring leatherboots Piratical swaggering fellows knife blades mingled with small hand projectors fastened to their belts Gray heavy faces some with scraggling unshaved beard They plucked at us jabbering in Martian One of them seemed the leader I said sharply Are you the commander here I speak not Ilton four well You speak the Earth English Footnote four Ilton the ruling race and official language of the Martian Union Yes he said readily I am Commander here He spoke English with the same freedom and accent of Miko Is this George Prince s sister Yes Her name is Anita Prince Tell your men to take their hands off her He waved his men away They all seemed more interested in Anita than in me He added I am Set Potan He addressed Anita George Prince s sister You are called Anita I have heard of you I knew your brother indeed you look very much like him He swept his plumed hat to the grid with a swaggering gesture of homage A courtierlike fellow this debonair as a Venus cavalier He accepted us I realized that Anita s presence was immensely valuable in making us convincing Yet there was about this Potan as with Miko a disturbing suggestion of irony I could not make him out I decided that we had fooled him Then I remarked the steely glitter of his eyes as he turned to me You were an officer of the Planetara The insignia of my rank was visible on my white jacket collar which showed beneath the Erentz suit now that my helmet was off Yes I was supposed to be But a year ago I embarked upon this adventure with Miko He was leading us to his cabin The Planetara wrecked Miko dead And Hahn and Coniston George Prince too we are the only survivors While we divested ourselves of our Erentz suits at his command I told him briefly of the Planetara s fall All had been killed on board save Anita and me We had escaped awaited his coming The treasure was here we had located the Grantline camp and were ready to lead him to it Did he believe me He listened quietly He seemed not shocked at the death of his comrades Nor yet pleased merely imperturbable I added with a sly sidelong glance There were too many of us on the Planetara The purser had joined us and many of the crew And there was Miko s sister the Setta Moa too many The treasure divides better among less An amused smile played on his thin gray lips But he nodded The fear which had leaped in me was allayed by his next words True enough Haljan He was a domineering fellow Miko A third of it all was for him alone But now The third would go to this sub leader Potan The implication was obvious I said Before we go any further I can trust you for my share Of course I figured that my very boldness in bargaining so prematurely would convince him I insisted And Miss Prince She will have her brother s share Clever Anita She put in swiftly I give no information until you promise We know the location of the Grantline camp its weapons its defense the amount and location of the ore I warn you if you do not play us fair He laughed heartily He seemed to like us He spread his huge legs as he lounged in his settle and drank of the bowl which one of his men set before him Little tigress Fear me not I play fair He pushed two of the bowls across the table Drink Haljan All is well with us and I am glad to hear it Miss Prince drink my health as your leader I waved it away from Anita We need all our wits your strong Martian drinks are dangerous Look here I ll tell you just how the situation stands I plunged into a glib account of our supposed wanderings to find the Grantline camp its location off in the Mare Imbrium hidden in a cavern there Potan with the drink and under the gaze of Anita s eyes was in a high good humor He laughed when I told him that we had dared to invade the Grantline camp had smashed its exit portes had even gotten up to have a look at where the ore was piled Well done Haljan You re a fellow to my liking But his gaze was on Anita You dress like a man or a charming boy She still wore the dark clothes of her brother She said I am used to action man s garb pleases me You shall treat me like a man give me my share of the gold leaf He had already demanded of us the meaning of that signal from the Mare Imbrium Miko s signal It had not come again though any moment I feared it I told him that Grantline had doubtless repaired his damaged portes and sallied out to assail me in reprisal And seeing the brigand ship landing on Archimedes had tried to lure it I wondered if my explanation were very convincing It did not sound so But he was flushed now with the drink And Anita added Grantline knows the territory near his camp very well He is equipped only for short range fighting I took it up It s like this Potan if he could get you to land unsuspectingly near the mouth of his cavern I pictured how Grantline might have figured on a sudden surprise attack upon the ship It was his only chance to catch it unprepared We were all three in friendly intimate mood now Potan said We ll land down there right enough But I need a few hours for my assembling He will not dare advance I said For one thing he can t leave the treasure He knows we have unmasked his lure Anita put in smilingly Haljan and I joining you that silenced him His light went out very promptly didn t it She flashed me a side gaze Were we acting convincingly But if Miko started up his signals again they might so quickly betray us Anita s thoughts were upon that for she added Grantline will not dare show his light If he does Set Potan we can blast him with a ray from here Can t we Yes Potan agreed If he comes within ten miles I have one powerful enough We are assembling it now And we have thirty men Anita persisted When we sail down to attack him it should not be very difficult to kill all the Grantline party Thirty of us that s enough to share in this treasure I m glad Miko is dead By Heaven Haljan this girl of yours is small but very blood thirsty That accursed Miko murdered her brother I explained Acting And never once did we dare relax If only Miko s signals would hold off and give us time We may have talked for half an hour We were in a small steel lined cubby located in the forward deck space of the ship The dome was over it I could see from where I sat at the table that there was a forward observatory tower under the dome quite near here The ship was laid out in rather similar fashion to the Planetara though considerably smaller Potan had dismissed his men from his cubby so as to be alone with us Out on the deck I could see them dragging apparatus about bringing the mechanisms of giant projectors up from below beginning to assemble them Occasionally some of the men would come to our cubby windows to peer in at us curiously My mind was roaming as I talked For all my manner of casualness I knew that haste was necessary Whatever Anita and I were to do must be quickly done But to win this fellow s utter confidence first was necessary so that we might have the freedom of the ship might move about unnoticed unwatched I was horribly tense inside Through the dome windows across the deck from the cubby the rocks of the Lunar landscape were visible I could see the brink of this ledge upon which the ship lay the descending crags down the precipitous wall of Archimedes to the Earthlit plains far below Miko Moa and a few of the Planetara s crew were down there somewhere Anita and I had a fairly definite plan We were now in Potan s confidence With this interview at an end I felt that our status among the brigands would be established We would be free to move about the ship join in its activities It ought to be possible to locate the signal room get friendly with the operator there Perhaps we would find a secret opportunity to flash a signal to Earth This ship I was confident would have the power for a long range signal if not of too sustained a length It was a desperate thing to attempt but our whole procedure was desperate And I felt if Anita perhaps could cajole the guard or the duty man from the signal room I might send a single flash or two that would reach the Earth Just a distress call signed Grantline If I could do that and not get caught Anita was engaging Potan in talking of his plans The brigand leader was boasting of his well equipped ship the daring of his men and questioning her about the size of the treasure My thoughts were free to roam A signal to Earth And while we were making friends with these brigands the longest range electronic projector was being assembled Miko then could flash his signal and be damned to him I would be on the deck with that projector Its operator and I would turn it upon Miko one flash of it and he and his little band would be wiped out But there was our escape to be thought of We could not remain very long with these brigands We could tell them that the Grantline camp was on the Mare Imbrium It would delay them for a time but our lie would soon be discovered We must escape from them get away and back to Grantline With Miko dead a distress signal to Earth and Potan in ignorance of Grantline s location the treasure would be safe until help arrived from Earth It all fitted together so nicely It seemed possible of success Our futile plans Star crossed always doomed fated always to be upset by such unforeseen evil chances By the infernal little Anita you look like a dove but you re a tigress A comrade after my own heart blood thirsty as a fire worshipper Her laugh rang out to mingle with his Oh no Set Potan I am treasure thirsty We ll get the treasure never fear little Anita With you to lead us Potan I m sure we will A man entered the cubby Potan looked frowningly around What is it Argle The fellow answered in Martian leered at Anita and withdrew Potan stood up I noticed that he was unsteady with the drink They want me with the work at the projectors Go ahead I said He nodded We were comrades now Amuse yourself Haljan Or come out on deck if you wish I will tell my men you are one of us And tell them to keep their hands off Miss Prince He stared at me I had not thought of that a woman among so many men His own gaze at Anita was as leeringly offensive as any of his men could have given He said Have no fear little tigress Anita laughed I am afraid of nothing But when he had lurched from the cabin she touched me Smiled with her mannish swagger for fear we were still observed and murmured Oh Gregg I am afraid We stayed in the cubby a few moments whispering trying to plan You think the signal room is in the tower Gregg This tower outside our window here Yes I think so Shall we go out and see Yes Keep near me always Oh Gregg I will We deposited our Erentz suits carefully in a corner of the cubby We might need them so suddenly Then we swaggered out to join the brigands working on the deck CHAPTER XXX Desperate Plans The deck glowed lurid in the queer blue greenish glare of Martian electro fuse lights It was in a bustle of ordered activity Some twenty of the crew were scattered about working in little groups Apparatus was being brought up from below to be assembled There was a pile of Erentz suits and helmets of Martian pattern but still very similar to those with which Grantline s expedition was equipped There were giant projectors of several kinds some familiar to me others of a fashion I had never seen before It seemed there were six or eight of them still dismantled with a litter of their attendant batteries and coils and tube amplifiers They were to be mounted here on the deck I surmised I saw in the dome side one or two of them already rolled into position at the necessary pressure portes Anita and I stood outside Potan s cubby gazing around us curiously The men looked at us but none of them spoke Let s watch from here a moment I whispered She nodded standing with her hand on my arm I felt that we were very small here in the midst of these seven foot Martian men I was all in white the costume used in the warm interior of the Grantline camp Bareheaded white silk Planetara uniform jacket broad belt and tight laced trousers Anita was a slim black figure beside me somber as Hamlet with her pale boyish face and wavy black hair The gravity being maintained here on the ship we had found to be stronger than that of the Moon rather more like Mars There are the heat rays Gregg A pile of them was visible down the deck length And I saw caskets of fragile glass globes bombs of different styles hand projectors of the paralyzing ray search beams of several varieties the Benson curve light and a few side arms of ancient Earth design swords and dirks and small bullet projectors There seemed to be some mining equipment also Far along the deck beyond the central cabin in the open space of the stern steel rails were stacked half a dozen small wheeled ore carts a tiny motor engine for hauling them and what looked as though it might be the dismembered sections of an ore shute The whole deck was presently strewn with this mass of equipment Potan moved about directing the different groups of workers The news had spread that we knew the location of the treasure The brigands were jubilant In a few hours the ship s armament would be ready and it would advance to attack Grantline I saw many glances being cast out the dome side windows toward the distant far down plains of the Mare Imbrium The brigands believed that the Grantline camp lay in that direction Anita whispered Which is their giant electronic projector Gregg I could see it amidships of the deck It was already in place Potan was there now superintending the men who were connecting it The most powerful weapon on the ship it had Potan said an effective range of some ten miles I wondered what it would do to a Grantline building The Erentz double walls would withstand it for a time I was sure But it would blast an Erentz fabric suit no doubt of that Like a lightning bolt it would kill its flashing free stream of electrons shocking the heart bringing instant death I whispered We must smash that before we leave But first turn it on Miko if he signals now I was tensely watchful for that signal The electronic projector obviously was not yet ready But when it was connected I must be near it to persuade its duty man to fire it on Miko With this done we would have more time to plan our other tasks I did not think Potan would be ready for his attack before another time of sleep here in the ship s routine Things would be quieter then I would watch my chance to send a signal to Earth and then we would escape With my thoughts roving we had been standing quietly at the cubby door oval for perhaps fifteen minutes My hand in my side pouch clutched the little bullet projector The brigands had taken it from me and given it to Potan He had placed it on the settle with my Erentz suit and when we gained his confidence he had forgotten it and left it there I had it now and the feel of its cool sleek handle gave me a measure of comfort Things could go wrong so easily but if they did I was determined to sell my life as dearly as possible And a vague thought was in my mind I must not use the last bullet That would be for Anita I shook myself free from such sinister fancy That electronic projector is remote controlled Look Anita that s the signal room over us The giant projector will be aimed and fired from up there It seemed so A thirty foot skeleton tower stood on the deck near us with a spiral ladder leading up to a small square steel cubby at the top Through the cubby window ovals I could see instrument panels A single Martian was up there he had called down to Potan concerning the electronic projector The roof of this little tower room was close under the dome a space of no more than four feet A pressure lock exit in the dome was up there with a few steps leading up to it from the roof of the tower signal room We could escape that way perhaps In the event of dire necessity it might be possible But only as a desperate resort for it would put us on the top of the glassite dome with a sheer hundred feet or more down its sleek bulging exterior side and down the outside bulge of the ship s hull to the rocks below There might be a spider ladder outside leading downward but I saw no evidence of it If Anita and I were forced to escape that way I wondered how we could manage a hundred foot jump to the rocks and land safely Even with the slight gravity of the Moon it would be a dangerous fall You are Gregg Haljan I started as one of the brigands coming up behind us addressed me Yes Commander Potan tells me you were chief navigator of the Planetara Yes You shall pilot us when we advance upon the Grantline camp I am control commander here Brotow my name He smiled A giant fellow but spindly He spoke good English He seemed anxious to be friendly We are glad to have you and George Prince s sister with us He shot Anita an admiring glance I will show you our controls Haljan All right I said Whatever I can do to help But not now It will be some hours before we are ready I nodded and he wandered away Anita whispered Did he mean that signal room up here in the tower Oh Gregg maybe it s only the ship s control room I don t know But the projector range finders are up there and I think it s the signal room Suppose we go up and see Gregg Miko s signals might start any minute And the electronic projector now seemed about ready It was time for me to act But a reluctant instinct was upon me Our Erentz suits were here close behind us in Potan s cubby I hated to leave them if anything happened and we had to make a sudden dash there would be no time to garb ourselves in the suits To adjust the helmets was bad enough I whispered swiftly We must get into our suits find some pretext I drew her back through the cubby doorway where we would be more secluded Anita listen I ve been a fool not to plan our escape more carefully We re in too great a danger here It seemed to me suddenly that we were in desperate plight Was it premonition Anita listen if anything happens and we have to make a dash Up through that dome lock Gregg It s a manual control you can see the levers Yes It s a manual But up there how would we get down She was far calmer than I There may be an outside ladder Gregg I don t think so I haven t seen it Then we can get out the way they brought us in The hull porte it s a manual too Yes I think I can find our way down through the hull corridors I mean for a quick run If we have to run you stay close behind me I ve this bullet projector and evidently there aren t many men in the lower corridors There are guards outside on the rocks We had seen them through the dome windows But there were not many only two or three A surprise rush at them would turn the trick We donned our Erentz suits What will we do with the helmets Anita demanded Leave them here No take them with us I m not going to get separated from them it s too dangerous We ll look strange going up to that signal room equipped like this she commented I can t help it We ll figure out something to explain it She stood before me a queer looking little figure in the now deflated bagging suit with her slim neck and head protruding above the metal circle of its collar Carry your helmet Anita I ll take mine We could adjust the helmets and start the Erentz motors all within a few seconds I m ready Gregg Come on then Let me go first I had the bullet projector in an outer pouch of the suit where I could instantly reach it This was more rational we had a fighting chance now The fear which had swept me so suddenly began to recede I was calm We ll climb the tower to the signal room I whispered Do it boldly We stepped from the cubby Potan was not in sight he was on the further deck beyond the central cabin structure perhaps or had gone below On the deck we were immediately accosted This was different our appearance in the Erentz suits Where are you going This fellow spoke in Martian I answered in English Up there He stood before us towering over me I saw a group of nearby workers stop to regard us In a moment we would be causing a commotion and it was the last thing I desired I said in Martian Commander Potan told me what I wish I can do From the dome we look around see where is the Grantline camp I am pilot of this ship to go there The man who had called himself Brotow passed near us I appealed to him We put on our suits I thought we might go up on the dome for a minute and look around If I m to pilot the ship He hesitated his glance sweeping the deck as though to ask Potan Someone said in Martian The commander is down in the stern storeroom It decided Brotow He waved away the Martian who had stopped me Let them alone Anita and I gave him our most friendly smiles Thanks He bowed to Anita with a sweeping gesture I will show you over the control room presently His gaze went to the peak of the bow The little hooded cubby there was the control room Satisfaction swept me Then this above us in the tower must surely be the signal room Would Brotow follow us up I hoped not I wanted to be alone with the duty man up there giving me a chance to get at the projector controls if Miko s signal should come I drew Anita past Brotow who had stood aside Thanks I repeated We won t be long We mounted the little ladder CHAPTER XXXI In the Tower Cubby Hurry Anita I feared that Potan might come up from the hull at any moment and stop us The duty man over us gazed down his huge head and shoulders blocking the small signal room window Brotow called up in Martian telling him to let us come He scowled but when we reached the trap in the room floor grid we found him standing aside to admit us I flung a swift glance around It was a metallic cubby not much over fifteen feet square with an eight foot arched ceiling There were instrument panels The range finder for the giant projector was here its little telescope with the trajectory apparatus and the firing switch were unmistakable And the signalling apparatus was here Not a Martian set but a fully powerful Botz ultra violet helio sender with its attendant receiving mirrors The Planetara had used the Botz system so I was thoroughly familiar with it I saw too what seemed to be weapons a row of small fragile glass globes hanging on clips along the wall bombs each the size of a man s fist And a broad belt with bombs in its padded compartments My heart was pounding as my first quick glance took in these details I saw also that the room had four small oval window openings They were breast high above the floor from the deck below I knew that the angle of vision was such that the men down there could not see into this room except to glimpse its upper portion near the ceiling And the helio set was banked on a low table near the floor In a corner of the room a small ladder led through a ceiling trap to the cubby roof This upper trap was open Four feet above the room roof was the arch of the dome with the entrance to the upper exit lock directly above us The weapons and the belt of bombs were near this ascending ladder evidently placed here as equipment for use from the top of the dome I turned to the solitary duty man I must gain his confidence at once Anita had laid her helmet aside She spoke first We were with Set Miko she said smilingly in the wreck of the Planetara You heard of it We know where the treasure is This duty man was a full seven feet tall and the most heavy set Martian I had ever seen A tremendous beetling browed scowling fellow He stood with hands on his hips his leather garbed legs spread wide and as I fronted him I felt like a child He was silent glaring down at me as I drew his attention from Anita You speak English We are not skilled with Martian I wondered if at the next time of sleep this fellow would be on duty here I hoped not it would not be easy to trick him and find an opportunity to flash a signal But that task was some hours away as yet I would worry about it when the time came Just now I was concerned with Miko and his little band who at any moment might arrive in sight If we could persuade this scowling duty man to turn the projector on them He answered me in ready English You are the man Gregg Haljan And this is the sister of George Prince what do you want up here I am a navigator Brotow wants me to pilot the ship when we advance to attack Grantline This is not the control room No I know it isn t I put my helmet carefully on the floor grid beside Anita s I straightened to find the brigand gazing at her He did not speak he was still scowling But in the dim blue glow of the cubby I caught the look in his eyes I said hastily Grantline knows your ship has landed here on Archimedes His camp is off there on the Mare Imbrium He sent up a signal you saw it didn t you just before Miss Prince and I came aboard He was trying to pretend that he was your Earth party Miko and Coniston Why The fellow turned his scowl on me but Anita brought his gaze back to her She put in quickly Grantline as Brother always said has no great cunning I believe he s planning now to creep up on us catch us unaware by pretending that he is Miko If he does that I said we will turn this electronic projector on him and annihilate him You have its firing mechanism here Who told you so he shot at me I gestured I see it here It s obvious I m skilled at trajectory firing If Grantline appears down there now I ll help you Is it connected Anita demanded boldly Yes he said You have on your Erentz suits are you going to the dome roof Then go But that was what we did not want to do Anita s glance seemed to tell me to let her handle this I turned toward one of the cubby windows she said sweetly Are you in charge of this room Show me how that projector is operated it will be invincible against the Grantline camp Yes I had my back to them for a moment Through the breast high oval I could see down across the deck space and out through the side dome windows And my heart suddenly leaped into my throat It seemed that down there in the Earthlit shadows where the spreading base of the giant crater joined the plains a light was bobbing I gazed stricken Miko s lights Was he advancing preparing to signal I tried to gauge the distance it was not over two miles from here Or was it not a light at all With the naked eye I could not be sure Perhaps there was a telescopic finder here in the cubby I was subconsciously aware of the voices of Anita and the duty man behind me Then abruptly I heard Anita s low cry I whirled around The giant Martian had gathered her into his huge arms his heavy jowled gray face with a leering grin close to hers He saw me coming He held her with one arm his other flung at me caught me knocked me backward He rasped Get out of here Go up to the dome leave us Anita was silently struggling with her little hands at his thick throat His blow flung me against a settle But I held my feet I was partly behind him I leaped again and as he tried to disengage himself from Anita to front me her clutching fingers impeded him My bullet projector was in my hand But in that second as I leaped I had the sense to realize I should not fire it and with its noise alarm the ship I grasped its barrel reached upward and struck with its heavy metal butt The blow caught the Martian on the skull and simultaneously my body struck him We went down together falling partly upon Anita But the giant had not cried out and as I gripped him now I felt his body limp I lay panting Anita squirmed silently from under us Blood from the giant s head was welling out hot and sticky against my face as I lay sprawled on him I cast him off He was dead his fragile Martian skull split open by my blow There had been no alarm The slight noise we made had not been heard down on the busy deck Anita and I crouched by the floor From the deck all this part of the room could not be seen Dead Oh Gregg It forced our hand I could not wait now for Miko to come But I could flash the Earth signal now and then we would have to make our run to escape Abruptly I remembered that light down at the crater base I kept Anita out of sight on the floor and went cautiously to a window The deck was in turmoil with brigands moving about excitedly Not because of what had happened in our tower signal room they were unaware of that Miko s signals were showing I could see them now plainly down at the crater base A group of hand lights and a small waving helio beam And they were being answered from the ship Potan was on the deck a babble of voices above which his rose with roars of command At one of the dome windows a brigand with a hand search beam was sending its answering light And I saw that Potan was working over a deck telescope finder It had all come so suddenly that I was stunned But I did not wait to read the signals I swung back at Anita It s Miko And they are answering him Get your helmet I ll try firing the projector Or would I instead try to send a brief flash signal to Earth There would be no time to do both we must escape out of here The route up through the dome was the only feasible one now This range mechanism of the projector was reasonably familiar and I felt that I could operate it The range finder and switch were on a ledge at one of the windows I rushed to it As I swung the little telescope training it down on Miko s lights I could see the huge projector on the deck swinging similarly Its movement surprised the men who were attending it One of them called up to me but I ignored him Then Potan looked up and saw me He shouted in Martian at the duty man whom he doubtless thought was behind me Be ready We may fire on them whoever they are I ll give you the word The signals were proceeding It had only been a moment I caught something like Haljan is impostor I was aiming the projector I was aware of Anita at my elbow I pushed her back Put on your helmet I had the range I flung the firing switch At the deck window the giant projector spat its deadly electronic stream The men down there leaped away from it with surprise I heard Potan s voice his shout of protest and anger But down in the Earthglow at the crater base Miko s lights had not vanished I had missed An error in the range Abruptly I knew it was not that Miko s lights were still there His signals still coming And I remarked now a faint distortion about them the glow of his little group of hand lights faintly distorted and vaguely shot with a greenish cast Benson curve lights I realized it My thoughts whirled in the few seconds while I stood there at the tower window Miko had feared he might summarily be fired upon He had gone back to his camp equipped all his lights with the Benson curve He was somewhere at the crater base now But not where I thought I saw him The Benson curve light changed the path of the light rays traveling from him to me I could not even approximate his true position Anita was plucking at me Gregg come I can t hit him I gasped Should I try the flash signal to Earth Did we dare linger here I stood another few seconds fascinated at the window I saw Potan down in the confusion of the deck training a telescope He had shouted up violently at his duty man here not to fire again And now he suddenly let out a roar I can see them It s Miko By the Almighty his giant stature Brotow look That s not an Earthman He flung aside his little telescope finder Disconnect that projector It s Miko down there This Haljan is a trickster Where is he Braile Braile you accursed fool Are Haljan and the girl up there with you But the duty man lay weltering in his blood at our feet I had dropped back from the window Anita and I crouched for an instant in confusion fumbling with our helmets The ship rang with the alarm And amid the turmoil we could hear the shouts of the infuriated brigands swarming up the tower ladder after us CHAPTER XXXII A Speck Amid the Stars I was only inactive a moment I had thought Anita would have on her helmet But she was reluctant or confused Gregg We ve got to get out of here Up through the overhead locks to the dome Yes She fumbled with the helmet Under the floor grid the climbing men on the ladder were audible They were already nearing the top The trap door was closed Anita and I were crouching on it There was a thick metal bar set in a depressed groove of the grid I slid it in place it would seal the trap for a time at any rate A degree of confidence came to me We had a few moments before there could be any hand to hand conflict That giant electronic projector would eventually be used against Grantline it was the brigands most powerful weapon Its controls were here by Heaven I would smash them That at least I could do I jumped for the window Miko s signals had stopped but I caught a glimpse of his distant moving curve lights A flash came up at me as in the window I became visible to the brigands on the ship s deck It was a small hand projector hastily fired for it went wide of the window It was followed by a rain of small beams but I was warned and I dropped my head beneath the high sill The rays flashed diagonally upward through the oval opening hissed against our vaulted roof The air snapped and tingled with a shower of blue red sparks and the acrid odor of the released gases settled down upon me The trajectory controls of the projector were beside me I seized them ripped and tore at them There was a roar down on the deck The projector had exploded A man s agonized scream split the confusion of sounds It silenced the brigands on the deck Under our floor grid those on the ladder had been pounding at the trap door They stopped evidently to see what had happened The bombardment of our windows ceased momentarily I cautiously peered out the window again In the wreck of the projector three men were lying One of them was screaming horribly The dome side was damaged Potan and other men were frantically investigating to see if the ship s air were hissing out A triumph swept me They had not found me so meek and inoffensive as they might have thought Anita clutched at me She still had not donned her helmet Put it on But Gregg Put it on I I don t want to put it on until you put yours on I ve smashed the projector We ve stopped them coming up for a while But they were still on the ladder under our floor They heard our voices they began thumping again Then pounding They seemed now to have some heavy implement They rammed with it against the trap But the floor seemed holding The square of metal grid trembled yielded a little But it was good for a few minutes longer I called down The first one who comes through will be shot My words mingled with their oaths There was a moment s pause then the ramming went on The dying man on the deck was still screaming I whispered I ll try an Earth signal She nodded Pale tense but calm Yes Gregg And I was thinking It won t take a minute Have your helmet ready I was thinking She hurried across the room I swung on the Botz signaling apparatus It was connected Within a moment I had it humming The fluorescent tubes lighted with their lurid glare they painted purple the body of the giant duty man who lay sprawled at my feet I drew on all the ship s power The tube lights in the room quivered and went dim I would have to hurry Potan could shut this off from the main hull control room I could see through the room s upper trap the primary sending mirror mounted in the peak of the dome It was quivering radiant with its light energy I sent the flash The flattened past full Earth was up there I knew that the western hemisphere faced the Moon at this hour I flashed in English with the open Universal Earth code Help Grantline And again Send help Archimedes region near Apennines Attacked by brigands Send help at once Grantline If only it would be received I flung off the current Anita stood watching me intently Gregg look She had taken some of the glass globe bombs which lay by the foot of the ascending ladder She held some of them now Gregg I threw some At the window we gazed down The globes she flung had shattered on the deck They were occulting darkness bombs five Footnote five Filled with an odorless harmless gas these bombs were used in warfare taking the place of the old fashioned smoke screens The diffusing gas was of such a nature that when released it absorbed within itself all the color inherent to the light rays striking it thus creating a temporary darkness Through the blackness of the deck the shouts of the brigands came up They were stumbling about But the ramming of our trap went on and I saw that it was beginning to yield One corner of it was bent up We ve got to go Anita Yes From out of the darkness which hung like a shroud over the deck an occasional flash came up unaimed wide of our windows But the darkness was dissipating I could see now the dim glow of the deck lights blurred as through a heavy fog I dropped another of the bombs Put on your helmet Yes yes I will You put on yours We had them adjusted in a moment Our Erentz motors were pumping I gripped her Put out your helmet light She extinguished it I handed her my bullet projector Hold it a moment I m going to take that belt of bombs The trap door was all but broken under the ramming blows of the men on the ladder I leaped over the body of the duty man seized the belt of bombs and strapped it about my waist Anita stood with me Give me the projector She handed it to me The trap door burst upward A man s head and shoulders appeared I fired a bullet into him the little leaden pellet singing down through the yellow powder flash that spat from the projector s muzzle The brigand screamed and dropped back out of sight There was confusion at the ladder top I flung a bomb at the broken trap A tiny heat ray came wavering up through the opening but went wide of us The instrument room was in darkness I clung to Anita

none	none	to me You go first here is the ladder We found it in the blackness mounted it and went through the cubby s roof trap I took a hasty look and dropped another bomb beside us The four foot space up here between the cubby roof and the overhead dome went black We were momentarily concealed Anita located the manual levers of the lock entrance Here Gregg I shoved at them Fear leaped in me that they would not operate But they swung The tiny porte opened wide to receive us We clambered into the small air chamber the door slid closed just as a flash from below struck at it The brigands had seen our little cloud of darkness and were firing up through it We were through the locks in a moment out on the open dome top A sleek rounded spread of glassite with broad aluminite girders There were cross ribs which gave us footing and occasional projections streamline fin tips the casings of the upper rudder shafts and the upstanding stubby funnels into which the helicopters were folded We moved along the central footpath and crouched by a six foot casing The stars and the glowing Earth were over us The curving dome top a hundred feet or so in length and bulging thirty feet wide beneath us glistened in the Earthlight It was a sheer drop down these curving sides past the ship s hull a hundred feet to the rocks on which the vessel rested The towering wall of Archimedes was beside us and beyond the brink of the ledge the thousands of feet down to the plains I saw the lights of Miko s band down there He had stopped signaling His little lights were spread out bobbing as he and his men advanced up the crater s foothills coming to join their ship I had an instant s glimpse Anita and I could not stay here The brigands would follow us up in a moment I saw no exterior ladder We would have to take our chances and jump There were brigands down there on the rocks I saw three or four skulking helmeted figures and they saw us A bullet whizzed by us and then came the flash of a hand ray I touched Anita Can you make the leap Anita dear Again it seemed that this must be farewell Gregg dear one oh we ve got to do it Those waiting figures would pounce on us Anita lie here a moment I jumped up and ran twenty feet toward the bow then back toward the stern flinging down the last of my bombs The darkness was like a cloud down there enveloping the outer brigands But up here we were above it etched by the starlight and Earthglow I came back to Anita We ll have to chance it now Gregg Good by dear I ll jump first down this side you follow To leap into that black patch with the rocks under it Gregg She was trying to tell me to look overhead She gestured Gregg see I saw it out over the plains a little speck amid the stars A moving speck coming toward us Gregg what is it I gazed held my breath A moving speck out there A blob now And then I realized that it was not a large object far away but small and already very close only a few hundred feet off dropping toward the top of our dome A narrow flat ten foot object like a wingless volplane There were no lights on it but in the Earthlight I could see two crouching helmeted figures riding it Anita Don t you remember I was swept with dawning comprehension Back in the Grantline camp Snap and I had discussed how to use the Planetara s gravity plates We had gone to the wreck and secured them had rigged this little volplane flyer The brigands on the rocks saw it now A flash went up at it One of the figures crouching on it opened a flexible fabric like a wing over its side I saw another flash from below harmlessly striking the insulated shield I gasped to Anita Light your helmet It s from Grantline Let them see us I stood erect The little flying platform went over us fifty feet up circling dropping to the dome top I waved my helmet light The exit lock from below up which we had come was near us The advancing brigands were already in it I had forgotten to demolish the manuals And I saw that the darkness down on the rocks was almost gone now dissipating in the airless night The brigands down there began firing up at us It was a confusion of flashing lights I clutched at Anita Come this way run The platform barely missed our heads It sailed lengthwise of the dome top and crashed silently on the central runway near the stern tip Anita and I ran to it The two helmeted figures seized us shoved us prone on the metal platform It was barely four feet wide a low railing handles with which to cling and a tiny hooded cubby in front with banks of controls Gregg Snap It was Snap and Venza She seized Anita held her crouching in place Snap flung himself face down at the controls The brigands in the lock were out on the dome now I took a last shot as we lifted My bullet punctured one of them he fell slid scrambling off the rounded dome and dropped out of sight Light rays and silent flashes seemed to envelop us Venza held the side shields higher We tilted swayed crazily and then steadied The ship s dome dropped away beneath us The rocks of the open ledge were under us Then the abyss with the moving climbing specks of Miko s lights far down I saw over the side shield the already distant brigand ship resting on the ledge with the massive Archimedes wall behind it A confusion back there of futile flashing rays It all faded into a remote glow as we sailed smoothly up into the starlight and away heading for the Grantline camp CHAPTER XXXIII Besieged Wake up Gregg They re coming I forced myself to consciousness Coming Yes Wake up I leaped from my bunk followed Snap with a rush into the corridor We had returned safely to the Grantline Camp Anita and I found ourselves exhausted from lack of sleep our arduous climb of Archimedes and that tense time on the brigand ship On the flight back Snap had explained how the landing of the ship on Archimedes was observed through the Grantline telescope using but little of its power for this local range They had read with amazement my signals to the brigands Snap had rushed to completion the first of our contemplated flying platforms Then he had seen Miko s signals from the crater base seen the lights of the fight to capture Anita and me in the cubby and had come to rescue us Back at the camp we were given food and Grantline forced me to try and sleep They ll be on us in a few hours Gregg Miko will have joined them by now He ll lead them to us You must rest for we need everyone at his best And surprisingly in the midst of the camp s turmoil of last minute activities I slept soundly until Snap called me that the ship was coming The corridor echoed with the tramp of Grantline s busy crew But there was no confusion now a grim calmness had settled upon everyone Anita and Venza rushed up to join us It s in sight There was no need of going to the instrument room From the windows fronting the brink of the cliff the brigand ship was plainly visible It came sailing from Archimedes a dark shape blurring the stars All its lights were extinguished save a single white search beam in the bow peak slanting diagonally down The beam presently caught our little group of buildings its glare shone in the windows as it clung for a moment I could envisage the triumphant curiosity of Potan and his fellows up there gazing along the beam Then it swung away The ship was at an altitude of no more than three thousand feet when I first saw it coming upon a level keel Would it circle over us firing at us Or sail past after inspecting us Or land perhaps boldly crowded upon our little ledge We were ready as ready as we could be with our meager equipment The camp was in a state of siege The cliff lights were extinguished the interior lights were dim save in the workshops of the main building where the final assembling of Snap s other flying platforms and their insulated protective shields was still in progress We had dimmed the lights to conserve our power and to enable the Erentz motors to run at full capacity Our buildings would have to withstand the brigand rays which soon would be upon us Outside on our dim Earthlit cliff the tiny lights showed where our few guards were lurking As I stood at the window watching the oncoming ship Grantline s voice sounded Call in those men Ring the call lights Franck The siren buzzed over the camp s interior the warning call lights on the roof brought in the outer guards They came running to the admission portes which had been repaired after Miko disabled them The guards came in We dimmed our lights further The treasure sheds were black against the cliff behind us No need for guards there the bulk of the ore was such that we reasoned the brigands would not attempt to move it until our buildings were captured But if they should try it we were prepared to sally out with our hand weapons and defend it In the dim lights we crouched A silence was upon us save for the clanging in the workshop down the corridor Most of us wore our Erentz suits with helmets ready though I am sure there was not a man of us but who prayed he might not have to go out At many of the windows our weakest points to withstand the rays insulated fabric shields were hung like curtains The brigand ship slowly advanced It was soon over the opposite rim of our little crater Its search beam swung about the rim and down into the valley My thoughts ran like a turgid stream as I stood tensely watching Four hours ago I had sent that flash signal to Earth If it were received a patrol ship could come to our rescue and arrive here in another eight hours or perhaps even less Ah that if If the signal were received If the patrol ship were immediately available If it started at once Eight hours at the very least I tried to assure myself that we could hold out that long The brigand ship crossed the opposite crater rim It dropped lower It seemed poised over the crater valley almost at our own level and less than two miles from us Its search beam vanished For a moment it hung a sleek cylindrical silver shape gleaming in the Earthlight Snap looked at me and murmured It s descending It slowly settled cautiously picked its landing place amid the crags and pits of the tumbled scarred valley floor It came to rest a vague silver menacing shape lurking in the lower shadows close at the foot of the inner opposite crater wall A few moments of tense waiting passed Soon tiny lights were moving down there some out on the rocks near the ship others up under its deck dome A stab of searchlight shot across the valley swung along our ledge and clung with its glaring ten foot circle to the front of our main building Then a ray flashed The assault had begun To be concluded Advertisement The Jovian Jest By Lilith Lorraine Illustration The object shot forth another tentacle Sidenote There came to our pigmy planet a radiant wanderer with a message and a jest from the vasty universe Consternation reigned in Elsnore village when the Nameless Thing was discovered in Farmer Burns corn patch When the rumor began to gain credence that it was some sort of meteor from inter stellar space reporters scientists and college professors flocked to the scene desirous of prying off particles for analysis But they soon discovered that the Thing was no ordinary meteor for it glowed at night with a peculiar luminescence They also observed that it was practically weightless since it had embedded itself in the soft sand scarcely more than a few inches By the time the first group of newspapermen and scientists had reached the farm another phenomenon was plainly observable The Thing was growing Farmer Burns with an eye to profit had already built a picket fence around his starry visitor and was charging admission He also flatly refused to permit the chipping off of specimens or even the touching of the object His attitude was severely criticized but he stubbornly clung to the theory that possession is nine points in law It was Professor Ralston of Princewell who on the third day after the fall of the meteor remarked upon its growth His colleagues crowded around him as he pointed out this peculiarity and soon they discovered another factor pulsation Larger than a small balloon and gradually almost imperceptibly expanding with its viscid transparency shot through with opalescent lights the Thing lay there in the deepening twilight and palpably shivered As darkness descended a sort of hellish radiance began to ooze from it I say hellish because there is no other word to describe that spectral sulphurous emanation As the hangers on around the pickets shudderingly shrank away from the weird light that was streaming out to them and tinting their faces with a ghastly greenish pallor Farmer Burns small boy moved by some imp of perversity did a characteristically childish thing He picked up a good sized stone and flung it straight at the nameless mass Instead of veering off and falling to the ground as from an impact with metal the stone sank right through the surface of the Thing as into a pool of protoplastic slime When it reached the central core of the object a more abundant life suddenly leaped and pulsed from center to circumference Visible waves of sentient color circled round the solid stone Stabbing swords of light leaped forth from them piercing the stone crumbling it absorbing it When it was gone only a red spot like a bloodshot eye throbbed eerily where it had been Before the now thoroughly mystified crowd had time to remark upon this inexplicable disintegration a more horrible manifestation occurred The Thing as though thoroughly awakened and vitalized by its unusual fare was putting forth a tentacle Right from the top of the shivering globe it pushed sluggishly weaving and prescient of doom Wavering it hung for a moment turning twisting groping Finally it shot straight outward swift as a rattler s strike Before the closely packed crowd could give room for escape it had circled the neck of the nearest bystander Bill Jones a cattleman and jerked him writhing and screaming into the reddish core Stupefied with soul chilling terror with their mass consciousness practically annihilated before a deed with which their minds could make no association the crowd could only gasp in sobbing unison and await the outcome The absorption of the stone had taught them what to expect and for a moment it seemed that their worst anticipations were to be realised The sluggish currents circled through the Thing swirling the victim s body to the center The giant tentacle drew back into the globe and became itself a current The concentric circles merged tightened became one gleaming cord that encircled the helpless prey From the inner circumference of this cord shot forth not the swords of light that had powdered the stone to atoms but myriads of radiant tentacles that gripped and cupped the body in a thousand places Suddenly the tentacles withdrew themselves all save the ones that grasped the head These seemed to tighten their pressure to swell and pulse with a grayish substance that was flowing from the cups into the cord and from the cord into the body of the mass Yes it was a grayish something a smokelike Essence that was being drawn from the cranial cavity Bill Jones was no longer screaming and gibbering but was stiff with the rigidity of stone Notwithstanding there was no visible mark upon his body his flesh seemed unharmed Swiftly came the awful climax The waving tentacles withdrew themselves the body of Bill Jones lost its rigidity a heaving motion from the center of the Thing propelled its cargo to the surface and Bill Jones stepped out Yes he stepped out and stood for a moment staring straight ahead staring at nothing glassily Every person in the shivering paralysed group knew instinctively that something unthinkable had happened to him Something had transpired something hitherto possible only in the abysmal spaces of the Other Side of Things Finally he turned and faced the nameless object raising his arm stiffly automatically as in a military salute Then he turned and walked jerkily mindlessly round and round the globe like a wooden soldier marching Meanwhile the Thing lay quiescent gorged Professor Ralston was the first to find his voice In fact Professor Ralston was always finding his voice in the most unexpected places But this time it had caught a chill It was trembling Gentlemen he began looking down academically upon the motley crowd as though doubting the aptitude of his salutation Fellow citizens he corrected the phenomenon we have just witnessed is to the lay mind inexplicable To me and to my honorable colleagues added as an afterthought it is quite clear Quite clear indeed We have before us a specimen a perfect specimen I might say of a of a He stammered in the presence of the unnamable His hesitancy caused the rapt attention of the throng that was waiting breathlessly for an explanation to flicker back to the inexplicable In the fraction of a second that their gaze had been diverted from the Thing to the professor the object had shot forth another tentacle gripping him round the neck and choking off his sentence with a horrid rasp that sounded like a death rattle Needless to say the revolting process that had turned Bill Jones from a human being into a mindless automaton was repeated with Professor Ralston It happened as before too rapidly for intervention too suddenly for the minds of the onlookers to shake off the paralysis of an unprecedented nightmare But when the victim was thrown to the surface when he stepped out drained of the grayish smokelike essence a tentacle still gripped his neck and another rested directly on top of his head This latter tentacle instead of absorbing from him visibly poured into him what resembled a threadlike stream of violet light Facing the cowering audience with eyes staring glassily still in the grip of the unknowable Professor Ralston did an unbelievable thing He resumed his lecture at the exact point of interruption But he spoke with the tonelessness of a machine a machine that pulsed to the will of a dictator inhuman and inexorable What you see before you the Voice continued the Voice that no longer echoed the thoughts of the professor is what you would call an amoeba a giant amoeba It is I this amoeba who am addressing you children of an alien universe It is I who through this captured instrument of expression whose queer language you can understand am explaining my presence on your planet I pour my thoughts into this specialised brain box which I have previously drained of its meager thought content Here the honorable colleagues nudged each other gleefully I have so drained it for the purpose of analysis and that the flow of my own ideas may pass from my mind to yours unimpeded by any distortion that might otherwise be caused by their conflict with the thoughts of this individual First I absorbed the brain content of this being whom you call Bill Jones but I found his mental instrument unavailable It was technically untrained in the use of your words that would best convey my meaning He possesses more of what you would call innate intelligence but he has not perfected the mechanical brain through whose operation this innate intelligence can be transmitted to others and applied for practical advantage Now this creature that I am using is as you might say full of sound without meaning His brain is a lumber room in which he has hoarded a conglomeration of clever and appropriate word forms with which to disguise the paucity of his ideas with which to express nothing Yet the very abundance of the material in his storeroom furnishes a discriminating mind with excellent tools for the transportation of its ideas into other minds Know then that I am not here by accident I am a Space Wanderer an explorer from a super universe whose evolution has proceeded without variation along the line of your amoeba Your evolution as I perceive from an analysis of the brain content of your professor began its unfoldment in somewhat the same manner as our own But in your smaller system less perfectly adjusted than our own to the cosmic mechanism a series of cataclysms occurred In fact your planetary system was itself the result of a catastrophe or of what might have been a catastrophe had the two great suns collided whose near approach caused the wrenching off of your planets From this colossal accident rare indeed in the annals of the stars an endless chain of accidents was born a chain of which this specimen this professor and the species that he represents is one of the weakest links Your infinite variety of species is directly due to the variety of adaptations necessitated by this train of accidents In the super universe from which I come such derangements of the celestial machinery simply do not happen For this reason our evolution has unfolded harmoniously along one line of development whereas yours has branched out into diversified and grotesque expressions of the Life Principle Your so called highest manifestation of this principle namely your own species is characterized by a great number of specialized organs Through this very specialization of functions however you have forfeited your individual immortality and it has come about that only your life stream is immortal The primal cell is inherently immortal but death follows in the wake of specialization We the beings of this amoeba universe are individually immortal We have no highly specialized organs to break down under the stress of environment When we want an organ we create it When it has served its purpose we withdraw it into ourselves We reach out our tentacles and draw to ourselves whatsoever we desire Should a tentacle be destroyed we can put forth another Our universe is beautiful beyond the dreams of your most inspired poets Whereas your landscapes though lovely are stationary unchangeable except through herculean efforts ours are Protean eternally changing With our own substance we build our minarets of light piercing the aura of infinity At the bidding of our wills we create preserve destroy only to build again more gloriously We draw our sustenance from the primates as do your plants and we constantly replace the electronic base of these primates with our own emanations in much the same manner as your nitrogenous plants revitalize your soil While we create and withdraw organs at will we have nothing to correspond to your five senses We derive knowledge through one sense only or shall I say a super sense We see and hear and touch and taste and smell and feel and know not through any one organ but through our whole structure The homogeneous force of our omni substance subjects the plural world to the processing of a powerful unity We can dissolve our bodies at will retaining only the permanent atom of our being the seed of life dropped on the soil of our planet by Infinite Intelligence We can propel this indestructible seed on light rays through the depths of space We can visit the farthest universe with the velocity of light since light is our conveyance In reaching your little world I have consumed a million years for my world is a million light years distant yet to my race a million years is as one of your days On arrival at any given destination we can build our bodies from the elements of the foreign planet We attain our knowledge of conditions on any given planet by absorbing the thought content of the brains of a few representative members of its dominant race Every well balanced mind contains the experience of the race the essence of the wisdom that the race soul has gained during its residence in matter We make this knowledge a part of our own thought content and thus the Universe lies like an open book before us At the end of a given experiment in thought absorption we return the borrowed mind stuff to the brain of its possessor We reward our subject for his momentary discomfiture by pouring into his body our splendid vitality This lengthens his life expectancy immeasurably by literally burning from his system the germs of actual or incipient ills that contaminate the blood stream This I believe will conclude my explanation an explanation to which you as a race in whom intelligence is beginning to dawn are entitled But you have a long road to travel yet Your thought channels are pitifully blocked and criss crossed with nonsensical and inhibitory complexes that stand in the way of true progress But you will work this out for the Divine Spark that pulses through us of the Larger Universe pulses also through you That spark once lighted can never be extinguished can never be swallowed up again in the primeval slime There is nothing more that I can learn from you nothing that I can teach you at this stage of your evolution I have but one message to give you one thought to leave with you forge on You are on the path the stars are over you their light is flashing into your souls the slogan of the Federated Suns beyond the frontiers of your little warring worlds Forge on The Voice died out like the chiming of a great bell receding into immeasurable distance The supercilious tones of the professor had yielded to the sweetness and the light of the Greater Mind whose instrument he had momentarily become It was charged at the last with a golden resonance that seemed to echo down vast spaceless corridors beyond the furthermost outposts of time As the Voice faded out into a sacramental silence the strangely assorted throng moved by a common impulse lowered their heads as though in prayer The great globe pulsed and shimmered throughout its sentient depths like a sea of liquid jewels Then the tentacle that grasped the professor drew him back toward the scintillating nucleus Simultaneously another arm reached out and grasped Bill Jones who during the strange lecture had ceased his wooden soldier marching and had stood stiffly at attention The bodies of both men within the nucleus were encircled once more by the single current From it again put forth the tentacles cupping their heads but the smokelike essence flowed back to them this time and with it flowed a tiny threadlike stream of violet light Then came the heaving motion when the shimmering currents caught the two men and tossed them forth unharmed but visibly dowered with the radiance of more abundant life Their faces were positively glowing and their eyes were illuminated by a light that was surely not of earth Then before the very eyes of the marveling people the great globe began to dwindle The jeweled lights intensified concentrated merged until at last remained only a single spot no larger than a pin head but whose radiance was notwithstanding searing excruciating Then the spot leaped up up into the heavens whirling dipping and circling as in a gesture of farewell and finally soaring into invisibility with the blinding speed of light The whole wildly improbable occurrence might have been dismissed as a queer case of mass delusion for such cases are not unknown to history had it not been followed by a convincing aftermath The culmination of a series of startling coincidences both ridiculous and tragic at last brought men face to face with an incontestable fact namely that Bill Jones had emerged from his fiery baptism endowed with the thought expressing facilities of Professor Ralston while the professor was forced to struggle along with the meager educational appliances of Bill Jones In this ironic manner the Space Wanderer had left unquestionable proof of his visit by rendering a tribute to innate intelligence and playing a Jovian Jest upon an educated fool a neat transposition A Columbus from a vaster kindlier universe had paused for a moment to learn the story of our pigmy system He had brought us a message from the outermost citadels of life and had flashed out again on his aeonic voyage from everlasting unto everlasting FOR VACATION ADVENTURERS Truth is stranger than fiction Ask the Regular Army man who has

strange Time Space of the Fourth Dimension in Tode s marvelous Atom Smasher CHAPTER I The Vanishing Place Look at that plane That fellow s crazy Took off with the wind behind him He ll nose dive before he clears the clubhouse He ll crash into those trees along the edge of the golf course The group on the field at Westbury Long Island held their breaths as they watched James Dent take off in the wildest most erratic flight that they had ever seen Under lowering storm clouds with the wind roaring half a hurricane behind him Dent spiraled upward as if unconscious of the laws of Earthly gravity I told you so You ought to have stopped him even if it is his private plane A feller s got no business trying to break his neck Look there He s cleared those trees after all James Dent had cleared them and the clubhouse too and was already disappearing across the Hempstead Plains looking like a leaf whirling up in a winter storm At a height of five hundred feet he sped eastward Didn t tell you where he was going Nope acted like a crazy man Something on his mind sure Wherever he s bound for he ll never get there But James Dent was already out of sight and the little group dispersed And Dent winging his way due east over the oak barrens of central Long Island was conscious neither of the storm that howled about him nor of the excitement that his rash take off had occasioned The rain lashed him in the open cockpit the ground fog swirled about him and though it was still afternoon there brooded a somber twilight over the wastes But in his mind Dent was already anticipating his descent at the Vanishing Place as the natives called it near Peconic Bay The Vanishing Place was so called because of the terrible and inexplicable catastrophe that had occurred there five years previously In the two century old farmhouse Miles Parrish the world s greatest authority on physical chemistry had been conducting investigations into the structure of the atom James Dent and Lucius Tode had been associated with old Parrish in this work which carried to a successful issue would revolutionize the social organization of the world The energy locked up in the atom is so stupendous that as Eddington indicated a thimbleful of coal disintegrated would carry the Mauretania from England to America and back again To unlock this energy would be to set man free from bondage to restore the pristine leisure and happiness of Eden And because the three men were playing with deadly forces of incalculable power this deserted spot had been selected for the carrying on of the investigations The old farmhouse had been converted into a laboratory For days together the three had bent over their tubes and laboratory apparatus hardly eating or sleeping And the day had come when success had seemed almost within their grasp Dent had received six months leave of absence from his duties at Columbia University in order to prosecute the experiments As the weeks went by and the blind track that the three were following opened into a clear road a sort of madness settled upon every one of them The Planck Bohr quantum theory that the energy of a body cannot vary continuously but only by a certain finite amount or exact multiples of this amount had been the key that unlocked the door But always it had been Lucius Tode who led the way Tode was a graduate of the University of Virginia and accounted one of the most brilliant minds of his generation At thirty he stood head and shoulders above his contemporaries Dark handsome fearless with a will power that nothing seemed able to subdue he had taken the leadership away from old Miles Parrish who eagerly and without thought of his own reputation followed in his assistant s footsteps There were the three men and there was the girl

none	none	Parrish the child of Miles s old age Seventeen when the catastrophe occurred she had come out to the deserted spot sometimes of a Sunday from her boarding school at Garden City And Tode had found time to make love to her when he rushed her back to her school in his high powered foreign car Jim Dent had known nothing of that until after the catastrophe Lucille had been afraid of him afraid to open her mouth upon the subject even to her father And she had been fascinated too as a young girl may well be when a fascinating man of thirty uses his arts to win her It was only by chance that Jim had failed to be involved in the hideous catastrophe that had stamped the old farmhouse with the name of Vanishing Place whenever the natives spoke of it Two Killed in Laboratory Explosion was the heading in the next morning s paper which gave Jim his first intimation of the accident He had been to Columbia overnight to look up a new publication that contained an article on the hydrogen spectrum It was only a long paragraph and the names of Parrish and Tode meant nothing to the man who had written it But Jim had taken train to Hempstead taxied to the flying fields and essayed his first plane ride to Peconic Bay in the charge of a pilot A group of natives three newspaper men and a Suffolk County policeman were near the spot where the farmhouse had been near the spot not on it For where the farmhouse had been was a great pool of stagnant water black as ink covering an expanse of perhaps three quarters of an acre No sir there was no explosion said the officer At least none of these fellows heard anything Just a you tell the Professor mister Lumm It was about half past eight last night mister Dent said Andrew Lumm who kept the village store a mile away Ground seemed to rock Earthquake I says to myself holdin on to the door But it wasn t no earthquake Too gentle for that Nothin broke not even a plate Then I says to missus Lumm They re gone poor fellers and I allus knowed it would be that way It s lucky young mister Dent went out last night on the seven point fifteen We hurried here but there wasn t no sign of the place jest a hole on the ground with a sort of sticky mud in it Water s been fillin in since then but I guess it s reached its level now They jest blowed themselves to bits mister Dent Tell him about the vi let light Andy put in one of the bystanders Yeah like a pillar of vi let fire that were mister Dent We seed it through the trees but by the time we got here it was most gone Gosh that throwed a scare into some of us It was mister Tode s soul a burnin squeaked Granpop Dawes I allus said that feller d come to no good end The group shook their heads and remained silent It was clear that if they did not share Granpop Dawes s opinion at least they considered it not without the bounds of plausibility Lucius Tode had created a bad impression among the natives Jim Dent stooped and picked up something lying imbedded in the mud at the edge of the black pool and slipped it into his pocket He had been present at the inquest and had gone back to Columbia That had been five years before Professor McDowd the palaeontologist had identified the object Jim had found as the milk molar of merychippus insignis the miocene representative of the modern horse And that had made Jim Dent think furiously The catastrophe must have been a gigantic one to have flung up that fossil tooth from strata far beneath the level of the earth s surface More there were even traces of archaean deposits around the borders of the pool whose depth in the center was ascertained to be one hundred sixty four feet Black silent uninhabited unstirred save by a passing breeze the pool had remained those five years past The spot was shunned as haunted or accursed by the superstitious country folks Dense underbrush had grown up around it Periodically Jim had gone out to visit it That was how he had come to invest in a private plane It was only an hour to the flying fields and less than an hour from there to Peconic Bay What he expected to achieve he did not know In the back of his mind was the belief that some day he would light upon some clue that would tell something of the unusual catastrophe And then that afternoon he had been shaken to the depths when a message came to him in Lucille s voice over the telephone I ve heard from dad Winging his way eastward through the storm Jim Dent was mentally reconstructing all that had led up to the present moment Lucille had finished her high school course and gone into business life Jim had found a position for her as secretary to a small group of physicists who were conducting private investigations a position for which her training well fitted her She had done well He had kept in touch with her Six months before their relations had altered They had realized that they were in love with each other In the months that followed they had discovered all sorts of things about each other that neither had suspected which might be summed up by saying that they had become all in all to each other It was so amazing this transformation of ordinary friendship into radiant love that they were still bewildered over it They were to be married at the end of the year It was then that Lucille had first told Jim about Lucius s wooing and her fear of the man Apart from that both had refrained by tacit agreement from making reference to the past And then that afternoon there sounded Lucille s voice over the telephone I ve heard from dad From your father You re mistaken dear
8684_293663_000104_000000	train-clean-360	 No Jim 
none	none	I m not mistaken He called me on the phone two hours ago I couldn t mistake his voice and besides he called me Lucy like he used to do He told me to come at once to the Vanishing Place but not to tell a soul unless I wished to do him a great evil Then he rang off Where are you now asked Jim I m phoning from Amityville I took the train immediately but I was so frightened and and at last I decide I must tell you I didn t think dad would have minded my telling you So I got out There s another train in a few minutes and I shall go on to Hampton Bays and walk the two miles to the Vanishing Place I I ll meet you there Lucille wait Can t you meet me somewhere else and we ll go on together I ll get my plane and Oh I just can t wait Jim I m in such terror that I won t find dad when I get there And he told me to tell nobody I I ll meet you at the Vanishing Place Jim And so great had been her agitation that with that arrangement Jim had had to rest content He had taken a taxi out to the flying fields at once In half an hour he would know what had happened And he was obsessed by the terror that he would not find Lucille or anything except the lonely pool That was why he opened the throttle and drove on wildly through the scurrying wraiths of mist pierced by the tops of trees that at times rose dangerously near the spreading wings That gap in the trees was Lake Ronkokoma Not far now Jim would know soon But as he flew vague fears that had beset his mind since he had received Lucille s message began to crystallize into the single fear of Tode If Parrish was really alive why not Tode too Beneath the polish and the surface comradeship Jim had always been conscious of some diablerie about the man of some inner life of which he knew nothing Something unscrupulous and relentless something infinitely cruel as when he had tested the Atom Smasher on a stray cur that had run into the laboratory not for experimentation but in mere ruthless savagery converting the living beast instantly into a shapeless mass of flesh and bone And Tode had known more about the Atom Smasher as they affectionately called the mechanism for releasing atomic energy than old Parrish and he together Suppose Lucille s story were true Suppose old Parrish were actually alive suppose Tode were responsible for some designed scheme which would in the end place Lucille in his power Wild thoughts and fears but Jim would soon know And with throttle stretched to the limit he went roaring over the scrub oak toward Peconic Bay It was beginning to grow dark almost too dark for landing But now Jim could feel the tang of the salt wind upon his face He slowed down The fog was as thick as ever but the scrub oak had given place to more open country In a minute or two he ought to sight some landmark Yes he had overshot his mark for suddenly through a gap in the mists he saw the line of breakers forming a white ridge upon the sand A mile southward Jim knew where he was now for he knew every curve of that shore He banked and turned And then he saw something that for an instant chilled his blood Not far away and not far beneath him a ghostly violet haze was spreading through the fog and the fog itself was coiling back from it until it formed a dense white wall For a moment Jim s hand was paralysed upon the stick The next his decision was made He closed his throttle and went down in a slow descent right toward the heart of that column of lavender smoke that seemed to be springing straight up out of the ground A pillar of violet fire It could not have been described better The plane dived through the dense wall of fog which for a moment shut out the violet fire completely Then Jim was through and almost immediately beneath him lay the black and glassy surface of the pool Out of the very heart of it rose the fire burning like some infernal flame that consumed nothing and between it and the fog was a space of almost translucent air extending to the borders of the pool Jim began to circle the pool to find a landing place But as he looked down the surface of the pool began to change its aspect In place of the unruffled calm it began to work with some devil s yeast all around the central pillar of flame until its depths seemed to be churned up in frothy masses and the movement extended almost to the circumference Then the whole surface of the water began to tilt and sway with a slow shimmering undulatory movement as if it was a giant roulette wheel in rotation And something was materializing out of the heart of the violet flame itself It was a face a human face with bestial features distorted and enormously magnified through the substance in which it was Such a face as might look back upon an observer out of one of those distorting mirrors at Coney Island or some other place of popular amusement but twisted and enlarged beyond conception so that it covered half the area of a city block Curiously blurred too as if each atom of that face was in isolated motion on its own account And beneath the face appeared the vague outlines of a hand apparently manipulating some sort of infernal mechanism And that face enlarged as it was out of all proportion filled Jim s heart with greater horror than any face he had ever known For it was the visage of Lucius Tode and on those huge and distorted features was something that looked like a diabolical smile Everything vanished Jim was back in the surrounding wall of fog Instinctively he banked again He strove to drive the horror from his brain He must circle circle incessantly in the hope of finding Lucille She must have already arrived But if she had not fallen into Tode s power she would hear the roaring of the plane and manage to signal him He circled back into the clear space between the white and the violet and now he saw that the effect upon the pool was still more pronounced The waters were rising up in a rim all around and yet not overflowing They were standing up like a bowl of clay upon the potter s wheel and down in the depths Jim could see the head and shoulders of Tode much less magnified more natural in appearance and less blurred And Tode was looking up at him and pointing that infernal mechanism at him something that looked like the tube of a telescope Suddenly the plane shivered and stood still The motor died abruptly The stick went dead And yet the plane did not fall As if upheld by the same repulsive force that drove back the white fog it simply hung suspended three hundred feet above the heart of the violet flame Then there was no longer any plane The stick had melted in Jim s hand the wings dissolved like wreaths of mist The entire body had disintegrated into nothingness Jim sat suspended in the void and felt himself very slowly descending into the violet column Down into the vortex of that bubbling pool which rimmed him on all sides down into the central aperture out of which emerged the leering face of Tode And as he dropped Jim heard thin faint and very far away the despairing cry of Lucille CHAPTER II Old Friends and Foes Jim must have lapsed into unconsciousness for when he opened his eyes there was a gap in his consciousness of the passage of time though none in his memory He opened his eyes and instantly he remembered everything Only a brief interval could have elapsed for it was not quite dark The fog and the violet flame had cleared away Overhead a few stars twinkled Jim was lying on his side half buried in the black slimy mud of the dried up pool There was nothing but the smooth shelving mud basin with the scrub oak surrounding it Tode and the machine had vanished Jim pulled himself with an effort out of the sucking mud and heavily clogged with it began to make his way toward the margin Stumbling struggling through the viscid ooze he shouted Lucille s name despairingly But no answer came and his cries only made the utter silence all about him seem more fearsome Exhausted by his efforts he gained the edge of the pool at last and stopped trying to orientate himself As he did so he saw a human face peering at him out of a clump of scrub oak It was the face of an aged man with a long white beard and rags of clothes that were festooned about him Jim took a step toward it shouting a challenge Next moment it had hurled itself out of its shelter toward him and two skeletonlike arms were twined about his shoulders while the fingers worked upward toward his throat The face was that of a madman crazed by fear And Jim recognized it It was the face of Professor Parrish Parrish the trim immaculate clean shaven urbane old man whose lectures imbued with wit and scholarship had always been the delight of his classes Parrish reduced to this gibbering maniac And yet Parrish himself returned to the site of their experiments after five years So fierce was the old man s onset so desperate his clutch that for a half minute or more Jim was reduced to fighting for his life The clawing fingers armed with long nails furrowed Jim s throat there was a terrific strength in the body wasted though it was almost to a skeleton But it was only for a half minute that old Parrish s endurance lasted Suddenly the old man went limp and tottered forward dropped upon the ground Jim bent over him Parrish you know me I m Jim Dent he cried I came here to save you Parrish was muttering something Jim caught the words Tode and God help Lucille Parrish I m Jim Dent Jim cried again and the old man shuddering opened his eyes and recognized him Jim he muttered Jim Dent Then where is she I got away from that devil found farmhouse empty got telephone book found her and phoned her Told her to come Save Lucille He fell back his eyes closed Jim crouched over the unconscious old man He was in a state of utter perplexity He could not quite gather what Parrish had been trying to tell him and it was with difficulty that he could focus his mind upon the situation so great had been the shock of finding his former chief in that condition What had become of his plane and where was Lucille Jim was positive that he had heard her cry for help out of the vortex in the water But there was no water only the circle of black mud extended in the starlight Again and again Jim shouted Lucille s name and his cries went echoing away through the scrub without result Jim looked down at the unconscious old man beside him He must get Parrish away get him to Andy Lumm s He bent over him again and raised him in his arms Suddenly he heard two familiar sounds behind him two dull thumps that sounded less like explosions than echoes long drawn out and receding into infinity There was no other sound quite like them that he had ever heard They were the snap of the electrical discharge as the Atom Smasher began to operate and why the snap had sounded like a heavy body falling a long distance away was not known Tode had said one day with what Jim had taken for sarcasm that they represented the wave series of a single sound extended in time to make four dimensional action but Jim had never considered the explanation seriously That sound bringing back all Jim s memories of their experiments brought him to his feet sharply He swung around The surface of the pool was a bubbling seething mass of mud and water And over its surface that faint violet haze was beginning to spread In the center where the light was thickest something like a gyroscope appeared to be revolving Out of the gyroscope something was beginning to project that infernal tube of Lucius Tode And Jim knew that in the heart of the flame that enormous distorted face of Lucius Tode would again be visible The human nervous system can only endure a certain amount of impact The sight of that ghastly flame already condensing into a violet pillar was more than Jim could stand He dragged old Parrish to his feet and started off with him into the thickest part of the undergrowth A fearful scream behind him stopped him at the very edge of the scrub He looked back still supporting the half conscious old man in his arms The violet flame was shooting up in a straight pillar the whole central portion of the pool was dry and the waters were heaped up all around it From the slightly elevated spot where Jim stood he could see Tode holding Lucille in his arms in the very heart of the fire which threw a pale fluorescent light over their faces Tode was wearing a spotted skin like that of a leopard and Lucille was in the blue frock that she had worn when Jim and she had dinner together two evenings before Jim dropped old Parrish shouted in answer and dashed back like a madman down the slope into the solid wall of water He fought his way desperately through that wall which seemed of the consistency of soft rubber or treacle as if some subtle change had taken place in its molecular isomers It adhered to him without wetting him and he plunged through it hearing Lucille cry out again and yet again And now he was through and once more struggling over the viscid surface of the pond Behind him he heard old Parrish blundering and screeching at the top of his voice but he paid no attention to him He could see Lucille more clearly and the large hazy outlines of Tode s features were beginning to assume the proper proportions There was a diabolical leer upon Tode s face unchanged during the five years since Jim had seen him last except that it had become more evil more powerful The enormous and distorted face that Jim had seen had been simply due to the presence of some refracting medium The pillar of violet light was thinning spreading out over the pool but Jim could now see the scene more clearly than before even as he rushed onward The machine was inside what looked like a flat boat but more circular than a boat and apparently was made of some metal resembling aluminum Either from the metal hull or from the mechanism inside it there was emitted a pungent odor resembling chlorine The mechanism itself bore some resemblance to the old Atom Smasher of five years before but it appeared to be immensely more complicated Wheels of various sizes were set at every conceivable angle around the central tube from which the violet light was emanating and all were rotating and gyrating so fast that they looked like discs of light The boat itself was trembling and this movement appeared to be communicated to the boiling mud in the central part of the pool As Jim tried to leap down through the sucking mud to snatch Lucille from Tode the latter stopped straightened himself and pointed a short tube at Jim s heart Jim felt as if an enormous invisible force had struck him in the chest It was apparently the same repulsive force that had driven back the waters The shock was not a violent one It did not throw him off his feet It merely pushed him slowly and irresistibly backward And the whole picture was beginning to fade Etched sharply in the violet light one moment it now looked like a drawing that had been covered with tissue paper The outlines were dissolving into a haze or rather each line seemed reproduced an infinite number of times as the edge of a vibrating saw shows an infinitude of edges The violet fire was becoming still more diffused It hovered over the waters a pale flickering glow And simultaneously the walls of water began to break and come surging forward Jim saw Lucille stretching out her arms toward him and tried to struggle forward but in vain She cried out his name and he put all his strength into that desperate futile struggle to reach her But he was being borne backward by the invisible power in the tube The rushing torrent was surging about his knees grew waist deep in another moment Jim was swimming for his life against the furious flood Suddenly however the tremendous pressure on his chest was relaxed Tode had turned the tube away from him He was leaning forward out of the boat and grasped old Parrish who had been flung violently against it by the dissolving waters The same flood carried Jim to the boat s side Here however the flood was only knee deep owing to the repulsion still being exercised by the violet light which was glimmering feebly Jim found his feet and leaped into the craft He grasped Lucille in his arms He turned to confront Tode who had just dragged old Parrish over the side The three men confronted one another Turn that tube on me and I ll jump into your damn machinery and bust it Jim shouted An ironical expression came on Tode s face It was clear that he still considered himself master of the situation At the immediate moment Dent the lives of all of us depend upon your keeping absolutely still he answered Take my advice and sit down Jim saw Lucille s face ghastly in the faint violet light that played about it The girl had fainted She was lying unconscious her feet against the circular metal plate that protected the machinery her head upon the rail that ran around the boat s upper edge Tode without waiting for Jim s answer stepped over the plate and took his seat at a sort of instrument board with control levers and thumb screws that apparently controlled the needles on four dials He touched a button and instantly the violet light disappeared With its vanishing the waves came surging forward and lapped violently against the hull as if about to overwhelm the vessel which however seemed immovable It simply rose higher in the water Jim understood the cause of this Those gyroscopes would retain the hull in the same position against anything but a mechanical force strong enough to ruin it He watched Tode as he sat at the instrument board which was illuminated by two tiny lights of what looked like mercury vapor His face handsome and cruel as ever was tense as he manipulated the thumb screws Beside him lay Parrish faintly whimpering The old man had evidently abandoned all hope of effecting his escape or of rescuing his daughter It was unbearable to have to sit there knowing that the three of them were absolutely at Tode s mercy and yet there was nothing else to do Tode looked up with a saturnine smile It s a delicate operation to blur the present without shooting out a hundred years or so in time he said but my micrometer s pretty accurate Dent Don t move I caution you He smiled again Yes Dent time is something like the fourth dimension of space as we believed in the old days and I ve proved it Jim saw Tode touch the screw that controlled the fourth dial and instantly it was borne in on him that each of the dials controlled one spatial dimension This fourth then was the time dimension Could it be true that Tode had solved the practical problem of traveling in time theoretically implied since the discoveries of Einstein He had known in the old days that the Atom Smasher might be adapted to this purpose but neither Parrish nor he had dreamed of turning aside from their endeavor to utilize it for the purpose of releasing atomic energy Thump Thump The familiar old sound rushing back into memory after all those years the release of the electrical discharge echoing through infinity The scrub around the pool blurred and was gone A vast gray panorama extended itself on either side of them They were travelling in space and time too Jim no longer doubted And chilled with horror he sat there his arm about Lucille s unconscious form CHAPTER III Into the Infinite How long he sat there he did not know Minutes or hours seemed all the same to him Nothing but that gray monochrome of neither light nor darkness that endless panorama of miles and years blended together into this chaos But suddenly there came a shout from Tode The blur ceased the lights flickered Again there sounded the two thumps of the electrical discharge The vibrating mechanism grew steady Above them out of the grayness a moon disclosed itself then the pin points of stars All about them was an immense sandy waste Know where we are Dent came Tode s chuckle Jim was not sufficiently master of himself to attempt to answer We are on what will be the Russian steppes some fifty thousand years ahead of us in time grinned Tode This is an interlude between two ice ages Observe how pleasantly warm the climate is for Russia Unfortunately the receding glaciers carried off the top soil which accounts for the barrenness of the district but in another century this country will be overgrown with ferns and inhabited by the mastodon and wild horse and a few enterprising palaeolithic hunters who will come in to track them down and destroy them with their stone axes I think you re the same sort of damn liar you always were Tode answered Jim but without conviction There was something terrific about that desolation Nothing within a thousand miles of Long Island corresponded to it You ll be convinced pretty quickly when you see my specimen answered Tode I let him off here on the way to the pool He s not exactly presentable and when I got the idea of picking up Lucille and taking her back with me I thought it best not to let her see him He didn t want to be let off Was afraid I wouldn t pick him up again and I ll admit it was a matter of pretty careful reckoning But this is the place almost to the yard Yes I ve done some close reckoning Dent but the cleverest part of the business was letting old Parrish think he d got away from me I knew he d telephone Lucille You know I always had the brains of the outfit Dent he continued with a smirk of self satisfaction He looked out of the boat And here if I m not mistaken comes my specimen he added Something was running across the steppes toward them It came nearer took human form It was human A man but such a man as Jim had never seen before outside the covers of a book And he recognised the race immediately It was a Neanderthal man one of the race that company existed with the highly developed Cro Magnons some thirty thousand years ago Man and not ape though the face was bestial and there were huge ridges above the eyebrows And if Jim had needed conviction the sight of this gibbering creature now climbing into the boat and fawning upon Tode convinced him For the Neanderthal man vanished from the scene long before the beginning of recorded history For a few moments a deathly faintness overcame him his eyes closed he felt unconsciousness rushing in upon him like a black cloud It s all right Dent don t look so scared came Tode s mocking voice 
8684_293663_000082_000000	train-clean-360	Jim opened his eyes 
none	none	shook off that cloud of darkness with an immense effort The boat was throbbing violently as the wheels gyrated the violet light had become a pillar as thick as a man and shot straight up to a height of fifty feet before it rolled away Lucille was lying where she had been her eyes still staring up unseeing at the stars Old Parrish was whining and whimpering as he crouched in his place And at Tode s feet crouched the Neanderthal man repulsive bestial even though hardly formidable and filling the last vacant spot inside the boat He was gibbering and mouthing as he fawned upon Tode and pressed his hand to his hairy face He continued to crouch and looked up at his master with doglike eyes Repulsive and yet man not ape Distinctly human perhaps a little lower than the Australian aborigine the Neanderthal showed by his reverence that the human faculty of worship existed in him Meet Cain one of my Drilgoes said Tode with a grin A faithful servant I left him here to wait for me on the return journey Cain s just my pet name for him because he subsists on the fruits of the earth don t you Cain The Drilgo grunted and pressed Tode s hand to his repulsive lips which were fringed with a reddish beard Suddenly Tode began to laugh uproariously Feel anything wrong with your head Dent he asked Dent put up his hand and pulled away a quantity of charred hair His forehead began to itch and rubbing his finger across it he realized that his eyebrows were gone Tode laughed still louder You ve kept your teeth by about two seconds grace Dent but I shouldn t be surprised if you needed dental attention shortly he said What a pity dentists won t be invented for another forty or fifty thousand years You re a devil cried Jim You see the human body is very resistant to the Ray Tode went on It almost seems as if there is an organizing principle within it Even the animal tissues are resistant though not to the same extent as the human ones It takes about twenty seconds for the organized human form to be disintegrated But hair and beaks and claws being superficial matter vanish almost as soon as the Ray is turned on them Ten seconds more and you d have been obliterated Dent just as your plane was Yes rub your head Your hair will probably grow again if I decide to let you live It rather depends upon what impression you make upon Lucille as a bald headed hero After all I didn t invite you to accompany us It s your own lookout Jim could find nothing to say to that He was discovering more and more that they were all helpless in Tode s hands Sit back snarled Tode suddenly He gave the Drilgo a push that sent him sprawling into the bottom of the boat Dent your life depends upon your absolute acquiescence to my proposals I didn t like you particularly in the old days any more than you liked me I thought you were a fool On the other hand I ve no active reason to hate you at present It may be that I can use you Meanwhile we ve got a longish journey before us ten thousand years more multiplied by the fourth power of two thousand miles Seems simple Well I had to invent the mathematical process for it Reckon in the gravitational attraction of the planets and you ll begin to get an idea of the complexity of it So in vulgar parlance we re not likely to arrive till morning He glanced at Lucille who was still lying unconscious with Jim s arm about her Then his eyes rose to meet Jim s and a sneering smile played about his lips That smile was the acknowledgment of their rivalry for the girl s affections And it was more it was a challenge Tode welcomed that rivalry because Jim could see he meant to keep him alive under conditions of servitude to demonstrate to Lucille his superiority Tode turned his thumbscrews and the two thuds resounded The violet column sank down the boat vibrated the level stretch of land became a blur again The moon and stars vanished Once more the four were off on that terrific journey At first they seemed to be traversing space that was shot through by alternate light and darkness so that at times Jim could see the other occupants of the boat clearly while at other times there was only Tode visible at the instrument board with the dark outlines of the Drilgo Cain sprawled at his feet But soon these streaks seemed to come closer and closer together until the duration of each was only a fraction of a second And closer until light and darkness blended into a universal gray These Jim knew were the alternations of night and day They were traveling incredible as it was in time as well as space though whether backward or forward Jim could not know From the presence of the Neanderthal man however Jim was convinced that Tode was taking them back more thousands of years into the beginnings of humanity A fearful journey A madder journey than Jim could have conceived of had he not been a participant in it He was losing all sense of reality He was hardly convinced that he would not awaken in New York to discover that the whole episode had been a dream Was this Lucille the girl he loved with whom he had dined in New York only a day or two before this unconscious form stretched out on the deck of the weird ship that was rushing through eternity Or rather it was they who were rushing through space and time upon a stationary ship What was reality and what was dream then Tode called Come over here Dent I want to talk to you Jim picked his way over the metal floor of the round boat came up to Tode and sat down beside him above the sprawling form of the Drilgo Cain You were a fool to come here Dent Tode turned with a malicious smile from his seat at the instrument board You didn t have to come I take it that you are in love with Lucille you poor imbecile and still cherish dreams of winning her We ll take up that matter in due course Do you think I ve been idle during these five years of my exile I ve been too busy even to come back for the woman I was in love with And do you know what I ve been doing during all this hellish period Charting courses Dent Mapping out all the planetary movements back for uncounted ages roughly crudely of course but the best I was able to These are difficult seas to navigate though they may not seem so You fool he added savagely why didn t you come in with me in the old days I told you that the Atom Smasher could be used to travel through time and you mocked at me as a dreamer I chose my hour When everything was ready I set forth on the most desperate journey ever attempted by man Talk of Columbus he had nothing on me I tell you Dent I ve been back to the Archaean Age back to the time when nothing but crawling worms moved on the face of the earth And I ve been forward to the time when an errant planet will disrupt the earth into a shower of lava and I nearly wrecked the boat Dent I ve won Dent I ve won I ve solved the problem that gives man immortality All the epochs that have existed since God first formed the world are mine to play with I have seen myself as a puling infant and as a greybeard I have made myself immortal because with this machine I can set back the clock of time I have found a land where I am worshipped as a god Tode s eyes glittered with maniacal fires He went on in a voice of indescribable triumph I m a god there Dent Do you want to know where that land is It is Atlantis sunk beneath the waves nine thousand years before recorded history opened It is Atlantis from which the Cro Magnons fled in their ships to land on the coasts of Spain and France and become the ancestors of modern man In old Atlantis still not wholly submerged I have made myself a god I have mastered the savage Drilgoes whom the Atlanteans oppressed All the spoils of their ruined cities are at my disposal And I came back to get Lucille whom I had never ceased to love Together Lucille and I will rule like god and goddess Join me Dent I m a god in Atlantis a god I tell you The lesser races fear me as a supernatural being Only the city remains uncaptured but it is mine whenever I choose to take it A god a god a god Jim saw now what he had not realized before that Tode was insane It would indeed have been a miracle if he had been able to retain his sanity under such circumstances as he had described His voice rose into a wild scream Yes Tode was mad just such a madman as any of the old Roman emperors drunk with power each in his turn the sole ruler of the world The Earth is mine Tode screamed Before the modern world was dreamed of before the nations were created Atlantis was the sole power that held dominion over the scattered tribes of mankind And she is in my hand whenever I strike Wealth incalculable treasures such as man has never since seen marvels of scientific discovery flying machines that would make ours look foolish paintings grander than have since been executed all these things exist in the proud city that will shortly be at my command And I have my Drilgoes the inferior race to serve me They worship me because they know I am a god Join me Dent and taste the joys of being one of the supreme rulers of the world In spite of his undoubted madness there was such power in Tode s voice that Jim could not help believe what he had said Well snarled Tode You hesitate to give me your answer Dent Lucille and I are engaged to be married answered Jim and the words were drawn from his lips almost against his will We love each other I am not going to lie to you and then betray you Tode The expression on Tode s face was demoniacal He snatched up the deadly tube that contained the violet fire and turned it upon Jim Again Jim felt that repulsive force pushing him back He gasped for breath and tensed his whole body in supreme resistance while he tried to grapple with Tode in vain But suddenly Tode dropped the tube and a roar of laughter broke from his lips You fool he shouted I tell you I am a god the one god supreme above all Do you think to match your puny will against my own I tell you Lucille is mine And for ever Dent Whenever we two have reached old age all that will be necessary for us to do will be to turn this screw a hair s breadth back into the past and we are both young again By holding this vessel steady in four dimensional space I can achieve immortality Yes Tode answered Jim but you see that s the one thing that you haven t been able to work out yet The words seemed to come automatically from Jim s lips It was only after he had spoken them that he realized they were true For a moment Tode glared at him then suddenly with a shriek of insane rage he leaped from the instrument board and swung the ray tube with all his might Jim felt the blow descend with stunning force upon his head He reeled flung out his arms and toppled forward unconscious CHAPTER IV Escape An intolerably bright light that seemed to sear his eyeballs was the first thing of which Jim was conscious Then he became aware of his aching head of a sense of utter lassitude as if he had been bruised all over in some machine that had caught him up and held him in its grip for endless aeons At last despite the pain in his eyes he managed to get his eyelids open He tried to struggle to his feet only to discover that he was firmly bound with what appeared to be tough creepers pliant as ropes After the lapse of a few minutes during which he struggled with the receding waves of unconsciousness he came to a realization of his surroundings That light that had so distressed him though the effects were now beginning to pass off was a pillar of smoke and flame shooting out of the crater of a volcano about a mile away across a valley He was lying in the entrance to a cave pegged out on his back and bound by the tough creepers to the stakes driven into the ground Up to the mouth of the cave grew huge tree ferns cattails cycads and such growths as existed in earlier ages in the warm moist regions of the world Beneath the level of the cave a heavy white fog completely shrouded the valley extending up to within a short distance of the volcano opposite But on the upper slopes of the volcano the sunlight played making its crater a sheen of glassy lava intolerably bright Beyond the volcano Jim could see what looked like an expanse of ocean He groaned and at the sound a creature came shambling forward carrying what looked like a huge melon in either hand Jim recognized the Drilgo Cain Chattering and mumbling Cain placed one of the fruits to Jim s mouth It was a sort of bread fruit but he was too nauseated to eat and rejected it with disgust Cain offered him the second fruit It was a hollow gourd the interior filled with a clear fluid Jim drank greedily as the Drilgo put it to his lips The contents were like water but slightly acid Jim felt refreshed He looked about him The Drilgo uttered a chattering call and immediately a host of the savages swarmed into the cave Men undoubtedly men in spite of the brow ridges and the receding foreheads carrying long spears consisting of chipped and pointed heads of stone with holes bored in them through which long bands of creepers passed fastening them firmly to the shaft Chattering and gesticulating the Drilgoes surrounded Jim as he lay helpless on the ground Their savage faces their rolling eyes the threatening gestures that they made with their spears convinced Jim that his end was a foregone conclusion But suddenly a distant rumbling sound was heard increasing rapidly in volume The floor of the cave vibrated masses of rock dropped from the walls The light of the volcano across the valley was suddenly obscured in an immense cloud of black smoke The twilight within the cave was succeeded by almost impenetrable darkness Shrieking in terror the Drilgoes bolted while Jim lay straining at his ropes expecting each moment to be crushed by the masses of rock that were falling all about him Suddenly a soft whisper came to Jim through the darkness Jim Are you safe Where are you I can t see you Speak to me It was Lucille s voice and Jim called back husky and tremulous in the sheer joy that had succeeded his anticipation of instant death Then he felt the girl kneeling at his side and heard her hacking at his bonds A whole minute passed before the stone knife was able to sever the last of the stout withes however Then Jim was swaying on his feet and Lucille s arms were about him and for a few moments their fears were forgotten in the renewal of their love I heard what that devil said to you last night the girl said He means to kill you with awful tortures He is away now on some task or other but he ll be back at any moment We must get away at once we three Dad s in another cave not far away and his guards bolted after the earthquake The earth was still rumbling and the cavern still vibrating but it was clear that there was no time to lose As soon as the quake subsided the Drilgoes would return Guided by Lucille Jim groped his way through the cavern The girl called softly at intervals and presently Jim heard old Parrish s answering call Then the old man s form appeared in silhouette against the dark I ve got Jim Lucille whispered Are you ready dad Yes yes I m ready chattered the old man Now s our chance I know a place where we can hide in the thick forests where the Ray of the Atlanteans cannot penetrate the mists Let s go Let s go Gripping hands the three started back toward the point where a faint patch of darkness showed out the entrance to the cavern They were nearing it when another and more violent shock flung them upon their faces Huge masses of rock came hurtling down from the roof and sides of the cavern and again the three seemed to escape by a miracle Suddenly a huge shaft of fire shot from the crater opposite evolving into an inverted cone that made the whole land dazzlingly bright It pierced the mists in the valley underneath and by that light Jim could see a great wave of lava streaming down the mountain sides like soup spilled out of a bowl A gush of black smoke followed and the light went out Now gasped Parrish and clinging to one another the three darted out of the cavern s entrance Another terrific shock sent them stumbling and reeling and sprawling down the side of the mountain Jim heard old Parrish wailing and as the shock subsided groped his way to his side You hurt he shouted Lucille Lucille moaned the old man She s dead A big rock crushed her I wish I was dead too Jim called Lucille s name frantically and to his immense relief heard her crying faintly out of the darkness He rushed to her side and held her in his arms Where are you hit darling I m all right she panted I was stunned for a moment I can go on now But she went limp in Jim s arms and Jim picked her up and stood irresolute until he heard Parrish shambling toward him over the heaving ground She s not hurt I think only fainted said Jim Which way Parrish You lead us Down the slope panted Parrish We ll be in the ferns in a minute We can hide there for a while till she s able to walk God help us all And I was once Professor of Physical Chemistry at Columbia The outcry might have seemed comical under other circumstances as it was Jim heartily re echoed old Parrish s sentiments in his heart The last shock was subsiding in faint earth tremors The two men plunged down into the heavy fog which quickly covered them Jim carrying Lucille in his arms He felt the ferny undergrowth all about him the thick boles of tree ferns emerged out of the mist We can stop here for a while panted Parrish Crouch down They ll never find us in this fog and in a few minutes when Lucille s better we can go on You must tell me where we are and what our chances are said Jim after again ascertaining that Lucille was unharmed I ll tell you Dent as quick as I can It s the place where I ve spent five years of hell as the slave of that devil Tode I never dreamed when we were working on the old Atom Smasher that he had adapted it to travel in the fourth dimension He s taken us back twelve thousand years or so to the island of Atlantis History hasn t begun yet Atlantis is the only civilization in the world The rest are Drilgoes Neanderthal men wandering in the forests and still in their stone age It s true Dent what old Plato learned from the Egyptian priests Atlantis has been slowly sinking for thousands of years and all that s left now is the one great island that we re on Nearly all the Atlanteans the Cro Magnon men have perished except for a few who have crossed in ships to the coasts of France and Spain They ll be the founders of modern Europe Basques and Iberians and Bretons and Welshmen Our ancestors It makes my brain reel to think of it Go on Go on said Jim There s a great city on the island known as Atlantis too As big as London or New York With flying machines and temples and art galleries and big ships that they re building to carry them away when the next subsidence comes They know they re doomed for every few days there s an eruption now Tode means to make himself master of Atlantis and transport it into another epoch by means of the Atom Smasher But he s never managed to enter He s made himself a god in the eyes of the Drilgoes the savages who inhabit these forests He s planning to lead them against the city and he s got an army of thousands from all parts of the interior who worship him as divine The Atlanteans are unwarlike They ve forgotten how to fight in their thousands of years of peace But they ve got a Ray ten times as strong as Tode s that brings instant death to everything it touches It shrivels it up It s a different principle I don t understand it but it s this Ray that keeps the Drilgoes from capturing the city Tode s got a laboratory inside the cave fitted up with apparatus that he brought from Chicago the world capital of the year three thousand A D after disintegrating the atoms and recombining them But he hasn t succeeded altogether He hasn t learned everything The future isn t quite clear like the past There s a dark cloud moves across the spectral lines and blurs them I think it s the element of free will or God I know Jim answered He can t hold that boat steady in four dimensional space as he pretends he can If he could it would mean that man was wholly master of his destiny He can t and he never will There s an unknown quantity comes in Parrish It is God and that s what s going to beat him in the end I ve not been as idle as Tode thinks said Parrish with a senile leer I know more about the Atom Smasher than he dreams of He thinks me just an old fool the remnants of whose brains are useful to him in his laboratory That s why he s kept me alive so far He ll find out his mistake he chuckled I have something Tode doesn t dream of Suddenly Parrish s air of intense seriousness vanished He chuckled and fumbled in his rags Jim felt a small object like a lever pressed into his hand and then withdrawn It s death Dent chuckled old Parrish The concentrated essence of the destructive principle It s a lever I fitted into a concealed groove in the Atom Smasher unknown to Tode This lever has a universal joint and connects with a hidden chamber and when pulled will catapult the annihilated components of a small quantity of uranium in any direction we desire The release of the slumbering energy of this uranium will produce an explosion of proportions beyond the wildest dreams of engineers perhaps one great enough to throw the Earth out of its orbit Uranium Breaking up its components gasped Jim You mean you can actually do that Yes chuckled Parrish I m keeping it for the day when Tode becomes a god When he s steadied the boat in time space and halted the march of the past and when he s got Lucille then Dent I shall so pull the lever that it will release the energy straight at Tode and destroy the Atom Smasher ourselves and even perhaps the whole Earth And he burst into a peal of such wild laughter that Jim realized the old man s wits were gone Was it true that amazing story It was difficult to know and yet anything seemed possible in this amazing world into which Jim had suddenly been thrown The vast pall of smoke cast out by the volcano was beginning to subside Slowly a spectral light began to filter through the valley Through the fog Jim could see glimpses of the ferny undergrowth the giant tree ferns and cycads that towered aloft It was like a picture of the earth when the mastodons the grass eaters and the meat eaters disputed for its supremacy Jim bent over Lucille He saw her stir he heard her murmur his name Suddenly she sat up fixed her eyes on his and shuddered I m all right Jim Let s go she said I can walk now She staggered to her feet Jim put out his hand to support her but she shook her head Jim touched old Parrish on the arm He started and uttered a wild screech then seemed to come to himself and rose But that screech of his was re echoed from the mountainside above Other voices took up the echoes Lucille clutched at Jim in a frenzy of fear The Drilgoes she whispered They re on our trail Seizing old Parrish by the arm Jim started to drag him into the recesses of the fern forest Suddenly the bestial face of a Drilgo appeared A yell broke from the man s throat The hairy arm shot back Jim saw the stone tip of the long spear poised overhead He leaped forward delivering a blow in the man s midriff with all the strength of his right arm The Drilgo grunted and doubled forward the spear falling from his hand The heavy head of stone embedded itself in the soft ground so that the spear remained upright As the man collapsed he yelled at the top of his voice This way This way gibbered old Parrish suddenly alert But now the undergrowth all about them was alive with Drilgoes The three dodged and doubled like hunted hares High overhead something began to clack with a sound like that made by a woodpecker drilling a tree but infinitely louder And out of the void above came Tode s voice shouting commands to the Drilgoes in their own language Suddenly a column of fire shot up from the volcano infusing the white mists with a reddish glare Overhead the three could see Tode He was flying with a pair of mechanical wings strapped to his shoulders not more than two hundred feet above them With a shout of triumph he swooped down In his hand was a small cylinder about the mouth of which a phosphorescent violet light was beginning to play I ve got you Dent he screamed in triumph hovering above the three while the wings drummed and vibrated till they seemed the mere play of light and shadow about Tode s shoulders Halt or I ll blast your body and soul to hell Halt or I ll kill her The deadly tube was pointing steadily at Lucille s body as Tode hovered ten feet overhead perfectly still save for the whirring wings The three stopped dead and Tode with a shout of triumph began calling the Drilgoes who swarmed forward out of the undergrowth Huge brown bodies nude save for their skins of jungle cat or serpent they emerged quickly forming a ring about the three prisoners Tode fluttered to the ground Fools did you think you could escape that way he asked As for you Dent I m going to convince you of the reality of four dimensional space as you would not be convinced in the old days Do you know what I m going to do with you I m going to strip the skin from you with the ray and take you into the anatomical room at Columbia University and leave you there as an exhibit Dent Tode grinned like a madman But Jim was looking past him at something that had suddenly appeared upon the far horizon It was a round disc of bluish white a disc like the moon but slightly smaller a disc that flickered as if it had an eyelid that was being winked repeatedly Simultaneously screams broke from the throats of all the Drilgoes They stampeded Tode whirled about and saw With a curse he leaped into the air and whirred away Out of that disc a slender blue white beam shot suddenly driving a pathway through the fog and disclosing the dark depths of the valley The Eye The Eye screeched Parrish Down on the ground Down Down He dropped and Jim caught Lucille and flung himself headlong with her To and fro overhead but only a few feet above them moved the searchlight Shrieks broke from the Drilgoes throats as they scattered through the jungle Everywhere that ray moved trees and undergrowth simply disappeared A bunch of Drilgoes caught by it were obliterated in an instant Great gaps were left through the undergrowth as the ray passed It faded as quickly as it had come and instantly old Parrish was on his feet dragging at his daughter Now Now he babbled heading along one of the burned tracks through the undergrowth Jim seized Lucille and the two raced in the wake of old Parrish Behind them they could hear the Drilgoes shouting but a dense impenetrable darkness was already beginning to settle down over the valley They lost the track and went crashing through the ferns on and on until all was silence about them Suddenly Parrish went down like a log He lay breathing heavily completely exhausted When Jim spoke to him a feeble muttering was the only answer Jim and Lucille dropped to the ground exhausted beside him CHAPTER V The Eye of Atlantis For perhaps half an hour the three lay there hearing nothing It seemed to be night for the darkness was impenetrable save for the lurid flashes of fire from the volcano Parrish who was slowly recovering his strength was mumbling incessantly It was with difficulty that Jim recalled him to a realization of his surroundings Where is the city of Atlantis he asked him Over there mumbled Parrish Behind the volcano Why do you ask me I m thinking of going there Eh Going there You re mad The Eye will see you the Eye that can see for a hundred miles They ll turn the Ray on you Nothing is too small for the Eye And they watch night and day The Eye is off now It s never off The Eye is dark It grows white only when they are about to use the Ray Perhaps the Eye is watching us now Nevertheless said Jim I think we would do well to try to enter the city We can t live here in the jungle at the mercy of these Drilgoes It is impossible to enter All strangers are killed by the Atlanteans Dad interposed Lucille I think we d better do what Jim suggests One of us must decide My idea is that you take us to some place where we can get a view of the city said Jim Then we can make up our minds what to do We ve got to get somewhere out of this jungle Parrish rose to his feet mumbling If we go round the base of the volcano we can see Atlantis he said It s always light there In the daytime they drive away the fogs by some means they ve got and at night they have an artificial sun But we ll be killed we ll all be killed Mumbling and muttering he began groping his way through the undergrowth in the direction of the volcano whose flashes were again becoming more frequent affording a means of directing their route Obscure rumblings were again beginning to shake the earth For an hour the three picked their way steadily upward through the ferns until the ground became more open They were approaching the base of the volcano whose side now towered above them the upper part glassy with vitreous lava Suddenly Parrish who was still leading stopped and began to tremble with fear Stepping to his side Jim heard the low muttering of voices not far away Very cautiously he moved forward through the thin fern scrub until the glow of burning embers caught his sight He stopped hearing the voices more distinctly and again moved forward Three Drilgoes huge bestial men and evidently an outpost were squatting around the ashes devouring something with noisy gusto Softly as Jim had moved their acute ears had caught the sound of his footsteps They rose still holding what they were eating in their hands and grasping their stone spears moved in three separate ways toward the edge of the clearing The man nearest Jim uttered a guttural exclamation and after sniffing a moment began to lope in his direction Suddenly he stopped short petrified with astonishment and fear at the sight of a man who instinct told him was neither Atlantean nor of his own kind Jim leaped tackling him about the knees and brought him heavily to the ground As the Drilgo fell the spear clattered from his hand but from his snakeskin girdle he pulled a long curved knife of chipped obsidian sharp as a razor Jim grasped the Drilgo s wrist but in a moment he saw that he was no match for the creature in strength He drew back his right arm and delivered a punch to the solar plexus with all his strength As the Drilgo s hand grew limp he snatched away the knife There was no helping what he did for the two others were close upon him A thrust a slashing blow and the Drilgo was weltering in his life blood A backward leap and Jim evaded the flung spear by a hair s breadth Knife in hand he leaped forward and dodging in beneath the long shaft of the weapon got in a slash that almost cut the Drilgo s body in two The third Drilgo seeing his two companions in their death throes flung away his spear and fled with loud howls into the jungle Jim stepped back Lucille and her father were already almost at his heels It s all right he called Come this way He led them through the ferny growth in such a manner that they should not see the two dead bodies Nevertheless he felt that Lucille knew Let s see what they were cooking he said But again he turned quickly He could not know for sure what flesh that was roasting and scorching on the embers and he had no desire to know It might have been monkey but he turned away and as he did so Parrish picked up several round objects that were lying a little distance away These are good to eat he said A sort of bread fruit I ve lived on it for five years he added with a sort of grotesque pathos They munched the fruit as they proceeded up the mountain and found it satisfying Parrish seemed more himself again though he still muttered at intervals Lucille clung closely to Jim as they proceeded They were treading on lava now vitreous and smooth as glass It was impossible to proceed further in that direction They turned their steps around the base in the direction of the sea After another hour during which their way was lit by almost continuous lurid flashes from the crater a patch of illumination apparently out at sea began to become visible A half hour more and they were rounding the volcano s base and suddenly it burst upon them a stupendous spectacle that drew an exclamation of amazement from Jim s lips That low flat background was the sea the sound of whose breakers was faintly audible Between sea and land ran a narrow slender causeway perhaps a mile in length And beyond that set on a small island was the most splendid city that Jim could have imagined Like New York very like New York with its mighty towers but more symmetrical sloping upward from the sea toward a towering rampart at the heart of it crowned with huge domes and minarets and serpentine ramps and mighty blocks of stone that must have sheltered as many occupants as New York s highest skyscrapers The whole was snow white and gleamed softly in an artificial light dispensed from an enormous artificial planet that seemed to hover above the ramparts God whispered Jim in awe as he gazed at the great city You cannot cross that causeway whimpered old Parrish It s death to try One sweep of the Ray will blot out every living thing Hush Listen came from Lucille s lips Something s moving down there The distant murmur of voices the indescribable feel of the proximity of other human beings told Jim that they were in imminent danger He glanced about him A little overhead was an outcrop of enormous boulders standing up like a little fortress above the smooth lava Get behind there Jim whispered They turned and ran slipping and stumbling up the smooth slope Reaching the boulders they ensconced themselves hastily behind them Jim peered out through a crevice between two of the largest stones The sound of moving things became more audible Then as a flash of flame shot from the crater overhead Jim saw a black human horde creeping like an array of ants around the base of the mountain not far beneath Just like an army of warrior ants it seemed to flow onward in perfect order And in the midst of it a faint violet light began to be visible Parrish seized Jim s arm shaking with terror You know what that is Dent he whimpered It s Tode s Drilgoes moving for a night attack upon Atlantis answered Jim And that thing in the middle is the Atom Smasher It seemed hours before the last of the serried ranks of Drilgoes had passed By the light of a lurid flash from the volcano Jim could see the column winding toward the causeway Then all was shrouded in impenetrable darkness save for the snow soft city upon the island What are we going to do chattered old Parrish I wish I was back in Tode s cave He gave me food and let me help with his work sometimes I ll die here We ll never get away We ll never get anywhere We re safer here than anywhere else answered Jim We ll have to stay till morning or God look at that Out of the ramparts of the city the round blue white disc of the Eye had suddenly disclosed itself And simultaneously a violet flare shot up above the moving hosts of the Drilgoes in the middle of the causeway Out of the center of the Eye that blinding searchlight streamed And the pillar of violet fire rose up to counter it clove it in two as a man cuts off the tentacle of a cuttlefish and left it groping helplessly above the heads of the Drilgoes To and fro wavered the blue white beam and like a protective wall the violet column spread and extended till the air was interlaced with the play of the two colors Streaks of white shot through streaks of purple and black neutral clouds twirled swirling in ghostlike forms It was a scene inconceivably beautiful and it was impossible to realize what must be happening out there Men must be dying withering like stubble in the blue white flames whenever they caught them And yet under that play of colors Jim could see the vast host crawling forward to the assault He held his breath It was sublime and terrible and on the result of that conflict depended what What difference when all this was forgotten history antedating the written records of the human race Then of a sudden the blue white rays were seen to win They were beating down the violet light Like living fingers they pierced that protective wall flinging it back until only the tall central pillar remained And then for the first time the sound of combat became audible A groan of despair of defeat of hopelessness The black stream was recoiling turning upon itself In the vivid glare of the white light it could be seen dissolving breaking into a thousand pieces streaming back toward the land And as it broke the blue white light pursued eating its way and blasting all it met Atlantis had triumphed Another sound was audible From the city it came a whirring as of innumerable grasshoppers increasing till it sounded once more like the tapping of innumerable woodpeckers Suddenly the night broke into whirling balls of fire Lucille cried out Jim leaped to his feet to see more clearly It s men with wings he cried Scores of them They re hurling something at the Drilgoes The clacking of the wing mechanism filled the air Now the fugitives from the Drilgo host were streaming along the base of the mountain underneath seeking the safety of the jungles and over them riding them harrying them flew the Atlantean birdmen hurling their fiery balls And where the balls fell conflagrations of cold fire seemed to start and run like mercury and shrivel up everything they touched But the birdmen were not without casualties of their own Here and there one could be seen to drop and then the massed Drilgoes would turn savagely upon him with their stone pointed spears The fight was coming very close now The savage cries of the Drilgoes filled the night A ball of fire broke hardly fifty yards away from where the three were crouching A birdman fluttered down like a wounded hawk and lay a sprawl just underneath the rampart of boulders Jim surmounted them ran down the slope of the mountainside and bent over the dying man He was hideously wounded by the thrust of a Drilgo spear whether because the mechanism had failed or because he had swooped too low Jim could not determine As Jim bent over him he looked up at him A youth in his teens with the face and build of a Greek warrior a worthy ancestor of European man Jim looked at him and shuddered My grandfather four hundred generations removed he thought Seeing that this was no Drilgo with eyes widened by the anticipation of death the Atlantean smiled and died Jim detached the straps that held the wings to his shoulders and examined them They were multi hinged built of innumerable layers of laminated wood which seemed to have been subjected to some special treatment In the base of each just where it fitted to the curve of the shoulder blade a tiny light was burning Jim looped the straps about his arms and walked back to the rampart Old Parrish saw him and screamed Lucille cried out I m going to try to get the Atom Smasher said Jim pointing to the thin spire of violet flame that was still visible in the center of the causeway It s our only chance You must stay here If I live I ll return If I don t return But he knew that he must return Nothing could kill him because Lucille would be waiting for him behind that rampart of stones upon the bare vitreous mountainside I m going to get the Atom Smasher Jim repeated In these wings I ll be taken for Atlantean I ll bring it back He spoke with faltering conviction And yet there was nothing else to do Everything depended upon his being able to bring back the Atom Smasher and take Lucille and her father away I think you re right Jim answered Lucille We ll wait here till you come back Her voice died away in a sob Jim bent and kissed her Then he began examining the mechanism of the wings It did not appear difficult A leather strap fastened around the body Through this strap ran cords operated by levers upon the breast and there was a knob in a groove that looked as if it controlled the starting of the mechanism I ll be back said Jim And suddenly the Eye appeared again and with it there sounded once more the whir of wings Down shouted Jim He was too late A score of birdmen shot out of the dark and hovered over them Next moment they had descended to the ground Lucille and Parrish were seized and Jim struggling furiously quickly found himself equally helpless in their grasp The accents of the Atlanteans as they spoke to one another were soft and liquid their faces were refined and gentle but their strength was that of athletes Jim saw Lucille and Parrish lifted into the air next moment he himself was raised in the arms of one of the birdmen who shot upward like an arrow and headed a course back toward the city carrying Jim as if he had been as light as a child CHAPTER VI Human Sacrifice In a great open space flanked by temples and colonnades the flight had come to rest There under the soft artificial light that made the whole city as bright as day Jim Lucille and her father were set down before a sort of rostrum on which were gathered the dignitaries of the city Jim s hopes were rising fast for between the Atlanteans and the savage Drilgoes there was as much difference as between a modern American and a blackfellow from the Australian bush These men were civilized to a degree that even modern America has not attained Nowhere was there a speck of dirt to be seen Vehicles moved soundlessly along the wide streets on either side of this central meeting place and the whole city was roofed with glass through which could be seen the brilliant moon and stars invisible from the mist filled valley without Soft garments of white wool clothed men and women alike fashioned something like togas but cut short at the knee leaving the lower part of the leg bare and disclosing the sandaled feet The hair was long and flowed about the shoulders But what struck Jim most forcibly was the look of utter gentleness and benignity upon these faces I guess we ve fallen into pretty good hands after all he whispered to Parrish But one of the dignitaries upon the platform an elderly man with a face reminiscent of William Jennings Bryan in his inspired moments was leaning forward out of his curved chair and addressing the old man and to Jim s astonishment Parrish was answering But these were not the liquid accents of the Atlanteans The words resembled the barking of a dog and across Jim s brain there suddenly flashed the explanation The dignitary was speaking in the tongue of the Drilgoes which Parrish of course would have learned in his five years of captivity Suddenly Parrish turned to Jim He wants to know where we come from he said I ve told him from a far country He thinks we re ambassadors from some of the parts of Europe that the Atlanteans who sailed away some years ago landed at It s no use trying to explain they don t seem to have succeeded in inventing an Atom Smasher for themselves Jim nodded and the colloquy went on and on while the Atlanteans listened with languid interest their kind and smiling faces seeming to exude benignity At length the session seemed to have ended Parrish wore a wide grin Everything s coming right dear he told Lucille The old chap says we are to be the guests of the city either for a night or for a week It s something to do with the moon and there seems to be a full moon to night Some quaint superstition or other And then I guess we ll have a chance to get away in the Atom Smasher I ve learned something of the mechanism and it won t be hard to operate it We ve fallen into good hands A squad of four soldiers or policemen with shorter robes and what looked like truncheons in their hands made signs to the three to accompany them Amid mutual bows the city s guests filled into a small court way closed at the further end on which a number of Atlanteans were standing While Jim was wondering what the next move was to be to his astonishment the whole courtyard began to rise slowly up the walls of the tall buildings on either side An elevator gasped Lucille Now I do feel that everything is coming out all right Jim dear Jim did not question the psychology of this He pressed her hand tenderly Already Tode and the past were becoming a bad dream Did you say anything about the Atom Smasher Parrish he asked No I thought it better not to replied the old scientist You see they know it only as a force that neutralizes the blue white ray Best not to let them know we re sailing for home in it I think that was wise answered Jim and just then the rising court way came to a stop level with the top story of the great building at one side Smiling courteously the guards invited the three to precede them inside an enormous hall supported on pillars of gleaming stone resembling alabaster In the center was a small low table triangular in shape with three of the low curved chairs The guards invited the three to be seated Almost immediately smiling servitors brought in fruits on platters of porcelain dishes of cooked vegetables somewhat like the modern ones but seasoned and flavored with delicious herbs The staple dish was something like an oval banana but infinitely more succulent The three fell to and made a hearty meal which was washed down with fine wines We ve certainly fallen into good hands said Jim All we ve got to do is to lie low and look pleasant and it won t be long before we get an opportunity to get hold of the Atom Smasher The guards seeing that they had finished their meal smilingly invited them to accompany them through a huge bronze door at one end of the hall It swung back disclosing complete darkness Jim felt Lucille s hand upon his arm The girl was hesitating and for a moment Jim hesitated too half afraid of a fall into emptiness Then he heard the footsteps of the guards ahead and went on It was eery moving there with the sound of feet in front of them and apart from that utter silence Then Lucille uttered a little cry Jim do you feel something pushing you she asked There is something Jim swung around but some invisible force continued to propel him forward He moved sidewise and the force gently corrected him The sound of footsteps had ceased What is it Jim cried the girl Help me Something s got hold of me Old Parrish was struggling close beside them Jim panted as he wrestled with the force but his efforts were absolutely futile Slowly as if slid on wires he was propelled forward until a cushion of air seemed to block his further progress Dark as it was and silent Jim had the consciousness of other human beings about him of a vast unseen multitude that was watching him Suddenly the droning of a chant began to fill the place as if a priest were intoning hymns As that chant rose and fell voices all about took up the echoing refrain Jim tried to reach Lucille but he could move his arm only a few inches against that resilient force pressing in on all sides of him Then in an instant a blinding stabbing light shot through his eyeballs He heard Lucille scream old Parrish yelp and with eyelids screwed tight against the intolerable glare fought once more desperately and ineffectively to reach Lucille s side Slowly Jim managed to unscrew his eyes He began to realize that he was standing in what appeared to be an enormous amphitheatre But high up upon a narrow tongue of flooring that ran like a bridge from one end to the other with Lucille on his right and Parrish on his left Nothing visible seemed to be restraining them and yet they were as securely held as if fastened with tight chains Jim s brain reeled as he looked down Imagine a bridge about half way up an amphitheatre of a hundred stories the ground beneath packed with human beings no larger than ants the whole of the vast interior lined with them tier above tier faces and forms increasing from pismire size below to the dimensions of the human form upon a level and again fading almost to pin points at the summit of the vast building where the soft glow of the artificial light filtered through the glass of the roof He clutched at the air felt the soft pressure of the force that was restraining him looked at Lucille and saw her half unconscious with fear leaning against it leaning against that soft resilient cushionlike invisible substance looked at Parrish whom the shock had thrown into a sort of semi catalepsy Parrish mouthing and staring He looked forward to where the tongue of flooring ended Here upon a stage flanked with huge carven figures a group was gathered At first he was unable to discern what was being enacted there so brilliant was the light that glared overhead It was the Eye a round disc perhaps ten feet in diameter that all seeing Eye of Atlantis that guarded the great city but how it worked Jim was totally unable to discover He saw however that it was blinking rapidly the alternations being so swift that it was only just possible to be conscious of them Perhaps the Eye was opening and closing ten times a second Jim strained his eyes to see what was taking place on the stage at the end of the tongue on which he stood What was it What were they doing there And was that the captured Atom Smasher standing between what looked like grinning idols A group of captured Drilgoes near it A shrill scream from Lucille echoed through the vast amphitheatre Her eye had seen what Jim s had not yet seen something that had shocked her into complete unconsciousness A marble figure she stood leaning against the invisible force that kept her on her feet and in those open staring eyes was a look of ineffable horror Jim could see clearly now for the light from the Eye was slowly diminishing in brilliancy or else his own eyes were growing more accustomed to it Those carven figures forming a semi circle upon the platform were figures of gods squat huge forms seeming to emerge out of the blocks of rock from which they had been fashioned Hideous gruesome carvings they were resembling some futuristic sculpture of to day for the artist who had fashioned them had given hardly more than a hint of the finished representation It was rather as if the masses of rock that had been transported there had become vitalized foreshadowing the dim yet awful beings that were some day to emerge from them Only the arms were clearly sculptured and each of the half dozen figures squatting upon its haunches in that semi circle had four of them Arms that protruded so as to form an interlacing network and the fingers were long claws fashioned of some metal Over the arms the shapeless heads beat down with a leering look and from each mouth protruded a curved tongue A masterpiece of horror that group like the great stone figures of the Aztecs or some of the hideous Indian gods Seen under the glare of the Eye they formed a background of horrible omen In a flash it dawned upon Jim that these hideous figures might be gods of bloody sacrifice That s why these people seem so gentle he heard himself saying It s the the contrast He pulled himself together Again he tried to move towards Lucille and again that invisible force restrained him Yes it was the captured Atom Smasher upon the platform and those forms grouped in front of the dignitaries were captured Drilgoes a dozen or so of them And the concealed priest was droning a chant again Every other sound was hushed but from each square foot of the great amphitheatre a pair of eyes was watching A myriad of eyes turned upon the platform What was going to happen next Suddenly the priest s voice died away and simultaneously the three dignitaries who seemed to be officiating priests from their solemn gestures stepped backward passing beneath the protruding arms of the idols There sounded the deep whir of some mechanism somewhere and the same invisible force that had Jim and his two companions in its control suddenly began to agitate the captive Drilgoes It was shuffling them It was forcing them into line pushing here and pulling there in spite of the Drilgoes terrified struggles They writhed and twisted groaning and clicking in abject terror as they wrestled with that unseen power and all in vain Slowly the foremost of the Drilgoes was propelled forward inch by inch until he stood immediately beneath the interlacing arms And what happened next filled Jim with sick horror and loathing For of a sudden the arms began to move the iron claws cut through the air a shriek of terror and anguish broke from the Drilgo s mouth and he was no longer a man but a clawed and pulped mass of human flesh Aiah Aiah Aiah broke from the throats of the assembled multitude The weaving arms had stopped From behind them an attendant was gathering up what had been the Drilgo in a basket Then the mechanism had begun again and again that shrill cry of the spectators was ringing in Jim s ears Louder still rose the shriek of old Parrish as he understood Jim put forth all his strength in a mad effort to break free A child would have had more chance in the grip of a giant And each time the arms of the gods revolved the unseen force pushed Jim Lucille and Parrish nearer the platform Now Jim understood This horrible sacrifice was a part of the religion of the Atlanteans and he Lucille and Parrish were being reserved for the final spectacle And at the sight of Lucille beside him stonily unconscious and yet standing and moving like a mechanical doll in little forward jerks at the sight of the girl hardly six feet distant and yet utterly beyond the touch of his finger tips Jim went mad He would not shout he closed his lips in pride of race pride of that civilization that he had left twelve thousand years ahead of him Not like the shrieking Drilgoes on the platform howling as each of them in turn was forced into that maze of revolving knives But he fought as a madman fights He hammered at the resilient air while the sweat ran down his face he braced his feet upon the wooden tongue and sought to stay his forward progress And all the while that infernal force moved him steadily onward He was on the platform now He was traveling the same route that the Drilgoes had taken The unseen force was shuffling him Lucille and Parrish pushing and pulling them And despite Jim s efforts it was Lucille who was first of the three and Jim second and old Parrish third Jim heard Parrish s hoarse whisper behind him Death Death The uranium He was fumbling at his breast but the significance of the words and gestures escaped him He was staring ahead Only three living Drilgoes of the whole number of prisoners remained alive and suddenly it was borne in upon Jim that he knew the last of the three It was the Drilgo Cain who had been their companion in the Atom Smasher there not a dozen feet distant Cain his bestial face with the ridged eyebrows and great jaws convulsed with terror and dripping sweat Cain immediately in front of Lucille God let her not wake Let her never know Jim breathed The agony would be but momentary And there was nothing a man could not endure if he must He could even endure to see Lucille become what the Drilgoes had become It would soon be over now The Eye was blinking overhead The hideous stone faces of the Atlantean gods looked down in leering mockery Another of the Drilgoes had gone the same route as the others Cain was the second now Lucille the third victim and he Jim would be the fourth Gritting his teeth Jim saw the next Drilgo propelled forward into the whirling knives He saw the man fling up his arms as if to shield his head and then he was a man no longer and the horrible knives revolved and Aiah Aiah Aiah cried the multitude Once more the mechanism whirred Once more the arms revolved A howl of terror broke from Cain s lips as he was propelled onward Then suddenly the whirring stopped The arms of the stone gods with their hooked razorlike claws to which clung particles of flesh were arrested in mid air Cain unharmed was leaning backward his features set in a mask of awful fear Simultaneously Jim knew that the force which had held him in thrall was gone He flung his arms out He was free He grasped Lucille held her tightly against his breast stood there drawing great labored breaths waiting for what A film was creeping over his eyes but he was aware that the Eye had suddenly gone out And out of the dark the priest was chanting Then came a deep drawn sigh from the spectators followed by a ringing shout In place of the Eye the full moon appeared sailing overhead And holding off that deathly weakness Jim understood The sacrifice had ended a new month had begun CHAPTER VII Back to Long Island Jim seated beside Lucille was listening to Cain s gruntings and chucklings as he expounded the situation to old Parrish It was the day following the scene in the amphitheatre The four had been escorted back along the tongue of flooring into a hall with walls of fretted stone and sumptuous colorings The floor was strewn with rich rugs woven of some vegetable fibre There were divans and low chairs At brief intervals servitors always smiling passed carrying trays with wines and foods And in the corridors were always glimpses of the guards It was the rising of the full moon saved our lives Dent Parrish explained It appears they have this sacrifice at each of the moon s phases The victims captives or criminals are eaten by the priests We ve got a week s respite Dent and then God help us Jim s arm tightened about Lucille but the girl turned and smiled into his face There was no longer any fear there And Jim swore to himself that he would yet find some way of outwitting their devilish captors What the devil are we supposed to be criminals or what he asked her father Why do they smile at us all the time in that confounded way Parrish questioned the Drilgo but apparently he was unable to explain himself to him Maybe they think it an honor for us Dent he answered or maybe it s their idea of etiquette Anyway we four are to head the list when the moon s at the three quarters God if only we could reach the Atom Smasher I m certain I could find out how it works Jim had tried more than once to reach it Through the colonnades at the end of the hall he could see the mechanism standing on the platform always being inspected by half a dozen or so of the dignitaries of Atlantis But all his attempts to cross that tongue of flooring had been vetoed by the guards They had presented their hands to him palms outward and on the palms were fine steel points about two inches long set into leather gauntlets It had been impossible to try conclusions with them Two days went by Once a group of dignitaries had entered the hall and with smiles and profuse bows inspected the prisoners Then they had departed And Jim had paced the floor to and fro thinking desperately There was no sort of weapon with which to hazard an attack Jim knew that they were under the closest observation He could only wait and hope And if all else failed he meant to hurl himself with Lucille in his arms off the tongue of floor into the depths below when their time came On the third morning after a troubled sleep induced by very weariness Jim was awakened by one of the guards and started up to see one of the bowing dignitaries before him and Parrish and Lucille sitting up among their rugs Bowing repeatedly the smiling old man addressed some words to Jim and then turned to Parrish He says he wants you to show him the way the Atom Smasher works said Parrish Now s our chance Dent He thinks it s simply an apparatus for neutralizing the blue white ray Don t let him guess I won t let him guess Jim answered Tell him we ll go and show him I ve told him and he says only you are to go He s suspicious Say something quickly Dent Tell him said Jim that I must have my two assistants and the lady Tell him I may also need the help of some of his people It requires many men to operate the machine Parrish translated speaking in the Drilgo tongue which was their only means of communication The Atlantean considered Then he spoke again He says that we three men may go but Lucille must be left behind groaned Parrish The answer is no said Jim The old dignitary who seemed somewhat crestfallen departed with an expressive gesture Jim and Parrish looked at each other That s our end groaned Parrish No he ll bite answered Jim with the first grin that had appeared on his countenance since their arrival Let s make our plans quickly We must contrive to get Lucille inside the machine under the pretense of assisting with the mechanism And Cain of course he added glancing at the goggly eyed Drilgo You do your best to locate the starting mechanism Parrish and signal me the moment you re ready We ll both leap in and the four of us will sail God I don t care where we sail to so long as we get away from here Into eternity if need be But I hope it s Long Island Back came the dignitary with two of the guards Smiling at Jim he indicated by signs that the three others might accompany him The Atlanteans had bitten as Jim had forecast The four proceeded along the hall and over the tongue of flooring This time the force that had previously controlled their movements was not in action At the farther end of the bridge they saw the group of dignitaries gathered about the Atom Smasher examining it curiously Over their heads the hooked arms of the hideous gods were raised The Eye was darkened as if with a curtain and through the glass roof high overhead the sunlight streamed down upon the empty amphitheatre In spite of their smiles the dignitaries of Atlantis were very much on the alert as their tense attitudes denoted Two more guards had appeared and Jim saw that they were uncovering some apparatus at the base of the Eye They were swinging a camera like object toward him its lens focused upon the Atom Smasher It was not difficult to understand what was in the minds of the Atlanteans The dignitaries were uneasy and mistrustful and at the first suspicion of treachery they meant to loose the blue white Ray contained in the apparatus and blow the Atom Smasher and the group about it to destruction Jim intercepted a sign from Parrish indicating that he was to make pretense of assisting him He bent over the machine Lucille beside him Parrish was busily examining the wheels and levers He was adjusting the thumbscrews moving the needles along the dials One of the Atlanteans spoke and Cain translated into Drilgo for Parrish s benefit Parrish answered Then without raising his head the old man said quietly I ve located the starting lever Dent You and Lucille get inside quickly and pretend you re doing something to the machinery They stepped over the bow of the boat and stood beside Parrish who continued examining the wheels We mustn t forget Cain whispered the girl to her father Oh I hope he understands But there was no direct evidence that Cain did understand and Parrish dared not warn him in Drilgo for fear one of the Atlanteans might understand the language Cain was standing close beside the boat But he was not in the boat Again one of the Atlanteans shot a question at Parrish Parrish beckoned to Cain and awaited the translation He answered Each moment was growing tenser It was impossible that the Atlanteans could fail to understand what was being planned The only saving chance was that they did not realize the possibilities of escape that the vessel offered A full minute went by Suddenly Parrish raised his head I ve got it fixed I think Dent he said I m going to count When I reach three seize Cain and pull him aboard Jim nodded The uneasiness was increasing The guards at the camera like object were each holding some sort of mechanical accessory in their hands It looked like a small sphere of glass and it connected with the apparatus by means of a hollow tube of fibre Jim guessed that in an instant the Ray could be made to dart out of the lens It would be quick work as nearly as possible instantaneous work Ready Dent asked Parrish in an even voice In this crisis the old man had become astonishingly calm He seemed the calmest of the lot One Jim beckoned to Cain who came toward him his eyes goggling in inquiry Two Jim reached out and took Cain by the arm There was a sharp question from the Atlantean who had spoken before Three With all his force Jim yanked Cain over the edge of the boat The Drilgo stumbled and fell headlong with a howl of terror But headlong inside What happened was practically instantaneous A sudden whir of the mechanism a violet glow from the funnel the smell of chlorine a flash of blinding blue white light The Atlantean guards had fired a quarter second too late The thump thump of the electrical discharge died away The four were in the boat whirling away through space Cain was rising to his knees a woe begone expression on his face And there was a clean cut with charred black edges along one side of the boat showing how near the Atlanteans had come to success The relief after the hideous suspense of the past days was almost too much for the three white people We re free we re going back home cried Jim exultantly as he caught Lucille in his arms And she surrendered her lips to his while the tears streamed down her checks Old Parrish at the instrument board looked up smiling and chuckling Even Cain understanding that they were not to be hacked to bits with knives gurgled and grinned all over his black face How long will it take us to get back Jim asked Parrish after a while I I m not quite sure my boy the old man replied You see I haven t quite familiarized myself with the machine as yet But we ll get back all right asked Jim Well we we re headed in the right direction answered Parrish You see my boy it s rather an intricate table of logarithmic calculations that that scoundrel has pasted on this board The great danger appears to be that of coming within the orbit of the giant planet Jupiter Of course I m trying to keep within the orbit of the Earth but there is a danger of being deflected onto Pallas Ceres or one of the smaller asteroids and finding ourselves upon a rock in space Jim and Lucille looked at Parrish in consternation But you don t have to leave the Earth do you Jim asked Unfortunately it s pretty hard sticking to the Earth my lad said Parrish You see Earth has moved a good many million miles through space since the time of Atlantis But both Jim and Lucille noticed that Parrish was already speaking of Atlantis as if it was in the past They drew a hopeful augury from that And then there was nothing to do but resign themselves to that universal greyness and to hope They noticed that Cain seemed to be watching Parrish s movements with unusual interest The Neanderthal man seemed fascinated by the play of the dials the whir of the wheels and gyroscopes Are you setting a course dad asked Lucille presently I mean do you know just where we are To tell you the truth my dear answered her father I don t I m relying on some markings that Tode made on the chart certain combinations of figures God only knows where they ll take us to But I m hoping that by following them we shall find ourselves back on Long Island in the year nineteen thirty No that rascal could hardly have written down those figures to no purpose They seem to me to comprise a course both going and returning But the calculations are very intricate especially in the time dimension I ve nearly reached the last row now Then we shall have arrived or we sha n t Jim and Lucille sat down again There was nothing that they could do But somehow their hopes of reaching Long Island in the year of grace nineteen thirty had grown exceedingly slim Everything depended upon whether or not Tode had meant those figures to represent the course back to the starting point or not A desperate hope that was all that remained to them They watched Parrish as his eyes wandered along the rows of figures while his fingers moved the micrometer screws And then he looked up We re reaching the end of our course he said We re going to land somewhere God knows where it will be We must hope that s all that s left us His hands dropped from the dials He pressed a lever The blur of nights and days began to slow A column of vivid violet light shot from the funnel Grip tight shouted Parrish Thump thump The Atom Smasher was vibrating violently A jar threw Jim against Lucille It was coming to a standstill Trees appeared Jim uttered a shout He stepped across to Parrish and wrung his hand He put his arms about Lucille and kissed her They were back at the Vanishing Place and all their sufferings seemed to be of the past CHAPTER VIII A Fruitless Journey Why don t you stop the boat Parrish I m trying to lad The Atom Smasher was still vibrating even more violently than before A column of violet light was pouring from her funnel The pool the mud the walls of heaped up water were discernible but all quivering and reproduced line after line to infinity It was like looking into the rear view mirror of a car that is vibrating rapidly It was like one of those Cubist paintings of a woman descending the stairs where one had to puzzle out which is the woman and which is the stairs A dreadful thought shot through Jim s mind He remembered what he had said to Tode You can t hold the boat still in four dimensional space This was not quite the same By stopping the infernal mechanism one re entered three dimensional space and landed Certainly the Atom Smasher could land They were not like the motorcyclist who got on a machine for the first time and rode to the admiration of all who saw him except that he couldn t find out how to stop Yet there was Parrish still fumbling with the controls and the boat was still vibrating at a terrific rate of speed It is impossible to dream of leaping out for there was no solidity no continuity in the scenery outside It was not like attempting to leap from a moving train for instance In that case one knows that there is solid earth beneath however hard one lands Here everything was distorted a sort of mirror reflection And Jim noticed a strange thing that had never occurred to him before Everything was reversed as in a mirror picture That clump of trees for instance which should have been on the right was on the left Parrish looked up There s some means of stopping her of course he said There must be a lever but I don t know where to look for it in all this mess He pointed to the revolving wheels No it might be a matter of days of experimenting in order to discover the elusive switch It may be a combination of switches said Parrish I don t know what we re going to do Suppose I jumped and chanced it Jim suggested Lucille caught his arm with a little cry Parrish shook his head That devil Listen there was a Drilgo he disliked He threw him out of the boat just before she landed at the cave Everything was in plain sight plainer than things are here But he was never seen again For God s sake lad sit still I ll try Hours later Parrish was still trying And gradually Jim and Lucille had ceased to hope Side by side they had sat watching that glimmering scene about them Sometimes everything receded into a blur across which sunlight and shadow and then moonlight raced at others the surroundings were so clear that it almost seemed as if by steadying the boat they could leap ashore And once there happened something that sent a thrill of cold fear through both of them For where the pool had been there appeared suddenly a hut and Tode standing in the doorway looking about him a malicious sneer curving his lips Jim leaped to his feet and old Parrish who had seen Tode too sprang up in wild excitement Sit down lad he shouted It s nothing I I turned the micrometer screw a trifle hard I got us back to five years ago when we were living here with Tode That s just a picture out of the past Jim Jim understood but he sank down again with cold sweat bathing his forehead The terrific powers of the Atom Smasher were unveiling themselves more and more each moment Jim felt Lucille s hand on his arm He looked into her face Jim darling what s going to happen to us if dad can t find how to work the machine I don t know dear I ve thought that we might all jump out and chance it If we held each other tight we d probably land in the same place Old Parrish stood up I can t work it Jim he said Tode s got us beat There s only one thing for us to do You can guess what it is I think I can said Jim glancing askance at Lucille Yes he knew but he lacked the heart to tell her If we were all to jump out tied together don t you think we might land somewhere near where we want to land he asked Jim do you realize what each vibration of this boat means asked Parrish There s a table on the instrument board It s a wave length of four thousand miles in space and nineteen years in time You mean we re moving to London or San Francisco and back Further than that every infinite fraction of a second answered Parrish No Jim we we wouldn t land So we must just go back to where we came from and He had been speaking in a low voice calculated not to reach Lucille s ears The girl had been leaning back her eyes closed as if half asleep Now she rose and stepped up to her father and lover You can tell me the truth she said I m not afraid We ve got to go back Lucille answered her father It s our only chance By following the course in reverse we can expect to make Atlantis again Back to that horrible place No my dear The chart will lead us obviously back to the cave where Tode has his headquarters We must try to surprise him and force him to bring us back to Long Island And then asked Lucille Parrish shrugged his shoulders We ll face that problem when we come to it he answered But how do you expect to be able to land at the other end any more than this asked Jim Suppose the machine continues to vibrate instead of coming to a standstill I think said Parrish that we ll be able to strike a bargain with Tode Obviously he will be willing to bring the machine to a standstill in order to parley with us We ll make terms the best we can After all he can t afford to remain marooned on the isle of Atlantis without the Atom Smasher I hate the idea of bargaining with that wretch said Lucille So do we all dear answered Jim But there s nothing else that we can do It s just a matter of give and take And I d be glad to consent to any terms that would bring us three safe back to earth with all this business behind us I ll start back then said Parrish turning back to the instrument board And to the familiar thump thump of the electrical discharge the Atom Smasher took up its backward journey once more A long time passed With her head resting against Jim s breast Lucille rested Jim bent over her trying to discover whether she was asleep or not Her eyes were closed her breathing so soft that she hardly seemed alive An infinite pity for the girl filled Jim s heart and mingled with it the intense determination to overcome the madman who had subjected her to these perils He glanced across at Parrish fingering his screws Old Parrish looked up and nodded There was a new determination in the old man s face that made him a different person from the crazed old man whom Jim had encountered at the Vanishing Place We can beat him Parrish Jim called and Parrish looked back and nodded again We re nearly back to the top of the column he answered Not long afterward Parrish looked up once more Stand by Jim he called And be ready Tode will be aware of our approach by means of the sensitive instruments he keeps in his laboratory But don t harm him We want him aboard and we want him badly He won t be able to play any more tricks with us I ve learned too much about the Atom Smasher He pressed a lever and the greyness dissolved into its component parts of light and darkness A jar Thump thump The violet light Lucille looked up raised herself uttered a low cry and caught at Jim s arm trembling They had run their course truly The Atom Smasher was vibrating outside the entrance to Tode s cave And that was Tode standing there watching them that devilish grin of his accentuated to the utmost A blurred figure that appeared and vanished and a surrounding crowd of Drilgoes how many it was impossible to guess for they looked like a crowd of apes in motion Suddenly Tode disappeared and a moment later Lucille uttered a terrified cry as his voice spoke in her ear I thought you d be back I knew you d got away from Atlantis when my recorder showed the waves of electrical energy proceeding from the city You were clever Dent but you see you had to come back to me to get my help Don t be afraid dear said Jim trying to soothe the girl That s a wireless receiving apparatus He pointed to a sort of cabinet enclosed among the rotating wheels and then it was evident that Tode s voice was proceeding from it Tode s figure appeared again dancing through a haze of lines and patches He was holding something in his hand which Jim made out to be the mouthpiece of a microphone The voice inside the Atom Smasher spoke again Turn all the micrometer screws until the needles register zero Parrish Then turn Dial D to point three Dial C to five Dial B to one and Dial A to two I ll repeat Now press the starting lever Parrish and you ll find yourself on firm ground again A few moments later the Atom Smasher was pouring out an immense column of the violet light and slowly the vibration ceased The blurred forms of Tode of the Drilgoes grew clear They had arrived Tode stepped over the rail And now my friends we ll have a talk he said No tricks Tode Jim warned him You ve probably got a number of deviltries up your sleeve One or two Dent grinned Tode We re willing to negotiate Of course you are You see I hold the trumps Dent Those dial deflections which are inevitable in the construction of any piece of mechanism are not the same for Earth in nineteen twenty Don t think you can use the same figures to land with You must remember that there has been a precession of the equinoxes since the time of Atlantis with a consequent shift in the earth s axis No Dent I ve got you very much where I want you But I m willing to discuss terms with you First of all let s get rid of this useless cargo I don t believe in overburdening a ship he grinned He picked up Cain bodily and heaved the astonished Drilgo over the side before he knew what was happening to him Cain picked himself up and rubbed his sides whimpering mournfully The Drilgoes crowded closer their faces agape with astonishment Tode spoke a command sharply and they scattered Before we come to terms Dent I ll give you a piece of news that may interest you said Tode Much has happened during the time you ve been away Ambassadors have been out to see me from Atlantis With the aid of a Drilgo interpreter they conveyed to me that they had been greatly impressed by the disappearance of the Atom Smasher They have nothing like it of course and they think I m a Number One magician The upshot is they want me to accept the supreme rule of the city and use my arts to restore the lost territory that has sunk beneath the waves They swore on an image of their god Cruk that they were sincere I told them that I d sent the Atom Smasher away on a journey but that it would be back shortly and that I d then give them their answer Now Dent Tode s face took on that look of fanaticism that Jim had seen on it before I m going to repeat the proposition I made to you before Join me I ll make you my chief subordinate and I ll load you and Parrish down with honors Everything that a human being can desire shall be yours And in a year or two when we re tired of being gods we ll take the Atom Smasher back to Earth and destroy it and with our wealth we ll become the supreme rulers of Earth too I need you Dent You don t realize how lonely life can be when one is worshiped as a god As for Lucille there are a thousand maidens more beautiful than she is in Atlantis Come Dent your answer Your last chance Dent Don t throw it away He read the answer before Jim could speak it Jim saw Tode s face flicker and hurled himself upon him Lucille screamed The two men wrestled together in the narrow confines of the circular boat Jim struck Tode a blow that sent him reeling against the rail Then he felt himself seized from behind A giant Drilgo had him in his arms He lifted him over the side and flung him to the earth In an instant the chattering Drilgoes were crowding down upon him Struggling madly Jim saw Tode fell old Parrish with a blow push back Lucille as she sprang at him and quickly press the starting lever The column of violet fire faded there came the whir of the mechanism the Atom Smasher vanished CHAPTER IX The Blinded Eye Jim fought with all his strength he managed to shake off his assailants and regain his feet Then one of the Drilgoes poised his stone tipped spear ready to hurl it through his body But the spear never left the Drilgo s hand in Jim s direction Like a great black ape Cain leaped upon the fellow and bore him to the ground his feet twined around his shoulders his hands gripping his throat Not until the Drilgo had been reduced to a heaving half strangled hulk did Cain leave him Then Cain bending until his stomach almost touched the ground came worming toward Jim making signs of obeisance What had happened that Jim had won the Drilgo s faith Why did Cain now look upon him apparently as his master It was impossible to gauge the processes of the black man s mind and at the moment Jim was in no mood to wonder The stunning disaster that had overtaken him monopolized his thoughts Lucille and Parrish were once more in Tode s power That was the dominating fact The only gleam of comfort in the situation was that Tode had given him the clue to his movements Beyond a doubt Tode had taken his captives into Atlantis with him It was impossible to disbelieve Tode s statement that he had been offered the supreme power in the city Tode s egotism would have compelled him to blurt out that fact Besides Tode had certainly not gone back to earth Jim must force his way into Atlantis He would find and rescue the two prisoners or die there He turned away from the groveling Cain and the chattering Drilgoes who inspired by Cain s example now seemed animated by the same instinct to obey him and went into the cave But at the entrance he turned for a moment and looked back It was night The valley was swathed in mists the volcano opposite was spouting a shaft of lurid fire On the water was a path of moonlight where the clouds had been dispersed by the Atlanteans Jim took in the scene he raised one arm and shook his fist Then without a word he passed inside There was a soft light in the cave streaming out from an inner chamber access to which was through a narrow orifice in the rock Jim passed through and found himself in Tode s laboratory He was astonished at its completeness still more so at the existence of numerous pieces of apparatus whose purpose it was difficult to understand There was a radio transmitter and receiver but improved out of all recognition from those in use in the prosaic year nineteen thirty Three or four tiny dynamos little more than toys in appearance were generating as much voltage from the indicators as a modern power station And overhead was a dial with two series of figures in black and red and two needles both of which were swinging briskly indicating that there was an intense electrical disturbance in the vicinity The Atom Smasher Jim took heart Tode could not be far away He looked about him subconsciously trying to discover some implement that would prove of service to him but there was nothing that he could see not even one of the ray tubes He looked about uneasily Then his eyes fell upon something so singularly out of place that it looked for the moment like some pre historic weapon It was the last thing Jim would have expected to find there nothing more nor less than a sporting rifle Deer shooting had been one of Tode s pastimes in the old days and more than one fat buck had been surreptitiously shot for the benefit of the larder at the Vanishing Place There was something almost pathetic in the sight of that rifle and the fifty cartridges in their cardboard carton Perhaps Tode had pictured himself shooting big game in Atlantis at some period or other It was a human weakness that for an instant lessened Jim s hate and horror of the man It brought him to a saner view of the situation Jim had been on the point of losing his powers of reason The sight of the rifle restored them He turned sharply as he heard a sound in the entrance Cain was coming toward him with many genuflexions and much stomach wriggling He stopped straightened himself There was a look of singular intelligence on the Drilgo s face He began chattering pointing in the direction of Atlantis Jim could make nothing of what he was trying to convey Yes they re there he said bitterly but I don t see how that s going to help me Oh my poor Lucille said Cain unexpectedly The words were like a parrot s speech the intonation so remarkable a copy of old Parrish s that Jim was flabbergasted Nevertheless it was evident that Cain knew he was referring to Lucille With a strange slinking motion he crossed the laboratory and bent beneath a huge slab of stone resting on two great hewn rocks He emerged holding in his arms two curious contrivances He laid them at Jim s feet Jim stared at them and suddenly understood what they were They were two pairs of wings of the kind the Atlanteans had used when they made their aerial sortie against the Drilgoes Cain picked up one pair and began adjusting it about his body He made fluttering movements with his arms You mean that you ve learned how to fly you black imp of Satan shouted Jim And Cain as if understanding nodded and beamed all over his black face With that Jim s idea was born If the Drilgoes would follow him he would lead them against Atlantis And before the assault began he would fly to the great Eye that guarded it and blind it He thought afterward that it was like a supernatural revelation this scheme that leaped full fledged into his brain And Cain had developed extraordinary executive ability Outside the cave through rifts in the swirls of fog Jim could see innumerable Drilgoes massing in the valley as if they understood Jim s purpose From Cain s gesticulations and the number of times he rubbed his stomach it was evident that he counted upon sacking Atlantis and was imagining innumerable meals of fat captives Each flash of lurid light from the volcano disclosed further masses of Drilgoes armed with their stone spears apparently assembling for the attack Whether Tode had summoned them before the Atlanteans offered him the rulership of the city or whether Jim s own plan had been communicated to them by some telepathic process it was impossible to guess but there was not the least doubt but that they were prepared to follow him Cain nudged Jim and began strapping the other pair of wings about his body Jim saw that the energy was supplied by two tiny lights burning in the base cold fire stored energy whose strength he did not guess For when Cain took him by the hand and motioned to him to slide the knob in the groove he was hurled skyward like a rocket There followed a delirious hour Tossing and tumbling like a pigeon in a gale Jim by degrees acquired mastery over the apparatus At the end of the hour he could fly almost as well as Cain who like a black guardian angel kept beside him reaching out a hand when he overbalanced and pulling him out of aerial side slips Suddenly Cain motioned toward the volcano and started toward it in a rocketlike swoop Jim understood The Drilgoes were ready for the attack upon Atlantis Jim dropped to earth ran back into the cave and picked up the rifle and the carton of ammunition He filled the magazine and with the rifle on his arm rose into the air again Cain was circling back uttering weird cries of distress at finding his master absent It s all right Cain said Jim I m here Side by side they flew steadily toward the base of the great cone which was pouring out a fan shaped stream of fire Rumblings shook the earth it was evident that another upheaval was in course of preparation The long column of the Drilgoes could be seen extending around the flank of the mountain Then of a sudden the Eye opened And across the causeway came the blue white Ray carrying death and destruction The Drilgoes who had learned wisdom remained concealed out of the Ray s path and escaped but a great dinosaur fifty or sixty feet in length startled by the light came blundering out of the ferns uttered a bellow and melted into an amorphous mass Birds dropped from their roosting places with a sound like that of falling hail Black paths were cloven through the midst of the jungle Rifle in hand Jim soared into the air and shot forward high above the causeway toward the glowing Eye He had noticed that the blue white ray appeared in cycles of about two minutes and had made his plans accordingly Two minutes in which to accomplish his task or take the chance of a hideous death Some thirty seconds carried him right into the glowing heart of the winking Eye he hovered and raised his rifle Underneath him the breakers thundered round the Eye a myriad sea birds fluttered dashing themselves against it falling into the waves Huge and high the great city towered into the skies lit by its soft incandescence Jim could see the throngs in the streets the traffic But what was happening in the other side of the Eye Suddenly he saw the moon in her third quarter sailing through the skies and a hideous fear overcame him Suppose Tode had met with treachery suppose that this very night Lucille were doomed to be sacrificed to the terrible god Cruk Suppose that even at that moment her tender flesh were being sacrificed by the awful hooks He drew a bead upon the Eye and fired and missed The bullet went wide But even if it struck what guarantee had he that it would shatter the glass or whatever substance it was that covered the orb He lost position and knew that the two minute interval was drawing to a close He soared and fired again The Eye still glowed Then of a sudden a blinding ray shot forth from it so dazzling that it seemed to sear Jim s eyeballs The interval was ended It shot beneath him but no more than a few feet and turning his eyes shoreward Jim saw it sweep along the causeway and tear a black path through the forest Frantically he soared and circled around the temple The ray went out Two minutes more And now the temporary panic had passed Jim s nerves grew steady as a rock He eased the controls and floated in toward the glowing orb Sea mews screaming dashed themselves against it and fell wounded and broken into the breaking seas below They fluttered past Jim s face one impacted against his chest with a thud that rocked him where he hovered But Jim knew that he could not fail At a distance of fifty feet he drew a bead upon the centre of the Eye and pressed the trigger And instantly the light went out CHAPTER X The Fight in the Dark

none	none	Within the city he heard a sound such as he had never heard before as if some ancient prophecy of doom had been fulfilled a wailing Aiah Aiah Aiah that was caught up from throat to throat and rose upon the wind in a clamor wild and mournful as that of the sea birds around the broken Eye 
8684_293663_000004_000004	train-clean-360	It was the death keening of proud Atlantis Queen of the Atlantic for fifty thousand years 
8684_293663_000004_000005	train-clean-360	She was dying in darkness 
8684_293663_000005_000000	train-clean-360	For with the blinding of the Eye all the soft lights within the city had gone out 
8684_293663_000005_000001	train-clean-360	Dense utter impenetrable darkness reigned and even the gibbous moon floating overhead seemed to give no light 
8684_293663_000006_000000	train-clean-360	Jim dropped to the causeway and began running in the direction of the city 
8684_293663_000006_000001	train-clean-360	But feeling the drag of his wings he unbuckled the strap and flung them away 
8684_293663_000006_000002	train-clean-360	He might need them but his one thought was to get to Lucille if she were still alive 
8684_293663_000006_000003	train-clean-360	And he felt that each moment lost might mean that he would be too late 
8684_293663_000007_000000	train-clean-360	Through the blackness he raced forward hearing that sobbing ululation within the walls 
8684_293663_000007_000001	train-clean-360	But behind him he heard another sound and shuddered at it all his hopes suddenly reversed 
8684_293663_000007_000002	train-clean-360	For that sound was the shouting of the Drilgoes as they rushed forward to conquest 
8684_293663_000007_000003	train-clean-360	And now it seemed a monstrous thing that proud Atlantis should be at the mercy of these hordes 
8684_293663_000007_000004	train-clean-360	He had let loose destruction upon the world 
8684_293663_000007_000005	train-clean-360	But it was to save Lucille 
8684_293663_000008_000000	train-clean-360	That was his consolation 
none	none	Yet he hardly checked the racing thoughts within his mind even for a moment to meditate on what he had done Those thoughts were all of Lucille 
8684_293663_000008_000002	train-clean-360	He must get to her before the Drilgoes entered 
8684_293663_000008_000003	train-clean-360	And he ran faster panting gasping till of a sudden the portals loomed before him and he saw a crowd of frenzied Atlanteans struggling to pass through and a file of soldiers struggling to keep them back 
8684_293663_000009_000000	train-clean-360	He could distinguish nothing more than the confused struggle 
8684_293663_000009_000001	train-clean-360	He hurled himself into the midst of the crowd and swept it back 
8684_293663_000009_000002	train-clean-360	He was within the walls now and struggling to pass through the mob of people that was swarming like homeless bees 
8684_293663_000010_000000	train-clean-360	He fought them with flailing fists he clove a pathway through them until he found himself in a great shadowy space that he recognized as the central assembly of the city 
8684_293663_000010_000001	train-clean-360	More by instinct than design he hit upon the narrow court that was the elevator 
8684_293663_000010_000002	train-clean-360	But the court was filled with another mob of struggling people and in the darkness there was no possibility of discovering the secret of raising it 
8684_293663_000011_000000	train-clean-360	He blundered about raging forcing a path now here now there 
8684_293663_000011_000001	train-clean-360	He ran into blind alleys into small threading streets about the court which led him back into the central place of assembly 
8684_293663_000011_000002	train-clean-360	It was like a nightmare that blind search under the pale three quarter moon and the black star blotched sky 
8684_293663_000012_000000	train-clean-360	Suddenly Jim found himself wedged by the pressure of the crowd into a sort of recess leading off the elevator court 
8684_293663_000012_000001	train-clean-360	So strong was the pressure here that he was unable to move an inch 
8684_293663_000012_000002	train-clean-360	Wedged bolt upright he could only wait and let the frenzied mob stream past him 
8684_293663_000012_000003	train-clean-360	And louder above the sound of wailing came the roars of the Drilgoes swarming along the causeway 
8684_293663_000013_000000	train-clean-360	Suddenly something gave behind him a door as it seemed broken off its hinges by the mob pressure 
8684_293663_000013_000001	train-clean-360	Jim was hurled backward and fell heavily down a flight of stone stairs bringing up against a stone balustrade 
8684_293663_000013_000002	train-clean-360	He got up unconscious of his bruises ran to the top of the flight and saw the dim square of palest twilight where the door had been 
none	none	But over him he could faintly see the stairs and the balustrade winding away to what seemed immeasurable height 
8684_293663_000014_000001	train-clean-360	That stairway must lead to the top of the building and thence there should be some access to the amphitheatre 
8684_293663_000014_000002	train-clean-360	Jim turned toward it 
8684_293663_000015_000000	train-clean-360	Suddenly a tremendous uproar filled the streets yells the clicking grunts of the Drilgoes the screams of the panic stricken populace The invaders had arrived and they were sweeping all before them 
8684_293663_000015_000001	train-clean-360	No chance of recognition in that darkness 
none	none	Lucille Shouting her name Jim began to ascend the stairs in leaps of three at a time 
8684_293663_000016_000000	train-clean-360	But long before he reached the top he was ascending one by one with straining limbs and laboring breath 
8684_293663_000016_000001	train-clean-360	Red slaughter down below a very inferno of sound above that shadowy stairway still extending almost to the heavens 
8684_293663_000016_000002	train-clean-360	Step after step flight beyond flight 
8684_293663_000017_000000	train-clean-360	Jim s lungs were bursting and his heart hammering as if it would break his chest 
8684_293663_000017_000001	train-clean-360	One flight more 
none	none	One more Another 
8684_293663_000017_000004	train-clean-360	Suddenly he realized that his task was ended 
8684_293663_000017_000005	train-clean-360	In place of the stairs stood a vast hall and beyond that another hall dim in the faint light that filtered through the glass above 
8684_293663_000018_000000	train-clean-360	Jim thought he remembered where he was 
8684_293663_000018_000001	train-clean-360	Beyond that next hall there should be the tongue of flooring crossing the amphitheatre and joining the platform of the idols 
8684_293663_000018_000002	train-clean-360	But he stopped suddenly as he emerged not upon the tongue but upon still another stairway 
8684_293663_000019_000000	train-clean-360	He had gone astray and out of his bursting lungs a cry of rage and despair went up 
8684_293663_000019_000001	train-clean-360	For a moment he stood still 
8684_293663_000019_000002	train-clean-360	What use to proceed further 
8684_293663_000020_000000	train-clean-360	And then amazingly there came what might have been a sign from heaven 
8684_293663_000020_000001	train-clean-360	Down through a small square opening overhead no larger than a ventilator it came a glimmer of violet flame 
8684_293663_000021_000000	train-clean-360	And Jim hurled himself like a madman against the stairs and surmounted them with two bounds 
8684_293663_000021_000001	train-clean-360	There were no more 
8684_293663_000021_000002	train-clean-360	Instead Jim found himself looking down into the amphitheatre 
8684_293663_000022_000000	train-clean-360	The thick walls had cut off all sound from his ears save a confused murmur but now a hideous uproar assailed them 
8684_293663_000022_000001	train-clean-360	The whole floor of the amphitheatre was a mass of moving shadows of slayers and slain 
8684_293663_000023_000000	train-clean-360	The Drilgoes had broken in and trapped the multitudes that had taken refuge there 
8684_293663_000023_000001	train-clean-360	Their fearful stone tipped spears thrust in and out to the accompaniment of their savage howls and the screams of the dying 
8684_293663_000024_000000	train-clean-360	Never has such a shadow play been seen perhaps as that below where death stalked in dense darkness and the slayer did not even see his victim 
8684_293663_000024_000001	train-clean-360	Only the thrust of spears the soft yielding flesh that they encountered the scream the wrench of stone from tissue and the blended howl of triumph and scream of despair 
8684_293663_000025_000000	train-clean-360	Yet only for a moment did Jim turn his eyes upon that sight 
8684_293663_000025_000001	train-clean-360	For he knew where he was now 
8684_293663_000025_000002	train-clean-360	He had emerged upon the other side of the amphitheatre upon the platform where he had seen the priests and dignitaries gathered when he was led forward to be sacrificed 
8684_293663_000026_000000	train-clean-360	There in the rear were the hideous shadowy gods looming up out of the darkness their outstretched arms interlaced 
8684_293663_000026_000001	train-clean-360	And there upon the platform was the Atom Smasher a little thread of violet light seeping out of the central tube 
8684_293663_000027_000000	train-clean-360	Beside it stood a group of figures impossible to distinguish in the darkness but of a sudden Lucille s scream rang out above the din below 
8684_293663_000028_000000	train-clean-360	With three leaps Jim was at her side 
none	none	He saw the girl Tode and Parrish struggling in the grasp of a dozen priests 
8684_293663_000028_000002	train-clean-360	They were dragging them toward the idols and Jim understood what that scene portended 
none	none	In despair at the irruption of the Drilgoes the priests were seeking to propitiate their gods by sacrificing the three strangers whom they held responsible for all their woes Jim caught Lucille in his arms shouting her name 
8684_293663_000030_000001	train-clean-360	She knew him turned toward him 
8684_293663_000030_000002	train-clean-360	Then one of the priests armed with a great stone headed club for no metal is permitted within the precincts of the god Cruk struck at him furiously 
8684_293663_000031_000000	train-clean-360	Jim leaped aside letting the club descend harmlessly upon the floor He shot out his right with all his strength behind it catching the priest upon the jaw and the man crumpled 
8684_293663_000032_000000	train-clean-360	Whirling the club around his head he fought back the fanatics all the while shouting to Tode to start the Atom Smasher 
8684_293663_000032_000001	train-clean-360	In such a moment he only remembered that Tode was a white man and of his own generation 
8684_293663_000033_000000	train-clean-360	He struck down three of the priests then he was seized around the knees from behind and fell heavily 
none	none	The club was wrenched from his hand In another moment Jim found himself helpless in the grasp of the Atlanteans 
8684_293663_000034_000000	train-clean-360	As he stopped struggling for a moment to gather his strength for a supreme effort he heard a whir overhead and saw the arms of the stone gods begin their horrible revolution 
8684_293663_000034_000001	train-clean-360	The priests had started the machinery 
none	none	And high above the din below rang out the wild chant of the high priest 
8684_293663_000035_000000	train-clean-360	Jim saw him now a figure poised upon a platform behind the arms his own arms raised heavenward 
none	none	Aiah Aiah Aiah 
8684_293663_000037_000000	train-clean-360	Jim was being dragged forward with Lucille beside him old Parrish following still making a futile struggle for life while pitiful screeches issued from his mouth 
8684_293663_000038_000000	train-clean-360	Jim saw the revolving arms descend within a foot of his head 
8684_293663_000038_000001	train-clean-360	One more fight one more the last 
8684_293663_000039_000000	train-clean-360	Suddenly with loud yells a band of Drilgoes leaped forward from the head of the stairs and rushed upon the struggling priests and victims And dark as it was Jim recognized their leader Cain 
8684_293663_000040_000000	train-clean-360	And Cain knew Lucille 
8684_293663_000040_000001	train-clean-360	As the priests rallied for a desperate resistance Cain hurled his great body through the air landing squarely upon the shoulders of the priest nearest the revolving arms and knocking him flat 
8684_293663_000041_000000	train-clean-360	Then the arms caught priest and Drilgo and the steel hooks dug deep into their flesh 
8684_293663_000041_000001	train-clean-360	A screech of terror a howl that reverberated through the amphitheatre and nothing remained of either but a heap of macerated flesh 
8684_293663_000042_000000	train-clean-360	But in that instant Jim had fought free again 
8684_293663_000042_000001	train-clean-360	He caught Lucille and dragged her back toward the Atom Smasher 
8684_293663_000043_000000	train-clean-360	Tode had already broken from his captors and was working at it frantically 
8684_293663_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 Hold on screeched old Parrish 
none	none	Hold on 
8684_293663_000045_000000	train-clean-360	They had a moment s leeway 
8684_293663_000045_000001	train-clean-360	The Drilgoes had driven the priests back into the hooks 
8684_293663_000045_000002	train-clean-360	With awful shrieks the fanatics were yielding up their lives in the place of their selected victims 
8684_293663_000046_000000	train-clean-360	But more Drilgoes were pouring up the stairs 
8684_293663_000046_000001	train-clean-360	A moment s leeway and no more before the savage band would impale the four upon their stone pointed spears 
8684_293663_000046_000002	train-clean-360	There was not the slightest chance that they would be able to make their identity known 
8684_293663_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 For God s sake hurry Jim yelled in Tode s ear 
8684_293663_000048_000000	train-clean-360	The wheels were revolving a stream of violet light leaping out of the central tunnel cast a lurid illumination upon the scene 
8684_293663_000049_000000	train-clean-360	But it was too late 
8684_293663_000049_000001	train-clean-360	A score of Drilgoes with leveled spears were rushing on the four 
8684_293663_000050_000000	train-clean-360	 Hold tight screeched Parrish 
8684_293663_000050_000001	train-clean-360	He thrust his arm into his breast and pulled out a little lever 
8684_293663_000050_000002	train-clean-360	Jim recognized it and remembered 
8684_293663_000050_000003	train-clean-360	It was the instrument of universal death the uranium release of untold forces of cataclysmic depredation 
none	none	Take that screamed the old man inserting the lever into the secret groove in the Atom Smasher and jerking it in the direction of the priests CHAPTER XI Tode s Last Gamble 
8684_293663_000054_000000	train-clean-360	A roar that seemed to rend the heavens followed 
8684_293663_000054_000001	train-clean-360	Roar upon roar as the infinite momentum of the disintegrating uranium struck obstacle after obstacle 
8684_293663_000054_000002	train-clean-360	The Drilgoes vanished the amphitheatre melted away walls and roof 
8684_293663_000054_000003	train-clean-360	Overhead were the moon and stars 
8684_293663_000055_000000	train-clean-360	And proud Atlantis was sinking into the depths of the sea 
8684_293663_000055_000001	train-clean-360	Not as a ship sinks but piecemeal her walls and towers crumbling and toppling as a child s sand castle crumbles under the attack of the lapping waves 
8684_293663_000055_000002	train-clean-360	Down they crashed carrying their freight of black clinging human ants while from the sea s depths a wave a mile high rose and battered the fragments to destruction 
8684_293663_000055_000003	train-clean-360	From the crater of the volcano a huge wave of fire fanned forward and where fire and water met a cloud of steam rose up 
8684_293663_000056_000000	train-clean-360	A boiling chaos in which water and earth and fire were blended spread over land and sea 
8684_293663_000056_000001	train-clean-360	And then suddenly it was ended 
8684_293663_000056_000002	train-clean-360	Where the last island of the Atlantean continent had been only the ocean was to be seen placid beneath the stars 
8684_293663_000057_000000	train-clean-360	The Atom Smasher was vibrating at tremendous speed 
8684_293663_000057_000001	train-clean-360	Jim with one arm round Lucille faced Tode at the instrument board 
8684_293663_000057_000002	train-clean-360	Near by sat Parrish watching him too 
8684_293663_000058_000000	train-clean-360	 That took a whole year said Tode 
8684_293663_000058_000001	train-clean-360	 That pretty little scene of destruction we ve just witnessed 
8684_293663_000058_000002	train-clean-360	The good old Atom Smasher has been doing some lively stunts or we d have been engulfed too 
8684_293663_000058_000003	train-clean-360	We re not likely to see anything so pretty in history again unless we go to watch the destruction of Herculaneum and Pompeii by lava from Vesuvius 
8684_293663_000058_000004	train-clean-360	But that would be quite tame in comparison with this 
8684_293663_000059_000000	train-clean-360	Tode s jeering tone grated on Jim s ears immeasurably 
8684_293663_000060_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t think any of us are craving any more experiments Tode he said trying to keep his voice steady 
8684_293663_000060_000001	train-clean-360	 Suppose you take us back to Peconic Bay 
8684_293663_000060_000002	train-clean-360	We ll dump the Atom Smasher into the pond and try to forget that we ve had anything except a bad nightmare 
8684_293663_000061_000000	train-clean-360	 Don t trust him Jim whispered Lucille 
8684_293663_000062_000000	train-clean-360	Tode heard 
8684_293663_000062_000001	train-clean-360	 Thank you he answered scowling 
8684_293663_000062_000002	train-clean-360	 But seriously Dent we can t go back with nothing to show for all our trouble 
8684_293663_000062_000003	train-clean-360	Those fools tried to betray me and then the Eye went out 
8684_293663_000062_000004	train-clean-360	Perhaps I have you to thank for that performance 
8684_293663_000062_000005	train-clean-360	However the sensible thing is to let bygones be bygones 
8684_293663_000062_000006	train-clean-360	But we must make a little excursion 
8684_293663_000062_000007	train-clean-360	How about picking up a little treasure from the hoards of Solomon or Genghis Khan 
8684_293663_000062_000008	train-clean-360	A few pounds of precious stones would make a world of difference in our social status when we reach Long Island 
8684_293663_000063_000000	train-clean-360	Jim felt a cold fury permeating him 
8684_293663_000063_000001	train-clean-360	Tode saw his grim look and laughed malignantly 
8684_293663_000064_000000	train-clean-360	 Well Dent I m ready to be frank with you he said 
8684_293663_000064_000001	train-clean-360	 The game s still in my hands 
8684_293663_000064_000002	train-clean-360	I want Lucille 
8684_293663_000064_000003	train-clean-360	I m willing to take you and Parrish back provided you agree she shall be mine 
8684_293663_000064_000004	train-clean-360	I ll have to trust you but I shall have means of evening up if you play crooked 
8684_293663_000065_000000	train-clean-360	 Why don t you ask my girl herself piped old Parrish 
8684_293663_000066_000000	train-clean-360	 He needn t trouble 
8684_293663_000066_000001	train-clean-360	He knows the answer cried Lucille scornfully 
8684_293663_000067_000000	train-clean-360	 There s your answer said Jim 
8684_293663_000067_000001	train-clean-360	 Now what s the alternative 
8684_293663_000068_000000	train-clean-360	 The alternative is that I have already set the dial to eternity Dent grinned Tode 
8684_293663_000068_000001	train-clean-360	 Eternity in the fifth dimension 
8684_293663_000068_000002	train-clean-360	Didn t know I d worked that out did you 
8684_293663_000068_000003	train-clean-360	A pleasant little surprise 
8684_293663_000068_000004	train-clean-360	No don t try to move 
8684_293663_000068_000005	train-clean-360	My hand is on the lever 
8684_293663_000068_000006	train-clean-360	I have only to press it and we re there 
8684_293663_000069_000000	train-clean-360	Jim stood stock still in horror 
8684_293663_000069_000001	train-clean-360	Tode s voice rang true 
8684_293663_000069_000002	train-clean-360	He believed Tode had the power he claimed 
8684_293663_000070_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes the fifth dimension and eternity said Tode where time and space reel into functionlessness 
8684_293663_000070_000001	train-clean-360	Don t ask me what it s like there I ve never been there 
8684_293663_000070_000002	train-clean-360	But my impression of it is that it s a fairly good representation of the place popularly known as hell 
8684_293663_000071_000000	train-clean-360	 You fool Dent Tode s voice rang out with vicious snarling emphasis I gave you your chance to come in with me 
8684_293663_000071_000001	train-clean-360	Together we d have made ourselves masters of Atlantis and brought back her plunder to our Twentieth Century world 
8684_293663_000071_000002	train-clean-360	You refused because of a girl a girl Dent who loved me long before you came upon the scene 
8684_293663_000072_000000	train-clean-360	 That s a lie Lucius answered Lucille steadily 
8684_293663_000072_000001	train-clean-360	 And you can do your worst 
8684_293663_000072_000002	train-clean-360	There s one factor you haven t reckoned in your calculations and that s called God 
8684_293663_000073_000000	train-clean-360	 The dark blur on the spectral lines old Parrish muttered 
none	none	Tode laughed uproariously
8684_293663_000074_000001	train-clean-360	 Come make your choice Dent he mocked It s merely to press this lever 
8684_293663_000074_000002	train-clean-360	You ll find yourself well we won t go into that 
8684_293663_000074_000003	train-clean-360	I don t know where you ll find yourself 
8684_293663_000074_000004	train-clean-360	You ll disappear 
none	none	So shall I But I m desperate 
8684_293663_000074_000006	train-clean-360	I must have Lucille Choose His voice rang out in maniac tones 
8684_293663_000074_000007	train-clean-360	 Choose all of you 
8684_293663_000075_000000	train-clean-360	 Lucille has answered you Jim retorted 
8684_293663_000076_000000	train-clean-360	 And how about you old man called Tode to Parrish 
8684_293663_000077_000000	train-clean-360	Parrish leased forward making a swift movement with his hand 
8684_293663_000077_000001	train-clean-360	 Go to your own hell you dev 
8684_293663_000078_000000	train-clean-360	A blinding light a frantic oscillation of the Atom Smasher a sense of death awful and indescribable and stark unconsciousness rushed over Jim 
8684_293663_000078_000001	train-clean-360	His last thought was that Lucille s arms were about him and that he was holding her 
8684_293663_000078_000002	train-clean-360	Nothing mattered therefore even though they two were plunged into that awful nothingness of the fifth dimension where neither space nor time recognizably exists 
none	none	Love could exist there CHAPTER XII Solid Earth
8684_293663_000081_000000	train-clean-360	 He s coming around Lucille 
8684_293663_000081_000001	train-clean-360	Thank God for it 
none	none	Jim opened his eyes 
8684_293663_000082_000001	train-clean-360	For a few moments he looked about him without understanding 
8684_293663_000082_000002	train-clean-360	Then the outlines of a room etched themselves against the clouded background 
8684_293663_000082_000003	train-clean-360	And in the foreground Lucille s face 
8684_293663_000082_000004	train-clean-360	The girl was bending over Jim one hand soothing his forehead 
8684_293663_000083_000000	train-clean-360	 Where am I Jim muttered 
8684_293663_000084_000000	train-clean-360	 Back on earth Jim the good old earth never again to leave it answered Lucille with a catch in her voice 
8684_293663_000084_000001	train-clean-360	With an effort she composed herself 
8684_293663_000084_000002	train-clean-360	 You mustn t talk she said 
8684_293663_000085_000000	train-clean-360	 But what place is this 
none	none	It s Andy Lumm s house Now rest and I ll explain everything later 
8684_293663_000087_000000	train-clean-360	But the first explanation came from Andy Lumm 
8684_293663_000087_000001	train-clean-360	 Well mister Dent my wife and me sure were glad to be on the spot when you and Miss Parrish got bogged on the edge of the Black Pool he said 
8684_293663_000087_000002	train-clean-360	 Mean treacherous place it is 
8684_293663_000087_000003	train-clean-360	Thar was a cow got mired thar last month up to her belly 
8684_293663_000087_000004	train-clean-360	If us hadn t found her and dragged her out with ropes she d have gone clear under 
8684_293663_000087_000005	train-clean-360	Granpop Dawes says thar s underground springs around the edge and that it runs straight down to hell though that seems sorter far fetched to me 
none	none	Yessir and if I hadn t heard WNYC giving Miss Parrish on the list of missing persons and as having been seen near here I reckon I d never have found you 
8684_293663_000088_000001	train-clean-360	Made me and my wife uneasy that did 
8684_293663_000088_000002	train-clean-360	 Andy she says 
8684_293663_000088_000003	train-clean-360	 I got an inkling you oughter go to the Vanishing Place and see if she ain t there And there I found you two mired to the waist and mister Parrish dancing around and fretting and his clothes burned to cinders 
none	none	It sure seems strange to me to think mister Parrish got away safe after that explosion five years ago and of his wandering around with loss of memory till you found him and brung him back here to restore it but thar s strange things in the world yes sir thar surely is In the happiness of being back on Earth once more Jim was content to let further explanations go 
8684_293663_000090_000001	train-clean-360	The return of Parrish had been duly chronicled in the newspapers and had provoked a mild interest but fortunately the public mind was so occupied at the moment with the trial of a night club hostess that after the first rush of newspaper men the three were left alone 
8684_293663_000091_000000	train-clean-360	Day after day in the brilliant autumn weather Jim and Lucille would roam the tinted woods recharging themselves with the feel of Earth until the memory of those dread experiences grew dim 
8684_293663_000092_000000	train-clean-360	 Well Jim I reckon I d better tell you and get it over said old Parrish one morning Parrish quite his old jaunty self again 
8684_293663_000092_000001	train-clean-360	 Tode had got the dials pointing to the fifth dimension eternity he called it though actually I believe it s nothing more than annihilation a grand smash 
8684_293663_000092_000002	train-clean-360	Well he pressed that lever 
8684_293663_000092_000003	train-clean-360	But something had gone wrong 
8684_293663_000093_000000	train-clean-360	 You remember how poor Cain seemed to take great interest in the Atom Smasher 
8684_293663_000093_000001	train-clean-360	There s no way of telling what had been going on in that brain of his but it looks to me like he d known that that lever meant death 
8684_293663_000093_000002	train-clean-360	It was sealed up in wax and Tode had got it free on the way out of Atlantis 
none	none	Well this it what I made out from examining the thing afterward Cain had been monkeying with the lever 
8684_293663_000094_000001	train-clean-360	He d pried loose one of the wires that hooked to the transformer and short circuited it not knowing of course just what he was doing 
8684_293663_000094_000002	train-clean-360	The result was that when Tode pressed that lever instead of blowing the whole contraption to pieces he got a couple of billion volts of electricity through his body combined with a larger amperage than has ever been imagined 
8684_293663_000094_000003	train-clean-360	It burned him to a few grease spots 
8684_293663_000094_000004	train-clean-360	He simply vanished 
8684_293663_000094_000005	train-clean-360	You don t remember what you did at the moment boy 
8684_293663_000095_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t seem to remember anything said Jim 
8684_293663_000096_000000	train-clean-360	 Well your response was an automatic one 
8684_293663_000096_000001	train-clean-360	You jumped him 
8684_293663_000096_000002	train-clean-360	Luckily you were too late for Tode vanished like that Old Parrish snapped his fingers 
8684_293663_000096_000003	train-clean-360	 But you must have got into the field of magnetic force any way you were almost electrocuted 
8684_293663_000096_000004	train-clean-360	Lucille and I thought you were dead for hours 
8684_293663_000097_000000	train-clean-360	 We laid you down and set a course for home 
8684_293663_000097_000001	train-clean-360	I used those dial numberings Tode had given me 
8684_293663_000097_000002	train-clean-360	He d said they wouldn t work but he d lied 
8684_293663_000097_000003	train-clean-360	They did work 
8684_293663_000097_000004	train-clean-360	They brought us back to the Vanishing Place 
8684_293663_000098_000000	train-clean-360	 We carried you out and then I saw your eyelid twitch 
8684_293663_000098_000001	train-clean-360	We worked over you with artificial respiration till it looked as if there was a chance for you 
8684_293663_000098_000002	train-clean-360	Then I shut off the power and let the waters rush in over the Atom Smasher and swam ashore 
none	none	And there it lies at the bottom of the pool and may it lie there till the Judgment Day Tode was a genius said Jim but he never understood that character counts for more than genius
8684_293663_000100_000000	train-clean-360	 Let s think no more about him said Lucille 
8684_293663_000100_000001	train-clean-360	She had come up to them and the two looked at each other and smiled 
8684_293663_000100_000002	train-clean-360	Love is self centred other things it forgets very quickly 
8684_293663_000101_000000	train-clean-360	 To morrow we go back to New York said Jim 
none	none	You think you re able to face the world and take up life again
8684_293663_000102_000000	train-clean-360	 I think so Jim said Lucille 
none	none	You re not remembering him after all No Jim 
8684_293663_000104_000001	train-clean-360	I was thinking of poor Cain 
8684_293663_000104_000002	train-clean-360	He died for me 
8684_293663_000105_000000	train-clean-360	 But that was twelve thousand years ago my dear and to day s to day said Jim 
8684_293663_000105_000001	train-clean-360	 And to morrow a new life begins for you and me 
8684_293663_000106_000000	train-clean-360	He drew her closer to him 
8684_293663_000106_000001	train-clean-360	No he would never quite forget but that was twelve thousand years ago and to morrow was his wedding day 
none	none	A Meeting Place for Readers of Astounding Stories Illustration The Readers Corner An Astounding Career Dear Editor A friend introduced me to your new magazine and it is wonderful The best story in the magazine or rather the one I liked best outside of the serial which I didn t read is The Cave of Horror by captain S P Meek Next comes Ray Cummings story of the Fourth Dimension Phantoms of Reality Other good ones are Tanks Invisible Death and Compensation I did not like The Stolen Mind It seemed to me to be a mixture of superstition and magic A fairy tale I am glad that you are publishing this magazine and I think that it is worth double its present price You have my good wishes to the magazine for a long and astounding career My way of reading a serial is to save copies and to read the story at one time I do not like to wait a month for a story to end or continue Your next issue seems to sound quite interesting The Spawn of the Stars a very interesting and I am sure a fit name for the story Creatures of the Light is a very vague name you don t know what to expect The others will prove to be as interesting as any that I have named I prefer interplanetary stories the most as any amount of science can be injected in them Nathan Greenfield three hundred eighteen East seventy eighth saint New York N Y Prefers Long Stories Dear Editor I got your first issue of Astonishing Stories and although I like the stories I do not like the way you have it bound This is supposed to be criticism so don t take it to heart The pages are uneven and hard to turn But the stories in the first copy were good And you ll have a swell magazine if you have stories by Harl Vincent and Ray Cummings The aforesaid men are two of the best in the science fiction field Another thing don t have any short stories If you have about three or four l o n g stories I d like it better I hope your magazine enjoys much success Linus Hogenmiller five hundred two N Washington Street Farmington Mo Another Who Likes Interplanetary Stories Dear Editor I have read the first issue of Astounding Stories with much pleasure and if the first issue is any indication of what is to follow I will continue to be a reader You inquire as to the kind of stories that your readers think should be published I think you will find the most popular brand to be interplanetary stories and stories along the line of the Beetle Horde Best wishes for success in your new endeavor F C Cowherd Room three hundred thirty three L N Railroad Louisville Ky Attention Joiners Dear Editor I have just finished one of the stories in your magazine and could not resist the temptation to write and tell you how much I enjoyed it The stories are great and are just the thing to give one rest and recreation At the same time they fire imagination and are not trashy love stories The main purpose of the letter is to revive an old idea and see if I can put it through I propose to organize a correspondence society for readers interested in science We would use Astounding Stories as our official medium Each member would receive a list of members names and addresses a quantity of official stationery for inter correspondence and a certificate of membership suitable for framing The object would be the discussion of scientific topics and the latest advances I would suggest an annual fee of two dollars fifty cents to cover the cost of printing stationery certificates application forms copy of the constitution lists of members and official pins All those interested in the formation of such a society are earnestly requested to write me giving suggestions as to a suitable name et cetera They will receive full information and a sample of the certificate of membership and an application form I trust you will publish this letter at your earliest convenience M R Bercovitch B Sc four thousand six hundred forty three saint Urbain Street Montreal Canada Sound Criticism Dear Editor You ask for readers to write you regarding types of stories desired Well I am an electrical engineer and of course like my yarns to have a touch of science in them Also I like my authors to make an original contribution to whatever theory of science they develop fictionally This Ray Cummings doesn t do in his very interesting story Phantoms of Reality His beginning is palpably borrowed from Francis Flagg s story The Blue Dimension which appeared in a Science Fiction magazine in nineteen twenty seven Flagg developed the theory of vibrations reverberation et cetera and contributed something new to speculative science Cummings merely seizes this point and dives into a series of improbable adventures Now I am not quarrelling with their improbability I like my stories improbable but I am asking for something more original than the old rehash of kings and queens intrigues and returning princes et cetera Again Cummings seems to lack enough scientific acumen to make his other world different than this Even a superficial thinker will readily see that the terrain of the other world would not faithfully follow our own in its salient features However forgive me for knocking the story wasn t so bad and Cummings doubtless can do better than this or has The Beetle Horde so far is a gem and holds the interest Furthermore its science is splendid I am looking forward to its conclusion The Cave of Horror is a damn good yarn well written interest sustained but I didn t care for The Stolen Mind The truth is that that particular story didn t hang together very well It left one up in the air as it were and far from satisfied me Too the science involved to say the least of it was not very sound or plausibly put In reading the story I felt that the author was one who should be encouraged to write more nothing wrong with his imagination or ability to fling words but that he should be gently coerced into writing with better continuity and intelligence Compensation didn t click too loose not compact enough Splendid idea ruined by hasty writing Another author needing a gentle hint But Tanks was another sure fire hit with me Held me to last word The story sounded real So for the stories in your first issue You see on the whole I liked all of them Still I also like variety Can t you give us some of the Francis Flagg type of fiction H Hyatt Verril is another of my favorites also doctor Keller and Clara Harris I have read mighty good tales by those authors I believe you could do worse than to run an occasional H G Wells story and if you gave us The First Men in the Moon serially I for one would be delighted I have tried in vain to get that story and never have Well I guess I have said enough Best wishes for the New Year May Astounding Stories grow and prosper and its Editor C Harry Jaeger twenty nine hundred Jeedan Road Oakland California Likes Interplanetary Stories Dear Editor Having read the first issue of Astounding Stories I am about to pronounce a sentence on it It is guilty of being Astounding to the Nth degree I enjoyed all the stories immensely and will be anxiously awaiting the next issue Now as for some suggestions which I think would improve the magazine I Try to have an interplanetary story in each issue II Publish a number of interesting letters concerning Astounding Stories in each issue III Have several illustrations in long stories I think this would improve the magazine although it is perfect just the way it is Hoping Astounding Stories has a long and successful life Forrest Ackerman five hundred thirty Staples Avenue San Francisco Cal Watch the Coming Issues Miss Miller Dear Editor Saw your new magazine at the newsstand and bought it at once I like the following stories in this issue The Beetle Horde Phantoms of Reality The Stolen Mind I did not care much for the others and least of all for Tanks I believe that readers like myself who are interested in scientific fantasies prefer stories of interplanetary travels and fourth dimensional stories and variations of these themes Such as various space ships and vibration machines for visiting other planets and traveling backward and forward in time Stories of lost continents and of strange races of people living in unknown places on our own Earth are interesting also A magazine of this kind has unlimited possibilities for stories of the aforementioned types and I believe that readers who buy magazines of these subjects expect to find therein really Astounding Stories Best wishes for the success of your magazine Ruth Miller saint Regis Hotel Cleveland Ohio The Scienceers Dear Editor This is to inform you that we have formed a club which we named The Scienceers The object of this club is to bring together members who are interested in science in general also to talk the stories of your magazine over We have no means of reaching those who are interested except through your magazine We hope you will grant us space to print this letter in your magazine We would appreciate it if every reader of your magazine living in New York City or nearby towns would drop us a card with his name and address We then would be able to send him information of our club We hope you will print this letter as we are all readers of your magazine Louis Wexeler nineteen thirty three Woodbine Street Brooklyn New York We Examine All Science Very Carefully Dear Editor In the first edition of your periodical you invite criticism from its readers I am extremely pleased to note that Ray Cummings is among its contributors His short crisp sentences and word pictures are most interesting As to the type of stories I would not be particular but there is one thing which must be observed Since this magazine is about science every story must be examined to discover any false statements by the author concerning present day science I think that discoveries and inventions to be made in the future by the author of course cannot be censored James Brodent New York N Y Young mister Wright Writes In Dear Editor I am accepting your offer to write and tell you what kind of stories I like So I did I prefer stories of the Fourth Dimension I hope to find plenty of these fascinating stories in your coming issues Billy Wright Age eleven Sheppard Place Nashville Tenn Likes His Science Fiction Dear Editor Allow me to congratulate you on your fine magazine it being one of the seven more or less magazines in print that are the best on the market I am glad to say that I can t throw you any brickbats only bouquets and thought I would tell you the kind of stories I would like to see in our magazine if I may take the liberty of calling it that I like stories of the type A Merritt and Edgar Rice Burroughs write particularly A Merritt and if you could reprint Through the Dragon Glass by A Merritt I wish you would and give it a cover illustration as I have everything by him except that one Please give it a cover illustration as well as any by Merritt and Burroughs you ever print You certainly have a good title and in my opinion the magazine need not be changed one iota except perhaps you might have the background a different color every month that is the background of the cover using every color in the solar spectrum which might make it sell better and at any rate would make a nice looking magazine in my opinion Everything in Science Fiction that comes out I have to get and pretty soon I will have so much that I will probably have to pay storage space for it I have a pretty good amount now four stacks two feet high each but I can t resist it and will keep on buying as long as there is anything in that line to buy and as long as I can Put this in the proverbial waste basket if you don t want to print it as that is probably its ultimate destination anyway as my ideas are not worth much or less than that But I do wish you would read it through and act on my suggestions soon Thanks from an ardent devourer of Science Fiction who reads everything in that line he can get his hands on your and our magazine being one of the best in that line Worth K Bryant four hundred six North Third Street Yakima Washington A Great Magazine Dear Editor I have just come across a copy of your new magazine Astounding Stories and to say that it is a great magazine is putting it mild I enjoy stories of the distant future The first instalment of The Beetle Horde by Victor Rousseau was great I hope to hear more of this author in coming issues I would like to see stories by such authors as Edgar Rice Burroughs Harl Vincent Otis Adelbert Kline Garret Smith also Ray Cummings I wish Astounding Stories a long life Wilbert Moyer five hundred thirty three N seventh Street Allentown Pa Mr Anderson s Favorites Dear Editor Just a word referring to your What kind of stories do you like in Astounding Stories I like stories with some facts based on true science of to day but let the author s imagination wander a little because anything might be possible to morrow I do not like love stories or much humor in this type of stories Stories of other worlds or of the Fourth Dimension always interest me because there is no limit to the imagination there Why not have a discussion column and print some of the letters It would encourage more to write and give you their opinion and whether good or bad should help you please the majority Some will maybe say the cover is too vivid but that was what attracted my eye when I picked it out from among many others Most of your stories in the first edition were good I liked The Beetle Horde and Phantoms of Reality best Also noticed the Spawn of the Stars next issue which sounds O K Hoping you all success in this type of stories C E Anderson three thousand five hundred four Colfax Avenue Minneapolis Minn A Young Reader s Favorites Dear Editor I am writing you per your request in your first issue of Astounding Stories They are most entertaining I have read three of the stories and they are excellent You asked the readers to tell you the kind of stories we liked best I like stories that concern the future of aviation I like interplanetary stories also the stories about the Fourth Dimension I like Cummings Rousseau s Leinster s Meek s Vincent s and Starzl s writing Your magazine is sure worth twenty cents You could put more science in your stories

magazine Ward Elmore twenty nine twelve Avenue J fort Madison Iowa A Contented Reader Dear Editor Congratulations on your new publication Astounding Stories I certainly enjoyed reading the January issue I believe that this magazine is the answer to the prayer of those readers who are desirous of something different something unique Another feature is that you are charging only twentyc a copy for a magazine that is really worth several times that amount You may count on me as a steady buyer of the Astounding Stories as long as future issues are up to the standard of the January issue Let me urge you that you give us the magazine on time every month I do not want to postpone my enjoyment of reading the Unique Magazine on the first Thursday of each month Keep up the good work and remember me as a contented reader of your publication T J Creaff junior P O Box seven hundred thirty four Phoenix Arizona A Lallapaloozer Dear Editor Well I ve got to say something and I might as well get it over with Your new magazine Astounding Stories is a Lallapaloozer I m sorry I didn t get the first edition of the new magazine but I suppose you have some in stock and I m sending in my twenty cents in stamps to get one I might as well tell you how I found out about this new wonder One dreary dreary night I walked into my newsdealer s store to get a paper While there I happened to glance upon the bookstand I saw the word Astounding and my curiosity aroused I walked over to the stand and pulled the magazine out Imagine my surprise and delight when I found out what it was Well I bought the book then and there without even taking a look inside When I got home I opened the book and the first story that caught my eye was Old Crompton s Secret by Harl Vincent I knew the story was good before I read it because I ve read quite a few of mister Vincent s novels and they were all excellent The best stories I like are interplanetary stories Why not have a Reader Talks in Astounding Stories where each reader gives his point of view on the stories in the magazine I know everyone would enjoy that as it gives the readers a chance to comment on stories and also see what the other reader thinks about any story in particular I wish you success in your new enterprise and hope my first edition of Astounding Stories arrives soon Joseph Kankowsky thirty five Columbia Street West
