4898_20016_000005_000000	train-clean-100	It was six o clock in the morning of last Thursday Christmas morning when Nathan Stoddard a young saddler strode through the vacant streets of one of our New England towns hastening to begin his work 
4898_20016_000005_000001	train-clean-100	The town is an old fashioned one and although the observance of the ancient church festival is no longer frowned upon as in years past yet it has been little regarded especially in the church of which Nathan is a member 
4898_20016_000005_000002	train-clean-100	As the saddler mounted the steps of his shop he felt the blood so rush along his limbs and tingle in his fingers that he could not forbear standing without the door for a moment as if to enjoy the triumph of the warmth within him over the cold morning air 
4898_20016_000005_000003	train-clean-100	The little stone church which Nathan attends stands in the same square with his shop and nearly opposite 
4898_20016_000005_000004	train-clean-100	It was closed as usual on Christmas day and a recent snow had heaped the steps and roof and loaded the windows 
4898_20016_000005_000005	train-clean-100	Nathan thought that it looked uncommonly beautiful in the softening twilight of the morning 
4898_20016_000006_000000	train-clean-100	While Nathan stood musing with his eyes fixed upon the church he became suddenly conscious that another figure had entered the square upon the opposite side and was walking hastily along 
4898_20016_000006_000001	train-clean-100	He turned his eyes upon it and was greatly surprised by its appearance 
none	none	He saw a tall old man although a good deal stooping with long straight and very white hair falling over his shoulders which was the more conspicuous from the black velvet cap as it appeared that he wore and the close fitting suit of pure black in which he was dressed and which seemed to Nathan almost to glisten and flash as the old man tripped along 
4898_20016_000006_000003	train-clean-100	He had hardly begun to speculate as to who the stranger could be when he beheld him turn in between the posts by the path that leads to the church tread lightly over the snow and up the steps and knock hastily and vigorously at the church door 
none	none	But half recovered from his wonder he was just raising his voice to utter a remonstrance when to his sevenfold amazement the door was opened to the knock and the old man disappeared within 
4898_20016_000007_000000	train-clean-100	It was not without a creeping feeling of awe mingled with his astonishment that Nathan gazed upon the door through which this silent figure had vanished 
4898_20016_000007_000001	train-clean-100	But he was not easily to be daunted 
4898_20016_000007_000002	train-clean-100	He did not care to follow the steps of the stranger into the church but he remembered a shed so placed against the building near the farther end that he had often when a child at some peril indeed climbed upon its top and looked into the church through a little window at one side of the pulpit 
4898_20016_000007_000003	train-clean-100	For this he started but he did not fail to run across the square and leap over the church gate at the top of his speed in order to gather warmth and courage for the attempt 
4898_20016_000008_000000	train-clean-100	When Nathan Stoddard climbed upon the old shed and pressed his face against the glass of the little church window he had at first only a confused impression of many lamps and many figures in all parts of the church 
4898_20016_000008_000001	train-clean-100	But as his vision grew more clear he beheld a sight which could not amaze him less than the apparition that startled Tam o Shanter as he glared through the darkness into the old Kirk of Alloway 
none	none	The great chandelier of the church was partly lighted and there were besides many candles and lanterns burning in different parts of the room and casting their light upon a large party of young men and women who were dressed in breeches and ruffled shirts and hooped petticoats and towering head dresses such as he had only seen in old pictures 
4898_20016_000008_000003	train-clean-100	They were mounted upon benches and ladders and boards laid along the tops of the pews and were apparently just completing the decoration of the church which was already dressed with green with little trees in the corners and with green letters upon the walls and great wreaths about the pillars 
4898_20016_000008_000004	train-clean-100	The whole party appeared full of life and cheerfulness while the old man whom Nathan had seen enter stood near the door looking quietly on with a little girl holding his hand 
4898_20016_000009_000000	train-clean-100	It was not until Nathan Stoddard had looked for some little time upon this spectacle that he began to feel that he was witness of any thing more than natural 
4898_20016_000009_000001	train-clean-100	The whole party had so home like an air and appeared so engaged with their pleasant occupation that notwithstanding their quaint dress Nathan only thought how much he should like to share their company 
none	none	But the more he studied their faces the more he was filled for all their appearance of youth and their simple manners with a strange sort of veneration The sweet and cheerful faces of the young women seemed to grow awfully calm and beautiful as they brought their task to a close and their foreheads with the hair brought back in the old fashioned way to become more and more serene and high 
4898_20016_000009_000004	train-clean-100	There was a strange beauty too about the old man s face 
none	none	He appeared to Nathan as if he felt that the group before him only waited his command to fade away in the morning light that struggled among the candles but he could not bear to give the word and so they kept playing with the festoons and stepping about the pews to please him Nathan felt a cold thrill partly from pleasure and partly from awe running up his back and a strong pain across his forehead seldom known to one of his temperament 
4898_20016_000009_000007	train-clean-100	Again and again he drew his hand across his brows until he felt that he was near swooning and like to fall and he clung desperately to his hold When the fit was over he dared venture no more but hastened to the ground 
none	none	It was no fear of ridicule or of incredulity that led Nathan Stoddard to keep secret what he had witnessed 
4898_20016_000010_000001	train-clean-100	But it was like some deep and holy experience that would lose its charm if it were spoken of to another 
4898_20016_000010_000002	train-clean-100	So he went back to his shop and sat looking upon the church and watching almost with dread the doves that lighted upon its roof and fluttered about and beat their wings against its windows 
4898_20016_000011_000000	train-clean-100	The minister of Nathan s parish was a young man by the name of Dudley and it so happened that he had driven out before light on the morning we have spoken of to visit a sick man at some distance 
4898_20016_000016_000001	train-clean-100	Dudley 
none	none	and it so happened that he had driven out before light on the morning we have spoken of to visit a sick man at some distance 
4898_20016_000011_000001	train-clean-100	In returning home he had to pass along the rather unfrequented street which runs in the rear of his church and close to it 
4898_20016_000011_000002	train-clean-100	As he was driving rapidly along his ear caught what seemed the peal of an organ 
none	none	He stopped his horse to listen and a moment convinced him that the sound both of the instrument and of singing voices came from his own church and it was music of a depth and beauty such as he had never before heard within it 
4898_20016_000011_000004	train-clean-100	Filled with astonishment he put his horse upon its fastest trot and drove round into the square to the shop of Nathan Stoddard 
4898_20016_000012_000000	train-clean-100	 There is music to day in our church Nathan he cried to the young saddler 
none	none	What can it mean But Nathan answered not a word 
4898_20016_000012_000002	train-clean-100	He caught the horse by the head and fastened him to a post before the door 
4898_20016_000012_000003	train-clean-100	Then stepping to the side of the sleigh he said to mister Dudley Come with me Sir mister Dudley looked upon the pale face and trembling lips of his parishioner and followed in silence 
4898_20016_000013_000000	train-clean-100	Nathan sprang upon the shed at the side of the church and scrambled up to the little window 
none	none	mister Dudley followed and with Nathan s help gained the same precarious foothold
4898_20016_000013_000002	train-clean-100	 Look in Sir said Nathan not venturing a glance himself 
4898_20016_000013_000003	train-clean-100	mister Dudley looked and had not Nathan s arm been about his body he would have lost his hold in sheer amazement 
none	none	The building was crowded as he had never known it before and crowded with people whom his eye versed in the dress and manners of our forefathers recognized as the church goers of a century and a half ago 
4898_20016_000013_000005	train-clean-100	The singers gallery was filled by a choir of girls and boys while his own place in the pulpit was occupied by a white haired figure whom he recognized as the original of a portrait which he had purchased and hung in his parlor at home for its singular beauty 
4898_20016_000013_000006	train-clean-100	It was said to be a portrait of a minister in the town who lived in the last century and is still remembered for his virtues 
none	none	The sight of this old man s face completely stilled the agitation of the young minister 
4898_20016_000013_000008	train-clean-100	He was leaning over the great Bible with his hands folded upon it and his eyes seemingly filled with tears of pleasure and gratitude and bent upon the choir 
4898_20016_000013_000009	train-clean-100	mister Dudley listened intently and could catch what seemed the words of some old Christmas carol 
none	none	Thou mak saint my cup of joy run o er 
4898_20016_000015_000000	train-clean-100	And he was so rapt with the sights and the sounds within that it needed all Nathan s endeavors to uphold him 
4898_20016_000016_000000	train-clean-100	By this time the sound of a gathering crowd below which he had not heeded at first was forced more and more upon his notice and the anxious voice of his oldest deacon calling mister 
none	none	Dudley mister Dudley rose high and loud while a great thundering at the front door of the church announced that the people below had also caught the sound of the music and were clamorous for admission 
4898_20016_000016_000003	train-clean-100	mister Dudley hastened round to prevent their causing any disturbance to the congregation within but he came only in time to see the door burst open and to be borne in with the crowd 
4898_20016_000016_000004	train-clean-100	All gazed about in wonder 
4898_20016_000016_000005	train-clean-100	The congregation indeed were gone and the preacher and the choir and the room was cold 
4898_20016_000016_000006	train-clean-100	But there was a great green cross over the pulpit and words along the walls and festoons upon the galleries and great wreaths like vast green serpents coiled about the cold pillars 
none	none	The church of the Orthodox parish of had been fairly dressed for Christmas by spirit hands 
4898_20016_000017_000000	train-clean-100	When mister Dudley reached his home after the wonder had in part spent itself he found that an enormous Christmas pie had been left at his door by a white haired old man dressed in black about six in the morning just after he had gone to visit his sick parishioner 
4898_20016_000017_000001	train-clean-100	The girl who received it reported the old man as saying in a tremulous but very kind voice Give your master the Christmas blessing of an old Puritan minister How the meaning of this message would have been known to mister Dudley had not the events we have told disclosed it who can say 
none	none	Need I add that my friend mister Dudley from whose lips I have taken down the above narrative has directed the decorations to remain in his church during the coming month and that he avows the intention of observing the Christmas of the following year with public services unless indeed he should be anticipated by his ancient predecessor It may not be impertinent to observe that I am invited to dine and spend the day with the Dudleys on that occasion and I shall not fail to make an accurate report of whatever glimpse I may obtain into the mysterious ceremonies of a Puritan Christmas IN THE CHURCHYARD AT CAMBRIDGE A LEGEND OF LADY LEE In the village churchyard she lies Dust is in her beautiful eyes No more she breathes nor feels nor stirs At her feet and at her head Lies a slave to attend the dead But their dust is white as hers Was she a lady of high degree So much in love with the vanity And foolish pomp of this world of ours Or was it Christian charity And lowliness and humility The richest and rarest of all dowers Who shall tell us No one speaks No color shoots into those cheeks Either of anger or of pride At the rude question we have asked Nor will the mystery be unmasked By those who are sleeping at her side Hereafter And do you think to look On the terrible pages of that Book To find her failings faults and errors

none	none	you will then have other cares In your own short comings and despairs In your own secret sins and terrors H W L THE LITTLE SOUTH WIND The little south wind had been shut up for many days while his cousin from the northeast had been abroad and the clouds had been heavy and dark but now all was bright and clear and the little south wind was to have a holiday O how happy he would be He sallied forth to amuse himself and hear what he did He came whistling down the chimney until the nervous old lady was ready to fly with vexation then away he flew laughing in triumph the naughty south wind He played with the maiden s work away the pieces flew some here some there and away ran the maiden after What cared she for the wind She tossed back her curls and laughed merrily and the wind laughed merrily too the silly south wind Onward he stole and lifting the curtain curious south wind what did he see On the sofa lay a young man a heavy book was in his hand The little south wind rustled through the leaves but the young man stirred not he was asleep hot and weary he slept The wind fanned his brow awhile lifted his dark locks and leaving a kiss behind stole out at the casement the gentle south wind Then he met a little child away he whirled the little boy s hat away ran the child but his little feet were tired and he wept poor child The wind looked back and felt sad then hung the hat on a bush and went on He had played too hard the thoughtless south wind A sick child lay tossing to and fro its hands and face were hot and dry The mother raised the window The wind heard her as he was creeping by and stepping in he cooled the burning face then playing among the flowers until their fragrance filled the room away he flew the kind south wind He went out into the highway and played with the dust but that was not so pleasant and onward he sped to the meadow The dust could not follow on the green grass and the little south wind soon outstripped it and onward and onward he sped over mountain and valley dancing among the flowers and frolicking round until the trees lifted up their arms and bent their heads and shook their sides with glee the happy south wind At last he came to a quiet dell where a little brook lay just stirring among his white pebbles The wind said Kind brook will you play with me And the brook answered with a sparkling smile and a gentle murmur Then the wind rose up and sporting among the dark pines whistled and sung through the lofty branches while the pretty brook danced along and warbled songs to the music of its merry companion the merry south wind But the sun had gone down and the stars were peeping forth and the day was done The happy south wind was still and the moon looked down on the world below and watched among the trees and hills but all was still the little south wind slumbered and the moon and the stars kept guard poor tired south wind Old lady and maiden young man and child the dust and the flowers were forgotten and he slept dear little south wind LINES WRITTEN AT THE CLOSE OF doctor HOLMES S LECTURES ON ENGLISH POETRY Footnote The Poets are metaphorically introduced as follows ROGERS The Beech CAMPBELL The Fir

Laurel Farewell farewell The hours we ve stolen From scenes of worldly strife and stir To live with poets and with thee Their brother and interpreter Have brought us wealth as thou hast reaped We have not followed thee in vain But gathered in one precious sheaf The pearly flower and golden grain For twelve bright hours with thee we walked Within a magic garden s bound Where trees whose birth owned various climes Beneath one sky were strangely found First in the group an ancient BEECH His shapely arms abroad did fling Wearing old Autumn s russet crown Among the lively tints of Spring Those pale brown leaves the winds of March Made vocal mid the silent trees And spread their faint perfume abroad Like sad yet pleasant memories Near it the vigorous noble FIR Arose with firm yet graceful mien Welcome for shelter or for shade A pyramid of living green And from the tender vernal spray The sunny air such fragrance drew As breathes from fields of strawberries wild All bathed in morning s freshest dew The OAK his branches richly green Broad to the winds did wildly fling The first in beauty and in power All bowed before the forest king But ere its brilliant leaves were sere Or scattered by the Autumn wind Fierce lightnings struck its glories down And left a blasted trunk behind A youthful ELM its drooping boughs In graceful beauty bent to earth As if to touch with reverent love The kindly soil that gave it birth And round it in such close embrace Sweet honeysuckles did entwine We knew not if the south wind caught Its odorous breath from tree or vine The CHESTNUT tall with shining leaves And yellow tassels covered o er The sunny Summer s golden pride And pledge of Autumn s ruddy store Though grander forms might near it rise And sweeter blossoms scent the air Was still a favorite mongst the trees That flourished in that garden fair All brightly clad in glossy green And scarlet berries gay to see We welcome next a constant friend The brilliant cheerful HOLLY TREE But twilight falls upon the scene Rich odors fill the evening air And lighting up the dusky shades Gleam the MAGNOLIA S blossoms fair The fire fly with its fairy lamp Flashes within its soft green bower The humming sphinx flits in and out To sip the nectar of its flower Now the charmed air more richly fraught To steep our senses in delight Comes o er us as the ORANGE TREE In beauty beams upon our sight And glancing through its emerald leaves White buds and golden fruits are seen Fit flowers to deck the bride s pale brow Fit fruit to offer to a queen But let me rest beneath the PINE And listen to the low sad tone Its music breathes that o er my soul Comes like the ocean s solemn moan Erect it stands in graceful strength Its spire points upward to the sky And nestled in its sheltering arms The birds of heaven securely lie And though no gaily painted bells Nor odor bearing urns are there When the west wind sighs through its boughs Let me inhale the balmy air The stately PALM in conscious pride Lifts its tall column to the sky While round it fragrant air plants cling Deep stained with every gorgeous dye Linger with me a moment where The LOCUST trembles in the breeze In soft transparent verdure drest Contrasting with the darker trees The humming bird flies in among Its boughs with pure white clusters hung And honey bees come murmuring where Its perfume on the air is flung A noble LAUREL meets our gaze Ere yet we leave these alleys green Mongst many stately fair and sweet The DAPHNE ODORA stands a queen May two eighteen fifty three AUNT MOLLY A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE In looking back upon my early days one of the images that rises most vividly to my mind s eye is that of Miss Molly or Aunt Molly as she was called by some of her little favorites that is to say about a dozen girls and not complimentary to the un fair sex to be sure one boy There was one who even to Miss Molly was not a torment and a plague and I must confess he was a pleasant specimen of the genus At the time of which I speak the great awkward barn of a school house on the Common near the Appian Way had not reared its imposing front In its place in the centre of a grass plot that was one of the very first to look green in spring and kept its verdure through the heats of July stood the brown one storied cottage which she owned and in which the aged woman lived alone Her garden and clothes yard behind the house were fenced in but in front the visitor to the cottage unimpeded by gate or fence turned up the pretty green slope directly from the street to the lowly door As I have started for a walk into the old times and am not bound by any rule to stick to the point I will here digress to say that the Episcopal Church the Church as it was simply called when all the rest were meeting houses that tells the traveller what a pure and true taste was once present in Cambridge and by the contrast it presents to the architectural blunders that abound in the place tells also what a want of it there is now this beautiful church stood most appropriately and tastefully surrounded by the green turf unbroken by stiff gravel walks or coach sweep and undivided from the public walk by a fence Behind the church and forming a part of its own grounds where now exist the elegances of School Court was an unappropriated field and that spot was considered by a certain little group of children of six or seven years old the most solitary gloomy mysterious place in their little world When the colors of sunset had died out in the west and the stillness and shadow of twilight were coming on they used to snatch a fearful joy in seeing one of their number whose mother had kindly omitted the first lesson usually taught to little girls to be afraid of every thing perform the feat of going slowly around the church alone stopping behind it to count a hundred Her wonderful courage in actually protecting the whole group from what they called a flock of cows and in staking and patting the mad dogs that they were for ever meeting was nothing to this going round the church But to return to the cottage from which the pretty rural trait of its standing in its unfenced green door yard led me away to notice the same sort of rustic beauty where the church stood We did not stop to knock at the outside door for Aunt Molly was very deaf and if we had knocked our little knuckles off she would not have heard us but went in and passing along the passage rapped at the door of the common room half sitting room half kitchen and were admitted Those who saw her for the first time whether children or grown people were generally afraid of her for her voice unmodulated of course by the ear was naturally harsh strong and high toned and the sort of half laugh half growl that she uttered when pleased might have suggested to an imaginative child the howl of a wolf She had very large features and sharp penetrating black eyes shaded by long gray lashes and surmounted by thick bushy gray eyebrows I think that when she was scolding the school boys with those eyes fiercely glowering at them from under the shaggy gray thatch she must have appeared to those who in their learned page had got as far as the Furies like a living illustration of classic lore Her cap and the make of her dress were peculiar and suggestive of those days before and at the time of the Revolution of which she loved to speak But we her little favorites were not afraid of her To go into her garden in summer and eat currants larger and sweeter than any we found at home to look up at the enormous old damson tree when it was white with blossoms and the rich honey comb smell was diffused over the whole garden was a pleasant little excursion to us She took great care and pains to save the plums from the plundering boys because it was the only real damson there was anywhere in the neighborhood and she found a ready sale for them for preserves She seemed to think that the real damsons went out with the real gentry of the olden time and perhaps they did as damsons though for aught I know they may figure now in our fruit catalogues as The Duke of Argyle s New Seedling Acidulated Drop of Damascus which would be something like a translation of Damson into the modern terminology But more pleasant still was it to go into Aunt Molly s best room The walls she had papered herself with curious stripes and odd pieces of various shapes and patterns ornamented with a border of figures of little men and women joining hands cut from paper of all colors and they were adorned besides with several prints in shining black frames There was no carpet on the snow white unpainted floor but various mats and rugs of all the kinds into which ingenuity has transformed woollen rags were disposed about it The bed was the pride and glory of the room however for on it was spread a silk patchwork quilt made of pieces of the brocade and damask and elegant silks of which the ladies belonging to the grand old Tory families had their gowns and cardinals and other paraphernalia made Aunt Molly had been a mantuamaker to the old quality and she could show us a piece of Madam Vassall s gown on that wonderful and brilliant piece of work the bed quilt On that hint she would speak A haw awr They were real gentle folks that lived in them days A haw awr I declare I could e en amost kneel down and kiss the very airth they trod on as they went by my house to church Polite they wor Yes they knew what true politeness was and to my thinking true politeness is next to saving grace Once a year or so Aunt Molly would dress up in her best gown a black silk trimmed with real black lace and a real lace cap relics of the good old days of Toryism and brocade and the real gentry and go to make an afternoon visit to one of her neighbors After the usual salutations the lady would ask her visitor to take off her bonnet and stay the afternoon knowing by the rig that such was her intention But she liked to be urged a little so she would say O I only came out for a little walk it was so pleasant and stopped in to see how little Henry did since his sickness You know I always call him my boy Yes Aunt Molly the only boy in the universe that for you had any good in him After the proper amount of urging she would lay aside her bonnet and black satin mantle saying Well I didn t come here to get my tea but you are so urgent I believe I will stay Aunt Molly s asides were often amusing She was so very deaf that she could not hear her own voice and often imagined she was whispering when she could be heard across the room On one occasion she saw a gentleman who was a stranger to her in the parlor when she went to visit one of the ladies who were kind and attentive to her She sat a few minutes looking keenly at him and then whispered Who s that mister Jay Who mister JAY Who mister JAY Oh o oh mister Jay Well what does he do for a living He s a tutor Ma am What A TUTOR What A TUTOR Oh o oh I thought you said a suitor Aunt Molly owned the little brown cottage where her widowed mother she said had lived and there she died As soon as she was laid in her grave it was torn down and the precious damson tree was felled I was rather glad that the school house was so ugly that I might have a double reason for hating the usurper If Nemesis cared for school boys she doubtless looks on with a grin now to see them scampering at their will round the precincts of the former enemy of their race and listens with pleasure while they make day hideous where once the bee and the humming bird only broke the quiet of the little garden Aunt Molly had a vigorous active mind and a strong tenacious memory and her love of the departed grandeur and Toryism of Court Row as she called that part of Brattle Street from Ash Street to Mount Auburn was pleasant and entertaining to those who listened to her tales of other times Peace to her memory

none	none	I entered the room with considerable empressement but when my eye detected the dim outline of a circle of bonneted figures I stopped in despair in the middle of the room not knowing which was which or whom I ought to speak to first and at last made an embarrassed half bow half courtesy to the company in general A confused murmur of greetings and introductions followed and throwing aside my air of stiff ceremonious politeness I rushed with a smiling face to the nearest lady shook hands with her in the most cordial manner and then in passing bowed formally to the next who I concluded was the stranger What then was my surprise and utter confusion when she caught me by the hand and drawing me towards her kissed me emphatically several times How do you do dear

4427_20023_000006_000002	train-clean-360	As he was passing her he thought he perceived that her fur boa or tippet had escaped from her neck and carefully lifting the end of it with one hand he made a low bow raising his hat with the other and said in his blandest tone Madam you are losing your tippet And what thanks did the worthy Doctor receive do you think for this truly kind and polite deed 
none	none	Why the lady merely turned her head gave him a wondering stare with her large eyes and said Moo o o o As an offset to this instance of courtesy and good breeding lavished on a cow let me give you as a parting bon bouche another cow anecdote where as you will see there was no gentle politeness wasted

4427_20023_000008_000003	train-clean-360	A favorite employment of this good man was the care of his garden and he might be seen any pleasant afternoon in summer rigged out in a hideous yellow calico robe or blouse with a dusty old black straw hat stuck on the back of his head hoeing and digging in that beloved patch of ground

man Learn retrenchment from the starving oyster who spends his last energies in a new pearly layer suited to his shrunken form As animals which have no organs of special sense know not light or sound as we do yet shrink from a hand or candle because their whole bodies are dimly conscious thus we have a glimmering perception of infinite truths and existences which we cannot grasp or fully know because our minds have no special organs for them The prick in the butterfly s wing will be in the full grown insect a great blemish The speck in thy child s nature if fondly overlooked now will become a wide rent traversing all his virtues As mineral poisons kill because by their strong affinity they decompose the blood and form new stony substances so the soul possessed by too strong an affinity for gold petrifies Our principles are central forces our desires tangential it requires both to describe the curve of life The slightest inclination of a standing body virtually narrows its

circumstances the fungi seem to owe theirs to outward influences It is a poor plant that crisps quickly into wood It is a meagre character which runs perpetually into prejudices As light suffers from no change of medium when it falls perpendicularly so the consequences of a perfectly upright action or cause of action are strictly fortunate But let it be ever so little oblique the new medium will exaggerate its obliquity and the farther it departs from uprightness the more frightfully it is distorted Hoops and coins which cannot preserve their equilibrium when in rest keep it when set in

experiment when under the restraint of human surveillance and I shall look upon him as a curiosity There is no fruit certainly which has so fair and alluring an exterior but few content themselves with feasting their eyes upon it How fresh and ripe it looks as it lies upon the plate with its rosy cheek turned temptingly upward How cool and soft is the downy skin to the touch And the fragrance so suggestive of its rich delicious flavor who can resist Ah unhappy wight Bitterly you shall repent your rashness Any other fruit can be eaten with comparative ease and politeness a peach was evidently intended only to be looked at or enjoyed beneath your own tree where no eye may watch and criticize your motions I see you in imagination at a party standing in the middle of the room plate in hand regarding your peach as if it were some great natural curiosity A sudden jog of your elbow compels you to a succession of most dexterous balancings as your heavy peach rolls from side to side knocks down your knife and threatens to plunge after it when you stoop to regain it You look distractedly round for a table but all are occupied Even the corner of the mantel shelf holds a plate and you enviously see the owner thereof leaning carelessly against the chimney and looking placidly round upon his less fortunate companions You glance at the different groups to see if any one else is in your most unenviable predicament Ah yes Yonder stands a gentleman worse off yet for in addition to your perplexities he is talking with a young laughing girl who is watching his movements with a merry twinkle in her bright eyes He evidently wishes to astonish her by his dexterity and disappoint her roguish expectations He holds his plate firmly in his left hand and proceeds at once to cut his peach in halves Deuce take the blunt silver knife The tough skin resists its pressure The knife and plate clash loudly together the peach is bounding and rolling at the very feet of the young lady who is in an ecstasy of laughter Ah she herself has no small resemblance to a peach fair beautiful and attractive without and I sadly fear with a hard heart beneath Are you yet more miserable than before Turn then to yonder sober looking gentleman who certainly seems sufficiently composed to perform the difficult manoeuvre He has the advantage of a table to be sure but that is not every thing He begins right by deliberately removing the woolly skin Now he lays the slippery peach in his plate and makes a plunge at it with his knife A sharp prolonged screech across his plate salutes the ears of all the bystanders and a fine slice of juicy pulp is flung unceremoniously into the face of the gentleman opposite who certainly does not look very grateful for the unexpected gift Every one of course has seen the awkward accident O no That pretty animated girl upon the sofa is much too pleasantly engaged that is evident to be watching her neighbors Playing carelessly with her fan and casting many sparkling glances upward at the two gentlemen who are vying with each other in their gallant attentions she has enough to do without noticing other people She is happily unconscious of the mortification which is in store for her or wilfully shuts her eyes to the peril Alas Her hand is resting even now upon the destroyer of all her present enjoyment the beautiful fragrant treacherous peach With a nonchalance really shocking to the anxious beholder she raises it and breaks it open talking the while and scarcely bestowing a thought upon what she is about Dexterously done but O luckless maiden the fruit is ripe and rich and juicy and the running drops fall not into her plate but upon the delicate folds of her dress The merry repartee dies away upon her lips as she becomes conscious of the catastrophe It is with a forced smile that she declares It is nothing O not of the slightest consequence That unlucky peach How many blunders how many pauses how many absent minded remarks it occasions She makes the most frenzied attempts to regain her former gayety but in vain Her gloves are stained and sticky with the flowing juice and she is oppressed by the conviction that all her partners for the rest of the evening will hate her most heartily An expression of real vexation steals over her pretty face and she gives up her plate to one of the attendant beaux with not so much as a wish that he will return to her Where are the arch smiles the lively tones the quick and ready responses now Her spirit is quenched Her manner has become subdued depressed shall I say it yes even sulky Ah I see your courage will not brave laughter You steal to the table half ashamed of yourself as you set down your untasted peach Your sudden zeal to relieve those ladies of their plates serves as a very good excuse for the relinquishment of your own You have rescued yourself very well from your dilemma this time Remember my advice for the future Never accept a peach in company MISERIES No two A DARK NIGHT There are some people who seem to have the faculty which horses and dogs are said to possess of seeing in the dark But I alas am blind and blundering as a beetle I never can find my way about house in the evening without a lamp to illumine my path Many smarting remembrances have I of bruised nose and black eyes the consequences of attempting to run through a partition under the full conviction that I have arrived at an open door My most prominent feature has been rudely assailed also by doors standing ajar unexpectedly which I have embraced with both outstretched arms Crickets tables chairs especially chairs with very sharp rockers and other movable articles of furniture have stationed themselves as it would seem with malicious intent to trip me up Some murderous contusion makes me suddenly conscious of their presence Then a feeling of complete bewilderment and helplessness and timidity comes over me I have not the least idea in what part of the room I am I am oppressed with a sense of chairs scattered about in improbable places I long most ardently for a lamp or only for one gleam from a neighbor s window It is no rare thing for me to discover by a thrilling touch upon the cold glass that I have been feeling my way exactly in the opposite direction from what I imagined Strange how ideas of direction and distance are lost when the sight is powerless Touch may find out mistakes but cannot always prevent them Touch may convince me that I have arrived at my bureau but it is too careless to perceive what the poor straining eyes would have discovered at a glance the open upper drawer that salutes my forehead as I stoop hastily to grasp the handles beneath Touch is clumsy It only serves to upset valuable plants inkstands solar lamps c with an appalling crash and then leaves me standing aghast in utter uncertainty as to the extent of the catastrophe In such emergencies a rush for the stairs is the first impulse Ah but those stairs I will pass over the startling plunge which begins my descent the frantic snatch for the banisters and the strange momentary doubt as to which foot must move first like what a child may feel when learning to walk All this only serves to render me so over careful that when I actually arrive at the foot of the staircase I cannot believe it until a loud scuff and the shock that follows the interruption of my expected descent assure me beyond a doubt There is nothing more exasperating than this unless it may be the corresponding disappointment in running up stairs when you raise your foot high in air and bring it down with an emphatic stamp exactly upon a level with the other But these are mere household experiences Sad though they are I esteem them as nothing in comparison with my adventures out of doors In a dark night and especially in a night both dark and stormy I feel myself one of the most wretched beings in existence Imagine a vessel lost in the wide ocean and without a compass and you will have some faint idea of my perplexity discouragement and loneliness at such a time I have a strange propensity for shooting off into the gutter or for shouldering the fences under the impression that I am pursuing a straight course I go quite out of my way to trip over chance stones or to pick out choice bits of slippery ice I splash recklessly through deep puddles stumble over unfortunate scrapers walk unexpectedly into open cellars and lay my length upon wet stone doorsteps I start back at visions of posts looming up in the darkness and whitewashed fences and trees all of which would be quite unlikely to be standing in the middle of the sidewalk and which disappear at the first reasonable thought I run into harmless passengers as if I would knock the breath of life out of them and tangle our umbrellas together so fearfully that they spin round and round some time after their separation O that umbrella of mine Sometimes I hook it in the drooping branches of trees and losing my hold in the suddenness of the shock have the gratification of feeling it tip up and go down over my shoulder into the mud behind me Its bone tips tap and scratch at the windows as I go by and scrape against the tall fences like fingers trying to catch at something to hold on by and stop my progress It hits a low branch and its varnished handle slips through my woollen gloves knocking my hat over my eyes and extinguishing me for the time being As if the night were not dark enough without My friends I could go on much longer with my complaints but I feel that I have drawn upon your sympathies sufficiently for the present You will be as glad to leave me at my own house door as I am to find it MISERIES No three TWINE Under the general head of string I might enumerate a long list of this world s miseries Shoe strings alone comprehend an amount of wretchedness which is but feebly described in the tragical story of Jemmy String Bonnet strings and apron strings dickey strings and watch guards curtain cord bed cord and cod line each and all have furnished enough discomfort to make out a long grumbling article But I cannot linger to describe their treacherous desertions when their services are most needed their unexpected weakness and their obstinate entanglements when time presses A certain pudding bag string is commemorated in one of the beautiful couplets of Mother Goose s Melodies I am sure you cannot have forgotten it nor the staring spotted cat that is there represented racing away with her booty That lamented pudding bag string is but a type of strings in general They are fleeting possessions always hiding always misplaced never in order You fit up a string drawer perhaps with a fine assortment and pride yourself upon its nice arrangement Go to it a week after and see if you can find one ball where you left it Can you lay your hand upon a single piece that you want

it had a weak side And so had its wearer perchance Since I left it on stairs to abide At a house where I went to a dance A lady ran into my hat My poor hat She demolished my invalid hat INNOCENT SURPRISES I am somewhat inclined to the opinion that if positive legislation could be brought to bear upon this subject making it a criminal offence for one person deliberately to concoct and designedly to spring a surprise upon another society would derive incalculable benefit from the act For the ordinary and inevitable surprises of every day life are sufficiently frequent and startling to content even the most romantic disposition entirely dispensing with the necessity of those artfully contrived embarrassing little plots which one s friends occasionally set in motion greatly to their own diversion and the extreme discomfort of the surprised unfortunate For he who has ever broken his skull on a treacherous sidewalk or received from the post a dunning missive when he expected a love letter or arrived one minute late at the car station or taken a desperately bad bill in exchange for good silver or been caught in a thunderstorm with white pantaloons and no umbrella knows that the unavoidable surprises of life are in themselves staggerers of quite frequent occurrence and require not the aid of human invention But the surprises which we most dread are not those which naturally fall to us as part of the misfortune we are born to inherit not those which result from unforeseen accidental circumstances from carelessness on our own part or from the folly of others from revolutions in the elements or in the affairs of nations these we can bear by using against them the best remedies we possess or by viewing and enduring them as wisdom and philosophy teach us to do No our only prayer in this connection is that we may be saved from our friends not from their carelessness but from their deliberate schemes against our security In order to reconcile this apparent contradiction in terms take the following instance of a friendly propensity You walk into your house at dusky twilight at that particular hour of evening at which your own brother if he be a reasonable being would not expect you to recognize him one of your family extends his or her head from the parlor and calls upon you at once to enter and greet an old friend You obey and are immediately confronted with an individual whose countenance wears an expression associated with some reminiscences of your youth but so dim and undefined is it that you cannot for the life of you give it its appropriate name or place What is to be done The recollections of early childhood are expected spontaneously to burst forth from under a heap of later and more vivid associations and the name residence business and whole history of the unwelcome guest are called upon to suggest themselves within a second s time After a long moment of painful hesitation during which you have in vain tried to stare his name out of him you clutch at a struggling idea and blurt out the name of one of your former associates You do this not by any means because common sense or conviction suggest the course but simply because something must instantly be done The result of course is that you hit upon the wrong name and now your kind friends can do no more for you even if they rush to the rescue and formally introduce the stranger it is of no avail The deed is done you are placed in a position of awkward mortification which both the stranger and yourself will never forget and never cease to regret Why it is that the feeling of shame which follows upon such mishaps attaches itself exclusively to the innocent sufferers rather than to those who are the cause of the suffering I never could understand This kind of diversion betrays a want of humane consideration in the contriver It is infinitely more cruel and unamiable than Spanish bull baitings or the gladiatorial shows of the ancients inasmuch as a shock to the finest feelings of human nature is harder to bear and longer in duration than the momentary pang induced by witnessing a merely physical suffering THE OLD SAILOR In my school vacations I used occasionally to visit an old sailor friend a man of uncommon natural gifts and that varied experience of life which does so much to supply the want of other means of education He must have been a handsome man in his youth and though time and hardship had done their utmost to make a ruin of his bold features and had made it needful to braid his still jetty black locks together to cover his bald crown his was a fine striking head yet to my boyish fancy I loved to sit at his feet and hear him tell the events of sixty years of toil and danger suffering and well earned joy as he leaned with both hands upon his stout staff his body swaying with the earnestness of his speech His labors and perils were now ended and in his age and infirmity he had found a quiet haven He had built a small house by the side of the home of his childhood and his son who followed his father s vocation lived under the same roof This son and two daughters were all that remained to him of a large family An easterly bank and a westerly glim are certain signs of a wet skin said the fisherman pointing to the heavy black masses of cloud that hung over the eastern horizon one morning when I had risen at sunrise for a day s fishing T won t do don t go out to day There s soon such a breeze off shore as with the heavy chop would make you sick enough Besides the old dory won t put up with such a storm as is coming No fishing my boy to day His old father said Stephen is right There is a blow brewing And he came to look leaning on his cane Stay in to day I yielded and the sky during the morning slowly assumed a dull leaden hue The storm came on in the afternoon heavily pattering and pouring and blowing against the windows and obscuring the little light of an autumn twilight I wandered through the few small rooms of the cottage endeavoring to amuse myself while the light lasted with two funeral sermons and an old newspaper Then I sat down at a window and I well remember the gloomy landscape seen through the rain in the dusk the marsh with the creek dividing it the bare round eminence between the house and the beach or rather the rocky cliffs and on either side the wide lonely sands with heavy foam capped breakers rolling in upon the shore with a sound like a solemn dirge At a distance on the left half hidden by the walnut trees lay the ruins of a mill which had always the air of being haunted A high rocky hill very nearly perpendicular on the side next the house was covered on the sides and top with junipers pines and other evergreens As the darkness thickened I left the lonely best room for the seat in the large chimney corner in the kitchen The old wife tottered round making preparations for the evening meal and muttered recollections of shipwrecks which the storm brought to her mind Now and then she would go to a window turn back her cap border from her forehead put her face close to the glass shading off the firelight with her hand and gaze out into the darkness Asa did not go out either thank the good Father she said The dog whined piteously saint saint Poor Scip Here shall have a piece Good dog A fearful night indeed it is The two men came in from the barn shook off the wet and drew near the fire Just such a night twenty nine years ago come August we ran afoul of Hatteras You remember old woman how they frighted ye about me don t ye Amidst such reminiscences we were called to supper I remember being solemnly impressed when that old man bent with hardship and the weight of years clasped his hands reverently and in rude terms but full of meaning asked a blessing upon their humble board I remember the flickering light from the logs burning on the hearth and how it showed upon the faces of those who sat there a strong feeling of the words in which rose an added petition in behalf of those on the mighty deep Supper being ended the old man took down the tobacco board and when he had cut enough to fill his pipe handed it to his son who having done the same restored it to its nail in the chimney corner Then they smoked and talked of dangers braved and overcome of pirates and shipwrecks and escapes till I involuntarily drew closer into my corner and looked over my shoulder Suddenly the dog under the table gave a whining growl I never seed the like o that dog exclaimed the fisherman turning to me I thought he was asleep But if ever a foot comes nigh the house at night he gives notice Depend on it there s some one coming The door of the little entry opened with a rush of the whistling wind and a man stepped in The dog half rose and though he wagged his tail in token that he knew the step to be that of a friend he kept up a low whine A young man muffled to the eyes and with the water dripping from his huge pea jacket opened the kitchen door William Crosby why what brings you out in such a storm as this Strip off your coat and draw up to the fire can t ye Where are you bound then and the night as dark as a wolf s throat The young fisherman made no answer unless by a motion of his hand As he turned back the collar from his face we saw by the waving light that it was pale as death The long wet locks already lay upon his cheeks making them more ghastly as he struggled to speak O Stephen Lee it s no time to be sitting by the fire when old Asa Osborn is rolling in the waters A man s drownded and who s to get the body for the wife and the children God pity them afore the ebb carries it out to sea The old man drew his hand across his forehead and rose I looked at him as he drew up his tall figure and looked the young messenger full in the eye In a low deep whisper he said Who William did ye say You said a man s drownded but tell me the name again Yes Gran sir I did say it Old Uncle Ase Flemming he and the minister went out a fishing in the morning The minister got his boots off in the water and after a long time he s swum ashore But poor Uncle Ase Stephen come along His poor wife s gone down to the beach now They left the house and I shut the door after them and came back softly to my seat by the old man s knee Once before I had seen him when a heavy sorrow fell upon him It was on a beautiful summer s day and the open window let in the cool breeze from the sea He was sitting by it in his arm chair looking out upon the calm water buried in thought His favorite daughter had long been very low and might sink away at any moment The old dog was at his feet asleep The clock ticked in the corner and the sun was shining upon the floor Some friends sat by in silence with sorrowful countenances His little grandchild came to his side and said Mother says tell Grandpa Aunt Lucy s gone home The old man did not alter his position For some time he sat in deep thought looking out with unseeing gaze and winding his thumbs as before Of five fair daughters three had before died by the same disease consumption He had seen them slowly fade away one by one and had followed his children to the grave in the secluded burying ground where the green sod was now to be broken to receive the fourth Rising slowly he walked across the room and taking the well worn family Bible returned with it to his seat and as he turned the leaves he said in a low tone to himself There s only one left now Then he sat entirely silent with his eyes fixed upon the sacred page He did not utter one word of lamentation he did not shed a tear but as he turned his eye on me in passing its expression went to my heart Stealing softly out I left him to the silent Comforter whose blessing is on the mourner Now the scene was changed One was suddenly taken from his side who had been a companion from boyhood to old age They had played and worked in company together they had embarked on their first voyage and their last and they had settled down in close neighborhood in the evening of their days Each had preserved the other s life in some moment of peril but took small praise to himself for so simple an act of duty Few words of fondness had ever passed between them They had gone along the path of life without perhaps being conscious of any peculiarly strong tie of friendship binding them together till they were thus torn asunder The death of a daughter long and slowly wasting away before his eyes could be calmly borne But this blow was wholly unforeseen and his chest heavily rose and fell and by the bright firelight I saw tears rolling over his weather beaten cheeks A child will weep a bramble s smart A maid to see her sparrow part A stripling for a woman s heart Talk not of grief till thou hast seen The hard drawn tears of bearded men The fury of the storm being abated I resolved to follow Stephen down to the shore He was not in sight and I knew not what direction to take It was a gloomy night the transient glimpses of the moon between driving masses of clouds only making the scene more wild and appalling I could see the tops of the tall trees bending under the fury of the blast ere it came to sweep the beach The heaving billows were covered with foam far as the eye could reach and rising and tumbling seemed striving with each other as they rolled on towards the sands I had seen storms upon the ocean before but never had it presented so awful and majestic an appearance As the breakers struck upon the shore and sent a huge mass of water upon the sands their sullen roar mingled with the howling and rushing of the wind and filled me with awe There were torches upon the beach and as I drew near I saw the fishermen run together to one point The body had just been washed ashore and lay stretched upon the sands The head was bare and long locks of white hair streamed down upon the shoulders The heavy pea jacket was off from one arm as if he had endeavored to extricate himself from it in the water The sinewy arms lay powerless and free from tension then but they told me that when they first drew him from the surf both hands were grasping a broken oar with such strength that they were unable to loose his hold till suddenly the muscles relaxed and the arms fell upon the ground They turned the body and a little water ran from the mouth Then gently raising it upon their shoulders they bore it home LAUGHTER In some individuals the risibles lie so near the surface that you may tickle them with a feather In others they are so deeply imbedded in phlegm or so protected by the crust of ill humor that a strong thrust and a keen weapon are required to reach them A laugh is in itself a different thing in different individuals Some persons laugh inwardly unsocially bitterly It is a pure grimace on your part when you join in their merriment unless you are superior to the fear of ridicule On the other hand there is a laugh of so contagious a nature that you are irresistibly moved to sympathy while ignorant of the exciting cause or out of the sphere of its influence You will laugh loud and long and afterwards confess that you had not the least gleam of a funny idea all the while You doubt the power of the sympathetic laugh Come with me into the nursery Here is a rosy little horror a year and a half old Sit down and take him upon your knees Hold his dimpled hands in yours and look steadily into his roguish eyes Repeat a nursery rhyme no matter what in a humdrum recitative he is sober and very attentive Suddenly spring a mine upon him with a Boo His Hicketty hick follows and his eyes begin to shine Repeat the experiment Hicketty hick again more heartily than at first with the baby encore Adin The same process awakens the rapturous little pearls again and again and you are quite in the spirit of the thing yourself Now for a more ecstatic burst You purposely prolong his suspense he is all atilt expecting the delightful surprise You drawl out each word you drone the ditty over and over again till every tiny nerve is tense with expectation Boo at last and over he goes in the complete abandon of baby glee his cherry lips are wide asunder his head hangs powerless back and the Hicketty hicks burst tumultuously from his little beating throat And you sir what are you doing Laughing I declare in full roar till the tears run down your cheeks You catch the boy in your arms toss him almost throttle him with kisses and so enhance the merry spasms that mamma who has a philosophical instinct with regard to excited nerves and dreads the reaction comes to the rescue Let me introduce you to another effective laughter You shall not hear a sound yet you cannot choose but laugh if she does quiet as she is about it See how her shoulders shake and look at her face Every feature is instinct with mirth the color mounts to the roots of the hair the curls vibrate the eyes sparkle through tears the white teeth glisten the very nose and ears seem to take a part like Nourmahal she laughs all over and while you wonder what the joke may be you are laughing too Do you feel dismal or anxious You should hear L tell a story She is one of the very few who can undertake with impunity to talk and laugh at the same time Look and listen while she describes some comic occurrence There is no unladylike boisterous noise but musical peals of laughter come thick and fast and faster and thicker preternaturally fast and thick come the words with them And yet each word is distinct you do not lose a syllable And I should like to see the man who can resist her if she chooses he should laugh even at his own expense There is an odd sort of power too in the gravity with which B tells a humorous anecdote He invariably maintains a sober face while every body is in an agony of laughter around him Just as it begins to subside the echo of his own wit comes back to him and as if he had just caught the idea he bursts into one little abrupt explosion so genuine so full of heartiness that it sets every body off upon a fresh score Nothing so melts away reserve among strangers nothing so quickly develops the affinities in chance society as laughter A person might be ever so polite and even kind and talk sentiment a whole day and it would not draw me so near to him as the mutual enjoyment of one heartfelt laugh It is a perfect bond of union for the time being you have but one soul between you TO STEPHEN I saw thee only once dear boy and it may be perchance That ne er again on earth my eyes shall meet thy gentle glance Years have gone by since then and thou no longer art the child With earnest eye and frolic laugh and look so clear and mild For thee the smiles and tears and sports of infancy are gone And youth s bright promise gliding into manhood has come on And yet thine image as a child will ever stay with me As bright as when so long ago I met and welcomed thee What was the charm that lay enshrined within thy smiling eyes What made me all thy childish winning ways so dearly prize It was thy likeness to another one whose looks of love No longer blessing earth were met by angel eyes above Yet thou hadst not the golden hair the brow of radiant white Nor the blue eyes so soft and deep like violets dewy bright But the smiles that played about thy mouth the sweetness in thine eyes The dimpling cheek that said Within a sunny spirit lies The true and open brow the bird like voice so free and clear The glance that told I have not learned the meaning yet of fear And more than all the trusting heart so lavish of its treasure In simple faith its earnest love bestowing without measure These more than lines and colors made a picture warm and bright Of one whose face no more might cheer and bless my earthly sight The nature beautiful and pure he carried to the skies Has been trained by angel teaching has been watched by seraph eyes Dear boy through this cold world thy earth bound feet have trod and now Is the loving heart still thine Hast kept that true and open brow THE OLD CHURCH There are certain old fashioned people who find fault with the luxuriousness of our churches and ascribe to the warmth and comfort which contrast so strongly with the hardships of early times the acknowledged sleepiness of modern congregations 
4358_20034_000003_000001	train-clean-360	For my part I see no necessary connection between discomfort and devotion 
none	none	My soul at least sympathizes so much with its physical adjunct that when the latter is uncomfortable the former is never quite free and active Let me call to remembrance the church my childhood knew with its capacious square pews in which half the audience turned their backs upon the minister the seats made to rise and fall for the convenience of standing and which closed every prayer with a clap of thunder its many aisles like streets and lanes the old men s seats and the queer but venerable figures that were seen in them some with black silk caps to protect their bald heads from the freezing draughts of air from the porchless doors the old women s seats on the opposite side the elevated row of pews round the sides of the church and the envied position of certain little children who had an extensive prospect through the open pew top within doors and a view of the hay scales and the town pump through the window besides Those windows in a double row with the gallery between how regularly I counted the small panes always forgetting the number to make the same weary task necessary every Sunday 
4358_20034_000004_000002	train-clean-360	The singing seats projecting from the central portion of the gallery furnished me with another hebdomadal study in large gilt letters of antique awkwardness which so impressed themselves on my mind that I see them now

4358_20034_000005_000000	train-clean-360	Opposite to the singing seats towered the pulpit from which the clergyman looked down upon us like a sparrow upon the house top 
none	none	He seemed in perpetual danger of being extinguished by a huge sounding board Very earnestly I used to gaze at the slender point by which it hung suspended and wished if it must come down that I might make the gilt ornament at the apex resembling a vase turned upside down my prize Under the pulpit was a closet which some one veraciously assured me was the place where the tithingman imprisoned incautiously playful urchins The terrors of that dark mysterious cell had little effect on my conduct however as I was not entirely convinced of the existence of any such lynx eyed functionary The largest church in the county it was however well filled many of the congregation coming five and some even six miles and remaining there through the noon intermission which on their account was made as short as possible 
4358_20034_000006_000001	train-clean-360	But in winter the vast airy space had a peculiar and searching chill 
none	none	No barn could be colder except that the numerous footstoves made some little change in the air during service 
4358_20034_000006_000003	train-clean-360	The minister stood upon a heated slab of soap stone 
none	none	I used to watch this in its progress up the broad aisle and the pulpit stairs under the arm of the boy from the parsonage and the irreverent way in which he made his descent in view of the assembly after depositing his burden was thus rebuked by an old lady who was always droll and quaint Why Matthew when you come down the pulpit stairs of a Sunday you throw up your heels like a horse coming out of a stable door Older grew the church and colder and if people then staid at home on Sunday afternoons they had a better excuse for doing so than their successors can muster 
4358_20034_000007_000001	train-clean-360	The chorister even was frequently among the missing but was charitably supposed to be subject to the ague Efforts were made to prevail upon the elderly part of the parish to permit the introduction of stoves with long funnels 
none	none	They scorned the enervating luxury 
4358_20034_000007_000003	train-clean-360	Their fathers had worshipped in the cold and their sons might 
none	none	But ah how degenerate were the descendants of the noble old Puritan church goers The services curtailed to half their proper length yet finding the patience of the listeners all too short The degenerate descendants carried the day however the most bigoted of their opposers becoming disabled by rheumatism The old sexton resignation to inevitable evils being a lesson he had had much opportunity to learn submitted with a good grace though very much of opinion that fires in a church were an absurdity and a waste 
4358_20034_000007_000008	train-clean-360	The stoves were provided and an uncommonly full attendance the next Sabbath showed the very general interest the matter had excited 
4358_20034_000007_000009	train-clean-360	How would it seem 
4358_20034_000007_000010	train-clean-360	Would any one faint 
none	none	There was by no means a superabundance of heat there was something wrong but the lack of warmth was a hundred fold made up in smoke 
4358_20034_000008_000001	train-clean-360	No one could see across the church and the minister loomed up as if in a dense fog all eyes were fountains of tears 
none	none	At last the old sexton went with a slow and subdued step up to the pulpit and wiping his eyes respectfully inquired in a whisper whether there was not a little too much smoke This suggestion being very smilingly assented to he proceeded to extinguish the fires and for that day the services were not indebted to artificial warmth to promote their effect How sad are improvements in places to which our childish recollections cling The gushing fulness of unchilled love is lavished even on inanimate and senseless things in a happy childhood How was my heart grieved when the old fashioned meeting house was converted into the modern temple Time and decay had rendered the tall spire unsafe yet its fall by force and premeditated purpose seemed a sacrilege I felt affronted for the huge weathercock reclining sulkily against a fence no more to point his beak to the east with obstinate preference I mourned over the broad old fashioned dial on which young eyes could discern the time a mile off The old sexton lived to see this change and at the end of half a century of care under that venerable roof he went to his rest The beloved minister and many many who sat with trustful and devoted hearts under his teachings are gone to their reward A board from the old pulpit a piece of the red damask curtain and the long wished for gold vase are now in my possession SOMETHING THAN BEAUTY DEARER You ask me if her eyes are fair And touched with heaven s own blue And if I can her cheek compare To the blush rose s hue Her clear eye sheds a constant gleam Of truth and purest love And wit and reason from it beam Like the light of the stars above Good humor mirth and fancy throng The dimples of her cheek And to condemn the oppressor s wrong Her indignant blush doth speak You ask me if her form is light And graceful as the fawn You ask me if her tresses bright Are like the golden dawn Her step is light on an errand of love Scarce doth she touch the earth And in graceful kindness doth she move Around her father s hearth And when to bless his child he bends His comfort and delight The silver with her dark hair blends Like a crown of holy light A TALE FOUND IN THE REPOSITORIES OF THE ABBOTS OF THE MIDDLE AGES Swept from his saddle by a low branch Count Robert lay stunned upon the ground The hunting party swept on the riderless steed galloping wildly among them No man turned back not one loved the Count better than his sport There came to the spot a man in a woodman s garb yet of a knightly and noble aspect He bent over the fallen man and bathed his temples turning back the heavy clustering locks The Count opening his eyes gazed on him at first without surprise he thought himself at home however he came there so familiar was the face Then did the woodman embrace him with tears crying My brother O my brother it is I it is Richard Thou in England cried the Count Art thou mad And he frowned gloomily Fear not for me replied the exile tenderly raising the Count from the ground A narrow path wound through the wood to a ruined hermitage The outlaw here prepared a bed of leaves for the Count laid him softly thereon and went to seek some refreshment His loved brother might revive and yet smile kindly on the playmate of his youth though under a ban When Richard returned there followed him like a dog a horse of the North country breed shaggy and in size not much greater than a stag hound Robert viewed him with surprise and it seemed with derision Despise not him who is able to bear thee out of the wood said Richard Thou art faint here is wine and of no mean vintage Robert drank from the earthen bottle and his eye grew brighter yet looked it not the more lovingly on Richard He ate right gladly of the store of the landless and penniless dried venison and oaten bread and was refreshed yet thanked him not Richard gave fragments to the neighing steed He ate no morsel himself nor tasted the wine His heart was full to bursting Tell me of home of of our father he said at last with deep strong sobs On the morrow on the morrow said Robert disposing himself for sleep Thou wilt hear soon enough But Richard seized him wildly by the shoulder and bade him tell the worst Nay then if thou wilt know he is dead I thy younger brother am now thy superior For that I care not As well thou as I to sit in my father s seat But oh left he no blessing for me Did he not at the last believe me the victim of calumny Alas No word Not one dying thought of Richard He died suddenly Richard wept long and bitterly and when with faltering tongue he asked tidings of his betrothed his face was covered he saw not the guilty flush upon his brother s brow for that he had spread a lying report of the exile s death Would Bertha still brave the king s displeasure Was she yet true to the unfortunate Bertha is a very woman She hath forgotten the absent lover and chosen another and a better man Who who hath supplanted me cried Richard fiercely and springing upon his feet I tell thee not lest thou wreak on him thy spite against thy faithless fair Know that Bertha s choice though a traitor is safe from me even were I as I was a man to meet a knight on equal terms His generous heart could not dream of fraternal treachery And when his rival saw this and that he suspected him not as yet he smiled to himself turned his face to the wall and closed his eyes if so be he might cut off further question Soon falling into slumber he clenched his hands and ground his teeth The sleep of a traitor is ever haunted by uneasy dreams and dark shadows of coming doom fell upon his spirit Richard watched till dawn Sometimes he started up to walk to and fro beating his bosom and wringing his hands in agony Anon he threw himself prostrate in the stupor of despair At the first carol of birds in the forest sleep surprised his weary senses and the peace of the innocent settled upon his features Side by side lay the brothers alike in form alike even in feature But in heart they bore no mark of the resemblance of kindred Envy of the elder born early possessed the soul of Robert like a base fiend first had it driven thence love and lastly honor Does no one seek for the absent lord of the castle while the weary hunters return to be his guests Keeps no one anxious vigil the live long night The unloving is not loved But he hath a king beneath his roof a king and lords of high degree sit at the morning board and shall none but vassals be hospitably proud and busy Ladies of rank were there and among them pale and silent sat Bertha looking on the king it seemed with an upbraiding eye An angry gloom sat upon his grimly compressed lips and sadness was upon his brow for kingly power was naught since remorse could not undo a wrong done to one who no longer lived and vengeance could not reach its absent object Richard s innocence had come to light and Robert albeit he knew it not was now the dishonored outlaw Ere the clock of the distant minster rung the hour of ten the royal cavalcade wound from the gates of the castle At the same hour Count Robert awoke and saw that the sun was already very high It shone upon the calm face of Richard tempered with quivering shadows from the leafy canopy above Up brother Richard cried the Count thou wast ever a sluggard And Richard at his bidding filled his hunting pouch with provisions for the way and went before leading the little Northern nag which the Count bestrode He bore himself bravely under the weight of a rider whose feet nearly grazed the turf on each side Slowly they wound through the tangled wood Stay I will lighten thy burden for thee said Robert if thou hast not left the bottle behind Here s to the fair Bertha What thou wilt not drink Then thou hast resigned her she is not worth a thought Thou wilt not peril thy life to see her again the false one who careth not for thee Now depart and when the king s wrath is overpast I will beseech him for thee Leave thy cause in a brother s hands But Richard went not back though when they came to the edge of the wood they beheld the king s train advancing in the broad highway Fly Richard escape while thou mayest cried Robert yet offered he not the horse for the greater speed Found on English ground thou diest a felon s death Disgrace not thy family Carest thou not for life he cried pursuing Richard who stinted not nor stayed at the sight of the king but the rather hasted forward What is life to me said Richard Let the king do with me as he will He strode onward proudly with folded arms offering himself to the view of Edward who as yet saw him not or only as a forester Halt at least that I may spur on and implore for thee said Robert for he hoped that he might deliver him a prisoner to some one in attendance that he should not come to speech of the king With this wily purpose he galloped forward A shout arose The traitor The traitor He was made prisoner by no gentle hands and at a nod from the king found himself led away to the rear but not far removed He looked about for Richard Could he not yet wave him back Should the king see that noble face he must be moved to mercy at least so far as to give him audience The brothers know not yet that all is reversed Robert sees a man in russet clothing kneel at the king s stirrup he sees the royal hand extended to raise him he sees many press forward eager to welcome the wanderer He turns away sick at the sight One look more Bertha has thrown herself into the arms of his hated brother He tears his beard he curses his own natal day and the stars that presided over his birth and destiny Yet must he look once more though to an envious soul the sight of a brother s happiness is like the torment of purgatorial fire Richard is standing with his hand extended towards him He is pleading the cause of the mean and cowardly enemy who betrayed him He pities and forgives him he even loves him still for is he not his brother As the eyes of the king and of all the surrounding crowd are turned on him burning shame subdues the warring passions that fill the heart of Robert and a faint emotion of gratitude brings a tear to fall upon his hot cheek Something of old childish love awakes in his bosom like dew in a dry land The king granted Richard s prayer the more readily because his anger was smothered by contempt The title and inheritance returned to the heir who was worthy his ancient name Robert to the day of his death lived on his brother s bounty harmless the rather that the king s decree had gone forth that in no case should he be Richard s successor or inherit aught from him NOTE Here ends the tale but by patient research we have discovered one verse of an ancient ballad supposed to have the same tradition for its subject It is preserved in a curious collection of fragmentary poetry to be found in most private libraries and in its more ancient and valuable editions in the repositories of antiquaries It stands in the modern copy which we possess as follows Richard and Robert were two pretty men Both laid abed till the clock struck ten Up jumps Robert and looks at the sky Oho brother Richard the sun s very high You go before with the bottle and bag And I ll come behind on little Jack nag THE SEA We sent him to school we set him to learn a trade we sent him far back into the country but it was of no use he must go to sea THE GRANDMOTHER S STORY A child was ever haunted by a thought of mystery Of the dark shoreless desolate heaving and moaning sea Which round about the cold still earth goes drifting to and fro As a mother holding her dead child swayeth herself with woe In all the jar and bustle and hurrying of trade Through the hoarse distracting din by rattling pavements made There sounded ever in his ear a low and solemn moan And his soul grew sick with listening to that deep undertone He wandered from the busy streets he wandered far away To where the dim old forest stands and in its shadows lay And listened to the song it sang but its murmurs seemed to be The whispered echo of the sad sweet warbling of the sea His soul grew sick with longing and shadowy and dim Seemed all the beauty of the land and all its joys to him Its mountains vast its forests old He only longed to be Away upon the measureless unfathomed restless sea Thither he went The foam capped waves yet beat upon the strand With a low and solemn murmuring that none may understand And he lieth drifting to and fro amid the ocean s roar With the drifting tide he loved to hear but shall hear never more And thus we all are haunted there soundeth in our ear A low and restless moaning that we struggle not to hear Yet still it soundeth the faint cry of the dark deeps of the soul Dark barren restless as the sea which doth for ever roll Hither and thither bearing still some half shaped form of good The flickering shadow of the moon upon the moon led flood And ever mid all the joys and weary cares of life Through the dull sleep of sluggishness and clangor of the strife We hear the low deep murmuring of that Infinity Which stretcheth round us dim and vast as wraps the earth the sea And in the twilight dimness in silence and alone The soul is almost startled by the power of its solemn tone When we view the fairest works of Nature and of Art They ever fill with longings never satisfy the heart But like the lines of weed and shells that stretch along the beach And show how far the flowing tide and the high waters reach They seem like barriers to hold back like weedy lines to show How far into this busy world the waves of beauty flow Yet when sweet strains of music rise about us float and play We almost dream these barriers of sense are broken away And that the beauty bound before is floating round us free As the bright glancing waters of the ever playing sea And for a little moment the spirit seems to stand With naked wave washed feet almost upon the strand But when she stoops to reach the wave the waters glide away And whisper in an unknown tongue she hears not what they say FASHION Why is it that the introduction of a really graceful fashion is generally met with ridicule and opposition while ugly modes are adopted with grave acquiescence and reverent submission Seest thou not what a deformed thief this Fashion is I know that Deformed he goes up and down like a gentleman Yes we all know Deformed When any of his family come to us from England or France or any foreign country we recognize the hideous brotherhood and extend our welcoming hands but Graceful must stay with us a long time to be greeted kindly and her sisters from foreign parts are coldly looked upon or dismissed at once To begin at the top the very head and front of the offending A gentleman goes into a fashionable hatter s and the shopman holding up for admiration a hat with a crown a foot high of the genuine stove pipe form and a brim an inch wide says This is the newest style Sir The gentleman walks home with the ugly thing on his head but no one stares or laughs Tis a new fashion but all take it easy A year later perhaps the hatter shows him a thing with a brim a half an inch wider but rolled up at the sides and a crown of a much greater diameter at the top than where it joins the brim a specimen of the bell crown This is solemnly donned and the wearer has the pleasure of knowing that the head gear of all his friends is as hideous as his own The inverted cone is worn with a sweet Malvolio smile And so Deformed has ruled the head of man for as many years as any of us can number only ringing the changes from one year to another upon the three degrees of comparison of the word ugly But a change takes place a light graceful low crowned hat with a brim wide enough for shelter or for shade begins to appear as a fashion and how is it received The clergyman thinks it would be very unclerical for him to wear it though it may be as black and is as modest as the rest of his apparel The young doctor timidly tries it on and in his first walk meets the wealthy hypochondriac his favorite patient and the one who is trying to introduce him to practice who seriously advises him as a friend not to wear that new fangled thing if the poor hat had only been ugly there would have been nothing bad in its new fangled quality as all his respectable patients will leave him if he dresses so like a fool The young lawyer gets one because he heard an old lady speak of those impudent looking hats and he is in hopes that impudence which he understands is all important in his profession and which he is conscious of not possessing may come with the hat A lady goes out with her son who is just old enough to have gained a coat and is looking for his first hat The mother has taste and judgment and the youth has yet some unperverted affinity with graceful forms left and so they choose and buy one of these comfortable and elegant chapeaux Just before they reach home they meet one of their best friends a person whom the lady regards most kindly and the young man admires and respects and he greets him with Why Tom have you got one of those rowdy hats And so the stiff stove pipe monstrosity keeps its place and the only pleasant sensible graceful becoming hat that the nineteenth century has known is called all sorts of bad names and quiet gentlemen are afraid to wear it Has it not been the fate of the shawl too the most simple and elegant wrapper and comfortable withal that a man can throw around him to be scouted and flouted Yes Deformed Come on next winter with a white surtout in your hand that must fit so tightly that your victims can but just screw themselves into it with a stiff square collar touching the ears and seven capes one over the other small by degrees and beautifully less and all respectable gentlemen will accept it and virtuously frown down as dandies or rowdies those who will not sacrifice their shawls to the ugly idol A GROWL I know it is generally considered decidedly boorish to utter complaints against the ladies But I am for the present a bachelor and in that capacity claim freedom of speech as my peculiar privilege In virtue of my unhappy position then I proceed to utter the first of a series of savage growls wishing the ladies to understand me as fully in earnest in this that when I growl loud I must be supposed to mean what I growl For a month past single gentlemen of every description have suffered in common with other fancy stocks and have remained hopelessly below par Those nice trim poetical and polite young beaux who when no great undertaking agitates the female mind are treated with kindness and sometimes with distinction by young ladies of discretion are now as it were ruthlessly thrust and bolted out of the pale of feminine society by an awful demon who reigns supreme the Genius of Dress making The other evening I pulled sixteen different bell handles in a gentlemanly manner without obtaining admission into any house for the purpose of making a call and when I succeeded in making an entrance at the seventeenth door by falsely representing myself as the agent of a dry goods dealer with a large box of patterns under my arm I found the ladies in close conference with three dress makers studying a fashion plate with an assiduity worthy of a better cause A friend of mine who has hitherto enjoyed the privilege of dining every day with six ladies and has derived from their society great pleasure and profit informed me yesterday with a tear in each eye that he had left the house for ever the conversation being always turned upon topics with which he is utterly unacquainted and conducted in a language which is about as intelligible to him as the most abstruse Japanese or the most classic Law Latin If we are so fortunate as to obtain by any stratagem admission to hall or anteroom in the mansions of our fair friends our olfactories are regaled with a fragrance which we instinctively associate with tailors shops and which I am informed does in fact arise from the contact of woollen substances with hot flat irons As we advance our ears are greeted by the resounding clash of scissors Entering upon the field of action our eyes are dazzled by a thousand fragments of rich and brilliant hues and our personal safety endangered by swiftly flying needles and unsuspected pins Gossip is at an end for the thread must be continually bitten off Dancing is child s play a folly of the past The piano is converted into a table or an ironing board No games can be suggested but Thread my needle and Thimble rig No books are at hand but Harper with the fashion plate at the end the newspapers of the day are cut into uncouth shapes and conversation when conducted in English hangs the unsuccessful Bloomer reform upon the gibbet of ridicule Now if we would prevent utter disunion in society something like a compromise must be effected and to the ladies belongs the laboring oar I use a metaphor which implies that they must do something they are little accustomed to do they must make some concession We have done all we could do and I will make one statement which will convince the world that we bachelors are not obstinate without good reason I confess though it is not without some slight degree of shame that I own it that I have during the last week consumed the greater part of every day in ineffectual study trying to perfect myself in the terminology of the science of Fashion I have listened attentively and have gathered into a retentive memory sundry technicalities but in vain have I submitted these terms of a strange dialect to the strictest etymological research In vain have I conversed upon this subject with the most intelligent dry goods dealers In learning the few idiomatic phrases they employ I have experienced only the satisfaction which young students in Greek literature feel when they have with infinite labor mastered the alphabet of that rich and copious language But there is hope Experience tells us this state of things cannot last for ever A few weeks and our sufferings shall be rewarded our forbearance repaid Then shall gay streamers pendent from rejuvenated bonnets float as of yore across our promenades and on the shoulders of Earth s fairest daughters the variegated mantle be again displayed The streets now deserted by the fair will ere long glitter with the brilliant throng and our sidewalks be swept once more by the gracefully flowing silk Taper fingers shall condescendingly be extended to us the smile of beauty beam on us and witty speech banish our resentful remembrance of incomprehensible jargon TO JENNY LIND ON HEARING HER SING THE ARIA ON MIGHTY PENS FROM THE CREATION When Haydn first conceived that air divine The voice that thrilled his inward ear was thine The Lark that even now to heaven s gate springs And near the sky her earth born carol sings Poured on his ear a higher purer note And heavenly rapture seemed to swell her throat To him from groves of Paradise the Dove Breathed Eden s innocence and Eden s love And seraph taught seemed the enchanting lay The Nightingale poured forth at close of day For yet nor sin nor sorrow had its birth To touch as now the sweetest sounds of earth Yes as upon his inner sense was borne The melody of that primeval morn And all his soul was music O to him The voice of Nature was an angel s hymn But was there then one human voice that brought Unto his outward ear his own rapt thought In tones interpreting in worthy guise The varied notes of Eden s melodies O happier we for unto us tis given To hear through thee the strains he caught from heaven December one eighteen fifty one MY HERBARIUM Poor dry musty flowers Who would believe you ever danced in the wind drank in the evening dews and spread sweet fragrance on the air A touch now breaks your brittle leaves Your odors are like attic herbs or green tea or mouldy books Your forms are bent and flattened into every ugly and distorted shape Your lovely colors are faded white changed to black yellow to dirty white gorgeous scarlet to brick color purple to muddy brown Poor things Who drew you from your native woods and brooks to press you flat and dry your moisture up and paste you down helplessly upon your backs such mocking shadows of your former grace and beauty Ah sorrowfully do I confess it It was I In my early years I searched the woods and meadows scaled rocks forded bogs and scrutinized each shady thicket with murderous intent I bore my drooping victims home and sacrificed them relentlessly to science With my own hand I turned the screw that crushed out all that was lovely and graceful and delicate about them How I wearied myself over that flower press How anxiously I watched over the stiff stalks and shrivelled leaves all that was left How perseveringly I changed and dried the papers jammed my fingers between the heavy boards and blistered my hands with that obstinate screw And how cordially I hated it all I liked the fun of gathering the flowers the triumph of finding new specimens and the excitement of hazardous scrambles but as for the rest it was drudgery which I went through only from a stern sense of duty Now thanks to the busy little fingers that passed over these leaves I have a fund of amusement laid up for me for every page has its story and each mutilated flower is the centre of a beautiful picture Here the ludicrous and the pathetic are so exquisitely blended that I laugh with a regretful feeling at my heart and sigh even when smiles are on my face The first few pages are light and joyous full of a child s warm impulses and ready zeal and enlivened here and there by some roguish caprice That was the time when in my simplicity I loved dandelions and buttercups and could see beauty even in the common white weed of the fields Ah here they are arranged in whimsical positions Clover and Sorrel Violets and Blue eyed Grass Peppergrass and Dock O how hard that was to press Mouse Ear and Yarrow Shepherd s Purse Buttercups and full blown Dandelion Succory and Chickweed and Gill run over the ground with their homeliest names written in sprawling characters all down hill beneath them I did not aspire to botanical names in those days I thought nothing was unfit for my new Herbarium Such was my zeal that I believe I should have filled it entirely in a few days if I had not been counselled to make a judicious selection I had a faculty for bringing home plants impossible to press and insisting upon making the experiment I slept for a week with my bed post tilted up on a huge book wherein reposed a water lily obstinately refusing to lie flat All kinds of woody plants too were my delight though they invariably came out of the press as they went in except that the leaves were in every variety of unnatural position I never grew weary either of gathering stately and graceful green ferns and finding them all cockled up as the phrase went when I got home I believe I made some experiments on a horsechestnut blossom once but as it is not to be found in my Herbarium I am inclined to think they were unsuccessful How happy children are with any new possession I thought there never was any thing quite equal to my new book All the girls had them with neat marbled covers and white paper within and each one was determined to make hers the best of the whole When pasting day came there was an intense excitement We all daubed our little fingers to our heart s content and our faces too as to that I remember perfectly the sensation of smiling after the paste stiffened We spattered our desks and pasted the wrong side of the flowers and stuck the leaves together and got every thing a little one sided and in short became so worried and heated and vexed that we did not hunt for any more flowers for a long time after the first pasting day In the mean while my ideas had undergone a change I had become much more ambitious A hew page brings flowers of a higher order and beneath them besides the common name appears a sounding botanical title ay still more the class and order are written in full Poor things How many of your species must have been pulled to pieces by inexperienced hands to ascertain the exact number of stamens and their relative positions I feel now a tenderness for the shrinking delicate wild flowers that makes me hesitate even to pick them from their shady retreats but then such was my ardor for investigation the more I loved them and the more beautiful they seemed the more eagerly I tore them to fragments Let the ingenious student analyze bits of brass wire and reduce to its simple elements as much gunpowder as he pleases but I raise my voice against this wanton destruction of rare and beautiful flowers No chemical process can ever restore them As I glance over this new page I see a merry troop of little girls crowding around their kind teacher trying to restrain their superabundant spirits and restless activity till they may give them free scope in the woods Passing up the street they are joined by fresh recruits who come dancing out of the houses with baskets and trowels and tin boxes and delightfully mysterious suppers packed away nicely to be eaten in the most romantic place that can be found provided there is no danger of snakes or ivy Where they are going I should find it impossible to say until I have consulted the new leaf just turned over Here side by side are the wild Columbine and the cheerful little Bethlehem Star They grew I remember upon Powder House Hill so named from the massive granite building upon its summit which we never dared to go near for fear of an explosion The hill was rough rocky barren and in some places quite steep In the clefts of the rocks generally far above our reach the bright red columbines stood in groups drooping their graceful heads Some of the rocks were worn to a perfect polish by the feet of daring sliders It was a dangerous pastime even to the most experienced A loss of balance a slight deviation from the beaten track a trip in a hollow or a momentary entanglement in your dress and you are lost I declined joining in the diversion ever after the first attempt which was nothing but a headlong plunge from top to bottom But though I heroically stood aloof while the girls were enjoying the sport and making the air ring with their laughter I was sure afterwards to come upon the slippery places unintentionally and take a slide whether I would or not I had I remember a most unfortunate propensity for climbing and scrambling choosing the worst paths and daring the others to follow my lead on precarious footholds It was unfortunate because I seldom came forth from these trials unscathed I was always tearing my dresses in clambering over fences or bumping my head in creeping under Where others cleared brooks with a light spring I landed in the middle I was sure to pick out spongy oozy slippery grass to stand upon in marshy land or was yet more likely to slump through over shoes in black mud Banks always caved in beneath my feet unexpectedly Brambles seemed to enter into a conspiracy to lay violent hands on me and hidden boughs lay in wait to trip me up Moss and bark scaled off the trunks of fallen trees bearing me with it when I was least on my guard or the trunks themselves solid enough to all appearance crushed to powder beneath my unwary tread Even the stone walls deserted me I made use of one as a bridge one day to reach a golden cowslip that grew temptingly in a swamp but a treacherous stone rolled off with me and a perfect avalanche of huge rocks followed splashing the muddy water all over me as I sat helplessly buoyed up by the tall grass I regret to say I forgot the cowslip THE OSTRICH Of the wild and wayward Ostrich say have ye never heard Of the poor distracted lonely outcast and wandering bird Which is not a bird of heaven nor yet a beast of earth But ever roveth homeless a creature of strange birth Wings hath it but it flies not And yet within its breast Are strange and sleepless drivings so that it may not rest Half formed half conscious impulses with its half formed pinions given Too strong for rest on earth too weak to bear to heaven And madly it beats its wings but vainly against its side For the light wind rusheth through them mocking them in its pride Then distraught it hurries onward the gates of heaven shut Flying from what it knows not seeking it knows not what While in the parching desert amid the stones and sand Its stone like eggs are lying here and there on every hand It wanders on unheeding and with funereal gloom Trembles in every breeze each torn dishevelled plume And when with startled terror it sees its foes around It strives to rise above them but clingeth to the ground Then on it madly rusheth with idly fluttering wings The stones in showers behind it convulsively it flings Onward and ever onward the fleetest horses tire But its strength grows less and less their tramping ever nigher The poor distracted thing it feels its lonely birth It may not rise to heaven so it cometh to the earth To the earth as to a mother since to the earth it must Its head in her bosom nestled its eye veiled with her dust But she will not receive it From earth and heaven outcast The Ostrich dies as it lived unfriended to the last Of the wild and wayward Ostrich say have ye never heard Of the poor distracted lonely outcast and wandering bird But not alone it wandereth My spirit stirs in me With a sort of half fraternal and drawing sympathy This lonely restless spirit that would rise from the heavy ground To the sky of light and love that stretcheth all around But with all its restless longings it too must earth bound stay And with wings half formed for soaring here hold its weary way Hungering for food of heaven feeding on dust and stone While about it lie unheeded as it hasteth on alone Its deeds of good or evil a fruitful mystery But it presseth on nor recketh what their event may be And when doubt and fear assail it it may not rise above To the glorious peaceful height of fear outcasting love But something draws it downward breathes of its lower birth Prompts it to seek a refuge in the blindness of the earth And it hides its head in earthliness at least it will not see The blow it cannot ward off and the foe it may not flee But something softly whispers that these wings shall grow to soar Heaven grant in the cloudless depths of love for evermore It whispers that again these blinded eyes shall see Heaven grant in their yearning gaze the long sought home may be It whispers each word and act shall to fruition spring Heaven grant they may joy to man and peace to the spirit bring Of the wild and wandering Ostrich say have ye never heard The type of the restless soul of man the weary wingless bird COWS 
3433-20043-0000	train-other-500	I admire cows in their proper places They are undoubtedly useful animals some may think them handsome and graceful this is as yet an unsettled question
none	none	 They certainly figure pretty extensively in all sketches of rural scenery and may therefore be considered as picturesque objects but I think that on canvas they take to themselves beauties which they do not possess in actual life 
3433-20043-0001	train-other-500	I do not object to see them at a distance quietly grazing in a meadow by the brink of a winding stream and all that sort of thing provided the distance is very great and a strong fence intervenes For
none	none	 I would have you know that I am a delicate young lady of nervous temperament and keen sensibilities 
3433-20043-0002	train-other-500	and have a mortal dread of cows I am not used to the customs of country life which place this animal on a level with domestic pets and when my brother asked me to pat the side of one of these great coarse brutes
3433-20043-0003	train-other-500	I screamed at the mere idea For I should be extremely unwilling to provoke one of them because I have been told that when heated with passion as these beasts often are it sometimes happens
3433-20043-0004	train-other-500	that the powder horns on top of their heads explode and spread ruin and desolation around People here bestow a vast deal too much consideration on these unpleasant animals
none	none	 for they are often seen that is those of them that are troubled with weak eyes walking along the streets with boards over their faces as a protection from the rays of the sun I don t believe that is the real reason of the thing though my brother assures me that it is I think myself that it is intended as a keen satire upon those young ladies 
3433-20043-0005	train-other-500	who wear veils in the streets but I never will yield my point I will wear my veil so long as I have a complexion worth protecting and so long as there are gentlemen worth cutting
3433-20043-0006	train-other-500	The Brighton Bridge Battery is a delightful promenade on a warm summer s day it is so shady but it is closed I may say every Wednesday and Thursday to accommodate these detestable pets of the public
3433-20043-0007	train-other-500	It seems as my brother informs me that the drovers from humane considerations are in the habit of driving their cattle over to Brighton when the weather is pleasant
3433-20043-0008	train-other-500	and back again on the next day in order that their health may be improved by the sea air which blows up Charles River Now I think that when the cow takes precedence of the lady and usurps to the utter exclusion of the latter
3433-20043-0009	train-other-500	the most delightful promenade in Cambridge
none	none	 it is time the city authorities should look to it 
3433-20043-0010	train-other-500	and so I told my brother He considered for a moment and then advised me not to bear it any longer but to go upon Brighton Bridge in spite of the cows and assert my independence I followed his advice as I always do
none	none	 and on one fine afternoon took advantage of the pleasant weather to indulge in a solitary walk in that direction As I was sauntering along on the wooden sidewalk gazing at the noble ships which lay moored by their gaff topsails to the abutments of the bridge 
3433-20043-0011	train-other-500	and viewing the honest sailors as they promenaded up and down the string ladders at the command of their captains my fears were aroused by a distant commotion I hastily turned and looked over the railing into the street
none	none	 A whole drove of infuriated cows 
3433-20043-0012	train-other-500	urged on by two fiendish boys and a savage dog was rapidly approaching me from the Cambridge side What should I do I was too much fatigued to run and I had never learned to swim My plans were hastily formed
none	none	 Flinging my red silk visite and sky blue parasolette into the water 
3433-20043-0013	train-other-500	lest the gay colors should still more enrage the wild animals I jumped over the outside railing towards the river and hung by one arm over the angry flood during a moment of speechless agony
3433-20043-0014	train-other-500	On they came with lightning speed in a whirlwind of dust A rapid succession of earthquakes bellowings groans and all was over I was safe
3433-20043-0015	train-other-500	On inspection of the footmarks I felt quite sure that some of them must have approached within ten yards of me
none	none	 and only two railings had intervened between me and their fury 
3433-20043-0016	train-other-500	An honest tar from one of the men of war employed in unloading coal at Willard s Wharf took the captain s gig
none	none	 and made for my parasol and visite as they floated away and returned them with the very unintelligible remark that I d better not clear the wreck next time unless it blew more of a breeze

none	none	 a vestal flame Love shall maintain thy ray THE FOURTH OF JULY It was the anniversary of our Glorious Fourth The evil genius who specially presides over the destinies of unoffending college boys put it into the heads of five of us to celebrate the day by an excursion by water to Nahant Beach The morning was delightful the cool summer air just freshening into a steady and favoring breeze the sun tempered in his ferocity by an occasional cloud above us the sea calm and pleasant and all that sort of thing you know just what you want on such occasions and we set sail from Braman s resolved to have a jolly good time I can t describe our passage down It was altogether too full of fun to be written on one sheet Suffice it to say we laughed and sang and joked and ate and drank t was when we were young and so on all the way and in fact I felt rather disappointed at arriving so soon as we did at our destined port Here new pleasures awaited us in the shape of acquaintances unexpected and unexpecting rides on the beach bowling and loafing in general much too rich to be described here and now But there is an end to all sport and ours came quite too soon The shadows had begun to lengthen considerably before we thought of starting on our return and certain ominous indications in the heavens above us warned us that as our passage homewards was not by land further delay was unadvisable Dolefully we set our sail and made for Boston Harbor We began to feel the reaction which always follows a season of extreme joviality and our spirits were down Our chief wit Tom B who had before kept us in a perpetual roar all the way sat moody and desponding and answered gruffly every question put to him speaking only when spoken to and then in monosyllables rarely used in polite circles Our other joker second only to Tom the above named having amused us during the whole day by long yarns spun out from a varied experience and a rich imagination betook himself to slumber and tried to dream that he was safe home again The rest of us performed our duties about the boat in gloomy silence looking occasionally with some anxiety at the clouds gathering slowly over our heads but keeping our opinions within our own breasts I had no apprehension of danger for nothing indicated a gale in fact the breeze was gradually deserting us All that was to be feared was a calm steady rain which visiting us at a distance of several miles from home and late at night promised any thing but an agreeable conclusion to our day s excursion At last it came First a heavy drop then a few more and then a regular straight old fashioned pour Our sail hung motionless and we seemed to stand still and take it Our companions were soon roused from their abstraction by the very unpleasant circumstances and we hastily took counsel together Unship the mast says Tom and over with your oars We obeyed our captain sulkily and soon were moving on again We pulled away for an hour or so drenched with the rain which seemed to come down faster than ever and were about as miserable and down cast a pack of wretches as ever lived for there is nothing like a good ducking to use the common expression to take the life and spirit out of a man not to mention the other discomforts that attended our situation Silently we rowed and not a sound was heard above the plashing of the rain upon the surface of the sea and the regular stroke of the oars It s very strange that we don t reach old Point Shirley says Tom who had been on the look out for this landmark during the last half hour Very strange said we and pulled away as before Thus passed another half hour in silent ceaseless occupation when from the mere force of habit I dipped my hand over the boat s gunwale with the hope of cooling my blistered palm in the salt water Judge of my surprise when I found my hand immersed in thick black mud By Jove fellows cried I we re floored There was no mistaking the fact we were aground At that instant the moon burst out from between the drifting clouds and as if in derision threw a streak of light over our melancholy position There we were high and dry on a bank of mud a scooped furrow on each side of us attesting the frantic efforts of our oarsmen to get a headway and a long wake ten feet in extent marking our distance from the sea behind us Such was our position as the moon revealed it to us We looked dolefully in one another s faces for three minutes then a grim smile gradually stole over Tom s expressive countenance as he slowly ejaculated Point Shirley it is when the ludicrous side of the matter seemed to occur to each of us simultaneously and we indulged ourselves with a roar of laughter the first since we had left Nahant Of course nothing could be done under the circumstances but we must wait patiently for the rising of the tide to float us off So we sat there in our wet garments until the dead of night when our boat gradually lifted herself off and we started again and finally arrived at Braman s early in the morning The moral of this tale may be summed up in a single word TEMPERANCE FROM THE PAPERS OF REGINALD RATCLIFFE esquire 
4930-20046-0000	train-other-500	In college I was the Illustrious Lazy In my professional studies and avocations I have been so hard driven in order to make up for four idle years
4930-20046-0001	train-other-500	that I am wasted almost to a shadow and fears are entertained that I shall wholly vanish into thin air My physician talks gravely about my having exhausted my nervous energy and sends me to Ratborough
4930-20046-0002	train-other-500	as the place of all others the most favorable for entire intellectual repose I am living with an old aunt Tabitha Flint who was wont to rock me
4930-20046-0003	train-other-500	and trot me and wash my face in my helpless infancy
none	none	 and can hardly yet be convinced that I have outgrown such endearing assiduities in the twenty five years that have intervened I let her pet me so far as I find it convenient and indeed farther because I feel grateful for the kind feelings of which I am the object There is another personage in the household who probably thinks that in the exuberant kindness of my aunt I have a full average of civility without the least interest on her part Do not for a moment imagine that I am piqued at her insulting indifference of manner towards a young man who 
4930-20046-0004	train-other-500	I beg you to believe is not wholly without claim to a glance of approbation now and then from a lady s eye You must not suppose I care at all about the matter But as I have not even a book
none	none	 allowed me to take up my thoughts my curiosity fixes itself strangely upon this silent sulky meditative little person who takes about as much notice of me as of the figure of Father Time over the clock 
4930-20046-0005	train-other-500	What can such a
none	none	 body have to think about the livelong day that is so absorbing that all one s bright thoughts and one s most whimsical sallies pass without notice Should I see her once move a muscle of her very plain doggedly inexpressive provokingly composed phiz I should jump up and cry Bo with surprise 
4930-20046-0006	train-other-500	She vanishes several hours at a time and I hear her humming to herself sometimes in one room sometimes in another
none	none	 I wish I knew how she amuses herself for I find self amusement the hardest drudgery I ever tried 
4930-20046-0007	train-other-500	I could stamp I am so impatient of doing nothing but lounge about I am as snappish as a chained cur as cross as a caged bear And while I gnaw my nails and stretch and yawn
none	none	 I hear that contented bee like murmur and now and then a light rapid step on the stairs 
4930-20046-0008	train-other-500	or about rooms which I do not frequent

4930-20046-0024	train-other-500	from that tedious companion my own self I never liked him very well I had rather do any thing than have a sober talk with a serious personage who always takes me to do for not making more of him He scolds me
4930-20046-0025	train-other-500	just as a stay at home wife lectures a gay husband who never returns to his better half when he finds any thing to amuse him abroad Good by old fellow I have found better company than your rememberings or hopings to wit

4930-20046-0026	train-other-500	I was exceedingly well amused making all the saucy speeches I could think of in the pure spirit of mischief and taking no notice of her tossing her pretty head and turning her back upon me Finding that her
none	none	 displeasure was not producing any particular effect upon 
4930-20046-0027	train-other-500	the object of it I imagine the indignant beauty begins to plot a different revenge on me Ha ha Miss Flora It is not because you like me better than you did that you are
4930-20046-0028	train-other-500	all smiles and grace and sunshine I shall not flatter you the more I am determined I am on my guard You shall never boast of me on your list of obsequious admirers

none	none	 after wasting so much on my aunt who cannot and Miss Etty who will not understand I am glad to have a chance to speak and to hear a human voice in answer

none	none	 and not for the better always Her singing Aunt Tabitha well describes

none	none	 We will have another lesson to morrow I thought though there was a shadow over her face when I called it practising Etty s eyes met mine at the moment a rare occurrence What was her thought One cannot read in her immovable face 
4930-20046-0038	train-other-500	Evening I am booked for a horseback ride with Little Handsome to morrow morning How did she make me offer I did not mean to All country girls ride I believe
4930-20046-0039	train-other-500	I often see Miss Etty cantering through the shady lanes all by herself I saw the bars down at the end of the track through the wood one day I immediately concluded that Little Ugly had paced off that way that I need not see her from my window
none	none	 I put the bars up again and lay in wait behind the bushes Soon I heard her approaching 
4930-20046-0040	train-other-500	I come forward as she comes near on that rat like pony of hers who holds his head down as if searching for something lost in the road I stand in doubt whether to laugh at her predicament
4930-20046-0041	train-other-500	or advance in a gentlemanly manner to remove the obstacle I had put in her way
none	none	 When lo the absurd little nag clears it at a bound and skims away over the green track like a swallow till he vanishes under the leafy arch I am left in a very foolish attitude with mouth and eyes wide open 
4930-20046-0042	train-other-500	Now this independent young lady shall be at liberty to take care of herself with no officious interference of mine
none	none	 I will not invite her to join us to morrow morning as I intended I wonder if any horses are to be procured that are not rats 
4930-20046-0043	train-other-500	I hope Miss Flora knows enough to mount her pony for I am sure I do not know how to help her Whew I hope we shall meet with no disasters
none	none	 I feel certain Little Handsome would scream like a sea gull pull the wrong rein 
4930-20046-0044	train-other-500	tangle her foot in the stirrup or riding skirt faint fall break her neck O horrors Will not the dear old Aunt Tabitha forbid her going What a well proportioned and ladylike figure it was
4930-20046-0045	train-other-500	now I think of it How gracefully she sat upon her flying Dobbin
none	none	 Sept twenty fifth Rainy Glad of it Breakfast late Miss Etty did not appear having been up some hours I imagine What for I wonder What can she be about One thing pleases me in her 
4930-20046-0046	train-other-500	If Aunt Tabitha wants any little attention a needle threaded or a dropped stitch taken up Miss Etty quietly comes to her aid It is so entirely a matter of course
4930-20046-0047	train-other-500	the old lady only smiles but any service from Flora calls forth an acknowledgment it being a particular effort of good nature and generally the fruit of a direct appeal Miss Etty talks more than she did too
4930-20046-0048	train-other-500	While I am talking nonsense with Little Handsome
none	none	 I hear her amusing my good aunty and I catch a few words 
4930-20046-0049	train-other-500	her utterance having a peculiar distinctness and the lowest tones being fine and clear like those of a good singer on a
none	none	 pianissimo strain It is a peculiarly ladylike articulation 
4930-20046-0050	train-other-500	was she born and bred in Ratborough I wonder She never speaks while we are singing Does she like music then
none	none	 I asked her once but what sort of answer is Yes to 
4930-20046-0051	train-other-500	such a question And that is all I elicited Music again the forenoon occupation Miss Flora does not like being criticized I find
4930-20046-0052	train-other-500	One must not presume to set her right in the smallest particular Singers are proverbially irritable
none	none	 I am not certain I could belong to a glee club and never get 
4930-20046-0053	train-other-500	cross or unreasonable I hate to be corrected but I hate more to be incorrect I could give Canary a hint or two now and then that would be serviceable if she would permit it
4930-20046-0054	train-other-500	I have no right however to take it upon me to instruct her and it puts her in a pet
none	none	 She laughed it off but I saw the mounting color and the flashing glance I am an impudent fellow I suppose Honest to boot I think she need not take offence at what was intended as a friendly help I am no flatterer at least Really 
4930-20046-0055	train-other-500	I am hurt that I might not take so trifling a liberty in behalf of my favorite song I ll walk off as often as she sings it Can her temper be perfectly good And yet one could not expect I ought not to be surprised
4930-20046-0056	train-other-500	Yet I can t help thinking suppose just suppose I had a right to find fault suppose I were a near friend would she bear it then Supposing she were my companion for life Humph
4930-20046-0057	train-other-500	that startles one was I near thinking of it in earnest She is beautiful I should be proud of her abroad But at home at home where there should
4930-20046-0058	train-other-500	be confidence would there not be constraint Must no improvement ever be suggested because it implies imperfection I hope none of my friends will ever be on such terms with me
none	none	 if I am touchy like a nettle may they grasp me hard and fear me not Sept twenty sixth This little sheet of water in front of the house has the greatest variety of aspects 
4930-20046-0060	train-other-500	its face is like a human face full of varying expressions A slight haze made it so beautiful just before sunset I took my chair and put it out of the window upon the grass then followed it
4930-20046-0061	train-other-500	and sat with it tipped back against the house close by the window of one of those mysterious rooms where Miss Etty immures herself I heard the Canary say in a scolding tone I should think you might oblige me
4930-20046-0062	train-other-500	it is such a trifle to do it is not worth refusing
none	none	 Why should you care for him No answer though I confess my ears were erected to the sharpest attitude of listening 
4930-20046-0063	train-other-500	I was wholly oblivious of myself or I should have taken myself away as in honor bound Won t you now Etty I ll only ask for one of our old duets just one No Flora
4930-20046-0064	train-other-500	said Little Ugly coldly enough Why not No answer To be sure he might hear He would find out that you are musical What of that
4930-20046-0065	train-other-500	Where is the use of being able to sing to sing only when there s nobody to listen I sing only to friends I cannot sing I have never sung to persons in whom I have no confidence Afraid
none	none	 What a little goose Not afraid exactly I don t comprehend I am sure I do not expect you should I never did understand you 
4930-20046-0066	train-other-500	You never will Silence again Flora tuned up and of all tunes she must needs hum my song
none	none	 I was on my feet in a moment to depart when I heard the clear tones of Etty s voice again and stood still 
4930-20046-0067	train-other-500	with one foot advanced Flora you should sharp that third note in the last line Flora murdered it again with the most atrocious cold blooded cruelty
4930-20046-0068	train-other-500	I almost mocked the sound aloud in my passion I do not tell you to vex you only I saw that mister Ratcliffe You need not trouble yourself about his opinion
none	none	 I knew you would not like it 
4930-20046-0069	train-other-500	if I told you of a mistake But I supposed you would rectify it and I should have done you a kindness even against your will
none	none	 And I to hate you for it eh 
4930-20046-0070	train-other-500	If you can Indeed I cannot Etty for you are my very best friend But you are a horrid truth telling formidable body Why not let me sing on my own way
4930-20046-0071	train-other-500	I don t thank you a bit I had rather sing it wrong than be corrected It hurts my pride I think people should take my music as they find it If
4930-20046-0072	train-other-500	it does not please them they are not obliged to ask me to sing One note wrong can surely be put up with if the rest is worth hearing I shall continue to sing it as I have done I think No
4930-20046-0073	train-other-500	please don t If I will mend it when I think of it will you sing a duet Yes though it will cost me more than you know Poh And Flora sang the song
4930-20046-0074	train-other-500	without accompaniment The desired sharp rung upon my ears and set my nerves at rest Bravo Encore I cried beneath the window and was pelted
4930-20046-0075	train-other-500	with peach stones I wonder
none	none	 when this duet is to come off Sept twenty seventh Have not stirred from the house But I have not heard any voice but Flora s She has been uncommonly amiable and fascinating and I am I not rather bewitched I cannot keep my resolution of not being flirted with I cannot be wise and reserved and indifferent Am I trifling Or am I in earnest Indeed I don t know I only know I am constantly at the side of Little Handsome without knowing how I came there She makes me sing with her ride with her walk with her at her will and as if that was not enough for one day to test her power over me to night she made me dance with her And now I feel like a fool as I think of Etty playing a waltz for us at Flora s request and giving me a long serious look as I approached the piano to compliment her playing I could not utter a word I answered her gaze with one as sober and more sad and came away to my room to have some talk with my real self Now for it Says I to Myself A truce to your upbraidings you old scold tell me at once how you find yourself affected towards this charming little Flora Says Myself There are no tastes in common between her and me Says I quickly Music and triumphed a moment or two But the snarling old fellow asked whether I liked her singing or her flattery For his part he thought we both liked to hear our own voices and agreed in nothing else Taste indeed when I would not let her sing a song I cared a fillip for In short my self communion ended in some very sage resolutions I feared the beautiful head with the shining curls was somewhat vacant And the heart was that empty likewise Or was that hidden cell the home of all the loveliest affections the firmest and purest faith and motive every thing that should be there to rule the life and my picture on the wall A question this Does she love me O yes answered vanity O no said good sense not at all If your picture is in her heart it is one of a whole gallery Don t be a fop It is not your character Don t let Flora make a fool of you And I resolved Sept twenty seventh A very dull day You are as sober as a judge said Flora at breakfast I caught Etty s eye but it said nothing Aunt Tabitha who yesterday evidently thought me in desperate case and once inquired about my income very significantly now suspected a quarrel between Flora and me I was embarrassed and overturned the cream No great loss said Etty seeing that I was chagrined As easy made up as a lovers quarrel said Aunt Tabitha Silly old woman No silly young fellow Flora has revenged herself on me as she meant to do for defying her power She has turned my head made me act like a simpleton But Richard s himself again and wiser than he was P M I endeavored to talk more with Miss Etty that the change in my manner might be less observed It was all natural that I should be as grave as a judge when I addressed myself to so quiet a member of society She seemed to divine my object and sustained the dialogue I never knew her to do it before It is not diffidence it seems that has been the cause of this reserve I was the more diffident of the two failing to express my thoughts well from a hurry and uncertainty of mind which I am not often troubled withal It was partly astonishment in truth that confused me Little Ugly and I actually exchanging ideas I shall call her Little Ugly still however for I could not make her look at me as she spoke nor answer my wit by a change of countenance Sept twenty eighth Little Handsome cannot be convinced that the flirtation is over absolutely at an end She alternately rails at my capricious solemnity and pretends to be grieved at it I can see that nothing but my avoidance of a tete a tete is my safety Should the sentimental tone prevail and tears come into those beautiful eyes I am a gone man At my earnest request I have grown humble or bold enough to ask a favor Miss Etty has brought or rather dragged her work basket into the parlor A great basket it is so great that I imagine in her own apartment she gets into the middle of it bodily I sat down to watch the motions of her adroit little digits in darning stockings and mending homely garments I imagined rather than saw a humorous gleam in her eye as I did so and there was certainly a slight contraction of her mouth in length as if to counteract an inclination of the muscles to move in the opposite direction Flora fluttered about the room like a bright hued butterfly pausing a moment at a window or a bookcase or resting awhile to play a few capricious notes on the piano and sometimes coming to view Miss Etty s employment as if it were a branch of industry she was unacquainted with and curious about The maples are turning red already The setting sun threw a glorious light through their tinted foliage and the still bosom of the lake reflected it in a softened changeable hue of mingled crimson and silver Flora was standing at the door I somehow found myself there also but I talked over my shoulder to Aunt Tabitha about potatoes I have a fancy for a walk round the pond said Flora After a pause she looked at me as much as to say Don t you see you monster it is too late for me to go alone Miss Flora I will second your wish if you can drum up a third party said I point blank Flora blushed and pouted for a moment then beckoned to Little Ugly who disobligingly suggested that the grass would be wet It so happened there was no dew and Flora convinced her of the fact by running in the grass and then presenting the sole of her shoe for her inspection Miss Etty her ill chosen objection being vanquished went for her bonnet and we set forth Miss Flora s arm in mine as a matter of course and Miss Etty s in hers save where the exigencies of the woodland path gave her an excuse to drop behind A little boat tied to a stump suggested to Flora a new whim Instead of going round the pond which I now began to like doing I must weary myself with rowing her across I was ready enough to do it however had not Miss Etty quietly observed that the pond was muddy and the boat unseaworthy Flora would not have yielded to twenty feet of water but mud She sighed and resumed my arm I offering the other to Miss Etty in so determined a way that she could not waive accepting it marched forward with spirits rising into high glee and loquacity Presently feeling a sudden irritation at the feather like lightness with which Little Ugly s fingers just touched my elbow as if she disdained any support from me I caught her hand and drew it through my arm and when I relinquished it pressed her arm to my side with mine thinking she would snatch it away and walk alone in offended dignity Whether she was too really dignified for that or took my rebuke as it was intended I know not but she leaned on my arm with somewhat greater confidence during the remainder of our walk and now and then even volunteered a remark Before we finished the circumambulation of the pond she had quite forgotten her sulky reserve and talked with much earnestness and animation Flora subsiding into a listener with a willing interest which raised her in my estimation considerably And now that I am alone in my room and journalizing it behooves me to gather up and record some of those words precious from their rarity Flora and I in our merry nonsense had a mock dispute and referred the matter to Miss Etty for arbitration Etty mind you side with me said Flora Be an impartial umpire Miss Etty said I and you will be on my side Little Ugly was obliged to confess that she had not heard a word of the matter her thoughts being elsewhere intently engaged I must request you to excuse my inattention she said and to repeat what you were saying The latter request I scorn to grant said I and the former we will consider about when we have heard what thoughts have been preferred to our most edifying conversation You shall tell us said Flora Yes or we till go off and leave you to your meditations here in the dark woods with the owls and the tree toads whom you probably prefer for company Miss Etty condescended to confess she should be frightened without my manful protection Quite a triumph I must thank you she said for the novelty of an evening walk in the woods I enjoy it I confess very highly Look at those dark mysterious vistas and those deepening shadows blending the bank with its mirror how different from the trite daylight truth It took strong hold of my imagination Go on And so you were thinking I was hardly doing so much as thinking I was seeing it to remember Etty draws like an artist said Flora in a whisper I was taking a mental daguerreotype of my companions by twilight and of all the scene round too in the same grey tint just to look at some ten or fifteen years hence when Let us all three agree said I on the twenty eighth of September eighteen to remember this evening I am certain I shall look back to it with pleasure O horrid shrieked Flora how can you talk so By that time you will be a shocking middle aged sort of person I always wonder how people can be resigned to live when they have lost youth and with it all that makes life bearable Fifteen years Dismal thought I shall have outlived every thing I care about in life So moaned Little Handsome But you may have found new sources of interest suggested I perhaps a little too tenderly for I had some sympathy with her dread of that particular phase of existence middle agedness Perhaps as the mistress of a household Worse and worse screamed Flora A miserable comforter you are As if it were not enough merely to grow old but one must be a slave and a martyr never doing any thing one would prefer to do nor going anywhere that one wants to go bound for ever to one spot and one perpetual companion Planning dinners every day for cooks hardly less ignorant than yourself added I laughing at her selfish horror of matronly bondage yet provoked at it Miss Etty would you if you could stand still instead of going forward My happiness is altogether different from Flora s she replied though we were brought up side by side What has taught me to be independent of the world and its notice was my being continually compared with her and assured with compassionate regret that I had none of those qualifications which could give me success in general society Which was a libel I began Without the last syllable said Flora catching up the word At any rate I knew I was plain and shy and made friends slowly So I chose such pleasures as should be under my own control and could never fail me They make my life so much happier and more precious than it was ten years ago that I feel certain I shall have a wider and fuller enjoyment of the same ten years hence What they are I partly guess and partly drew from her in her uncommonly frank mood I begin to perceive that I as well as Flora have been cherishing most mistaken and unsatisfactory aims My surly old inner self has often hinted as much but I would not hear him Etty may have her mistaken views too but she has set me thinking Well you crusty old curmudgeon what has been my course since the awe of the schoolmaster ceased to be a sort of external conscience You told me study was none of my business says Conscience and a pretty piece of work you have made of it without me Idle in college and when you began to perceive the connection between study and what people call success in life overworking yourself here you are and just beginning to bethink yourself that I might have furnished just the right degree of stimulus if you had but allowed it Hark hark It is the duet That silvery second is Etty s I will steal down stairs and when they have ended pop in and it shall go hard but I will have another song Parlor dark and empty I fancied I heard Flora giggling somewhere but I might be mistaken Yet the voices sounded as if they came from that quarter and and I am sure I heard one note on the piano to give the pitch Hark I hear the parlor door softly shut and now the stairs creak and betray them stealing up as they probably betrayed me stealing down They only blew out the lights and kept perfectly still Witches Donkey Etty your voice is still with me clear sweet and penetrating as it was when you talked so eloquently to night in our dreamy ramble What if I had early adopted her idea that with every conscious power is bound up both the duty and the pleasure of developing it Might I not now have reached higher ground with health of body and mind Ambition is an unhealthy stimulus A wretchedly uneasy guest too in the breast of an invalid I would fain have a purer motive which shall dismiss or control it Etty what are the uses to be made of her talents while she lives thus withdrawn into a world of her own Certainly she is wrong I shall convince her of it when our friendship now fairly planted I trust shall have taken root Now we shall be the best friends in the world and I will confide to her my my O I am nodding over my paper and that click says the old clock at the stair head is making ready to announce midnight Sept twenty ninth Capricious are the ways of womankind Little Ugly is more thoroughly self occupied and undemonstrative than ever I am chagrined I think I am an ill used man I am downright angry and have half a mind to flirt with Little Handsome out of spite Only Miss Etty is too indifferent to care I did but leave my old aunt to Flora and step back to remark that it was a pleasant Sunday that the sermon was homely and dull and that the singing was discordant Miss Etty assented but very coldly and presently she bolted into an old red house and left me to go home by myself When we started for church again she was among the missing and we found her in the pew on our arrival Thus pointedly to avoid me It might be accident however for she did not refuse to sing from the same hymn book with me and pointed to a verse on the other page quaint but excellent After all old Watts has written the best hymns in the language Evening Without choice I found myself walking round the pond again It was as smooth as glass and the leaves scarcely trembled on the trees and bushes round it And in my heart reigned a similar calm A strange quiet has fallen on my usually restless and anxious mind I thought that in future I could be content not to look beyond the present duty and having done my best in all circumstances that I could leave the results to follow as God wills At that moment I could sincerely say Let him set me high or low wherever he has work for me to perform If I can remain thus quiet in mind my health will soon return I feel assured If A well founded distrust I fear This peace must be only a mood to pass away when my natural spirits return The fever of covetousness of rivalry of envy and ambitious earthly aspirations will come back Like waves upon the lake these uneasy feelings will chase each other over my soul I picked up a little linen wristband at this moment which I recognized She does not deserve to have it again sulky Little Ugly said I I will put it in my pocket book and keep it as a remembrancer for I am glad to perceive this is the very spot where we stood when we agreed to remember it and each other fifteen years hence We will see what I shall be then and I shall have some aid from this funny little talisman it will speak to me quite as intelligibly and distinctly as its owner in a silent mood at any rate Heigh ho How lonely I feel to night Every human soul is must be a hermit yet there might be something nearer companionship than I have found for mine as yet No one knows me My real self Ha old fellow I like you better than I did let us be good friends Sept thirtieth A golden sunrise 
4930-20048-0000	train-other-500	How much one loses under a false idea of its being a luxury to sleep in the morning Reclining under Farmer Puddingstone s elm and looking upon the glassy pond in which the glowing sky mirrored itself
4930-20048-0001	train-other-500	my soul was fired with poetic inspiration On the blank page of a letter I wrote How holy the calm in the stillness of morn and threw down my paper being suddenly quenched by self ridicule

4930-20048-0007	train-other-500	just as I love her homely sincerity of affection Who arranges the glasses in the parlor Etty I would not fear to affirm from the asters and golden rod cheek by jole with petunias and carnations
4930-20048-0008	train-other-500	I wonder if she would not like some of the clematis I saw twining about a dead tree by the pond It is more beautiful in its present state than when it was in flower Etty loves wild flowers because she is one herself
4930-20048-0009	train-other-500	and loves to hide here in her native nook where no eye I might except my own gives her more than a casual glance Noon
4930-20048-0010	train-other-500	I shall think it quite uncivil of Little Ugly if she does not volunteer to arrange my share of the booty I am bringing now that I have almost broken my neck and quite my cane to obtain it
none	none	 This I said to myself as I came into the house by the kitchen entrance and proceeded to deposit my trailing treasures on Norah s table by the side of a yellow squash Do go with me to Captain Black s said Etty s voice at the side door The old folks have not seen you since your return

4930-20048-0013	train-other-500	So I went to church having walked in the graveyard till the bell rang Owl that you are I don t envy you the lively meditations you must have had Why don t you go It s of no use waiting for me What

4930-20048-0015	train-other-500	I don t think three or four peaches and a few flowers can add much to the weight It is tiresome enough to do what I don t want to do when it is really necessary
4930-20048-0016	train-other-500	And Little Handsome danced into the parlor without perceiving me I laid a detaining hand on Etty s basket as she put herself in motion on which she turned round with a look of
4930-20048-0017	train-other-500	unfeigned astonishment May I not be a substitute for Flora I inquired
none	none	 I do not require any aid 
4930-20048-0018	train-other-500	said Miss Etty shyly It is not on that account I was urging Flora Please to let me have the basket
none	none	 Indeed it is quite unnecessary you should trouble yourself she insisted as I persevered in carrying off my load It is the old red house is it not said I with the roof sloping almost to the ground 
4930-20048-0019	train-other-500	And shall I say that you sent this A view of my strange phiz will not refresh the old people like the sight of Flora s fresh young face but I shall go in and make the agreeable as well as I can
4930-20048-0020	train-other-500	Are you really in earnest asked Etty looking full in my face with a smile of wonder that made her radiantly beautiful She turned away blushing at my surprised and eager gaze and taking up her little basket joined me
4930-20048-0021	train-other-500	without a word of answer on my part It was some time before I quite recovered from a strange flurry of spirits which made my heart bump very much as it does when I hear any unexpected good news
4930-20048-0022	train-other-500	And then I dashed away upon the subject of old age and any thing else that came uppermost in the hope of drawing the soul lighted eyes to mine again with that transfiguring smile playing upon the lips
4930-20048-0023	train-other-500	But I was like an unskilful magician I had lost the spell I could not again discover the spring I had touched In vain I said to myself I ll make her do it again Little Ugly would nt
none	none	 She answered my incoherent sallies in her usual sedate manner and I believe it was only in my imagination that her cheek dimpled a little with a heightened color now and then when I was particularly eloquent Introduced by Miss Etty I was cordially welcomed I am always affected by the sight of an 
4930-20048-0024	train-other-500	aged woman who at all reminds me of the grandmother so indulgent to my prankful boyhood The old man too interested me
none	none	 he has seen much of the world in his seafaring life

4930-20048-0026	train-other-500	How very lovely Etty looked sitting on a cricket at the old woman s feet and with a half smile on her face submitting her polished little head to be stroked by her trembling hands This I saw out of the corner of my eye Hark
4930-20048-0027	train-other-500	Aunt Tabitha s call to dinner I am glad of it I was scribbling such nonsense when I have so much to write better worth while twelve o clock The night is beautiful
4930-20048-0028	train-other-500	and it is a piece of self denial to close the shutter light my lamp and write in my journal Peace of mind came yesterday positive happiness to day neither of which I can analyze
4930-20048-0029	train-other-500	I only know I have not been so thoroughly content since the acquisition of my first jackknife nor so proud since the day when I first sported a shining beaver I have conquered Etty s distrust she has actually promised me her friendship
4930-20048-0030	train-other-500	I am rather surprised that I am so enchanted at this triumph over a prejudice I am hugely delighted Not because it is a triumph however vanity has nothing to do with it It is a worthier feeling
4930-20048-0031	train-other-500	one in which humility mingles with a more cordial self respect than I have hitherto been conscious of I can and I will deserve Etty s good opinion She is an uncompromising judge
4930-20048-0032	train-other-500	but I will surprise her by going beyond what she believes me capable of I never had a sister I shall adopt Etty and when I go home we will write every week if not every day But how came it all about

4930-20048-0033	train-other-500	till now as I hope it is broken up for ever People under the same roof cannot long mistake each other it seems else Etty and I should never have become friends
4930-20048-0034	train-other-500	As we left the door of Captain Black s house and turned into the field path to avoid the dust Etty said I do not know whether you care much about it but you have given pleasure to these good old people
none	none	 who have but little variety in their daily routine being poor and infirm and lonely It is really a duty to cheer them up if we can I felt that it warmed my heart to have shared that duty with her and I said so 
4930-20048-0035	train-other-500	I thought she looked doubtful and surprised It was a good opening for egotism and I improved it
4930-20048-0036	train-other-500	I saw that she was no uninterested listener but all along rather suspicious and incredulous as if what I was claiming for myself was inconsistent with her previous notions of my disposition
4930-20048-0037	train-other-500	I believe I had made some little impression Saturday night but her old distrust had come back by Sunday morning Now she was again shaken At last
none	none	 looking up with the air of one who has taken a mighty resolve she said I presume such a keen observer as yourself must have noticed that the most reserved people are on some occasions the most frank and direct 
4930-20048-0038	train-other-500	I am going to tell you that I feel some apology due to you if my first impressions of your character are really incorrect I am puzzled what to think
4930-20048-0039	train-other-500	I am to suppose that your first impressions were not as favorable as those of missus Black whom I heard remark that I was an amiable youth with an uncommonly pleasant smile
none	none	 Just the opposite in fact pardon me To my eye you had a mocking ironical cast of countenance I felt sure at once you were the sort of person I never could make a friend of and acquaintances I leave to Flora 
4930-20048-0040	train-other-500	who wants to know every body I thought the less I had to do with you the better I felt hurt and almost insulted I had not been mistaken then
4930-20048-0041	train-other-500	she had disliked me and perhaps disliked me yet It was not that I stood in fear of your satire she continued I am indifferent to ridicule or censure in general
none	none	 no one but a friend has power to wound me A flattering emphasis truly I felt my temper a little stirred by Miss Etty s frankness I was sulkily silent 
4930-20048-0042	train-other-500	I had no claim to any forbearance any consideration for peculiarities of any sort I am perfectly resigned to being the theme of your wit in any circle
4930-20048-0043	train-other-500	if you can find aught in my country bred ways to amuse you Zounds I must speak My conduct to Flora must have confirmed the charming impression produced by my unlucky phiz I imagine
4930-20048-0044	train-other-500	But don t bear malice against me in her behalf you must have seen that she was perfectly able to revenge herself Etty s light hearted laugh rung out
4930-20048-0045	train-other-500	and reminded me of my once baffled curiosity when it reached my ear from Norah s domain But though this unsuppressed mirth of hers revealed the prettiest row of teeth in the world
none	none	 and made the whole face decidedly beautiful somehow or other it gave me no pleasure but rather a feeling of depression My joining in it was pure pretence Presently the brightness faded and I found myself gazing at the cold countenance of 
4930-20048-0046	train-other-500	Little Ugly again No I did not refer to Flora said she As you say she can avenge her own quarrel and we both were quite as ready to laugh at you as you could be to laugh at us I assure you
4930-20048-0047	train-other-500	No doubt of it said I with some pique But what I cannot forgive you cannot think of with any toleration is What cried I astonished How have I offended
4930-20048-0048	train-other-500	A man of any right feeling at all could not make game of an aged woman his own relative at the same time that he was receiving her hearty and affectionate hospitality
4930-20048-0049	train-other-500	Neither have I done so cried I in a towering passion You do me a great wrong in accusing me of it I would knock any man down who should treat my aunt with any disrespect
4930-20048-0050	train-other-500	And if I have sometimes allowed Flora to do it unrebuked you well know that she might once have pulled my hair or cuffed my ears and I should have thought it
none	none	 a becoming thing for a young lady to do 
4930-20048-0051	train-other-500	I have played the fool under your eye and submit that you should entertain no high opinion of my wisdom But you have no right to judge so unfavorably of my heart
4930-20048-0052	train-other-500	If I have spoken to my aunt with boyish petulance when she vexed me at least it was to her face and regretted and atoned for to her satisfaction
4930-20048-0053	train-other-500	I am incapable of deceiving her much less of ridiculing her either behind her back or before her face I respond to her love for me with sincere gratitude and the sister of my grandmother shall never want any attention
4930-20048-0054	train-other-500	that an own grandson could render while I live I shall find it hard to forgive you this accusation Miss Etty I said haughtily and shut my mouth as if I would never speak to her again
4930-20048-0055	train-other-500	She made no answer but looked up into my face with one of those wondrous smiles It went as straight to my heart as a pistol bullet could do my high indignation proving no defence against it
none	none	 I was instantly vanquished and as I heartily shook the hand she held out to me I was just able to refrain from pressing it to my lips which now I think of it would have been a most absurd thing for me to do 
4930-20048-0056	train-other-500	I wonder what could have made me think of doing it After Dinner
none	none	 I hear Flora s musical laugh in the mysterious boudoir 
4930-20048-0057	train-other-500	and a low congratulatory little murmur of good humor on Etty s part I believe she is afraid to laugh loud lest I should hear her do it and rush to the spot The door is ajar I ll storm the castle
none	none	 Flora admitted me with a shout of welcome the instant I tapped Etty pushed a rocking chair toward me but said nothing The little room was almost lined with books Drawings paintings shells corals and in the sunny window plants met my exploring gaze but the great basket was nowhere to be seen It was got up for the nonce I imagine Etty a rogue 
4930-20048-0058	train-other-500	This is the pleasantest nook in the house It is a shame you have not been let in before said Flora zealously You shall see Etty s drawings
4930-20048-0059	train-other-500	Neither of us opened the portfolio she seized however but watched Etty s eyes They were cast down with a diffident blush which gave me pain
4930-20048-0060	train-other-500	I was indeed an intruder She gave us the permission we waited for however
none	none	 There were many good copies of lessons 
4930-20048-0061	train-other-500	those I did not dwell upon But the sketches spirited though imperfect I studied as if they had been those of an Allston Etty was evidently in a fidget
4930-20048-0062	train-other-500	at this preference of the smallest line of original talent over the corrected performances which are like those of every body else I drew out a full length figure done in black chalk on brown paper
none	none	 It chained Flora s wondering attention as quite new 
4930-20048-0063	train-other-500	It was a young man with his chair tipped back his feet rested on a table with a slipper perched on each toe His hands were clasped upon the back of his head The face
4930-20048-0064	train-other-500	really I was angry at the diabolical expression given it by eyes looking askance and lips pressed into an arch by a contemptuous smile It was a corner of this very brown sheet that I saw under her arm
4930-20048-0065	train-other-500	when she vanished from the kitchen as I entered the vociferous mirth which attracted me was at my expense Before Flora could recognize my portrait Little Ugly pounced upon it
4930-20048-0066	train-other-500	it fell in a crumpled lump into the bright little wood fire and ceased to exist I had totally forgotten it said she with a blush which avenged my wounded self love Ironical pleasure
none	none	 at having been the subject of her pencil 
4930-20048-0067	train-other-500	I could not indulge myself in expressing as I did not care to enlighten Little Handsome Any lurking pique was banished when Etty showed me with a smile the twilight view by the pond
4930-20048-0068	train-other-500	Do you draw she asked and Flora cried He makes caricatures of his friends with pen and ink let him deny it if he can I
