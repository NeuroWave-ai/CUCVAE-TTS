Produced by Nick Hodson of London England The Ghost Ship by John Conran Hutcheson This book intentionally veers in and out of the supernatural as the title implies The officers get more and more bewildered as they work out their position and yet again encounter the same vessel going in an impossible direction Having warned you of this I must say that it is a well written book about life aboard an ocean going steamer at about the end of the nineteenth century You will find it worth listening to or reading and I recommend it N H THE GHOST SHIP BY JOHN CONRAN HUTCHESON CHAPTER ONE THE STAR OF THE NORTH The sun sank below the horizon that evening in a blaze of ruby and gold It flooded the whole ocean to the westward right up to the very zenith with a wealth of opalescent light that transformed sea and sky alike into a living glory so grand and glorious was the glowing harmony of kaleidoscopic colouring which lit up the arc of heaven and the wide waste of water beneath stretching out and afar beyond ken Aye and a colouring too that changed its hue each instant with marvellous rapidity tint alternating with tint and tone melting into tone in endless succession and variety Throughout the day the weather had looked more than threatening From an early hour of the morning the wind had been constantly veering and shifting showing a strong inclination to back and now the sea was getting up and the white horses of Neptune had already begun to gambol over the crests of the swelling billows which heaved up and down as they rolled onward with a heavy moaning sound like one long deep drawn sigh It looked as if the old monarch below angered by the teasing of the frolicsome zephyrs was gradually working himself up into a passion which would vent itself most probably ere long in a much more telling fashion than by this melancholy moan so different to the sea god s usual voice of thunder Yes it looked threatening enough in all conscience A brisk breeze had been blowing from the nor east before breakfast but this had subsequently shifted to the nor ard at noon veering back again first to the nor east and then to due east in the afternoon The wind freshened as the hours wore on being now accompanied towards sunset by frequent sharp gusts a sign betokening plainly enough to a seaman s eye that something stiffer was brewing up for us by and by Glancing over the side I noticed that our brave vessel the Star of the North was becoming very uneasy She was running under her jib and foresail with fore topsail and fore topgallantsail being only square rigged forwards like most ocean steamers but in order to save coals and ease the engines the skipper had set the fore and main trysails with gaff topsails and staysails as well piling on every rag he could spread With this press of canvas topping her unaccustomed hull the poor old barquey heeled over more and more as the violent gusts caught her broadside on at intervals rolling too a bit on the wind fetching round aft while her stern lifting as some bigger roller than usual passed under her keel the screw would whiz round aimlessly in mid air from missing its grip of the water racing as sailors say in their lingo with a harsh grating jar that set my teeth on edge and seemed to vibrate through my very spinal marrow as I stood for a moment on the line of deck immediately over the revolving shaft At the same time also that the afterpart of the vessel rose up on the breast of one billowy mountain her forefoot in turn would come down with a resonant thwack into the valley intervening between this roller and the next the buoyant old barquey dipping her bows under and giving the star crowned maiden with golden ringlets that did duty for her figurehead an impromptu shower bath as she parted the indignant waves with her glistening black hull sending them off on either hand with a contemptuous swish on their trying in mad desperation to leap on board first to port and then to starboard as the ship listed in her roll It was however but a vain task for these mad myrmidons of Neptune to attempt strive as recklessly as they might in their wrath for the good ship spurned them with her forefoot and the star crowned maiden bowed mockingly to them from her perch above the bobstay laughing in her glee as she rode over them triumphantly and sailed along onward and so the baffled roysterers were forced to fall back discomforted from their rash onslaught swirling away in circling eddies aft where anon the cruel propeller tossed and tore them anew with its pitiless blades ever whirling round with painful iteration to the music of their monotonous refrain Thump thump Thump thump and ever churning up the already seething sea into a mass of boiling brawling bubbling foam that spread out astern of us in a broad shimmering wake in the shape of a lady s fan stretching backward on our track as far as the eye could see and flashing out sparks of fire as it glittered away into the dim distance like an ever widening belt of diamonds fringed with pearls The SS Star of the North was a large schooner rigged cargo steamer strongly built of iron in watertight compartments and of nearly two thousand horsepower but working up under pressure of nearly half as much again on a pinch having been originally intended for the passenger trade She belonged to one of the great ocean lines that run between Liverpool and New York and was now on her last outward trip for the year and rapidly nearing her western goal the Fastnet light and according to our reckoning when we took the sun at noon in latitude forty two deg thirty five minutes North and longitude fifty deg ten minutes West that is just below the banks of Newfoundland our course to our American port having been a little more southerly than usual for the season This was in consequence of Captain Applegarth our skipper wishing as I said before to take advantage of the varying winds of the northern ocean as much as possible so as to economise his steam power and limit our consumption of fuel for freights across the herring pond as the Yankees call it are at a very low ebb nowadays and it is naturally a serious consideration with shipowners how to make a profit out of the carrying trade without landing themselves in the bankruptcy court So they have to cut down their working expenses to the lowest point practicable with efficiency where full speed all the way is not a vital necessity as in the case of the mail steamers and first class passenger ships of enormous steam power and corresponding speed which of course run up a heavy coal bill for they always carry on all they can to and fro across the Atlantic accomplishing the passage now between Queenstown and Sandy Hook veritable greyhounds of the ocean that they are within the six days all told from land to land Aye and even this record promises to be beaten in the near future Prior to our leaving Liverpool on this voyage the very day before we sailed in fact greatly to my surprise and satisfaction as may be imagined I was made fourth officer the owners having unexpectedly promoted me from the position of apprentice which I had filled up to our last run home without any thought of so speedy a rise Of course I had to thank my old friend Captain Applegarth for my good fortune though why the skipper thus spoke up for me I m sure I cannot say for I was very young to hold such a subordinate post having only just turned my seventeenth year besides being boyish enough in all conscience and beardless too at that But be that as it may fourth officer I was at the time of which I write I recollect the evening well enough It was on the seventh of November the anniversary of my birthday a circumstance which would alone suffice to imprint the date on my memory were I at all disposed to forget it But that is not very likely No I can assure you It would be impossible for me to do that as you will readily believe when you come to know my story for on this eventful evening there happened something which somehow or other thenceforth whether owing to what visionary folk term Destiny or from its arising through some curious conjuncture of things beyond the limits of mere chance appeared to exercise a mysterious influence on my life affecting the whole tenor and course of my subsequent career I had better tell you however what occurred and then you will be able to judge for yourself CHAPTER TWO SAIL HO Away forward I remember the ship s bell under the break of the forecastle or fo c s le as it is pronounced in nautical fashion was just striking two bells in the first day watch In other words more suited to a landsman s comprehension it was five o clock in the afternoon when I came on deck from my spell of leisure below to relieve mister Spokeshave the third officer then on duty and the sight I caught of the heavens across the gangway was so beautiful that I paused a moment or two to look at the sunset before going up on the bridge where mister Spokeshave I had no doubt was anxiously awaiting me and equally certainly grumbling at my detaining him from his tea This gentleman however was not too particular as to time in relieving others when off watch and I did not concern myself at all about Master Conky as all of us called him aboard on account of a very prominent and so to speak striking feature of his countenance Otherwise he was an insignificant looking little chap as thin as threadpaper and barely five feet high but he was always swelling himself out and trying to look a bigger personage than he was with the exception that is of his nose which was thoroughly Napoleonic in size and contour Altogether what with the airs he gave himself and his selfish disposition and nasty cantankerous temper Master Spokeshave was not a general favourite on board although we did not quarrel openly with the little beggar or call him by his nickname when he was present albeit he was very hard to bear with sometimes Well not thinking of him or his tea or that it was time for me to go on watch but awed by the majesty of God s handiwork in the wonderful colouring of the afterglow which no mortal artist could have painted no none but He who limns the rainbow I stood there so long by the gangway gazing at the glorious panorama outspread before me that I declare I clean forgot Spokeshave s very existence all important though he considered himself and I was only recalled to myself by the voice of mister Fosset our first officer who had approached without my seeing him speaking close beside me Ah he was a very different sort of fellow to little Spokeshave being a nice jolly good natured chap chubby and brown bearded and liked by every one from the skipper down to the cabin boy He was a bit obstinate though was mister Fosset and as pigheaded as a Scotch barber as Captain Applegarth would say sometimes when he was arguing with him for the first mate would always stick to his own opinion no matter if he were right or wrong nothing said on the other side ever convincing him to the contrary and making him change his mind He had caught sight of me now leaning against the bulwarks and looking over the side amidships just abaft the engine room hatch as he passed along the gangway towards the bridge which he was about to mount to have a look at the standard compass and see what course the helmsman was steering on his way from the poop where I had noticed him talking with the skipper as I came up the booby hatch from below Hullo Haldane he cried shouting almost in my ear and giving me a playful dig in the ribs at the same time this nearly knocked all the breath out of my body Is that you my boy Aye aye sir I replied hesitating for I was startled alike by his rather too demonstrative greeting as well as his unexpected approach I I mean yes sir mister Fosset laughed a jolly catching laugh it was that of a man who had just dined comfortably and enjoyed his dinner and did not have apparently a care in the world Why what s the matter with you youngster said he in his chaffing way Been having a caulk on the sly and dreaming of home I bet No sir I answered gravely I ve not been to sleep But you look quite dazed my boy I made no reply to this observation and mister Fosset then dropped his bantering manner Tell me said he kindly is there anything wrong with you below Has that cross grained little shrimp Spokeshave hang him been bullying you again like he did the other day Oh no sir he s on the bridge now and I ought to have relieved him before this I replied only thinking of poor Conky and his tea then for the first time I wasn t even dreaming of him I m sure I beg his pardon Well you were dreaming of some one perhaps nearer and dearer than Spokeshave rejoined mister Fosset with another genial laugh You were quite in a brown study when I gave you that dig in the ribs What s the matter my boy I was looking at that sir said I simply in response to his question pointing upwards to the glory in the heavens Isn t it grand Isn t it glorious This was a poser for the first mate though good natured and good humoured enough and probably a thinking man too in his way was too matter of fact a person to indulge in dreamy sentimentalities as he would have styled my deeper thoughts A sunset to him was only a sunset saving in so far as it served to denote any change of weather which aspect his seaman s eye readily took note of without any pointing out on my part so he rather chilled my enthusiasm by his reply now to me Oh yes it s very fine and all that youngster he observed in an off hand manner that grated on my feelings making me wish I had not spoken so gushingly I think that sky shows signs of a blow before the night is over which will give you something better to do than star gazing I can t very well do that now sir said I slily with a grin at catching him tripping Why the stars aren t out yet That may be Master Impudence replied mister Fosset all genial again and laughing too but they ll soon be popping out overhead But sir it is quite light still I persisted See it is as bright as day all round just as at noontide Aye but it ll be precious dark soon It grows dusk in less than a jiffey after the sun dips in these latitudes at this time o year said he Hullo I say though that reminds me Haldane Of what sir I asked as he stopped abruptly at this point Anything I can do for you mister Fosset No my boy nothing he replied reflectively and looking for the moment to be in as deep a brown study as he accused me of being just now Stop though I tell you what you can do Run forwards and see what that lazy lubber of a lamp trimmer is about He s always half an hour or so behind time and seems to get later every day Wake him up and make him hoist our masthead lantern and fix the side lights in position for it ll soon be dark I bet ee in spite of all that flare up aloft over there and we re now getting in the track of the homeward bounders crossing the Banks and have to keep a sharp look out and let em know where we are to avoid any chance of collision Aye aye sir I cried making my way along the gangway by the side of the deckhouse towards the fo c s le which was still lit up by the afterglow as if on fire I ll see to it all right and get our steam lights rigged up at once sir So saying in another minute or so scrambling over a lot of empty coal sacks and other loose gear that littered the deck besides getting tripped up by the tackle of the ash hoist which I did not see in time from the glare of the sky coming right in my eyes I gained the lee side of the cook s galley at the forward end of the deckhouse Here as I conjectured I found old Greazer our lamp trimmer This worthy who was quite a character in his way was a superannuated fireman belonging to the line whom age and long years of toil had unfitted for the rougher and more arduous duties of his vocation in the stoke hold and who now instead of trimming coals in the furnaces below trimmed wicks and attended to the lamps about the ship on deck and elsewhere He managed I may add to make his face so dirty in the carrying out of the lighter duties to which he was now called probably in fond recollection of his byegone grimy task in the engine room that his somewhat personal cognomen was very appropriate his countenance being oily and smutty to a degree He was a very lazy old chap however and in lieu of attending to his work was generally to be found confabulating with our mulatto cook Accra Prout as I discovered him now more bent on worming out an extra lot of grog from the chef of the galley in exchange for a lump of hard tobacco than thinking of masthead lanterns or the ship s side lights green and red What are you about lamp trimmer I called out sharply on catching sight of him palavering there with the mulatto the artful beggar furtively slipping the tin pannikin out of which he had been drinking into the bosom of his jumper Here s two bells struck and no lights up Two bells sir Aye two bells I repeated taking no notice of his affected air of surprise There s the ship s bell right over your head where you stand and you must have heard it strike not five minutes ago Lor Master Dick may I die a foul death ashore if I ever heard a stroke he replied as innocently as you please Howsomdever the lamps is all right sir I ain t ave forgot em That s all right then Greazer I said not being too hard on him and excusing the sly wink he gave to Prout as he told his barefaced banger about not hearing the bell in memory of his past services Come along now and rig them up smart or you ll have mister Fosset after you Making him hoist our masthead light on the foremast twenty feet above the deck according to the usual Board of Trade regulations for steamers under way at sea I then marched him before me along the deck and saw him place our side lights in their proper position the green one to starboard and the red on our port hand Old Greazer then mounted the bridge ladder in advance of me with the binnacle lamp in his hand to put that in its place and as I followed slowly in his slow footsteps for the ex fireman was not now quick of movement an accident in the stoke hold having crippled him years ago I half turned round as I ascended the laddering to have a look again at the horizon to leeward over our port quarters when I fancied when advancing a foot with the lamp trimmer I had seen something to the southward In another instant my fancy became a certainty Yes there in the distance sailing at an angle to our course right before the wind was a large full rigged ship Everything though was not right with her as I noted the moment I made her out with her white canvas all crimson from a last expiring gleam of the afterglow for I could see that her sails were tattered and torn with the ragged ends blowing out loose from the boltropes in the most untidy fashion unkempt uncared for Besides she was flying a signal of distress patent to every sailor that has ever crossed the seas Her flag was hoisted half mast high from the peak halliards Half mast high I did not wait nor did I want to see anything further No that was enough for me and springing on to the bridge with a bound that nearly knocked poor old Greazer down on his marrowbones as he stopped to put the lantern into the binnacle I shouted out in a ringing voice that echoed fore and aft startling everybody aboard even myself Sail ho A ship in distress Sail ho CHAPTER THREE DID I DREAM IT Where away Haldane cried mister Fosset the first to notice my shout catching up a telescope that lay handy on the top of the wheel house of the bridge and in his hurry eagerly scanning every portion of the horizon but the right one I don t see her There she is sir away to the right said I equally flurried pointing over the lee rail in the direction where I had observed the ship only a second before as I mounted the bridge ladder although I could not actually make her out distinctly at the moment now on account of the smoke from our funnels which just then came belching forth in a thick black cloud that streamed away to leeward athwart our starboard beam obscuring the outlook There away sir out there Well I can t see anything ejaculated mister Fosset impatiently rising to his feet after stooping down to the level of the bridge cloth trying to get a sight of the strange vessel as best he could under the cloud of smoke which was now trailing out along the horizon blown far away to leeward by the strong wind across our beam I m sure I can t see anything over there youngster you must have dreamt it Yes when you were lolling about in the waist below there just now put in my friend Master Spokeshave who had been pretending to look out from his end of the bridge because he thought he ought to do so as mister Fosset was there although he really couldn t possibly see anything aft from that position on the port side on account of the wheel house and funnel which were of course abaft the bridge blocking the view The cantankerous little beggar sniffed his beak of a nose in the air as if trying to look down on me though he was half a head shorter and spoke in that nasty sneering way of his that always made me mad He did enjoy growling at any one when he had the chance and so he went on snarling now like a cat behind an area railing at a dog which couldn t get at it to stop its venomous spitting I saw you my joker star gazing down there instead of coming up here to relieve me at the proper time I believe you only sang out about the ship to cover your laziness and take a rise out of us I did nothing of the sort mister Spokeshave I answered indignantly for the little beast sniggered away and grinned at mister Fosset as if he had said something uncommonly smart at my expense I saw however where the shoe pinched He was angry at my having kept him waiting for his tea and hence his spiteful allusion to my being late coming on watch so I was just going to give him a sharp rejoinder referring to his love for his little stomach a weak point with him and a common joke with us all below at meal times when ere I could get a word out of the scathing rebuke I intended for him the smoke trail suddenly lifted a bit to leeward and leaving the horizon clear I caught sight again of the ship I had seen over the rail This of course at once changed the current of my thoughts and so without troubling my head any further about Conky I sang out as eagerly as before to the first mate all the more anxious now to prove that I had been right in the first instance There she is mister Fosset there she is Where on earth are you squinting now boy said he a bit huffy at not making her out and apparently inclined to Spokeshave s opinion that I had not really seen her at all Where away There sir away to leeward cried I almost jumping over the bridge rail in my excitement She s nearly abreast of our mizzen chains and not a mile off She seems coming up on the port tack sir For strangely enough although we were going ten knots good by the aid of the wind that had worked round more abeam so that all our fore and aft sail drew while the ship which when I saw her before seemed to be running with the nor easter and sailing at a tangent to our course so that she ought really to have increased her distance from us now on the contrary appeared ever so much nearer as if she had either altered her helm or drifted closer by the aid of some ocean current in the interim albeit barely five minutes at the best if that had only elapsed since I first sighted her But stranger still mister Fosset could not see her when there she was as plain as the sun setting in the west awhile ago at least to my eyes and as she approached nearer yet in some unaccountable way for her bows were pointed from us and the wind of course was blowing in the opposite direction she being on our lee I declare I could distinctly see a female figure like that of a young girl with long hair on the deck aft and beside her I also noticed a large black dog jumping up and down I m sure I can t see any ship youngster said mister Fosset at the moment Even while he was actually speaking I observed the sailing vessel to yaw in her course her ragged canvas flattening against the masts as if she were coming about although from the way her head veered about she did not seem to be under any control There s nothing in sight Haldane I tell you What you perhaps thought was a ship is that big black cloud rising to the southward It looks like one of those nasty sea fogs working up and we ll have to keep a precious sharp look out to night I know There s no ship there echoed my friend Conky tapping his forehead in a very offensive way to intimate that I had a screw loose in the upper storey as the saying goes grinning the while as I could see very well in the dim light and poking his long nose up in the air in supreme contempt The boy is either mad or drunk or dreaming as you say sir It is all a cock and a bull yarn about his sighting a vessel and he only wants to brave it out There s no ship there Can you see anything Atkins asked mister Fosset of the man steering There away to leeward I mean No sir answered the sailor not a speck sir Do you see anything lamp trimmer No can t say I does sir replied old Greazer after a long squint over our lee in the direction pointed out Not a sight of a sail nor a light nor nothink It was curious For at that very moment when the first mate and Spokeshave and the helmsman and lamp trimmer standing on the bridge beside me one and all said they could see nothing I declare to you I saw not only the ship and the figures on her deck but I noticed that the girl on the poop waved a scarf or handkerchief as if imploring our assistance and at the same time the dog near her bounded up against the bulwarks and I can solemnly assert from the evidence of my ears that I heard the animal distinctly bark giving out that joyous sort of bark with which a well dispositioned dog invariably greets a friend of his master or mistress I could not make it out at all It was most mysterious Look look mister Fosset I cried excitedly There she is now There she is coming up on our lee quarter Why you must be all blind I can not only see the ship distinctly but also right down on to her deck Nonsense boy you d better go below said the first mate brusquely while Spokeshave sniggered and whispered something to the lamp trimmer and man at the wheel that made them both laugh out right There s something wrong with you to night Haldane for you seem quite off your chump so you d better go below and sleep it off There s no ship near us I tell you What you imagined to be a sailing vessel is that dark cloud there coming up from the leeward which is fast shutting out the horizon from view It s a sea fog such as are frequently met with hereabouts below the Banks as we are now It was true enough about the cloud or mist or fog or whatever it was for as mister Fosset spoke the darkness closed in around us like a wall and the ship that I swear I had seen the moment before vanished sky and sea and everything else disappearing also at the same instant leaving us as it were isolated in space the veil of vapour being impenetrable CHAPTER FOUR A CONFLICT OF AUTHORITY Just then Captain Applegarth appeared on the scene He had gone down by the companion way into the saloon below after mister Fosset had left the poop to look at the barometer in his cabin and now came along the upper deck and on to the bridge amidships startling us with his sudden presence The skipper had a sharp eye which was so trained by observation in all sorts of weather that he could see in the dark like a cat almost as well as he could by daylight Looking round and scanning our faces as well as he could in the prevailing gloom he soon perceived that something was wrong Huh he exclaimed What s the row about There s no row sir explained the first mate in an off hand tone of bravado which he tried to give a jocular ring to but could not very successfully This youngster Haldane here swears he saw a full rigged ship on our lee quarter awhile ago flying a signal of distress but neither mister Spokeshave who was on the watch nor myself could make her out where Haldane said he saw her Indeed No sir continued mister Fosset nor could the helmsman or old Greazer here who came up with the binnacle lamp at the time Not one of us could see this wonderful ship of Haldane s though it was pretty clear all round then and we all looked in the direction to which he pointed That s strange said Captain Applegarth very strange Quite so sir just what we all think sir chimed in Master Spokeshave putting in his oar Not a soul here on the bridge sir observed anything of any ship of any sort leastways one flying a signal of distress such as Dick Haldane said he saw Humph ejaculated the skipper as if turning the matter over in his mind for the moment and then addressing me point blank he asked me outright Do you really believe you saw this ship Haldane Yes sir I answered as directly as he had questioned me I ll swear I did No I don t want you to do that I ll take your word for it without any swearing Haldane said the skipper to this speaking to me quietly and as kindly as if he had been my father But listen to me my boy I do not doubt your good faith for a moment mind that Still are you sure that what you believe you saw might not have been some optical illusion proceeding from the effects of the afterglow at sunset It was very bright and vivid you know and the reflection of a passing cloud above the horizon or its shadow just before the sun dipped might have caused that very appearance which you took to be a ship under sail I have myself been often mistaken in the same way under similar atmospheric surroundings and that is why I put it to you like this to learn whether you are quite certain you might not be mistaken Quite so shoved in Spokeshave again in his parrot fashion quite so sir I didn t ask your opinion growled the skipper shutting him up in a twinkling and then turning to me again he looked at me inquiringly Well Haldane have you thought it out Yes captain I have I replied firmly though respectfully the ill timed interference of the objectionable mister Spokeshave having made me as obstinate as mister Fosset It was no optical illusion or imagination on my part sir or anything of that sort I assure you sir I am telling you the truth sir and no lie I saw that ship sir to leeward of us just now as clearly as I can see you at this moment aye clearer sir Then that settles the matter I ve never had occasion to doubt your word before during the years you ve sailed with me my boy and I am not going to doubt it now So saying Captain Applegarth putting his arm on my shoulder faced round towards the first mate and Spokeshave as if challenging them both to question my veracity after this testimony on his part in my favour This ship you say Haldane then continued the skipper proceeding to interrogate me as to the facts of the case now that my credulity had been established in his sharp sailor like way was flying a signal of distress eh Yes sir I answered with zest all animation and excitement again at his encouragement She had her flag the French tricolour I think sir hoisted half mast at her peak and she appeared sir a good deal battered about as if she had been in bad weather and had made the worst of it Besides cappen I hesitated Besides what my boy he asked on my pausing here almost afraid to mention the sight I had noticed on the deck of the ill fated ship in the presence of two such sceptical listeners as mister Fosset and my more immediate superior the third officer Spokeshave You need not be afraid of saying anything you like before me I m captain of this ship Well sir said I speaking out just before that mass of clouds or fog bank came down on the wind shutting out the ship from view she yawed a bit off her course and I saw somebody on her deck aft What cried the skipper interrupting me Was she so close as that Yes sir said I She did not seem to be a hundred yards away at the moment if that And you saw somebody on the deck Yes cap en I answered a woman He again interrupted me all agog at the news A woman Yes sir said I A woman or rather perhaps a girl for she had a lot of long hair streaming over her shoulders all flying about in the wind What was she doing She appeared to be waving a white handkerchief or something like that as if to attract our attention asking us to help her like The skipper drew himself up to his full height on my telling this and turned round on mister Fosset his face blazing with passion A ship in distress a woman on board imploring our aid he exclaimed in keen cold cutting tones that pierced one like a knife and you passed her by without rendering any assistance a foreigner too of all We Englishmen who pride ourselves on our humanity above all other nations What will they think of us I tell you sir we could not see any ship at all retorted the first mate hotly in reply to this reproach which he felt as keenly as it was uttered And if we couldn t see the ship how could we know there was a woman or anybody aboard Quite so echoed Spokeshave emphasising mister Fosset s logical argument in his own defence That s exactly what I say sir I would not have had it happen for worlds We flying the old Union jack too that boasts of never passing either friend or foe when in danger and asking aid He spoke still more bitterly as if he had not heard their excuses But hang it cap en cried mister Fosset I tell you Captain Applegarth waved him aside Where did you last sight the ship Haldane he said turning round abruptly to me How was she heading She bore about two points off our port quarter I replied as laconically I think sir she was running before the wind like ourselves though steering a little more to the southwards The skipper looked at the standard compass in front of the wheel house on the bridge and then addressed the helmsman How are we steering now quartermaster The same course as I set at noon eh Aye aye sir replied Atkins who still stood by the steam steering gear singlehanded If it had been the ordinary wheel unaided by steam power it would have required four men to move the rudder and keep the vessel steady in such a sea as was now running We ve kept her pretty straight sir since eight bells on the same course west by south sir half south Very good quartermaster Haldane are you there Yes sir said I stepping up to him again having moved away into the shadow under the lee of the wheel house whilst he was speaking to Atkins Here I am sir Was that vessel dropping us when we passed her or were we going ahead of her She was running before the wind sir at a tangent to our course and more to the southwards moving through the water quicker than we were until she luffed up just before that mist or fog bank shut her out from view But Well I think sir I continued that was done merely to speak us and if she bore away again as she was probably forced to do being at the mercy of the gale she must be scudding even more to the southwards almost due south I should fancy as the wind has backed again more to the nor ard since this I fancy the same my boy I see you have a sailor s eye and have got your wits about you Quartermaster Aye aye sir Let her off a point or two gradually until you bring her head about sou sou west and keep her so Aye aye sir responded Atkins easing her off as required Sou sou west it shall be sir in a minute That will bring us across her I think said the skipper to me But we must go a little faster if we want to overtake her What are we doing now eh I don t quite know sir I answered to this question I was only just coming up on the bridge to relieve mister Spokeshave when I sighted the ship and have not had time to look at the indicator I should think though we re going eight or nine knots This didn t satisfy the skipper so he turned to the first mate who had remained moodily aloof with Spokeshave at the end of the bridge mister Fosset he sang out abruptly what are the engines doing About thirty revolutions sir half speed as nearly as possible How much are we going altogether Ten knots with our sails replied the other The wind is freshening too So I see said Captain Applegarth laconically And it ll freshen still more by and bye if I m not mistaken Yes it looks as if we re going to have a bit of a blow The scud is flying all over us now that we are running before the wind I really think we ought to ease down sir for the screw races fearfully as she dips and I m afraid of the shaft I m responsible for that mister Fosset answered the skipper as moving the handle of the gong on the bridge communicating with the engine room he directed those in charge below to put on full speed ahead I never yet abandoned a ship in distress and I m not going to do so now We re on the right course to overhaul her now I think eh Haldane Yes sir I replied I hope though we won t pass her in the fog sir or run into her perhaps No fear of that my boy The fog is lifting now and the night will soon be as clear as a bell for the wind is driving all the mists away Besides we ll take precautions against any accident happening mister Fosset Aye aye sir Put a couple of lookouts on the fo c s le Aye aye sir Perhaps too we d better send up a rocket to let em know we re about mister Spokeshave mister Spokeshave No answer came this time however from my friend Master Conky though he had been ready enough just now with his aggravating quite so I think sir said I mister Spokeshave has gone below to his tea Very likely replied the skipper drily he s precious fond of his breadbasket that young gentleman I don t think he ll ever starve where there s any grub knocking about Fancy a fellow calling himself a man thinking of his belly at such a moment Go Haldane and call him up again and tell him I want him I started to obey Captain Applegarth s order but I had hardly got three steps down the ladder when Spokeshave saved me further trouble by coming up on the bridge again of his own accord without waiting to be summoned The skipper therefore gave him instructions to let off every quarter of an hour a couple of signal rockets and burn a blue light or two over our port and starboard quarter alternately as we proceeded towards the object of our quest All right sir quite so said Conky as well as he could articulate his mouth being full of something he had hurriedly snatched from the steward s pantry when he had gone below and brought up with him to eat on deck knowing that the skipper would be sure to sing out for him if he remained long away at so critical a juncture All right sir quite so The skipper laughed as he went down again to get the rockets and blue lights which were kept in a spare cabin aft for safety He s a rum chap that little beggar he observed to mister Fosset who had been forward to set the look out men on the forecastle and had returned to the bridge I think if you told him he was the laziest loafer that ever ate lobscouse he couldn t help saying Quite so You re about right sir I think though he can t help it he s got so used to the phrase replied the other joining in the skipper s laugh But hullo here comes old Stokes panting and puffing along the gangway I hope nothing s wrong in the engine room I hope not said the skipper We want to go all we can just now to overhaul that ship Haldane saw If he saw it muttered the first officer under his breath and glowering at me A pack of sheer nonsense I call it this going out of our course on a wild goose chase and tearing away full speed on a wild night like this in a howling sea with a gale too astern and all because an ass of a youngster fancies he saw the Flying Dutchman I daresay the captain heard him but the appearance just then of mister Stokes our chief engineer who had now reached the bridge panting and puffing at every step as mister Fosset had said he being corpulent of habit and short winded stopped any further controversy on the point as to whether I had seen or had not seen the mysterious ship Cap en Cap en Applegarth cried out the chief engineer asthmatically as soon as he got within hail speaking in a tearful voice and almost crying in his excitement Are you there sir Aye here I am mister Stokes as large as life though not quite so big a man as you answered the skipper jocularly I am here on the bridge quite at your service mister Stokes however was in no jocular mood Cap en Applegarth said he solemnly did you really mean to ring us on full speed ahead I did replied the skipper promptly What of that What of that repeated the old engineer dumbfounded by this return shot Why sir the engines can t stand it That is all if you must have it Can t stand what They can t stand all this driving and racing with the propeller blades half out of water every second revolution of the shaft No engines could stand it with such a heavy sea on and the ship rolling and pitching all the time like a merry go round at Barnet Fair The governor is no good and though Grummet or Links have their grip on the throttle valve all the while to check the steam and I ve every stoker and oiler on duty the bearings are getting that heated that I m afraid of the shaft breaking at any moment Full speed sir Why we can t do it sir we can t do it Nonsense Stokes said the skipper good humouredly You must do it old fellow But I tell you Cap en Applegarth the engines can t stand it without breaking down and then where will you be I d like to know I ll risk that No cap en snorted the old chief doggedly I m responsible to the owners for the engines and if anything happened to the machinery they d blame me I can t do it The skipper flew up to white heat at this But mister Stokes recollect I am responsible for the ship engines and all sir The greater includes the less and as captain of this ship I intend to have my orders carried out by every man jack on board Do you hear that Yes sir I hear replied mister Stokes grumblingly as he backed towards the bridge ladder But sir The skipper would not give him time to get out another word You heard what I said he roared out in a voice that made the old chief jump down half a dozen steps at once I ordered you to go full speed ahead and I mean to go full speed ahead whether the boilers burst or the propeller races or the screw shaft carries away for I won t abandon a ship in distress for all the engineers and half hearted mollicoddles in the world A ship in distress gasped old mister Stokes from the bottom rung of the ladder I didn t hear about that before Well you hear it now snapped out the skipper viciously storming up and down the bridge in a state of great wrath But whether it s a ship in distress or not I ll have you to know mister Stokes once for all that if I order full speed or half speed or any speed I intend my orders to be obeyed and if you don t like it you can lump it I m captain of this ship CHAPTER FIVE THE GALE FRESHENS Presently a cloud of thick black smoke again pouring forth from the funnels showed that mister Stokes had set the engine room staff vigorously to work to carry out the skipper s orders while the vibration of the upper deck below our feet afforded proof were such needed that the machinery was being driven to its utmost capacity the regular throbbing motion caused by the revolving shaft being distinctly perceptible above the rolling of the vessel and the jar of the opposing waves against her bow plates when she pitched more deeply than usual and met the sea full butt end on The surface fog or mist which had lately obscured the view rising from the water immediately after the last gleams of the sunset had disappeared from the western sky had now cleared away giving place to the pale spectral light of night an occasional star twinkling here and there in the dark vault overhead like a sign post in the immensity of space making the wild billowy waste through which we tore with all the power of wind and steam seem all the wilder from contrast We had carried on like this for about an hour steering steadily to the southwards without catching sight again of the strange ship though Spokeshave and I had continued to let off signal rockets and burn blue lights at intervals the gale increasing in force each instant and the waves growing bigger and bigger so that they rose over the topsail as we raced along when all at once a great green sea broke amidships coming aboard of us just abaft of the engine room hatchway flooding all the waist on either side of the deckhouse and rolling down below in a regular cataract of tumid water sweeping everything before it That s pretty lively exclaimed Captain Applegarth clutching hold of the rail to preserve his balance as he turned to the quartermaster at the wheel Steady there my man Keep her full and by Aye aye sir answered Atkins But she do yaw so when she buries her bows She s got too much sail on her sir I know that said the skipper But I m going to carry on as long as I can all the same my man Even as he spoke however a second sea followed the first nearly washing us all off the bridge and smashing the glass of the skylight over the engine room besides doing other damage By Captain Applegarth s directions a piece of heavy tarpaulin was lashed over the broken skylight securing the ends to ringbolts in the deck but hardly had the covering been made fast ere we could see the chief engineer picking his way towards us struggling through the water that still lay a foot deep in the waist and looking as pale as death Hullo mister Stokes cried the skipper when the old chief with great difficulty had gained the vantage of the bridge ladder What s the matter now old fellow He was too much exhausted at first to reply What s the matter he echoed ironically when able at last to speak Oh nothing at all worth mentioning nothing at all I told you how it would be sir if you insisted on going ahead full speed in such weather as we re having Why Cap en Applegarth the stoke hold s full of water and the bilgepump s choked that s all and the fires I expect will be drowned out in another minute or two That s what s the matter sir believe me or not With that the poor old chap who was quite overcome with the exertions he had gone through and his pent up emotion broke down utterly bursting into a regular boohoo Dear me mister Stokes mister Stokes don t give way like that said the skipper soothingly patting him on the back to calm him down being a very good hearted man at bottom in spite of his strict discipline and insistence on being captain of his own ship as he termed it Don t give way like that old friend Things will come all right by and bye O o h will they snivelled the old chap refusing to be comforted like a veritable Rachel mourning for her children We may possibly get rid of the water below but the crosshead bearings are working loose and I d like to know who s going to give me a new gudgeon pin Hang your gudgeon pin cried the skipper irascibly not perhaps for the moment attaching the importance it demanded to this small but essential part of the engines uniting the connecting rod of the crank shaft with the piston which he thus irreverently anathematised and then struck by the comic aspect of the situation with the waves breaking over us and the elements in mad turmoil around us while the fat old chief was blubbering there like a boy about his gudgeon pin as if bewailing some toy that had been taken from him that he burst out with a roar of laughter which was so contagious that in spite of the gloomy outlook and our perilous surroundings mister Fosset and all of us on the bridge joined in even the quartermaster not being able to prevent a grin from stealing over his crusty weatherbeaten face though the man at the wheel on board ship when on duty is technically supposed to be incapable of expressing any emotion beyond such as may be connected with the compass card and the coursing of the ship Wha wha what s the matter with that now old chap One would think it was a whale and not a gudgeon you make such a fuss about it Of course the captain s joke set us all off cackling again mister Spokeshave s he he he sounding out high in the treble above the general cachination This exasperated mister Stokes making the old fellow quite furious This is no laughing matter Cap en Applegarth said he with great dignity standing up as erectly as he could and puffing his corpulent figure out to such an extent that I thought he would burst I ll have ye to know that sir Nor did I come on deck sir at the peril of my life almost to be made a jeer block of though I m only the chief engineer of the ship and you re the ca p en He spoke with so stately an air that I confess I felt sorry I had given away to any merriment at his expense while the others grew serious in a moment and as for Atkins his whilom grinning face seemed now to be carved out of some species of wood of a particularly hard and fibrous nature Now don t get angry Stokes old fellow cried the skipper shoving out his fist and gripping that of the chief in the very nick of time for the vessel gave a lurch just then and still standing on his dignity as the poor old chap was without holding on to anything he would have been precipitated over the rail to the deck below but for the skipper s friendly aid Don t be angry with me old chum I m sorry I laughed but you and I have been shipmates too long together for us to fall out now Why what the devil has got over you Stokes You ve never been so huffy since I first sailed with you and I should have thought you one of the last in the world to take offence at a little bit of harmless chaff Well well Cap en Applegarth let it bide let it bide replied the old chief coming round at once his rage calming down as quickly as it had risen I don t mind your laughing at me if you have a mind too I daresay it all seemed very funny to you my being anxious about my engines but I m hanged if I can see the fun myself But it was funny Stokes deuced funny I tell you ho ho ho rejoined the skipper bursting out into a regular roar again at the recollection of the scene his jolly laugh causing even the cause of it to smile against his will However there s an end of it gudgeon pin and all Now about that stoke hold of yours It s flooded you say Aye there s eighteen inches of water there now right up to the footplates said the engineer with a grave air The bilge pumps won t act and all my staff of stokers are so busy keeping up the steam that I can t spare a man to see to clearing out the suctions though if the water rises any higher it will soon be up to the furnace bars and put out the fires Humph that s serious answered the skipper meditatively I ll see what I can do to help you I say Fosset Aye aye sir Want me Yes replied the skipper mister Stokes is shorthanded below and says the bilge pumps are choked Can you spare him a man or two to help clear the suctions I daresay there s a lot of stray dunnage washing about under the stoke hold plates You might go down and bear a hand yourself as I won t leave the bridge Certainly sir I ll go at once with mister Stokes and take some of the starboard watch with me It s close on seven bells and they d soon have to turn out anyway to relieve the men now on deck That ll do very well Fosset said the skipper and raising his voice he shouted over the rail forwards Bosun call the watch Bill Masters who had been waiting handy on the deck amidships immediately below the bridge expecting some such order with the need as he thought of the skipper reducing sail at once stuck his shrill boatswain s pipe to his lips and gave the customary call Whee ee oo oo whee ee ee Starboard watch ahoy The men came tumbling out of the fo c s le at the sound of the whistle and the old seadog s stentorian hail whereupon the first mate selecting six of the lot to accompany him he followed mister Stokes towards the engine room hatchway Before disappearing below however the engineer made a last appeal to the skipper I say cap en he sang out stopping half way as he toddled aft somewhat disconsolately in spite of the assistance given him now won t you ease down sir just to oblige me The engines won t stand it sir and it s my duty to tell you so sir All right Stokes you ve told me and may consider that you ve done your duty in doing so replied the skipper grimly laconic But I m not going to ease down till seven bells my hearty unless we run across Dick Haldane s ship before when we ll go as slow as you like and bear up again on our course to the westwards Very good sir answered the old chief as he lifted his podgy legs over the coaming of the hatchway prior to burying himself in the cimmerian darkness of the opening wherein mister Fosset and his men had already vanished I ll make things all snug below sir and bank the fires as soon as you give the signal With that he too was lost to sight The skipper I could see was not very easy in his mind when left alone for he paced jerkily to and fro between the wheel house and the weather end of the bridge as well as he was able the vessel being very unsteady rolling about among the big rollers like a huge grampus and pitching almost bows under water sometimes though the old barquey was buoyant enough notwithstanding the lot of deadweight she carried in her bowels rising up after each plunge as frisky as a cork when she would shake herself with a movement that made her tremble all over as if to get rid of the loose spray and spindrift that hung on to her shining black head and which the wind swept before it like flecks of snow into the rigging spattering and spattering against the almost red hot funnels up which the steam blast was rushing mingled with the flare of the funnels below After continuing his restless walk for a minute or two the skipper stopped by the binnacle looking at the compass card which moved about as restlessly as the old barquey and himself oscillating in every direction We ought to have come up with her by now Haldane he said addressing me as I stood with Spokeshave on the other side of the wheel house Don t you think so from the course she was going when you sighted her Yes sir I answered if she hasn t gone down I hope not my boy said he but I m very much afraid she has or else we ve passed ahead of her That s not likely sir I replied She looked as if crossing our track when I last saw her and though we were going slower then we must be gaining on her now I should think We ought to be said he We must be going seventeen knots at the least with wind and steam Aye aye sir all that corroborated old Masters the boatswain who had come up on the bridge unnoticed Beg pardon sir but we can t carry on much longer with all that sail forrad The fore topmast is a complainin like anythink I can tell ye sir Chirvell the carpenter and me s examinin it and we thinks it s got sprung at the cap sir If that s the case my man said Captain Applegarth to this we d better take in sail at once It s a pity too with such a fine wind I was just going to spare the engines and ease down for a bit trusting to our sails alone but if there s any risk of the spars going as you say wrong we must reduce our canvas instead There s no help for it sir returned the boatswain quickly Either one or t other must go Shall I pass the word sir to take in sail Aye take in the rags Fo c s le ahoy there yelled Masters instantly taking advantage of the long desired permission All hands take in sail We had hauled the trysails and other fore and aft canvas which was comparatively useless to a steamer when running before the wind at the time we had altered course towards the south in quest of the ship in distress the Star of the North speeding along with only her fore topsail and fore topgallantsail set in addition to her fore topmast staysail and mizzen staysail and jib The gale however had increased so much the wind freshening as it shifted more and more to the north that this sail was too much for her the canvas bellying out and the upper spars buckling as the vessel laboured in the heavy sea the stays taut as fiddle strings and everything at the utmost tension The skipper perceived this now when almost too late Let go your topgallant bowline and lee sheet and halliards he roared out holding on with both hands to the rail and bending over the bridge cloth as he shouted to the men forward who had tumbled out of the forecastle on the boatswain s warning hail Stand by your clewlines and by your boat lines The men sprang to the ropes with a will but ere they had begun to cast them off from the cleats an ominous sound was heard from aloft and splitting from clew to earring our poor topgallantsail blew clean out of the boltropes with a loud crack as if a gun had been fired off the fragments floating away ahead of us borne on the wings of the wind like a huge kite until it disappeared in the dark chiaraoscura of the distant horizon where heaven and sea met amid the shadows of night Just then a most wonderful thing happened to startle us further While all of us gazed at the wreck aloft expecting the topsail to follow suit before it could be pulled though the hands were racing up rigging for the purpose the halliards having been at once let go and the yard lowered a strange light over the topsail made us look aft when we saw a huge ball of fire pass slowly across the zenith from the east to the west illuminating not only the northern arc of the sky but the surface of the water also immediately beneath its path and making the faces of the men in the rigging and indeed any object on board stand out in relief shining with that corpse like glare or reflection produced by the electric light the effect being weird and unearthly in the extreme At the same instant one of the lookouts in the bows who had still remained at his post and had probably been awakened from a quiet caulk by the awful portent suddenly shouted out in a ringing voice that thrilled through every heart on board Sail ho Captain Applegarth and the rest of us on the bridge faced round again at once Where away where away my man cried the skipper excitedly Where away Right ahead of us sir replied the man in an equally eager tone And not half a cable s length away My God exclaimed old Masters the boatswain whose grey hair seemed to stand on end with terror as we all now looked in the new direction indicated and saw a queer ghost like craft gliding along mysteriously in the same direction as ourselves and so close alongside that I could have chucked a biscuit aboard her without any difficulty That there be no mortal vessel that ever sailed the seas Mark my words Cap en Applegarth that there craft be either The Flying Dutchman as I ve often heard tell on but never seen meself or a ghost ship and Lord help us we be all doomed men CHAPTER SIX A CHAPTER OF ACCIDENTS Nonsense man cried Captain Applegarth Don t make such an ass of yourself Flying Dutchman indeed Why that cock and bull yarn was exploded years ago and I didn t think there was a sailor afloat in the present day ass enough to believe in this story I may be a hass sir I know I am sometimes retorted old Masters evidently aggrieved by the skipper speaking to him like this before the men But sir seein is believin There s this ship an there s that there craft a sailin alongside in the teeth o the gale Hass or no hass I sees that captain Hang it all man can t you see that it is only the mirage or reflection of our own vessel produced by the light of the meteor throwing her shadow on to the mass of cloud leeward Look there are our two old sticks and the funnels between with the smoke rushing out of them Aye and there too you can see this very bridge here we re standing on and all of us as large as life Why bo sun you can see your own ugly mug reflected now opposite us just as it would be in a looking glass Look man Aye I sees sir plain enuff though I m a hass said Masters at length But it ain t nat rel sir anyhow an I misdoubts sich skeary things I ain t been to sea forty years for nothin Captain Applegarth an I fears sich a sight as that betokens some danger ahead as ill happen to us some time or other this voyage Even started on a Friday sir as you knows on sir Rubbish cried the skipper angry at his obstinacy See the mirage has disappeared now that the meteor light has become dispersed Look smart there aloft and furl that topsail It s just seven bells and I m going to ease down the engines and bear up on our course again Up with you men and lay out on the yard The hands who had stopped half way up the fore rigging spell bound at the sight of the mirage now bestirred themselves shaking off their superstitious fears old Masters in the presence of something to be done also working and soon the sail was furled the bunt stowed and the gaskets passed It s no use our keeping on any longer after that ship of yours Haldane observed the skipper turning to me when the men had all come in from the topsail yard and scrambled down on deck again after making everything snug aloft If she were still afloat we must have overhauled her before this I really think youngster she must have been only a sort of will o the wisp like that we saw just now an optical illusion as I told you at the time recollect caused by some cross light from the afterglow of the sunset thrown upon the white mist which we noticed subsequently rising off the water Eh my boy Ah no captain I replied earnestly The ship I saw presented a very different appearance to that reflection of ours She was full rigged I told you sir and though her canvas was torn and she looked a bit knocked about in the matter of her tophamper she was as unlike our old Star of the North as a sailing vessel is unlike a steamer She might have been a derelict I saw a girl on her deck aft sir with a dog beside her as distinctly as I see you sir now Well well be that as it may my lad though I m very sorry for the poor young thing if she is still in the land of the living I can t carry on like this for ever If she were anywhere in sight it would be quite another matter but as it is not knowing whether we re on her right track or not we might scud on to the Equator without running across her again No no it wouldn t be fair to the owners or to ourselves indeed to risk the ship as well as the lives of all on board by continuing any longer on such a wild goose chase Very good sir said I on his pausing here as if waiting for me to say something We ve tried our best to come up with her at any rate We have that and I daresay a good many would call us foolhardy for carrying on as we ve done so long However I m going to abandon the chase now and bear up again on our proper course my boy and the devil of a job that will be I know in the teeth of this gale So saying the skipper grasping the handle of the engine room telegraph which led up through a tube at the end of the bridge signalled to those in charge below to slow down to half speed Down with the helm quartermaster he cried to the man at the wheel and at the same moment holding up his hand to attract the attention of old Masters who had returned to his station on the fo c s le greatly exercised in his mind by what had recently occurred he sang out in a voice of thunder that reached the knightheads and made the boatswain skip Haul in your jib sheet and flatten those staysails sharp I want to bring her round to the wind handsomely to prevent taking in another of those green seas aboard when we get broadside on Look smart bo sun and keep your eye on her Keep your eye on her d you hear It s ticklish work you know Look out sharp or she ll broach to Far as the eye could reach the storm tossed surface of the deep was white with foam white as a snowfield and boiling with rage and fury The bank of blue black cloud that had rested along the horizon to leeward had now melted away in some mysterious fashion or other and the sky became as clear as a bell only some wind driven scrap of semi transparent white vapour sweeping occasionally across the face of the pale sickly looking moon that looked down on the weird scene in a sort of menacing way while in lieu of the two or three odd sentinels that had previously peeped out from the firmament all the galaxies of heaven were at this moment in their myriads above spangling the empyrean from zenith to pole But the gale While running before the wind the wind although it had ballooned our sails out to bursting point brushing us along at a wild mad cap rate and buffeting the boisterous billows on either hand scooping them up from the depths of the ocean and piling them in immense waves of angry water that rolled after us striving to overwhelm us we could hardly even while taking advantage of it appreciate its awful and tremendous force On coming about however and facing it the case was vastly different the wind increasing tenfold in its intensity Where it had sung through the rigging it now shrieked and howled as if the air were peopled with demons while the waves lashed into fury dashed against our bows like battering rams rising almost to the level of our masthead where their towering crests met overhead Round came the old barquey s head slowly and more slowly still as she staggered against the heavy sea until all at once she stopped in stays unable apparently though struggling all she could to face her remorseless foe Luff up quartermaster roared the skipper to the top of his voice and dancing up and down the bridge in his excitement Luff you beggar luff I can t sir yelled the man in desperation a fresh hand who had come on duty to relieve Atkins at six bells The steam steering gear has broken down sir and I can t make her move By Jingo that s a bad job cried the skipper but he was not long at a nonplus Run aft Haldane and you too Spokeshave Loosen the bunt of the mizzen trysail and haul at the clew That ll bring her up to the wind fast enough if the sail only stands it To hear was to obey and both Spokeshave and I scuttled down the bridge ladder as quickly as we could and away along the waist of the ship aft the urgency of our errand hastening our movements if we had needed any spur beyond the skipper s sharp imperative mandate But speedily as we had hurried on mounting the poop ladder and rushing towards the bitts at the foot of the mizzenmast to cast off the bunt lines and clewlines of the trysail we found we had been already forestalled by an earlier arrival on the scene of action This was mister O Neil the second officer whom I had left below asleep in his cabin when I came up at two bells from the saloon he having been on duty all the afternoon and his services not being required again until night when he would have to go on the bridge to take the first watch from eight to midnight Feeling the bucketing about we were having in the trough of the sea when we came about and probably awakened by the change of motion just as a miller is supposed to be instantaneously roused by his mill stopping though he may be able to sleep through all the noise of its grinding when at work Garry O Neil had at once shoved himself into his boots and monkey jacket and rushed up on the poop through the companion and booby hatch that led up directly on deck from the saloon Arrived here he had evidently noted the vessel s insecurity and seamanlike had hit upon the very same way out of the difficulty that had suggested itself to the skipper having ere we reached his side cast off the ropes confining the folds of the trysail and trying singlehanded to haul out the clew Begorrah me bhoys ye ve come in the very nick o time he exclaimed on seeing us Here Spoke me darlint hang on to the end of this sheet and you Dick step on to the tail of it whilst I take a turn of the slack round that bollard Faith it s blo in like the dievle and we ll have our work cut out for us me bhoys to git a purchase on it anyhow Now all together yo heave ho Pull baker pull dievle With that bending our backs to it we all hauled away at the sheet succeeding by a great endeavour in stretching the clew of the sail to the end of the boom which we then secured amidships as best we could though the spar and sail combined jerked to such an extent that it seemed as if the mizzenmast would be wrenched out of the ship each instant the heavy fold of the canvas that hung loosely under the jaws of the gaff shaking and banging about with a noise like thunder Even the small amount of canvas exposed to the wind however was sufficient to supply the additional leverage required aft and the engines working at half speed with the headsails flattened the ship s bows were presently brought up to the wind when we lay to under easy steam Well done my lads sang out the skipper from the bridge when the ship s head was round and the peril of her broaching to in the heavy seaway been fortunately averted the wind was blowing aft of course and bringing his voice to us as if he stood by and shouting in our very ears Now look sharp and come here under the bridge I want you to cast off the lashings of the big wheel amidships and see that the yolk lines run clear We shall have to manhandle the helm and steer from below as the steam gear up here in the wheel house is hopelessly jammed and will take a month of Sundays to get right Aye aye sir we made answer under his nose having been scurrying forwards while he was speaking the Irish mate adding in his native vernacular Begorrah we ll rig up the whole sir in the twinkling of a bedpost sure Hullo exclaimed the skipper is that you O Neil Faith all that s lift of me sir How s that I was just going to send down to your cabin to rouse you out Begorrah its moighty little rousin I want sor The ould barquey s that lively that she d wake a man who d been d id for a wake sure I ve been so rowled about in me burth and banged agin the bulkheads that my bones fell loike jelly and I m blue mouldy all over But what d ye want cap en Sure I m helping the youngster with this whale here By jingo cried the skipper you re the right man in the right place Faith that s what the gaolor s id to the burghlor sor when he fixed him up noicely on the treadmill The skipper laughed Well you fix up your job all right and you ll be as good as your friend the gaoler he said When we have the helm all alaunto again we can bear up on our course and jog along comfortably I think we are lucky to have got off so lightly considering the wind and sea with this steering gear breaking down at such an awkward moment Ah we ain t seed the worse on it yet and you d better not holler till ye re out o the wood muttered old Masters under his breath in reply to this expression of opinion of the skipper the boatswain having come to our assistance with all the hands he could muster so as to get the wheel below the bridge in working order as soon as possible I knowed that this ghost ship meant sumkin and we ain t come to the end o the log yet Almost as he uttered the words mister Fosset came up the engine room hatchway and made his way hurriedly towards us By jingo Fosset here you are at last exclaimed the skipper on seeing him I thought you were never coming up again finding it so jolly warm and comfortable below Are things all right there now and are the bilge pumps working Captain Applegarth spoke jocosely enough everything being pretty easy on deck and the ship breasting the gale like a duck but mister Fosset s face I noticed looked grave and he answered the other in a more serious fashion than his general wont his mouth working nervously in the pale moonlight that lent him a more pallid air as the words dropped from his lips making his countenance indeed almost like that of a corpse But what man exclaimed the skipper impatiently interrupting his slow speech before mister Fosset could get any further Anything wrong eh Yes sir I m sorry to say something is very wrong I fear very wrong below replied the other sadly There has been a sad accident in the stoke hole Old Masters whose ears had been wide open to the conversation here nudged me with his elbow as I stood beside him and at the same time giving forth a grunt of deep and heartfelt significance I knowed summet ud happen he whispered in a sepulchral voice that sounded all the more gruesome from the attendant circumstances the shrieking wind tearing through the riggings the melancholy wash of the waves alongside the moaning and groaning of the poor old barquey s timbers as if she were in grievous pain while at that very moment the bell under the break of the fo c s le struck eight bells slowly as if tolling for a passing soul You seed the ghost ship mister Haldane the same as me for I saw it that I did CHAPTER SEVEN DISASTER ON DISASTER Accident in the stoke hold repeated the skipper who of course did not overhear the old boatswain s aside to me Accident in the stoke hold again repeated the skipper anybody hurt Yes sir replied the first mate in the same grave tone of voice mister Stokes and two of the firemen Seriously Not all sir said the other glancing round as if looking for some one specially The chief engineer has one of his arms broken and a few scratches but the firemen are both injured and one so badly hurt that I fear he won t get over it for his ribs have been crushed in and his lower extremities seem paralysed Good heavens exclaimed the skipper How did the accident happen They were searching under the stoke hold plates to get out some cotton waste that had got entangled about the rosebox of the suctions which as we found out prevented the bilge pumps from acting when all in a moment just when all the stray dunnage had been cleared out the ship gave a lurch and the plates buckled up catching the lot of them mister Stokes and all in a sort of rat trap mister Stokes tumbled forwards on his face in the water and was nearly drowned before Stoddart and I could pull him out the poor old chap was so heavy to lift and he nearly squashed Blanchard the stoker by falling on top of him as we were trying to raise him up cutting his head open besides against the fire bars Poor Jackson however the other fireman was gripped tight between two of the plates and it was all we could do to release him Stoddart having to use a jack saw to force the edges of the plates back My God horrible horrible ejaculated the skipper terribly upset and concerned Poor fellows Jackson too was the best hand Stokes had below Aye sir and as good a mechanic too I ve heard them say as any of the engineers agreed mister Fosset with equal feeling But sir I m losing time talking like this I only came up for assistance for the poor fellows and the others who are wounded Where s Garry O Neil Why he was here under the bridge a moment ago cried the skipper eagerly Hullo O Neil Pass the word up men for mister O Neil He s wanted at once Sharp look alive Our second officer it should be explained was not only a sailor but a surgeon as well He had run away to sea as a boy and after working his way up before the mast until he had acquired sufficient seamanship to obtain a mate s certificate he had at his mother s entreaty she having a holy horror of salt water abandoned his native element and studied for the medical profession at Trinity College Dublin Here after four years practice in walking the hospitals he graduated with full honours much to his mother s delight The old lady however dying some little time after he feeling no longer bound by any tie at home and having indeed sacrificed his own wishes for her sake incontinently gave up his newly fledged dignity of Doctor Garry O Neil returning to his old love and embracing once more a sea faring life which he has stuck to ever since He had sailed with us in the Star of the North now for over a twelvemonth in the first instance as third officer and for the last two voyages as second mate the fact of his being a qualified surgeon standing him in good stead and making him even a more important personage on board than his position warranted cargo steamers not being in the habit of carrying a medical man like passenger ships and sailorly qualities and surgical skill interchangeable characteristics Hitherto we had been fortunate enough to have no necessity for availing ourselves of his professional services but now they came in handy enough in good sooth mister O Neil sang out the men on the lower deck passing on his name in obedience to the skipper s orders from hand to hand till the hail reached the after hatchway down which Spokeshave roared with all the power of his lungs being anxious on his own account to be heard and so released from his watch so that he could go below mister O Neil he again yelled out Spokeshave must have shouted down the Irishman s throat for the next instant he poked his head up the hatchway Here I am bedad he exclaimed shoving past Master Conky to whom he had a strong dislike though Garry as we all called him was friendly with every one with whom he was brought in contact and was himself a great favourite with all the hands on board Now as he made his way towards the bridge where some of the men were still singing out his name he cried out Who wants me sure Now don t ye be all spaking at once one at a time me darlints as we all came into the wurrld Why where did you get to man said the skipper somewhat crossly We ve been hunting all over the ship for you Sure I wint down into the stowage to say if the yolklines and chains for the wheel were all clear and to disconnect the shtame stayrin gear replied our friend Garry But you ll find it all right now with the helm amidships and you can steer her wheriver you like only you ll want four hands at least to hauld the spokes steady if she breaks off as I fear she will in this say That s all right cried the skipper appeased at once for he evidently thought that Garry had gone back to his cabin and left us in the lurch But I ve bad news and sorry to say O Neil we want your services as a doctor now There s been a bad accident in the stoke hold and some of the poor fellows are sadly hurt Indade now ejaculated the other all attention What s the matter Any one scalded by the shtame sure No not that said mister Fosset taking up the tale mister Stokes has had his arm broken and another poor fellow been almost crushed to death He s now insensible or was when I came on deck so you d better take some stimulant as well as splints with you Faith I understand all right and will follow your advice in a brace of shakes replied the second mate as he rushed off towards the saloon You d better go on ahead Fosset and say I m coming With these parting words both he and the first officer disappeared from view the latter hastening back to the engine room while the captain slowly mounted the bridge ladder again and resumed his post there by the binnacle after placing four of the best hands at the wheel amidships with old Masters the boatswain in charge Ah what d ye think o that now observed the latter to me as I stood there awaiting my orders from the skipper or to hear anything he might have to say to me I said as how summut was sure to happen That there ship the ghost ship didn t come athwart our hawser for nothink I knowed Just then there was a call up the voicepipe communicating between the wheel house on the bridge and the engine room The skipper bent his ear to the pipe listening to what those below had to say and then came to the top of the ladder Below there he sang out Is mister Spokeshave anywhere about No sir I answered He went off duty at eight bells The devil he did and me in such a plight too with that awful accident below cried Captain Applegarth angrily I suppose he s thinking of his belly again the gourmandising little beast He isn t half a sailor or worth a purser s parings I ll make him pay for his skulking presently by Jingo However I can t waste the time now to send after him and you ll do as well Haldane better indeed I think All right sir said I eager for action I m ready to do anything That s a willing lad cried the skipper Now run down into Garry O Neil s cabin and get some lint bandages he says he forgot to take with him in his hurry leaving them on the top of his bunk by the doorway and tell Weston the steward to have a couple of spare bunks ready for the injured men in one of the state rooms aft will be best All right sir said I adding as he seemed to hesitate anything else sir Yes my boy take down a loose hammock with you and some lashings so as to make a sort of net with which to lift and carry poor Jackson He s the only chap badly hurt and unable to shift for himself so O Neil says Look sharp Haldane there s no time to lose the poor fellow s in a very ticklish state and they want to get him up on deck in order to examine his injuries better than they can below in the stoke hold Aye aye sir I answered darting aft immediately to avoid further debation towards the saloon door under the poop I m off sir at once Here I soon got what the Irishman had asked for out of his cabin and giving Weston his order about the state room unslinging the while my own hammock from its hooks and rolling it up blankets and all in a roll I kicked it before me as I made my way down the engine room hatchway as quickly as I could The machinery I noticed when passing through the flat to the stoke hold which was of course on a still lower level was working away pretty easily the piston in the cylinder moving steadily up and down and the eccentric which always appeared to me as a sort of bandy legged giant executing its extraordinary double shuffle in a more graceful fashion than when we were going at full speed as it performed its allotted task of curvetting the up and down motion of the piston into a circular one thus making the shaft revolve while Grummet the third engineer who was still watching the throttle valve hand on lever had a far easier job than previously when we were running with full power before wind and sea and rolling and pitching at every angle every minute But even in the fleeting glance I had passing by the screw still went round in a dangerous way when the stern of the vessel lifted as some big wave passed under her keel in spite of all Grummet s precautions in turning off steam and I could not help wondering how long the engines would stand the strain which was all the more perilous from being intermittent On reaching my destination below however all thought of the machinery and any possible damage to the ship was instantly banished from my mind by the sight that met my gaze In the narrow stoke hold lit up by the ruddy glare of the furnace fires the light from which enabled me to see the brackish bilge water washing about beneath the hole in the flooring and gurgling up through the broken portplates there I saw that a group of half naked firemen and others were bending over a pile of empty coal sacks heaped up against the further bulkhead dividing the occupied apartments from the main hold as far away as possible from the blazing fires on which one of the stokers on duty pitched occasionally a shovelful of fuel or smoothed the surface of the glowing embers with a long toothed rake I couldn t distinguish at first any one in particular the backs of all being towards me as I came down the slippery steel ladder carrying the hammock for I had taken the precaution of hoisting it on my shoulders on leaving the engine flat above in order to prevent its getting wet while the noise of the machinery overhead and the roar of the furnaces coupled with the washing of the water prevented my hearing any distant sound Presently however I recognised Garry O Neil s voice above the general din Clear off ye murthorin divvles he cried waving his arms above the heads of the crowd of onlookers as I could now see The poor chap wants air and ye re stayling the viry br ith out of his nosshrils Away wid ye all ye spalpeens or by the powers it s a pizening the howl batch of ye I ll be doin the next toime ye comes to me for pill or powdher The men clustering round him spread out moving nearer to me and they laughed at his comical threat which sounded all the more humorous from the Irishman s racy brogue which became all the more prominent when Garry was at all excited God knows though their merriment untimely as it might have sounded to outside ears betrayed no want of sympathy with their comrade They laughed as sailors will do sometimes holding their lives in their hands as is the practice of those who have to brave the manifold dangers of the deep below and aloft on shipboard even when standing on the brink of eternity As they moved away the fierce light from one of the open furnace doors was beating on their bare bodies and making them look indeed the very devils to whom the Irishman had jocularly likened them the latter looked up quickly saw me and beckoned me to approach nearer Arrah come along man with those bandages he said Sure ye moight have made em in the toime since I called up to the skipper Where are they now me darlint I produced the roll of lint at once from the pocket of my monkey jacket Hullo said he as he took and deftly proceeded to unroll the bundle of bandages what s that you ve got on your shoulders a rick A hammock sir I replied Cap en Applegarth told me to bring one down for lifting the poor chap who s so hurt and so I took my own which had blankets already in it thinking it would be warmer for him sir Begorrah the skipper s got his head screwed on straight and you the same too Haldane said he approvingly with a sagacious nod as he bent over the pile of sacks in the corner Come and see the poor fellow me bhoy There doesn t seem much loife lift in him sure hay There certainly did not to me he looked already dead Stretched out on the pile of dirty sacking in a half sitting half reclining position lay the recumbent figure or rather form of the unfortunate fireman Jackson his face as ghastly as that of a corpse while his rigid limbs and the absence of all appearance of respiration tended to confirm the belief that the spark of life had fled Stoddart the second engineer was kneeling beside the poor fellow rubbing his hands and holding every now and then to his nose what seemed to me a bottle of ammonia or some very pungent restorative the powerful fumes of which overcame the foetid atmosphere of the stoke hold mister Stokes looking almost as pale as the unconscious man assisting with his unwounded arm with which he lifted Jackson s head his broken one being already set in splints by our doctor mate Blanchard the other sufferer from the accident was sitting down on a bench near by evidently recovering from the shock he had experienced which really was not so serious as at first anticipated a rather stiff glass of brandy and water which Garry had given him having pretty soon brought him to himself All our attention therefore concentrated on Jackson who as yet made no sign of amendment in spite of every remedy tried by O Neil By George exclaimed mister Stokes a few minutes later when we all began to despair of ever bringing him back to life again I m sure I felt his head move then Aye sir corroborated Stoddart pressing his hand gently on Jackson s chest to feel his heart where a slight convulsive movement became perceptible at first feeble and uncertain enough as you may suppose but then more and more sustained and regular as if the lungs were getting to work again Look alive he s beginning to breathe again and yes his heart beats I declare quite plain Hurray shouted Garry O Neil hastily putting to his patient s lips a medicine glass into which he dropped something out of a small vial filling up the glass with water I ve got something here shtrang enough begorrah to make a dead man spake The effect of the drug whatever it was seemed magical In an instant the previously motionless figure moved about uneasily the pulsation of his chest grew more rapid and pronounced and then stretching out his clenched hands with a jerk as if he were suddenly galvanised into life thereby displaying the magnificent proportions of his torso he being stripped to the waist Jackson opened his eyes drawing a deep breath the while a breath something between a sob and a sigh Where where am I he said looking round with a sort of far away dreamy stare but meeting mister Stokes sympathetic gaze he at once seemed to recover his consciousness Ah I know sir I found out what was the matter with the suction before that plate buckled and gripped me I have cleared the rose box too sir and you can connect the bilge pumps again as soon as you like sir Of course all this took him some time to get out All right my man answered the old chief greatly overcome at the fact of the old sailor wounded to the death thinking of his duty in the first moment of his recovery Never mind that man How do you feel now my poor fellow better I trust Why just a little pain here sir said Jackson pressing his hand to his right side I m thankful though my legs escaped sir I ve no pain there Garry O Neil looked grave and shook his head at this and looking too as he cast down his eyes over the lower part of the unfortunate man s body I saw that the cruel edges of the iron plates had torn away part of his canvas overalls from the thigh to the knee of one leg peeling off with the covering the flesh from the bone while the foot of the other boot and all was crushed into a shapeless bloody mass horrible to behold the sight making one feel sick It s a bad sign his having no fayling there Haldane whispered the Irishman to me very low so that Jackson could not hear It s jost what I thought sure God may help him but I can t He ll niver recover do what we moight for him niver in this worruld The poor misfortunate fellow has his spoine injured and he can t live forty eight hours if as long as that sure He did not tell him this however nor did he lead any of the others to understand either that Jackson s case was hopeless On the contrary when he spoke aloud as he did immediately afterwards he seemed in the best of spirits as if everything was going on as well as possible though I noticed a tear in his eye and a quiver in his voice that touched me to the heart making me turn away my head Now you mustn t talk now old fellow for we want you to husband all your strength to get up the hatchway to a foine cabin of yer own on the upper deck where we re goin to nurse ye me darlint till ye re all roight sure he said cheerfully Here now just dhrink another drop of the craythur me bhoy to kape yer spirits up and you Master Haldane jist hand over that hammock ye ve got storved away on ye shulder so that we can fix up Jackson comfortable like for his trip to the upper reggins So saying the good hearted Irishman busied himself with the help of Stoddart who was equally gentle in handling the poor fellow getting him ready for removal and when he had been carefully placed in the hammock and covered with the blanket the two of them both being strong and powerful men they lifted their burden with the utmost tenderness and carried him upward to the main deck where he was put into a berth in one of the state rooms that the steward had prepared and every attention paid him mister Fosset and I helped up Blanchard the other fireman he luckily not requiring to be carried and we then went down for mister Stokes who had refused to leave the stoke hold until his men had been attended to Propping up the stout old chap behind so that he could not slip back down the slippery steel ladder as he only had the one arm now to hold on by the three of us reached the level of the engine room all right the chief resting here a moment to give a look round and a word to Grummet who of course was still in charge telling him to slow down still further and use all his spare steam for clearing the bilge as the sluice valves had been opened to prevent the fires being flooded out and the pumps were in good working order again Grummet promised to attend carefully to these directions and a host of others I cannot now recollect poor mister Stokes being as fussy and fidgetty as he was fat and in the habit of unintentionally worrying his subordinates a good deal in this way and the three of us again started on our way upwards the old chief leading as before and mister Fosset and I bringing up the rear very slowly so as to prevent accident when all at once there was a fearful crash that echoed through my brain followed by a violent concussion of the air which nearly threw us all down the engine room ladder though mister Fosset and I were both hanging on to it like grim death and supporting the whole weight of mister Stokes between us At the same instant too the crank shaft stopped revolving all motion of the machinery ceased and the hatchway with all the space around us was filled by a dense cloud of hot steam CHAPTER EIGHT ANCHORED Nor was this the worst for hardly had we begun to draw breath again in the stifling vapour bath like atmosphere surrounding us ere we could utter a cry indeed or exchange a word of speech with reference to what had just occurred there arose a sudden and violent oscillation of the vessel which pitched and rolled and then heeled over suddenly to port while an avalanche of water came thundering down the hatchway on top of our heads Good Lord we re lost gulped out mister Stokes as we all floundered together on the grating forming the floor of the engine room where fortunately the flood had washed us instead of hustling us down the stoke hold below where all three of us would most inevitably have been killed by the fall A boiler s burst and the ship broached to Not quite so bad as that sir sang out the voice of Grummet in the distance the thick vapour lending it a far away sound The vessel is recovering herself again and the cylinder cover s blown off sir that s all All indeed exclaimed the old chief in a despairing tone as he staggered to his feet enabling mister Fosset and myself to rise up too an impossibility before as he was right on top of us and had served us out worse than the water had done Quite enough damage for me and all of us I think How s your arm mister Stokes asked mister Fosset as the atmosphere cleared a little and the engine room lights glimmered through the misty darkness that now enveloped the place I hope it hasn t been hurt by your tumble Oh damn my arm cried the other impatiently evidently more anxious about the machinery than his arm Have you shut off the steam Yes sir replied his subordinate calmly I closed all the stop valves up here the moment I knew what had happened and the men below in the stoke hold have cut off the supply from the main pipe while mister Links has gone into the screw well to disconnect the propeller Very good Grummet So they be all right down below All right sir Thank God for that How about the fires Drowned out sir all but the one under the fire boiler on the starboard side You d better look after that to keep the bilge pumps going or else it ll be all drowned out with this lot of water coming down the hatchway every time the ship rolls I do hope the skipper will lie to and keep her head to sea until we can get the engines going again though I m afraid that ll be a long job Before Grummet could reply to this Stoddart the second officer or rather engineer came scrambling down from the saloon where he had been assisting Garry O Neil in making poor Jackson comfortable the escape of the steam having evidently told its own tale to an expert like himself Although a younger man than mister Stokes his brains were considerably sharper and he was a better mechanic in every way so now when after examining the damage done to the cylinder he made light of the accident instead of groaning over it like the old chief mister Fosset I could see and with him myself also who shared his belief saw that the injury was not irreparable and that it might certainly have been worse Of course it can t be done in a day Stoddart said still it can be patched up That s all very well interposed mister Stokes holding to his despondent view of the situation But I d like to know how you re going to get that cracked cover off the cylinder with the vessel rolling like this Oh I ll manage that easy enough said the energetic fellow in his confident way I ve done worse jobs than that in a heavy sea Why I ll lash myself to the cylinder if it comes to the worse and unscrew the cover nut by nut shifting my berth round till I have it off Then if Grummet will see to getting the portable forge ready and some old sheet iron or boiler plates for working and making into a patch and if Links will turn out some new bolts and screws with the lathe we ll have everything in working order before we know where we are Bravo my hearty cried mister Fosset lending Stoddart a hand to lash himself to the cylinder while Grummet held a screw wrench and other tools up to him You ought to be a sailor you re so smart I prefer my own billet retorted the other with an air of conscious power I am an engineer mister Fosset laughed All right said he good humouredly Every one to his trade Humph groaned mister Stokes who was leaning against the bulkhead looking very white about the gills as Grummet whispered to me The steam gradually dispersing and the lights burning more brightly enabled us to see his face better I suppose there s nothing I can do No nothing sir answered Stoddart busy at the moment with the first nut of the cylinder cover You can very safely leave matters to Grummet and me And mister O Neil told me as I left the maindeck that you ought to go to your cabin and lie down so as to rest your arm or it might mortify he says when he would not answer for the consequences you understand sir Ah that settles the matter I won t give our amateur sawbones a chance of lopping it off as I daresay he d like said poor mister Stokes with a feeble attempt at a joke Yes I d better go to my cabin for I see I m not wanted here and to tell the truth I ve an aching all over me and feel rather tired and faint Then off you go to the doctor at once cried mister Fosset catching hold of him by his uninjured arm and leading him towards the hatchway again the ship being pretty steady for the moment You and I too Haldane ought to be on deck helping the skipper and the rest instead of stopping here hindering these smart fellows at their work Come along with me my lad Leaving mister Stokes at the door of the saloon in charge of Weston the steward the first mate and I proceeded along the waist to the bridge where we found Captain Applegarth pacing up and down in his customary jerky impatient way like the Polar bear in the Zoological Gardens as I always thought Well he said to mister Fosset bringing himself up short in front of the rail on our approach how are matters getting on below badly I m afraid The first mate explained Spokeshave who was at the other end of the bridge coming up to listen as usual to the conversation That s good news indeed said the skipper on hearing how Stoddart had set to work to repair the damage I thought the engines were completely broken down If it weren t for poor Jackson who O Neil told me just now was in a bad way I think we d got out of the scrape pretty well for the old barquey is comfortable enough now and though there s a heavy sea running and it is still blowing stiff from the north ard and the west ard the sky is clearer than it was and I fancy we ve seen the worst of the gale eh I m sure I hope so sir replied mister Fosset not committing himself to any definite expression of opinion in the matter It has given us a rare good doing all round while it was about it at an rate Aye it has that said the skipper The old barquey though has come through it better than any one would have supposed with all that deadweight amidships considering that she broached to awhile ago and got caught in the trough of the sea the very moment the machinery below gave out By George Fosset we had a narrow squeak then I can tell you I can quite believe that sir said the other looking round about and aloft sailor like as he spoke For my part I feared the worst I m sure However all s well that ends well and the old barquey looks first rate as you say sir in spite of all she s gone through She rides like a cork She certainly was a capital seaboat and lay to now as easily as if she were at anchor in the Mersey though the wind was whistling through the rigging and the ocean far and wide white with foam bowing and scraping to the big waves that rolled in after her like an old dowager duchess in a ball room curtseying to her partner During the long time the first mate and I had been down below in the stoke hold the skipper had lowered the upper yards and housed her top masts getting her also under snugger canvas the fore and mizzen topsails being set scandalised as we call it aboard ship that is with the heads of the sails hauled up and their sheets flattened taut as boards so as to expose as little surface as possible to the wind only just sufficient to keep the vessel with her head to sea like a stag at bay Opportunity had also been taken I noticed to secure the broken engine room skylight in a more substantial way than formerly and so prevent any more green seas from flooding the hold the opening having been planked over by the carpenter and heavy bars of railroad iron which formed part of our cargo laid across instead of the tarpaulin that was deemed good enough before and had given way when mister Stokes poor man and the first mate and myself got washed down the hatchway by a wave that came over the side crumpling the flimsy covering as if it were tissue paper Altogether the outlook was more reassuring than when I had gone below for although a fierce northerly gale was howling over the deep making it heave and fret and lashing it up into wild mountainous billows the heaven overhead was clear of all cloud and the complaisant moon which was at the full but shining with a pale peaceful light while numerous stars were twinkling everywhere in the endless expanse of the firmament above gazing down serenely at the riot of the elements below It was now close on midnight and Garry O Neil came on deck to take the middle watch it being his turn of duty Well doctor said the skipper anxious to hear something about the invalids how re your patients Both going on capitally Jackson sleeping quietly sir though he can t last out long poor fellow And mister Stokes Faith he s drivin his pigs to market in foine stoil you should only hear him cap en answered the Irishman looking out to windward Begorrah ain t it blowin though sir Sure as we used to say at ould Trinity de gustibus non est disputandum which means Mister Spokeshave as yo re cockin up your nose to hear what I m after sayin it s moighty gusty an there s no denyin it The skipper laughed as he generally did at Garry s nonsensical queer sayings By George O Neil I must go down and have a glass of grog to wash the taste of that awful pun out of my mouth he cried turning to leave the bridge for the first time since he had come up there at sunset You can call me if anything happens or should it come to blow worse but I shall be up and down all night to see how you re getting on Och the divvle dout ye muttered the Irishman in his quizzing way as the skipper went down the ladder giving a word to the boatswain and man at the wheel below as he passed them on his way up Ye niver give a chap the cridit of keeping a watch to himself Soon after this I too left the deck and turned in Garry O Neil telling me he did not want me on the bridge and that I had better sleep while I could a permission I readily availed myself of tired out with all I had gone through and the various exciting episodes of the evening There was no change in the weather the following morning the wind even blowing with greater force and the sea such as I had never seen it before and such a sea as I hope never to experience again so in order that the ship might ride the more easily and those below in the engine room better able to go on with the repair of the cylinder than they could with the old barquey pitching her bows under and then kicking up her heels sky high varying her performances by rolling side to side violently like a pendulum gone mad the skipper had all our spare spars lashed together and attaching a stout steel wire hawser to them launched the lot overboard through a hole in the bulwarks where one of the waves had made a convenient clean sweep veering the hawser ahead with this jetsam to serve as a floating anchor for us and moor the ship By this means we all had a more comfortable time of it the old barquey no longer shipping water in any considerable quantity and there being less work below in the way of clearing it all of the bilge pumps fortunately for us all Stoddart and the engine room staff were able to keep going otherwise we must have foundered long since The gale continued without abatement all that day and the next the second since our mishap when late in the afternoon the wind began to go down veering from the north west to the north and so on back to the eastern quadrant Soon after this just before it got dark an English man of war hove in sight and seeing our disabled condition signalled to ask whether we required any assistance Through the clumsiness of mister Spokeshave who had charge of our signal department and showed his cleverness by hoisting the very numbers of the flags giving the skipper s reply that though our engines were temporarily broken down they were fast being repaired the captain of the man of war could not understand him and so fearing the worst ranged up under our stern to see what help he could render in what he evidently considered from Spokeshave s hoist to be a pressing emergency Ship ahoy he shouted through a speaking trumpet from his quarter deck aft which was on a level with our bridge the vessel a splendid cruiser of the first class towering over the comparatively puny dimensions of the poor broken down Star of the North Shall I send a boat aboard with assistance No thank you very much replied our skipper taking off his cap and returning the greeting of the naval officer We ve got over the worst of it now sir and will be soon under weigh again as the weather is breaking Glad to hear it returned the other who could read our name astern as she lay athwart us Where are you bound to New York sir sang out the skipper Twelve days out from England We ve been disabled forty eight hours Hope your engines will soon be in working order sang out the handsome officer from the deck of the man of war giving some other order at the same minute for I heard the shrill sound of a boatswain s pipe and the rattle of feet along her deck Please report us when you reach your destination What name sir Her Majesty s ship Aurora on passage from Bermuda to Halifax With that he waved his hand and her white ensign whose blood red cross of Saint George stood out in bold relief dipped in parting salute to our vessel which reciprocated the compliment as the man of war bore away on her course to the northward a group of officers rollicking round their captain on her deck aft and gazing at us as she moved off rapidly under a full pressure of steam evidently admiring our skipper s wonderful sea anchor As the noble ship glided away through the still tempestuous sea against a strong headwind a thing of beauty and of might such a contrast to us lying there almost at the mercy of the seas I could not help thinking of the wondrous power of mind over matter displayed in our grand ocean steamers and what a responsibility rests upon their engineers How little do the thousands of passengers who yearly go to and fro across the Atlantic know or indeed care to know that their comfort and the rate at which they travel through the water they who talk so glibly of making the passage in such and such a time be the sea smooth or rough and the wind fine or contrary that all this depends on the unceasing vigilance of the officers in charge of the vessel in which they voyage Do they even think I wondered that while they are sleeping eating enjoying themselves and doing what they please on board even grumbling at some little petty defect or shortcoming which they think might be prevented the engineers below in an atmosphere in which they could not breathe are incessantly watching the movements of the machinery and oiling each part at almost every instant of time moving this slide and that adjusting a valve here and tightening a nut there ever cooling the bearings and raking at the furnaces and putting on fresh coal this being done every hour of the day and night through the passage from land to land Have any of them realised the fact that these same engineers and their able assistants the firemen and oilmen and trimmers the whole stoke hold staff so to speak run a greater risk of their lives in the event of an accident happening than any one else in the ship as should a boiler or cylinder burst they may be scalded to death before the noise of the explosion could reach those above Or again should the vessel strike on a rock the compartment below in which perforce they are compelled to work deep down in the vessel s bowels will fill from the very weight of the engines quicker than any other part of the ship most probably when those confined below must necessarily be liable to be drowned like rats in a hole without the chances of escape possessed by the passengers and hands on board No I don t suppose any one even thinks of such things said I to myself as I left the bridge and went towards the saloon to ask how poor Jackson was uttering my thoughts unconsciously aloud as I reflected and now that I considered their responsibility thought how much poor old mister Stokes with his broken arm and Stoddart and the others must have on their minds Hullo who is that It was Weston the steward who spoke I wish you d come and look at Jackson sir he said The poor chap wore all right when mister O Neil comed down jist now and a sleepin still as when you seed him awhile ago But all of a suddink he starts up as he hears you a comin down the companion way sir and is jabbering away like anythink Oh but I exclaimed why did you leave him I wor afeard he d jump overboard or try to do somethink awful Nonsense the very thing you are there for to prevent said I going into the cabin where I saw the poor fellow trying to get out of the cot Turning angrily to Weston I repeated again You shouldn t have left him for one moment in this state But sir I wanted to hail mister O Neil or somebody I thought I oughter ave summun by to elp me in case he becomed desperate like and I couldn t make no one hear on deck and that s why I comed when I knowed you was a passing along sir This was unanswerable logic though Weston always had an answer for anything and everything Poor Jackson though did not look as if he would be desperate again in any shape or form That he was delirious I could see at a glance for his eyes great wild eyes were wide open staring at vacancy fixed on the bulkhead that divided the cabin from the captain s which was just beyond and he was very much excited sitting up in the cot and gesticulating violently with both his hands and waving his arms about as he repeated some unintelligible gibberish over and over again that I could not make out Presently he looked at me very straight as if he recognised me and afterwards spoke a little more coherently Ah yes sir I recollect now he said at last You re mister Haldane I know but where s the little girl and the the dog Why Jackson old man I said speaking soothingly to him what s the matter with you There s no girl or dog you know here Don t you know where you are my poor fellow He got quite savage at this There s no reason in delirium Of course I know where I am he screamed out making a grab at Weston as he writhed in torture from the internal and violent inflammation which must have set up I m in hell I can feel I am I am burning all over inside me here And you Oh yes I know you This paroxysm left him again after a moment and he lay back on his pillows only to sit up the next minute again however He now pointed his finger in the direction of the sea through the porthole gazing earnestly as if he saw something there The ship has come for me again as it did t other night you know you know he said in agonised whispers There there can t you see it now sailing along as Mister Haldane said there with a a signal of distress flying the flag half mast high Why there it is now as plain as plain can be and see see they re lowering a boat look for me to take me aboard Lend us a hand mate I wants to halloo to em and I feels so bad and I can t I can t move myself Hi there Ship ahoy Wait a minute can t you Ship ahoy I m coming I m comi ing I m Then raising his eyes to heaven and drawing a long deep breath something between a sob and a sigh a breath that was his last poor Jackson fell back on the pile of pillows behind him stone dead CHAPTER NINE WE SIGHT THE STRANGE CRAFT AGAIN That s number one said old Masters the boatswain meeting me at the door of the saloon as I came out on deck Weston having already told him the sad news Master Stokes ll foller next and then you or hi Master Haldane for we be all doomed men I know arter seein that there ghost ship I made no reply to the superstitious old seaman s ominous prediction but as I made my way forward to the bridge to inform Captain Applegarth and the others of what had happened I could not help thinking how strange it was that poor Jackson should have recalled at the very moment the spirit was quitting his crippled body the fact of my sighting the ship in distress and the account I had given the skipper of what I had seen on board that mysterious craft mister Fosset or some of the hands who accompanied him must have taken down the yarn to the stoke hold only just before the unfortunate man met with his terrible accident though I had no doubt that he must have seen the man of war through the port hole of the cabin which was right opposite his bunk as she brought up under our stern to speak to us earlier in the afternoon and the sight of HMS Aurora had somehow or other amid the wanderings of his unconscious brain got mixed up with the remembrance of what he had previously heard concerning the vessel I had seen at sunset the two days prior It was now getting dark the evening closing in quickly and what with the dying man s queer talk and the boatswain harping on the same theme immediately afterwards I confess I felt far from comfortable my nerves being in a state of constant tension from the painful scene in the cabin that I had just witnessed while the gloomy shades of the night that were fast enwrapping us the dull roar of the ever breaking sea and the groaning of the ship as she rolled like a living creature in pain all worked on my overtried fancy and made me almost afraid of my own shadow as I slipped and stumbled along the sloppy deck my mind being in a complete whirl till I reached my goal the bridge What s the matther me bhoy asked Garry O Neil who was speaking to the skipper the two examining a chart in the wheel house the light from the doorway of which fell on my face Faith ye look quite skeared Haldane jist as if ye d sane a ghoast sure I mentioned what had happened however and he at once dropped his chaffing manner looking as grave as a judge Begorrah it s moighty sorry I am to hear that now said he in a more serious tone Sure and he was a foine h ilthy man entirely barrin that accident bad cess to it He moight have lived till a hundred an then aunly died of auld age for he d the constitution of an illiphent Faith I never saw such a chist and thorax on a chap in me loife before Poor fellow observed the skipper He seems to have gone off awfully sudden at the last I thought you said he was getting on well when you went down to see him awhile ago Bedad I did that sir father s no denyin it answered the Irishman off hand But I niver s id he d git over it cap en I tuld ye from the first he couldn t reciver for he was paralysed poor craytur from the waist downwards and had a lot of internal injury besides It was aunly bekase he was sich a shtrang man that he s lasted so long sir Any one else would have died directly outright afther the accident for he was pretty well smashed to pieces Strange muttered Captain Applegarth who although hasty of temper sometimes was a man of deep feeling Sunday night again and that man dead Only a week ago this very evening he came up to me here as I was standing by the binnacle to ask about some carpenter s stores that were wanted in the engine room He and I then got talking I recollect it being Sunday I suppose of religious matters He imagined himself poor chap a materialist as they call themselves but his arguments on the point were very weak He argued that there was no hereafter no future state the heaven and hell spoken of in Scripture he suggested being the happiness or punishment we meet with below here while living in accordance with our own lives Faith said Garry O Neil who was not a deep thinker not troubling himself much about anything beyond the present That s a puzzling question but I for one wouldn t care to be of that way of thinkin sure sir That question however poor Jackson has solved long ere this As Captain Applegarth uttered these words solemnly enough the fireman s ravings when in the agonies of death came back to me and I thought that if confident in his materialism when in health and strength his creed had not altogether eased his mind at the last when I saw him raise his eyes for a few minutes to heaven in prayer That night the gale which had moderated considerably during the afternoon assailed us again with renewed vigour as if old Boreas had put a fresh hand to the bellows as sailor folk say It began in the middle watch when the wind suddenly veered to the southwards and it came on to blow great guns causing the skipper the utmost uneasiness as he feared we would break away from our spar anchor when disabled as we were a steamer in a storm without the use of the engines being no better off than a baby in arms deprived of its nurse it seemed almost impossible to prevent the vessel from broaching to in which case she would more than likely founder with all hands Consequently not a soul turned in the livelong night the port and starboard watches both remaining on duty with Captain Applegarth and mister Fosset on the bridge while Garry O Neil relieved the boatswain who now had eight men under him in charge of the wheel where the utmost caution and the greatest vigilance were necessary to keep the old barquey s head to the sea I had fearfully hard work too for the big waves ever and anon leapt up over her bows burying the fo c s le in clouds of spray and spent water that came pouring down into the waist and rushing aft flooding the whole deck almost up to the gunwhales taking everything movable overboard the boats being lifted off the chocks amidships even and swept away and the cook s galley in the forward part of the deckhouse got badly damaged This was in the height of the storm just before daybreak about two bells in the morning watch or five o clock AM Our poor old barquey then rolled so much that the skipper thought the wire hawser attached to the spars had parted and that we were at the very mercy of the tempest So certain indeed was he that he yelled out for all hands to make sail with the idea of trying one last desperate venture and beard the winds with our puny canvas Fortunately however there was no need for us to essay this futile expedient breaking the force of the billows as they reared up in their colossal grandeur to annihilate us and keeping us steadily facing their attack and presently shortly after six bells when we really experienced pretty nearly the worst of it there was a muttered growl of thunder accompanied by a lightning flash that illuminated the whole of the heavens from pole to pole and then rain came down in a deluge the wind dropping as suddenly with a wild weird shrill shriek of disappointed rage that wailed and whistled through the rigging and then quietly died away Of course the sea did not quiet down all at once old Neptune not being easily pacified after being stirred up to so great an extent and the waves ran high most of the day while the sky was overcast and the ocean of a dull leaden colour but towards evening it cleared up and the water being a bit calmer the captain thought it a fitting time to bury poor Jackson All the hands were mustered on deck the engineers and stokers stopping their busy repairing work below which they had kept at night and day without intermission ever since our breakdown and coming up with the rest of the crew to pay the last tribute of respect to their departed comrade even mister Stokes though he was still in a very weak state of health and had his head and broken arm bandaged up insisting on being present Garry O Neil and Stoddart supporting him between them for the purpose Then the body of the unfortunate fireman enclosed in a hammock covered by the ship s ensign and having a pig of ballast tied to the feet to ensure its submersion was brought up from the cabin where he had died and placed on a plank by the gangway where the waves had washed away our bulwarks leaving a wide open space Captain Applegarth read over the remains the beautiful prayers of the Church Service appointed for the burial of those who die at sea all of us standing bareheaded around A faint gleam of light from the setting sun away on our port bow shone through a mist of cloud that obscured the horizon to windward and as this disappeared the skipper came to the end of the viaticum when at a signal from the boatswain the plank was tipped and poor Jackson s body was committed to the deep with a sigh of regret at his untimely end and the devout hope that though his earthly voyage had been cut short he might yet reach that haven where there are no accidents nor shipwrecks and where seas swallow not up or stormy winds blow Some little while after this a slight breeze sprang up from the southward and westward bringing a cool feeling with it and I shivered as I stood on the bridge looking out over the dark waste of waters feeling rather melancholy if the truth be told That s a bad sign Master Haldane said old Masters close to my ear making me jump for I did not know he was there They say that when a ship chap shivers like that there it be meaning that somebody or summit be a walking over his grave Stave that bo sun I cried impatiently You re a regular old Jonah and enough to give a fellow the creeps Ah you may try to laugh it off Mister Haldane he retorted in his lugubrious way But as I says to ye last night says I when that poor chap kicked the bucket as we ve just been a burying on we ain t seen the end on it yet I misdoubts the weather too sir There s a great bank of cloud now rising up to win ard and I fancies I heard jist now the sound o thunder ag in Thunder I exclaimed Nonsense No Mister Haldane it ain t no nonsense said the old fellow solemnly You ain t known me to croak afore without re sin and I tells ye I don t likes the look o things to night There s summit a brewin up over there or I m a Dutchman What s that bo sun cried the skipper coming up on the bridge at the moment to look for the chart of the North Atlantic which he had left in the wheel house the night before and overheard the old growler s remark Got the Flying Dutchman on the brain again No sir I weren t talking o that replied Masters I was a saying to Master Haldane that it were precious misty and thick to win ard and I feared thunder over there Thunder thunder your grandmother cried the skipper testily I ve pretty sharp ears bo sun and I have heard none to night Have you Haldane N n o sir not thunder I answered listening attentively for a moment Stay sir though I do hear something now but the sound seems more like firing in the distance What guns No sir more like rifle shots or the discharge of a revolver firing quickly at intervals Captain Applegarth thereupon listened attentively too in his turn while Masters went out to the end of the bridge and peered out over the side to windward with rapt gaze By George yes you re right boy cried the skipper the next moment I can hear the shots quite plainly I do believe Hullo there What the deuce is going on over there I wonder There was reason for exclamation At that instant the dark mass of cloud on the horizon towards which we were all looking was rent by a flash and we could see standing against the black background in vivid relief the masts and spars of a large full rigged ship She was evidently burning a flare up to attract attention and ere the light waned I noticed that her yards were all a cock bill and her sails and rigging torn and disordered while stranger still she had her flag astern hoisted half mast high the French tricolour too Both the boatswain and I simultaneously involuntarily uttered a cry of dismay The vessel in sight was the very identical ship I had seen three nights before flying the same signal of distress and here she was now sailing as then four points off our weather bows and eight before the wind which was as I ve already said blowing a light breeze from the southward and westward What new calamity did this second appearance of the ghost ship as the old boatswain called her portend to all of us Aye what indeed Time alone could tell CHAPTER TEN MYSTIFICATION Old Masters turned his face towards me as the fleeting vision became swallowed up in the darkness that now obscured the sky to the westwards and I saw that he looked horror struck staring into space spell bound As for me I cannot express what I felt because I am unable to describe it fully There there I exclaimed clutching Captain Applegarth s arm in nervous horror There she is again But the skipper although startled by the sudden appearance of the mysterious vessel in the first instance as his ejaculation on catching sight of her showed evidently did not regard her in the same light as the boatswain and myself Why Haldane what s the matter with you my lad he said in a joking way You seem all of a tremble and by George you grip tight I beg your pardon sir I m sure I stammered out trying to pull myself together as I released his arm But but did you did you see her sir See that ship just now Yes of course I did I suppose she sighted us lying here like a log and wanted us to report her or something though why they lit that flare up over her stern I am sure I can t imagine They couldn t expect us to read her name at that distance She must have been close on five miles off But sir I cried out quickly She s the same The same what Haldane Why the ship in distress sir that I sighted at sunset on Friday night just before our breakdown Captain Applegarth whistled through his teeth My good lad he said incredulously that s simply impossible Well sir you may not believe me I urged rather nettled that he should put me down in this way but I declare to you she is the identical vessel I saw that evening as I told you at the time and of which we went in chase till the gale stopped us and our machinery gave out I cannot doubt the evidence of my own eyes sir My dear boy replied the skipper in kinder tones than I expected to this outburst for he was a hot tempered man generally and disliked anything like argument from his officers when he had once said his say being of the opinion that his word should be last Just reflect a moment and let your own natural good sense decide the point How can it be likely that the vessel you asserted you saw on Friday night hundreds of miles away from here should come across us now under precisely similar circumstances considering all that has happened since She s the same ship sir nevertheless I maintained stubbornly though I was a bit puzzled on my own account mind by his putting the case so strongly The vessel I saw on Friday night was a full rigged ship with her sails knocked about and had her ensign hoisted half mast high at the peak and this one seemed the same in every particular I did not notice all that when she burnt the flare up just now The light only lasted an instant There is something in that certainly Haldane answered the skipper wavering a little I thought in his ideas Still when one is inclined to believe in a thing the imagination is often a great aid in turning a wish into a certainty Besides sir I continued wishing to clench my argument if we were driven out of our course by the gale she might have been similarly affected and the winds and currents might have brought us together again That s possible but not probable he rejoined I ve known two bottles of the same weight dropped overboard from the same ship at the same hour and Well sir One was found landed on the Lofoden Isles off the coast of Norway the other came ashore at Sandy Point in the Straits of Magellan He laughed when he said this apparently thinking he had utterly settled the matter but I checkmated him with his own theory The very uncertainty of the action of the currents of the Atlantic which you instance sir I said shows that what you think impossible might be very possible and the strange weird vessel that I saw three nights ago might have come within sight of us again That s one for you Haldane acknowledged the skipper very good naturedly for he was a fair man when anything was laid clearly before him But recollect no one saw this ship distinctly but yourself I couldn t say of my own knowledge what rig she was and I certainly didn t see any flag or sign of distress I only saw something that looked like a ship burning a flare up in the distance that s all Beg pardon sir whispered old Masters stepping up and touching his cap ere he addressed the skipper but I seed the ghost ship too sir the same as Master Haldane sir The skipper wheeled round and stared at him Ghost ship man What do you mean I means that there ghost ship that hove in sight jist now and which have passed us afore sir She be sent as a warning to us I knows and as a Christian man Cap en Applegarth I takes it as sich The old seaman spoke so earnestly that the skipper although he had hard work to keep himself in answered him without ridiculing his extraordinary delusion as he held it to be I am a Christian man too I hope bo sun he said I believe in a divine power above and put my trust in a merciful providence but I can t believe in any of your queer supernatural visitations whether as warnings or what not Not if you seed the same blessed thing three times No not if I saw it a hundred times he roared out impatiently Ah seein is believin I says whined old Masters not a whit shaken on the point in spite of the skipper s scepticism Master Haldane seed it and I seed it and poor Jackson seed it Indeed cried the skipper I did not know he had been on deck before the accident It wore arter that sir that he seed the ghost ship said the old boatswain in reply to the implied question It were jist afore he died Just before he died repeated Captain Applegarth indignantly as if he thought he was being made a fool of Why man the poor fellow was out of his mind then and besides never stirred out of his cabin Ah but he had the warnin jist the same for Weston it was told me as how Jackson seed the ship and cried out when he lay there a dyin Bulkheads can t keep sperrits out sir Nor in either as I know to my cost returned the skipper drily Your friend Weston is pretty familiar with them if they come in his way I fancy Stuff and nonsense bo sun how can you believe such rubbish The other night you imagined the reflection of our own vessel when that meteor came by to be a ghost ship as you call it in your absurd folly and to night when that craft to win rd passed and lit a flare up hanged if you aren t at it again with your ghost ship By George it makes me sick Masters to think that a grown man and a good seaman like yourself should be such a confounded ass Hass or no hass there she wer said the old fellow doggedly But here comes mister Fosset sir He were on the poop aft when that vessel passed as I speaks on Ax him what he thinks of her and if she weren t the same full rigged ship as Master Haldane and all of us seed I will replied Captain Applegarth promptly and on the first mate approaching nearer he hailed him I say Fosset what did you think of that ship just now The other s answer however bewildered the skipper more than Masters and I had done previously Ship said the first mate What ship That vessel that lit the flare up awhile ago I didn t see any flare up replied mister Fosset and certainly no ship has passed us to my knowledge since I ve been on deck By George I don t know who or what to believe exclaimed Captain Applegarth looking from the one to the other of us You ve set my very brains wool gathering between you with your vessels in distress and ghost ships I m hanged if I won t go down to the engine room and have a little practical common sense knocked into me as well as see how they re getting on with the repairs to the machinery So saying the skipper went below and as there was nothing particular for me to do on deck I followed his example Instead of proceeding down to the engine room however I only went as far as my bunk and turned in wondering what the morrow would bring forth I was haunted though by strange dreams all through the night continually waking up and then getting to sleep again in snatches only to wake up again immediately after I had dropped off CHAPTER ELEVEN IN THE GULF STREAM It s a dead calm sir I heard mister Fosset sing out next morning outside the door of the skipper s state room which opened out of the saloon close to my berth when he went to call him at four bells in obedience to orders given overnight The gale has completely blown itself out and there s only a little cat s paw of a breeze from the south ard Humph yawned the skipper from within That s a good job Fosset I think we ve had enough wind to last us for a blue moon So say I sir agreed the other with much heartiness I wouldn t like to go through the same experiences again by Jingo Nor I came from the other evidently about to turn out from his bunk I ll be on deck in five minutes or so Fosset The first mate however would not take this for a dismissal having apparently further important information to give and which he at once proceeded to disclose Do you know sir I think we re in the Gulf Stream he said in an impressive tone There s a lot of the weed knocking about round the ship Gulf weed exclaimed the skipper s voice again from the cabin sounding a bit muffled as if he were in the act of pulling his shirt over his head Are you certain Aye affirmed the other There s not the slightest doubt about it It s as plain as a pike staff sir The deuce it is said the skipper in a louder key showing that my surmise had been correct as to the progress of his toilet and that his head was now unloosed from its bag like envelope By George I can t make it out at all There s no getting over the fact sir persisted the first mate We re quite surrounded by the weed I saw it well the first streak of light at two bells on suddenly looking over the side sir There s mister O Neil up on the bridge now and he has noticed it too The skipper to judge from the voice that came from his cabin and the way he was banging his boots and other things about was as much mystified by mister Fosset s unexpected announcement as he had been the previous evening by the sight he and I and the boatswain had seen He was also angry I know so I thought it good for me to turn out likewise from my bunk as speedily as possible it not being advisable under the circumstances to be caught napping By George I can t understand it repeated Captain Applegarth crossly If we re in the Gulf Stream all I can say is we must have drifted a wonderful distance in the last two or three days Why man the current is seldom perceptible above the fortieth parallel I know that sir replied the first mate but if you recollect sir from the lunar observation mister O Neil took on the night of the breakdown we were then as far south as forty one deg thirty minutes and we ve been drifting south east by east ever since Well Fosset I m hanged if I know where we are after the bucketting about we ve had since last Friday said the skipper who now came into the saloon where I already dressed was hurriedly having a cup of cocoa and bite of biscuit Weston had just brought me in from the pantry I feel half inclined to believe now in the old superstition about it being an unlucky day though I always used to laugh at the notion There are plenty aboard who believe queerer things than that said mister Fosset drily with a meaning glance in my direction eyeing my cocoa as if he rather fancied a cup himself I say Haldane that cocoa smells good It s not half bad sir I replied grinning Perhaps you would like some too sir Weston s got a lot more inside here hot just fetched from the galley I don t mind if I do have a cup said he Will you join me cap en No thanks I m too worried I ll wait till breakfast said the skipper turning to go up on deck by the companion way and hitching his cap off the hook by his cabin door You won t be long I hope eh I ll follow you up in a jiffey sir as soon as I have swallowed a toothful of this warm stuff to keep out the cold Hi steward Aye aye sir answered Weston promptly putting his head out of his pantry where he had been listening Cup of cocoa sir yezzir I say Fosset said the captain who had lingered near awhile as if in deep thought as he stood with one foot on the lower step of the companion as if he were trying to recollect something I say we must make some points to day on the chart you know Yes sir I don t think there ll be any difficulty about that Do you No the sun ought to be pretty clear at noon with a morning like this clear enough at all events for us to find out the latitude and longitude Just what I said to Spokeshave sir before I came down to call you awhile ago Quite so Aye quite so sir Whereupon both sniggered at the skipper s apt mimicry of Master Conky s pet phrase which Captain Applegarth pronounced in the little beggar s exact tone of voice so like indeed being the imitation that I nearly choked myself while swallowing the balance of my cocoa as I hastily drained my cup and rose to follow the skipper up the companion ladder to the deck As mister Fosset had said there was a dead calm on the bosom of the deep for the slight swell that remained after the gale on the previous evening even up to the time of my going down below had quite disappeared the surface of the water being as smooth as glass as far as the horizon line and all aflash now with the rosy hue of sunrise to the eastward The sky still preserved however the pale neutral tints of night in the west and up to the zenith where it merged into a faint and beautiful seagreen that lost itself imperceptibly in the warm colouring of the orient which each moment became more and more intense in hue heralding the approach of morn At last up jumped the glorious orb of day proudly from his ocean bed came with one bound as it were a veritable globe of liquid fire flooding the vast distant heaven and sea with a wealth of light and radiance that seemed to give life to everything around There Haldane said Captain Applegarth pointing over the taffrail at a lot of straggling masses of quasi looking stringy stuff that came floating on top of the water close by the ship resembling vegetable refuse discarded from Neptune s kitchen garden That s the gulf weed mister Fosset was just speaking about to me Indeed sir I can t say much for its appearance It looks more like a parcel of cauliflowers run to seed than anything else sir Yes that s not a bad simile of yours my lad he replied moving nearer to the side and sending his keen sailorly glance alow and aloft examining our old barquey to see how she fared after the storm If I can remember rightly I think one of our best naturalists has given a similar description of it Yes that s the gulf weed or sargassum or fucus natans as the big guns variously call it in their Latin lingo A rum sort of tackle isn t it Yes it does look funny queer stuff sir said I for I had never had the opportunity of noticing it before all my voyages hitherto backwards and forwards across the Atlantic having been outside the limits of the uncanny looking gulf weed Does it grow in the sea sir It looks so fresh and green Well that depends how you take it my lad returned the skipper rather absently his attention being fixed on something forward about which he evidently could not quite make up his mind as there was a slight puzzled expression on his face You see it is all through those long winded chaps who won t be content with what the Creator gives them but must put a cause and reason for everything beyond God s own will and pleasure and who lay down arbitrary rules of their own for the guidance of Dame Nature though between you and I and the binnacle Haldane the old lady got on well enough for a good many scores of years I d be sorry to say how many without their precious help Now these gentlemen who know everything will have it that the gulf weed grows deep down at the bottom of the sea and that only the branches and tendrils or leaves so to speak float on the top and are visible to us How strange sir said I Just like an aquarium plant It is strange It would be if true for they would have to possess uncommonly long stems as in the Sagossa Sea in the centre of the Gulf Stream where the weed is most plentiful and to be seen at its freshest and most luxuriant growth the recorded depth of the water is over four miles That is not likely then I observed in reply to this I mean sir the fact of its growing up from the bottom of the sea Certainly not my boy Another wise man of the same kidney as the long winded chap of the theory I ve just explained says that the gulf weed in its natural and original state grows on the rocky islets and promontories of the Florida coast and that it is torn thence by the action of the great Atlantic current that bears it many miles from its home though strangely enough I have never seen any gulf weed growing on rocks in the Gulf of Florida or in any of the adjacent seas nor has any one else to my knowledge Then you do not believe it grows to anything at all do you sir No I don t My opinion is that it is a surface plant of old Neptune s rearing and that the warm water of the Gulf Stream breeds it and nourishes it for at certain times it seems partly withered and this could not be due to accident The weed I believe is a sailor like you and I my lad and lives and has its being on the sea no matter what your longshore naturalists who don t know much about it from personal observation may say to the contrary Hullo though my boy look forrad there Where has our spar anchor gone I thought I noticed something and could not make out at first what it was Look youngster and see whether you can see it I was equally puzzled for the moment for although our good ship rested as peacefully on the bosom of the deep as if she were moored the raftlike bundle of spars to which she had been made fast the night before was now no longer to be seen bobbing up ahead athwart our hawser as then Where could our wonderful floating anchor have gone The next moment however I saw what had happened the mystery being easily explained by the calm They ve floated alongside sir I said I can see them under the counter on the port side sir Yes of course there they are exemplifying the attraction of gravitation or some other long winded theory of your scientific gentlemen replied the skipper who seemed to have got science on the brain this morning being violently antagonistic to it somehow or other Ah Fosset see our anchor s come home without weighing I think you d better have the spars hauled on board and rig up the sticks again now that they ve served our time in another way aye and served it well too Aye aye sir said the first mate who had come up after us on the poop looking I couldn t help noticing all the better for the good and early breakfast he had just finished I thought of getting them in just now but waited to call you first Well you needn t wait any longer Fosset rejoined the skipper Pass the word for the bo sun forrad Yes yes sir Quartermaster call Masters Bo sun pipe all hands to hoist spars aboard These orders were roared out by mister Fosset in rapid succession and then in equally rapid sequences came the boatswain s whistle and hail to the men down the hatchway just along the deck All had a rare time of it and an amount of yoho hoes hoing went round that it would have done anybody s heart good to hear the first mate was bellowing out his orders and old Masters seeing to their proper execution by the busy hands and active feet the skipper meanwhile standing on the poop superintending matters with his keen eye and woe to the lubber who bungled at a hitch or left a rope s end loose or brace slack CHAPTER TWELVE BOAT AHOY By the time the sun was near the meridian our top masts were up and the upper yards swayed aloft and crossed making the old barquey all ataunto again and pretty nearly her old self our broken bulwarks and smashed skylight betraying the only damage done by the storm on deck at all events I calculate Fosset as our Yankee friends would say we may now cry spell O observed the skipper who was highly pleased with the progress made in refitting the ship Tell the bo sun to pipe the hands to dinner and you and I had better go up on the bridge and see what we can do in the way of determining our position on the chart That gulf weed must have lost its bearings I m sure It seems impossible to me that we could have drifted so far to the south as to bring us in the Stream An observation will soon settle the point sir replied the first mate passing the word to Masters to knock off work Run down Haldane and get my sextant for me there s a good chap I left it on the cabin table all ready You ll find it there Belay there sang out the skipper as I started off towards the companion way You may as well bring mine too while you re about it Two heads are better than one eh Fosset Yes sir perhaps so rejoined the other before I got out of earshot It seems though as if we re going to have three on the job for here comes mister O Neil with his sextant under his arm evidently bent on the same errand I soon was back with the instruments for the other two and presently all three were at work taking the sun s altitude and measuring off the angle made by the luminary with the horizon A short delay ensued from our clocks being fast on account of our having drifted to the eastward of where they had last been set Then all at once mister Fosset sang out It s just noon sir now The sun s crossing the meridian All right make it so replied the skipper Bos un strike eight bells Aye aye sir came back from old Masters away forward and then followed the melodious chime of the ship s bell that hung immediately under the beak of the fo c s le Ting ting ting ting ting ting ting ting Now going into the wheel house let us look at the chronometer and see what Greenwich time says and then tot up our reckonings The two others followed him into the little room on the bridge sitting down to a table in which the track chart of the ship s course lay and all were busy for some few moments calculating and working out our latitude and longitude I was standing by the doorway after bringing up the correct time of the chronometers which the skipper kept locked up in his own cabin to prevent their being meddled with and I could see he looked puzzled adding up and subtracting his figures over and over again as if he thought he must have made some error though he found that he invariably came to the same result Well Fosset he cried at length unable to restrain himself any longer What do you make it thirty nine deg twenty minutes north latitude sir and forty seven deg fifteen minutes west longitude Faith an I make it the same sir also put in Garry O Neil the twain having worked out the reckoning long before the poor skipper Both of us agree to the virry minnit sure lavin out the sicconds sir By George exclaimed the skipper It s even worse than I thought How sir asked mister Fosset with a smile on his face no doubt chuckling to himself at being cleverer and wiser than Captain Applegarth who would not believe we were in the Gulf Stream Don t you think us right sir Oh yes Fosset I agree with you myself The reckoning is right enough but father s the devil to pay The skipper couldn t sacrifice the joke though he was terribly put out See here he continued jabbing with great noise and force the compasses with which he was measuring off our position into the chart as if that was in fault while Fosset and O Neil laughed Look where we are I shouldn t have thought it possible for us to have been driven so far south right into the Gulf Stream as we are for the current generally runs to the nor east ards below the Banks The stream has done it though sure enough said mister Fosset that and the gale for the one has drifted us to the coast and the other pressed us down southwards and between the two we re just fetched where we are sir Well replied the skipper shrugging his shoulders you were right Fosset and I was wrong this morning Let me see though how we have fetched here if we can trace our course so far from when we last took the sun Sure an that was Friday that baste of a day interposed Garry O Neil pointing to a place on the chart I worked at the rickonin and I put it down meself marking it with a red pencil Yes here it is forty two deg thirty five minutes north latitude and longitude fifty deg ten minutes west said the skipper I worked it out also on my own hook and you and I tallied if you recollect Of course we did the divvil doubt it sir answered the second mate in his usual Irish fashion Thin sor we ran for five hours from that p int on a west by south course going between ten and twelve knots for though I didn t say it meself Mister Fosset tould me the wind was freshinin all the toime so that we must have travelled about sixty miles more or less So that brings us to this blue mark here Yes sor to forty two deg twenty eight minutes north and fifty one deg twelve minutes west Then we sailed right before the wind due south Sure an we did that same afther Mister Haldane s will o the wisp for three hours bedad Oh mister O Neil I pleaded please leave me out of it I m sure I ve seen and heard enough of the ship already Be aisy me darlint It s only me fun sure and I mean ye no harrum said he in his jocular way Arrah how can I lave ye out of the story when ye re the howl h id and tail of it sure and without ye there d be none to tile Yes cap en dear sure an as I was a saying when Haldane broke in upon me yarn thray hours on this southerly course brought us here right where ye see me little finger now About fifty one deg five minutes west longitude and forty one deg forty minutes north latitude How did you get this eh Faith sor the ould moon looked so moighty plisint that night that I took a lunar or two jist to divart mesilf with when Spokeshave wint below and there was nobody lift to poke fun at sure A very useful sort of amusement said the skipper drily And I see too you ve put in the distance we ve run by dead reckoning as about another fifty miles or so Yes sor The bo sun hove the log ivery half hour till the engines stopped an he made out we were going sixteen knots an more bedad so he s id whin we were running before the wind with full shtame on That was very likely O Neil replied the skipper but after that we altered course again you know In course we did sor an you ll say it marked roight down there on that line We thin sailed west a quarter south by compass close hauled on the starboard track for two hours longer after you altered course ag in an bore up to the west ard keeping on till the ingines bhroke down bad cess to em When was that asked the skipper slowly I was so worried and flurried at the moment that I forgot to take the time Four bells in the first watch sor replied the Irishman quickly It was after we d brought up poor Jackson from below as Stoddart the engineer faith was a sittin near jist before me attindin on the poor chap in the cabin whin the rush of shtame came flyin up the hatchway faith an the sekrew stopped We both of us looked at the saloon clock on the instant sure an saw the toime sor That is the last mark on the chart then said the old skipper meaningly pencil and compass in hand and still bending over the tell tale track map spread out on the wheel house table Since that nobody knows how we ve drifted Faith no one sor returned Garry O Neil thinking the question was addressed to him Only perhaps the Pope God bless him or the Imporor of Chainy All laughed at this Captain Applegarth now losing his preoccupied air as if there were nothing to be gained he thought by dwelling any longer on the past It was wonderful though how we had drifted in the short interval comparatively that had elapsed since we became disabled As mister Fosset had been the first to find out in the morning the Gulf Stream that great river that runs a course of some two thousand miles in the middle of the ocean keeping itself perfectly distinct from the surrounding water through which it flows from its inception as a current in the Caribbean Sea to its final disposal in the North Atlantic had first carried us in an easterly direction after we had broken down so utterly while the strong nor westerly gale aided probably by the Arctic current running due south from the Polar regions and which disputes the right of way with the Gulf Stream some little distance to the southwards of the great Banks of Newfoundland had pressed upon the helpless hull of the Star of the North bearing her away whither they pleased So unable to resist either the winds or the waves these combined forces had driven her off her course at an oblique angle thus converting the nor easterly or easterly drift proper of the Gulf Stream into a true sou westerly one taking us from latitude forty one deg thirty minutes north and longitude fifty one deg forty minutes west where we were on the previous Friday night when we were forced to lie to to our present position on the chart To put the case more concisely the Star of the North had been carried for the distance of four degrees and a half exactly of longitude backward on her outward track to New York and some two degrees or thereabouts to the southwards placing us as nearly as possible in the position the skipper had already indicated a direction of some five hundred miles more or less from our proper course and about midway between Bermuda and the Azores or Western Islands While Captain Applegarth was explaining this as much for my benefit and instruction I believe as anything a thought occurred to me Are we not now sir in the track of all the homeward bound ships sailing on the great circle from the West Indies and South American ports The skipper looked at me steadily smelling a rat at once I suppose Haldane he said somewhat sternly you want to get me back to that infernal ship again Not if I know it my lad As you told mister O Neil just now we ve all had enough and to spare of that vessel and the wild goose chase she has led us from first to last I won t hear another word about her by Jingo Just then old Masters who had gone up in the foretop to set something right which had struck his sailor eye as not being altogether as it should be aboard the Star of the North raised his arm to attract the attention of those on deck below him Hullo there bo sun called out the skipper seeing him for he seldom kept his glasses away from the rigging of the ship and things aloft What s the row eh I sees summit to win ard sir By George exclaimed the skipper in a tone that made every one laugh who heard all but Masters the coincidence was so comical after what Captain Applegarth had said only a minute before Not another ghost ship I hope No sir growled the boatswain rather savagely It bean t no ghost ship this time though she ain t far off I knows to my thinkin He added the last words as if speaking to himself but I heard him and his remark stopped my mirth instanter What is it bo sun that you do see then cried the skipper impatiently that is if you see anything at all beyond some vision of your own imagination I ain t dreaming hailed back old Masters not quite catching what he said I sees summit as plain as possible out to win ard Aye it be a driftin down athawt our hawser too cap en Why hullo I m blessed Boat ahoy CHAPTER THIRTEEN IN THE NICK OF TIME A boat exclaimed Captain Applegarth his jesting manner changing instantly to one of earnest attention Where away On our starboard beam sir sang out Masters from the foretop About two points off I fancies sir I can t see her said the skipper looking in the direction the boatswain had indicated I thought she was close to from your hailing her She s further away now than I thought sir shouted old Masters in reply to this after having another squirm over the topsail yard I m blessed though if I ain t lost her with the ship s head bobbing all round the compass No there she be ag in sir No yes yes There she is about a mile or so off sir I m thinkin By George Masters you think too much I think the skipper retorted angrily You don t seem to know what you re saying and I believe you ve gone off your chump since you saw that ghost ship as you called it Go aloft Haldane and see what you can make of this blessed boat he says he sighted I was already in the weather shrouds before the skipper gave me this order and in another minute I was on the top beside the boatswain who pointed out silently to me a little black speck in the distance apparently dancing about amid the waves which were beginning to curl before an approaching breeze that was evidently springing up from the westwards Fortunately I had a pair of binoculars in my jacket pocket and I immediately levelled the glasses at the object in view Well Haldane at last sang out the skipper impatiently from the end of the bridge where he still stood looking up at me with his chin cocked in the air What do you make it out to be eh my lad It s a boat sure enough sir I shouted down to him without taking my eyes off it She s a long way off though sir and I think she s drifting further away too The deuce exclaimed Captain Applegarth Can you see any one in the boat No no not distinctly sir I replied after another searching look Stay I do I do think there s a figure at one end and yes yes I m sure I noticed something that appeared like a movement but it might have been caused by the rocking of the sea But don t you see anybody or can t you make anything else out Only the boat sir and that a breeze seems coming up from the westward I see a white line on the water along the horizon That s all I can see sir Well that s not much use to us he growled below beginning his customary quarter deck walk up and down the bridge I wish some one would come up from the engine room to say they had repaired the cylinder and that we could go ahead again Almost as soon as he spoke thus I noticed mister Stokes who I thought was lying down in his cabin coming towards the forepart of the ship where we were from the direction of the engine room hatchway Hullo Stokes said the skipper catching sight of him at once with his eagle eye that seemed to take in everything that went on whether his back was turned or not I thought you were on the sick list still and ill You oughtn t to be bustling about so soon after your accident my dear fellow No but I feel better replied the old chief who although he was still pale and shaky had a more cheerful look on his face than the day before when he appeared decidedly ill I ve been down below and I m glad to say Stoddart and the other artificers who I must say have worked well without me you will be glad to know have got the cylinder cover on again They ve made a splendid job of it Stoddart himself is a splendid fellow said the skipper enthusiastically Aye and the rest of your staff too my dear Stokes By George you ve brought us good news But that isn t all cap en cried the old fellow beaming over with a broad smile of quiet enjoyment at the surprise the skipper showed They say below that they ll be able to start the engines as soon as there s a full head of steam on Now what do you think of that sir Isn t that good news The skipper looked ready to embrace our fat chief and I believe only refrained from giving this expression of his joy by the sight of poor mister Stokes bandaged arm which was still in a sling He contented himself therefore with patting him tenderly on the back and walking round him admiringly like a cat purring round a saucer of cream By George he cried I feel as pleased as if my grandmother had left me five thousand pounds I wish she had laughed the old chief I would ask to go shares And so you should my boy so you should repeated the skipper with much heartiness and as if he really meant it How soon do you think we shall be able to start eh Very soon I think sir The after boiler fires were lit early this morning and they ve been getting up steam ever since That s good cried the skipper stopping in his excited walk up and down the bridge which he had again resumed being unable to keep still when he looked up caught sight of me and hailed me I say Haldane Aye aye sir I sang out from the top where I had remained with the boatswain on the look out and hearing likewise all that transpired beneath What do you want sir I hope you re keeping your eye on that boat my lad If she is there we may be able to overhaul her yet if you don t lose sight of her No fear of that sir I shouted back pointing with my finger in the distance There she is still to win ard pretty nearly flush with the water Then she really is there all right my lad Keep your eye on her The funnels had been emitting smoke for some time without our having paid much attention to the fact the fires of the fore boilers having been kept in and banked ever since our breakdown in order to work the pumps and capstan gear when required but now steam I noticed came out as well as smoke and I could hear it plainly roaring up the waste pipe besides making a fearful row Presently another sound greeted my ears and made me jump It was that of the electric bell in the wheel house giving warning that those below in the emporium wished to make some communication mister Stokes went to the voice tube that led down thither from the bridge What s the matter he roared into the mouthpiece so loud that I heard every word he uttered although a top of the mast Anything wrong I couldn t of course catch the reply that came up the pipe and it certainly was not a satisfactory one for mister Stokes turned round at once to the skipper who immediately stopped his quarter deck walk to hear what the chief had to say They ve corrected the propeller sir he exclaimed with a chuckle that made his fat form shake all over and Stoddart says he s only waiting for your signal to close the stop valves and let the steam into the cylinder By George he shan t wait a minute longer cried Captain Applegarth moving the engine room telegraph Go ahead my hearties as soon as you please Hullo there forrad I want a hand here at the wheel I suppose the steam steering gear is all right again now Oh yes sir replied mister Stokes to this Grummet fixed that up on Sunday afternoon he told me I am sure it was done I remember he was doing it when that man of war came alongside and spoke you Strange I didn t see him at the job he must have been pretty smart over it replied the skipper But I m very glad it is done though In answer to the skipper s signal a sudden blast of steam rushed up the funnel abaft the wheel house and I could feel the ship tremble as the shaft began to revolve and the propeller blades splashed the water astern with the familiar thump thump thump thump All hands joined in a hearty cheer to which Masters and I in the top lent what aid our lungs could give Steady amidship there sang out the skipper as the old barquey forged ahead once more Steady my man Aye aye sir answered the foremost hand Parrell who had come from the fo c s le to take the first trick at the steering wheel on the bridge Steady it is How does the boat bear now Haldane Two points off our starboard bow sir I replied to this hail of the skipper She s about three miles off I think sir All right he shouted back to me Port your helm there Aye aye sir repeated Parrell Port sir it is We re rising her fast now sir I called out after a short interval There s a man in the boat yes a man sir I can see him quite plainly now and I m sure I m not mistaken Are you quite sure my lad Quite sure sir And he s alive too I m certain Yes sir he moved then distinctly I could see him plainly Why the boat is so near now that you ought to see it from the deck And so I can by Jingo Haldane replied the captain peering out ahead himself with a telescope from the end of the bridge I fancy I can see a second figure and it looks like another man too lying down in the bows of the boat as well as the figure at the stern who seems to me to be holding up an oar or something Yes there is sir I called out stopping on my way down the rigging to have another look After a pause I exclaimed I can see both of them and with my naked eye I can see them now Well then you d better come down from aloft Tell your friend the boatswain to come down as well He ll be wanted at the fo c s le when we presently come up to the boat as I trust we shall Lucky Masters saw the boat sir said I when I reached the deck and up to the skipper s side again But even more fortunate it is for the poor fellows that our engines are working again sir for otherwise we could not have been able to get up to the boat and save them It isn t luck my boy observed mister Stokes whom the death of poor Jackson and his own narrow escape from a like fate had led to think of other matters besides those connected with his mundane profession It s Providence CHAPTER FOURTEEN AN APPEAL FOR AID Aye that s the better way of looking at it chimed in the skipper raising his arm at the same time from his station at the end of the bridge where he was conning the ship He then called out sharply to enforce the signal Luff up you lubber luff Luff it is sir rejoined the helmsman rapidly turning round the spokes of the little steam steering wheel It s hard over now sir Steady there next sang out the captain Steady my man Aye aye sir repeated the parrot like Tom Parrell bringing the helm amidships again Steady it is By George we re nearing the boat fast cried the skipper after another short pause during which we had been going ahead full speed with a quick thump thump thump thump of the propeller and the water foaming past our bows Starboard Parrell Starboard a bit now Aye aye sir came again the helmsman s answering cry from the wheel house Starboard it is sir Keep her so A trifle more off Steady Steady it is sir Now down with it Parrell sang out the skipper bringing his hand instanter on the handle of the engine room gong which he sounded twice directing those in charge below to reduce speed while he hailed old Masters on the fo c s le Hi bo sun Look out there forrad with your rope s end to heave to the poor fellows We re just coming alongside the boat Aye aye sir replied Masters promptly keeping one eye on the skipper on the bridge and the other directed to the little craft we were approaching and now close to our port bow We re all ready forrad sir Mind you don t run her down sir She s nearly under our forefoot All right bo sun returned the skipper Port Parrell Port it is sir repeated Tom Parrell Two points off Steady man steady continued the skipper holding his hand up again Boat ahoy Stand by We re going to throw you a rope At the same instant Captain Applegarth sounded the engine room gong again bringing the Star of the North to a dead stop as we steamed up to the boat slanting wise the steamer having just sufficient way on her when the screw shaft ceased revolving to glide gently up to the very spot where the little floating waif was gently bobbing up and down on the wave right ahead of us and barely half a dozen yards away drifting at the will of the wind without any guidance from its occupants who seemingly were unaware of our approach Boat ahoy shouted the skipper once more raising his voice to a louder key Look out there The men in the bows of the boat still remained in the same attitude as if unconscious or dead but the other in the stern sheets appeared to hear the skipper s hail for he half turned his head and uttered a feeble sort of noise and made a feeble motion with one of his hands Now s your time bo sun cried Captain Applegarth Heave that line sharp Aye aye sir roared out Masters in his gruff tones Stand by below there With that the coil of half inch rope which he held looped on his arm made a circling whirl through the air the end falling right across the gunwales of the boat close to the after thwart where sat the second of the castaways who eagerly stretched out his hand to clutch at it But unfortunately he failed to grasp it and the exertion evidently being too much for him for he tumbled forward on his face at the bottom of the boat while the rope slipped over the side into the water coming back home to us alongside the old barquey on the next send of the sea the heavy roll of our ship when she brought up broadside on as well as the weight of the line saturated with water fetching it in to us all the sooner Poor fellows they can t help themselves cried the skipper who had watched the boatswain s throw and its unsatisfactory result with the deepest interest Bear a hand there some one forrad and have another try to reach them The boat s drifting past and we ll have to go astern to board her in another minute if you don t look sharp Having climbed into the fore rigging however so as to have a good look at the boat and its occupants as we neared them I was quite as quick as the skipper to notice what had happened having indeed foreseen the contingency before it occurred So ere Masters or any of the other men could stir a hand having made up my mind what to do I had seized hold of part of the slack of the line that remained inboard and plunging into the sea swam towards the boat A couple of strokes combined with the forward impetus of my leap overboard took me up to the little craft and in a jiffey I had grasped the gunwale aft and clambered within her securing the end of the line I had round one of the thwarts at once amid the ringing cheers of the skipper and my shipmates in the old barquey who proceeded to haul us up alongside without further delay tugging away at the tar rope I had hitched on yo heave hoing and hurrahing in one and the same breath right lustily So smart were they so instantaneous had been the action of the moment during the episode that we were close in to the ship s side and under her conning immediately below the port end of the bridge where the skipper stood leaning over the rail and surveying operations before I had time actually to look round so as to have a nearer view of the unfortunate men whom we had so providentially rescued When I did though one glance was enough I was horror stricken at the sight that met my eyes The man whom I had observed when we were yet some distance off to be lying huddled up in the bows motionless as if dying or already dead I now saw had received a horrible wound on the top of his head that had very nearly smashed in the skull besides almost severing one of his ears which was hanging from the cheek bone attached by a mere scrap of skin the bottom boards of the boat near him being stained with blood that had flowed from the cut and his hair likewise matted together with gore Oh it was horrible to see He was not dead however as I had thought but only in a state of stupor breathing heavily and making a strange stertorous sound as if snoring His fellow sufferer aft who did not appear to have suffered so much as his comrade had seemingly swooned from exhaustion or exposure as on my putting my arm round him and lifting up his bent head the man opened his eyes and murmured something faintly in some foreign lingo Spanish I think it was at any rate a language I did not understand But I was unable to notice anything beyond these details which I grasped in that one hurried glance for as I was in the act of raising up the poor chap in the stern sheets the skipper hailed me from the bridge above Below there he sang out How are the poor fellows Are they alive Haldane They are in a bad way sir I replied They ve got the life left in them and that s all I m afraid Neither dead then No sir Bravo whilst there s life there s hope cried the skipper in a cheery tone Are they quite helpless do you think Haldane I mean quite unable to climb up the side Quite unable sir I answered One s unconscious and I don t think the other could move an inch if he tried Then we must haul em up said Captain Applegarth turning to Masters who had popped his head over the bulwarks and was now looking down into the boat like the rest of the hands on board I say bo sun can t you rig up a chair or something that we can lower down for the poor fellows Aye aye sir responded old Masters drawing in his head from the bulwarks and disappearing from my view as I looked upwards from the stern sheets where I was still holding up the slowly recovering man I ll rig up a whip from the foreyard and we can let down a hammock for em tricing up one at a time Stay cap en cried mister Fosset as the boatswain went bustling off I suppose though of course from my position I could not see him to carry out this plan of his The davits here amidship are all right as well as the tackle of our cutter that had got washed away in the gale Wouldn t it be easier to let down the falls sir and run up the boat all standing with the poor fellows in her as they are By George the very thing Fosset exclaimed the skipper accepting the suggestion with alacrity It will save the poor fellows a lot of jolting and be all the easier for us as you say Besides the little craft will come in handy for us as we re rather short of boats just now Short of boats sir repeated the first mate ironically as he set to work at once with the help of a couple of the hands who jumped to his side to assist him the moment he spoke casting off the lashings of the davits so as to rig them outwards letting go at the same time the hooks of the fall blocks and overhauling the running gear Why sir we haven t even the dinghy left intact after that clean sweep we had from the wave that pooped us Oh aye I know that well enough said the skipper drily But look alive now Fosset with that tackle and don t be a month of Sundays over the job Send down two of the cutter s crew to overrun the falls and drop down into the boat They can help Haldane in holding up that poor chap astern and also bear a hand in hoisting up All right sir we re just ready shouted back the first mate as he gave the word to let go Lower away there with the slack of those falls Easy my man gently does it In another instant down came the fall blocks with one of the hands hanging on to each the men alighting gingerly on the thwarts of the boat in the bow and stern of the little craft which became immersed almost up to the gunwales with the additional weight This was only for a moment for the next minute mister Fosset gave the signal to hoist away the falls having been hooked on beneath the thwarts in a jiffey and up we all went in mid air between the devil and the deep sea as we say afloat sometimes Bravo cried the skipper when we reached the level of the gangway and were all able to step out on to the deck That s very handsomely done my lads Now let us see about lifting the poor fellows out That chap there in the bows seems in a very bad way You d better carry him into the cuddy at once and let mister O Neil look after him Indade I will sor said our doctor mate who was standing near by with a spirit flask in one hand and a medicine glass in the other ready to give immediate succour to the rescued men Carry the poor beggar along an I ll be afther ye in a minnit for this other misfortunate gossoon here looks as if he wouldn t be the worst for a dhrop of good brandy an faith I ll say to him fourst avic So saying the Irishman poured some of the contents of the spirit flask into the glass which he held to the lips of the man mister Fosset and I were supporting him in our arms against the side of the boat whence we had just removed him The poor fellow s strength returned to him almost as soon as he had sipped a drop or two of the brandy and starting away from the first mate and myself as if no longer needing our aid he stood erect on the deck Mil gracias amigos he said with a polite inclination of his head in apology like for shaking himself free from us Estoy major Captain Applegarth stepped up to him I am sorry I can t speak Spanish sir though I understand you to say you re better We re Englishmen all on board this ship sir and I m glad we ve been able to pick you up The eyes of the man glistened and a pleased expression stole over his face What You are English he exclaimed excitedly But but I m an American Only I ve been so long in Venezuela amongst Spaniards that I sometimes forget my own language Our skipper was equally delighted By George he said I was sure you were no blessed foreigner in spite of your lingo sir Welcome on board the Star of the North The stranger looked round and his manner changed at once and he pointed towards our funnels anxiously and their escaping steam A steam vessel eh Yes sir said the skipper I command her sir Cap en Applegarth at your service The deuce I was forgetting We passed you last night I remember now and you re the captain Aye replied the skipper not quite making out what the other was driving at I m captain of this ship Merciful Heavens cried the rescued man falling on his knees on the deck and bursting into a passion of sobs Thanks be to God Yes thanks be to God You will save her captain You will save her The skipper thought the evident suffering he had gone through had turned his brain Save who he asked adding in a kinder tone Of course we ll do anything and everything we can for you but I must know my bearings first my friend The man was on his feet at once I am not mad captain as you appear to think I can see from your manner you think so he said I want you to save my Elsie my only child my little daughter whom those villains those black devils are carrying off Your only child your daughter black devils echoed Captain Applegarth astonished at the poor man s speech and at his wild and agonised look What do you mean sir Heavens We re losing time while those scoundrels are getting away with the ship exclaimed the other frantically and walking to and fro in a most excited state Fire up the engines pile on the coals and steam like the devil and go in chase of her my good captain you will For Heaven s sake captain for the love of God start at once in chase of her In chase of whom asked Captain Applegarth still believing him to be out of his mind In chase of whom The man uttered a heart rending cry in which anger grief and piteous appeal were alike blended In chase of a band of black miscreants who have committed murder and piracy on the high seas he ejaculated in broken accents The blood of a number of white men massacred by treacherous negroes calls for vengeance the safety of a young girl and the lives of your brother sailors still on board the ship calls to you for help and rescue Great Heaven Will you stand idly by and not render the aid you can Think captain a little girl like your own daughter my Elsie my little one Yes and white men your brothers and sailors too like yourselves at the mercy of a gang of black ruffians Sir will you help them or not CHAPTER FIFTEEN WE START IN CHASE OF THE SHIP The effect of this appeal was electrical not only on the skipper but on all of us standing by Great heavens man cried the captain staring at the other in wild astonishment What do you mean I cannot understand you sir Your ship you say My words are plain enough captain said the stranger interrupting the skipper Our ship the Saint Pierre is in the possession of a gang of Haytian negroes who rose on us while we were on the high seas and murdered most of the officers and the crew They then threw poor Captain Alphonse who commanded her overboard after they had half killed him and the rest of the unfortunate sailors and passengers amongst them my little daughter are now at the mercy of the black devils My God exclaimed the skipper confounded by this lucid statement And you sir I am an American said the other with a proud air drawing himself up to his full height of six feet and more and with his eyes flashing while a red flush mounted to his cheeks which had formerly been deadly pale I m a white man captain and it s not likely I would stand by and see people of my own colour butchered Of course sir I went to the poor captain s assistance but then the murderers served me almost as badly as they did him chucking me overboard after him I beg your pardon sir I m sure for appearing to doubt your story cried the skipper stretching forward his hand which the other eagerly grasped The fact is sir I thought at first your sufferings had set your head wrong but now I need hardly say I believe thoroughly every word you ve told us and you may rely on my aid and that of every man aboard here to help you and yours There s my hand on it sir and my word you ll find as good as my bond so sure as my name is Jack Applegarth And mine captain is Vereker Colonel Vereker at your service returned the other reciprocating the skipper s cordiality as he looked him straight in the face holding his hand the while in a firm grip He let go the skipper s fist however the next moment and a puzzled expression came into his eyes as he glanced round occasionally apparently in search of some one or other Heavens Where s my unfortunate comrade who was in the boat with me poor Captain Alphonse Alas I had forgotten him We have not forgotten him though colonel said the skipper smiling He has been carried below to the saloon on the maindeck where my second mate mister O Neil who is a qualified surgeon is now attending to his injuries He has been terribly mauled poor fellow we could see that Aye terribly repeated the other with a shudder as if the recollection of all he and his fellow sufferers had gone through suddenly came back to him at the moment But great Heavens captain we re losing time and that accursed ship with those scoundrels and our remaining comrades and with my darling child on board is speeding away while we re talking here You will will you not Senor Applegarth go in pursuit of her my friend By George I will colonel I will at once immediately if you ll tell me her bearings cried the skipper excitedly When was it this terrible affair happened When did you leave the ship and where The revolt of the blacks or mutiny I should call it captain broke out four days ago on last Friday indeed sir said the American promptly in his deep musical voice and whose foreign accent obliterated all trace of the unmelodious Yankee twang But we kept the rascals at bay until last night soon after sundown when they made an ugly rush and overpowered us Captain Alphonse had just sighted your vessel in the distance and was burning a blue light over the stern to attract your attention so as to get assistance at the time this happened Was yours a large full rigged ship Yes sir the Saint Pierre is of good size and had all her sails set replied the other to the skipper s question We were running before the wind with our helm lashed amidship as it had been since the previous Friday for we were all too busy defending our lives to think of attending to the ship Steering about nor east I suppose Confound it captain said the colonel impatiently We were drifting I tell you sir at the mercy of the elements and heaven only knows how we were going Fortunately the weather was pretty fair save the very day the mutiny broke out when it blew heavily and our canvas got split to pieces as there was no one to go aloft and take it in Otherwise we must have gone to the bottom By George exclaimed the skipper turning round to old Masters and myself who were still standing by with the hands who had come aft to haul up the boat Then my bo sun here and this young officer were right when they declared they saw a large full rigged ship to the westward of us though I only noticed the light of your flare up You were too far off for me to make you out Ojala ejaculated the American reverting again to the familiar Spanish tongue in his emotion Would to God captain you had seen us It would have been useless if I had my friend said the skipper soothingly We couldn t move to come to your assistance if every soul on board had seen you and known your peril sir for our engines were broken down and we were not able to get up steam again until late this afternoon when we ran down to pick you up But sir hastily whispered the colonel suppressing a sob of emotion you can and will steam now Why ask replied the skipper The moment we know where to go in search of your ship that very moment we ll start and try to overhaul her You say you quitted her last night Quitted her We were thrown overboard sir by the black devils Captain Applegarth in reply said calmly Yes yes of course accepting the correction and trying by his manner to soothe the infuriated man But what time was that I can t say the exact hour replied the American whose vexed tone showed that the captain s methodical mode of setting to work did not quite harmonise with the excited state of his feelings I think however it must have been nearly seven o clock as well sir as I can remember Then I chimed in Ah I exclaimed quickly that was just the very time that Masters and I heard the shooting in the distance to win ard and it was six bells in the second dog watch So it were Master Haldane so it were agreed the old boatswain looking from me to the skipper and then at Colonel Vereker Well I m blowed and I m glad then for that there ghost ship wor a rael ship arter all said and done Now who was right I d like to know Of course it was a real ship you old dotard said the skipper gruffly and looking angrily at him Of course it was he added while our new acquaintance looked at us unable naturally to understand the mystical allusion but Captain Applegarth soon turned his roving thoughts into another direction by asking him a second question How long did you keep in sight of your vessel after leaving her colonel do you think She was in full view of us at sunrise this morning replied the American The boat in which we were adrift kept near her all night as there was very little wind if any A slight breeze sprang up shortly after the sun rose and she then steadily increased her distance from us as the day wore on finally disappearing from my gaze about noon and taking with her my little darling my pet my Elsie The poor fellow broke down again at this point throwing up his hands passionately and burying his face in them his whole frame convulsed with sobs though not a man present thought his emotion a thing to be ashamed of all of us being deeply interested in his narrative and as anxious as himself for the skipper to start off in pursuit of the black mutineers and pirates We were not long kept in suspense the colonel s last words and violent burst of emotion apparently touching our old man s feelings deeply and hastening his decision Cheer up sir cheer up said he to the other whose shoulders still shook with his deep hysterical sobs And we ll find your little girl yet for you all right and restore her to you and we ll settle matters too with those scoundrels I promise Now tell me how far off do you think the ship must have drifted from us by now mister Fosset Between twenty and thirty miles sir replied the first mate She was lighter than us and of course she had the advantage of what wind there has been though thank goodness that has been little enough Away to the nor east I suppose Aye aye sir said mister Fosset The breeze what there was has been from the sou east and the current trends in the same direction Then if we steer east nor east we ought to pick her up soon Not a doubt of it sir We have four good hours of daylight left yet Precisely my opinion cried the skipper mister Stokes will the engines stand full speed now do you think Oh yes sir replied the old chief who with the rest of us was all agog to be after the strange ship again now that he had heard the colonel s explanation of her true character if you ll send some one below to tell Stoddart what you want I would go myself but I m rather shaky in getting down the hatchway as yet I twisted my arm just now when I went down That s all right Stoddart I am sure will excuse you said the skipper kindly and turning to me he added You Haldane run down and tell Stoddart we want all the steam we can get He won t spare the engines I know when he knows the circumstances of the case and you will explain matters So saying the skipper started off forwards in the direction of the bridge while I dived down the engine room hatchway reaching the machinery flat just as the old man sounded the gong to put on full speed ahead the telegraph working quick as if he were in a great hurry Ere I could tell my story Stoddart sent an answering blast up the steam pipe to let the skipper know his signal was being attended to and then pulling back the lever of the throttle valve the piston began to go up and down the cylinder oscillated from side to side and the crank shaft revolved at first slowly but presently faster and faster until we were now going to the utmost of our pace All this while I was yarning away though I had to shout to the top of my voice in order to overcome the noise of the machinery as I described all that had occurred I did not speak to unheeding ears By Jove Haldane cried Stoddart who was a man of action if ever there was one The cylinder is all right again and will bear any pressure now and I tell you what it is the old barquey shall steam along in pursuit of those demons faster than she ever went in her life since she was launched and engined I am with you there old fellow said Grummet our third engineer hastening towards the stoke hold I ll go down and see the firemen and stir them up and put some more oilers to work in the screw well to lubricate the shaft so as to prevent the bearings from overheating That s your sort my hearty said Stoddart So you can return on deck Haldane and tell the skipper and mister Stokes that everything shall be done down here by us to overhaul your ghost ship He laughed as he uttered this little piece of chaff at my expense the story being now the common property of everybody on board and I laughed too as I ran up the hatchway with my clothes nearly dry again even drying in the short space of time I had been in the hot atmosphere below although goodness knows they had been wet enough when I had gone down having had no time or opportunity to shift them after my dip overboard when taking the line to the drifting boat On reaching the main deck I met Spokeshave He was coming out from the saloon and from his puffy face and corpulent appearance generally he looked as if he had been making a haul on the steward s pantry although he had not long had his dinner and it was a good way off tea time Hullo he cried out on seeing me I say that chap O Neil is having a fine go of it playing at doctoring He has got a lot of ugly long knives and saws laid out on the cuddy table and I think he s going to cut off the chap s leg Which chap do you mean I asked not the colonel Aye said he The chap with the moustache and long hair like Hamlet you know My good chap said I you seem to know a good deal about other chaps or think you do but I never heard before of Hamlet having a moustache like a life guardsman Irving doesn t wear one when he takes the part if I recollect right my joker You think yourself mighty knowing Quite so replied Master Spokeshave using his favourite phrase as usual But you don t call Irving Shakespeare Haldane do ye I don t know anything of the matter old boy I am not so well informed as you are concerning the dramatic world Spokeshave I know you re a regular authority or toffer if you like on the subject Don t you think however you re a bit hard on poor Irving who I ve no doubt would take a word of advice from you if you spoke kindly to him and without that cruel sarcasm which you re apt to use The little beggar actually sniggered over this being of the opinion that I was paying a just tribute to his histrionic acumen and judgement in things theatrical on which he prided himself on account of his having appeared once behind the footlights in a theatre in Liverpool as a super I believe and in a part where he had nothing to say Quite so Haldane quite so chuckled Spokeshave as pleased as Punch at the imaginary compliment I do believe I could teach Irving a thing or two if I had the mind to Yes you donkey if you had the mind to said I witheringly by giving an emphasis he did not mean to his own words Very like a whale as our old friend Polonius says in the play the real Hamlet I mean my boy not your version of it Very like a whale indeed I m sure mister Haldane he answered loftily cocking his long nose in the air with a supercilious sniff I don t know what ye mean And I ve no time to waste telling you now returned I At that moment we emerged on the open deck from under the back of the poop where we had been losing our time and talking nonsense and looking towards the bridge forward I saw Colonel Vereker the very person about whom we had been speaking standing by the side of the skipper O Lor Spokeshave what a crammer I cried You said not a moment ago that Garry O Neil was about to cut off the colonel s leg while there he is standing there all right I didn t say he had cut it off yet he retorted I said he was going to cut it off O Neil told me so himself Then said I instead of cutting off the poor colonel s leg he was only pulling your leg my joker The cross grained little beggar however did not seem to quite understand the term I employed thus in joke though it was used at sea to express the fact of taking a rise out of any one and a common enough saying I m not the only fellow who tells crammers he grimly muttered How about that yarn of yours of the blessed ghost ship you saw the other night I d like to know I believe too that the colonel as you call him is only an impostor and that the skipper is going on just such a wild goose chase after this ship of his which he says was captured by pirates as he did that Friday hunting your Flying Dutchman wasting our time with your idiotic story Pirates and niggers indeed Why this chap I ll bet is a nigger himself and more of a pirate than any one we ll come across if we steam from here to the North Pole Put that in your pipe and smoke it Dick Haldane you and your confounded ghost ship together Such utter humbug and nonsense and thinking you take people in with such yarns in these days CHAPTER SIXTEEN FULL SPEED AHEAD I was so indignant at what the spiteful little brute said that I incontinently turned on my heel and left him without another word going forwards towards the bridge to give the skipper Stoddart s message Here the sight of Colonel Vereker s grand figure one that would be remarkable anywhere towering above the rail and almost herculean in its massive proportions coupled with the sad look in his noble face and which reminded me somehow or other of one of the pictures of the old Cavaliers of the Stuart days made me resent the more the baseless imputation of his being an imposter The idea of such a thing being possible could only have occurred to an ignoble mind like that of Spokeshave for one single glance at the distinguished looking gentleman s speaking countenance with its finely chiselled features and lofty open brow would have satisfied any unprejudiced person that his was a nature incompatible with deceit and meanness even in the most remote degree Well young Haldane exclaimed old mister Stokes whom I found with Captain Applegarth and the colonel when I reached the wheel house What do those smart chaps of mine down below say hey my boy His face beamed as he spoke and he looked as if he would have liked to have rubbed his hands together in his old way when he felt particularly jolly but unfortunately his crippled arm which was still in a sling prevented that Oh that s all right sir I replied in an equally cheery tone the old chief s genial address making me forget at once my anger at Spokeshave s contemptible nonsense mister Stoddart directed me to tell the cap en that he may go on ahead as usual as he likes for everything has been made taut and secure below and there need be no fear of another mishap He says he intends driving the engines as they were never driven before and he has put every fireman and oiler in the stoke hold on the job Bravo cried the skipper sounding the gong again and yelling down the voice tube that led below like one possessed Fire up below there and let her rip Dear dear panted mister Stokes whose fears for his engines which he regarded with the affection which a young mother might bestow on her first baby began to overcome his interest in the chase after the black pirates I hope you and Stoddart between you won t be rash cap en I hope I do hope you won t Nonsense Stokes you old croker just you shut up said the skipper Keep her steady east nor east helmsman Now my dear colonel at last we really are after those infernal rascals in earnest and sir between you and me and the binnacle we ll be up to them before long before nightfall I ll wager I hope to heaven we will Senor Applegarth replied the other sadly but eagerly But alas the ocean is wide and we may miss the ship I cannot bear to think of it Oh but we won t miss her said the skipper confidently and he was the last man to give up hope Take my davy for that sir She must be within a radius of from twenty to thirty miles of our present bearings on the chart somewhere here away to the eastwards sir and if we make a long leg to leeward and then bear up to the north ard and west ard again we ll overhaul her I m sure of it yes sure of it in no time Look colonel look how we re going now By George ain t that a bow wave for you sir and just see our wake astern The old barquey was certainly steaming ahead at a great rate the sea coming up before her in a high ridge that nearly topped the fo c s le and welling under her counter on either hand in undulating furrows that spread out beneath her stern in the form of a broad arrow widening their distance apart as she moved onward while the space between was frosted as if with silver by the white foam churned up by the ever whirling propeller blades beating the water with their rhythmical iteration thump thump thump thump thump thump There was no racing of the screw now for Neptune was in one of his quiet moods and there were no big rollers to surmount or deep wave valleys to descend into consequently the old barquey had no excuse for giving way to any gambolling propensities in the water of pitching and tossing steaming away on an even keel and using every inch of power of her engines with not an ounce to waste in the way of mis spent force And so on we went tearing through the water a blue sky overhead unflecked by a single cloud a blue sea around that sparkled in sunshine and reflected harmonies of azure and gold save where the bright fresh western breeze rippled its surface with laughing wavelets that chuckled as they splashed the spray into each other s faces or where we passed a stray scrap of gulf weed with its long yellow filaments spread out like fingers vainly clutching at the wavelets as if imploring them to be still or where again the dense black smoke from our funnels made a canopy in the sky athwart our track obscuring the shimmering surface of the deep with a grim path of shadow that checked the mirth of the lisping young wavelets and even awed the sunshine when it came in closer contact anon as the wind waved it this way and that at its will Hi bo sun shouted out the skipper presently after carrying on like this for a goodish spell the deck working beneath our feet and the Star of the North seeming to be flying through water and air alike by a series of leaps and bounds quivering down to her very kelson with the sustained motion and the ever driving impulse of her masterful engines spurring her onward How is she going now eh Old Masters was away aft on the poop hauling in the patent log which had been hove over the side on our beginning the run and the next minute as soon as he was able to look at the index of the instrument he answered the skipper s question Sixteen knots sir he sang out and then we could hear the old sea dog add his customary comment whether of approval or discontent Well I m blowed By George colonel cried Captain Applegarth to our melancholy looking guest at his side We re going sixteen knots sir just think of that I didn t believe the dear old barquey had it in her It is a good wonderful speed captain replied the other who I noticed was looking even more exhausted now than when we removed him from the boat Remember though sir the Saint Pierre is sailing on all this time before the wind as she was this morning and must be miles ahead of us Aye I know she s going or at least I suppose so and I ve made every allowance for that in my calculation of her whereabouts returned our skipper in nowise daunted by the colonel s argument But if she had every rag set that she could carry she couldn t go more than three or four knots at the most in this light breeze and for every foot she covers we re going five That is true said the American with a very weary and absent look on his face But but I m afraid we may be too late after all I I m God protect my my The fact is my dear sir cried the skipper abruptly interrupting him as the other hesitated in his speech turning a deadly white and clutching at the bridge rail in front of him as if to save himself from falling or fainting You re completely worn out and your nerves shaken Why you can t have had much if any sleep the last three or four days not since that rumpus broke out aboard your ship eh Heavens ejaculated the other I don t think I have closed my eyes senor since Friday excepting when I was drifting in the boat part of which time I must have been senseless for though I recollect seeing your vessel and trying to signal her by holding up a piece of the bottom planking of the boat as we hadn t oar or sail in her I have no remembrance of seeing your vessel steaming up to help us or of this brave young gentleman here jumping into the water and swimming to our assistance as you tell me captain that he gallantly did Believe me sir I shall never forget you and I shall be ever and eternally grateful to you for that noble act of yours He half turned and bowed to me politely as he said this but I was too much confused by his exaggerated estimate of what I had done to say anything at the moment in reply And after all it was only a very simple thing to do to swim with a line to a boat any other fellow could have done the same and would have done it under the same circumstances The skipper however spoke for me Come come sir he said Haldane only did his duty like the brave lad he is and I m sure you only make him uncomfortable by your thanks I want you colonel to go below and have a little rest and some refreshment Besides I promised mister O Neil to send you down to have your wounded leg dressed and seen to more than half an hour ago when he came up on deck after attending to that other poor chap and yet here you are still talking and exciting yourself How is your leg now colonel Easier Confound it No no replied the other with a writhe of torture as he changed his position so as to relieve the strain on the wounded limb which I had quite forgotten about the brave follow having stoically repressed all indication of pain while urging on the pursuit of the black mutineers It s hurting me like the devil But sir I cannot rest or leave the deck till we come up to that accursed ship and save my poor child my little darling if we be not too late too late This is nonsense sir said the skipper bluntly and rather angrily I thought and he continued The ship we know must be a goodish bit ahead of us still and we can t possibly overhaul her for an hour or more at the earliest So come cheer up and come along with me and have your leg attended to at once I insist colonel come But persisted Colonel Vereker evidently trying to make out the time in arguing and loth to leave the scene of action though apparently ready to drop now from sheer pain and exhaustion combined Who will who will My first officer here mister Fosset will remain on the bridge during our absence below interposed Captain Applegarth anticipating his last unuttered objection He s quite competent to take charge and I m sure will let us know the moment the ship comes in sight if she appears before we return on deck Aye that I will sir cried out mister Fosset I ll keep a sharp look out and I ll hail you sir sharp enough as soon as she heaves in sight on the horizon There exclaimed the skipper in an exultant tone taking hold of the colonel s reluctant arm and placing it within his own so as to lead him away and to give him the benefit of his support down the bridge ladder Won t that satisfy you now sir and you see you ll lose nothing by going below for a spell Come come my good friend have the leg seen to and eat something for you must require it Why colonel unless you keep up your strength and spur yourself up a bit you won t be able to tackle those black scoundrels when we get up to the ship and catch them and it comes to a fight as I expect it will So come along my hearty rouse yourself and come This concluding remark of the old skipper affected more than all his previous persuasion the colonel at once allowing himself to be helped down the laddering without further demur and so along the gangway on the upper deck towards the lower entrance to the saloon under the beak of the poop I lending the aid of my shoulder for the crippled man to lean on as he limped painfully onward having to pause at almost every step his wounded leg dragging now so much now that excitement no longer sustained his flagging frame the skipper gave aid too his arm propping him up on the other side CHAPTER SEVENTEEN DOCTOR AND PATIENT Faith it s moighty glad I am sor to say you at last cried Garry O Neil starting up from his seat at the cuddy table on our ultimately reaching the saloon where the Irish mate was having a rather late lunch with mister Stokes who had preceded us below I was jist comin after ye ag in colonel whin I had snatched a bit mouthful to kape the divvil out of me stomach sure I want to inspict that game leg o yours sor now that I ve sittled your poor f ind s h id Begorrah colonel somebody gave him a tidy rap on the skull whin they were about it It was done with a hand spike explained the other groaning with pain as we assisted him to a seat at the further end of the table where the skipper s armchair was drawn out for him to fix him up more comfortably One of those treacherous niggers came behind his back and dealt him a terrific blow that landed on the side of his head partly nearly cutting his ear off Aye I saw that sor of course put in Garry pouring out some brandy into a tumbler which he proceeded to fill up with water aqua pura he called it I ve shtrapped it on ag in now and it looks as nate as ninepins But jist dhrink this colonel dear It ll warrm the cockles of your heart sure an put frish loife into you The American took a sip first at the glass proffered him and then drained off the contents with a deep sigh of satisfaction Ah he exclaimed I feel a little better But how is poor Captain Alphonse now Bedad he s gitting on illegantly replied Garry sniffing at a soup plate containing some steaming compound which Weston the steward had just brought in and directing that worthy to place it in front of our poor invalid guest There was a nasty paice of bone sphlinter sticking in the crayture s brainpan but first I trepanned him an raymoved the impiddimint an the poor chap s now slayping as swately as a babby slayping in the cap en s cot over yonder But come colonel I want ye to take some of this pay soup here afore I set to work carving ye about Begorrah it s foine stuff an ll set ye up a bit to roights Thank you a thousand times returned he taking a mouthful or two of the soup which Weston had placed before him eating very sparingly at first like one who had been deprived of food for some time I m not afraid of your handling me sir I have undergone too many operations for that Faith colonel cried the Irishman laughing in his usual good tempered racy manner you d best spake well of the craft or I ll be afther payin you out sure alannah whin I get your leg in me grip Jist you stow some more o that illigint soup inside your belt sor before I start on the job an while ye re aitin I ll tell you how I once sarved out an old woman whom I was called in to docther whin I was at ould Trinity larnin the profession in faith That s right O Neil said the skipper seeing his motive in trying to set our sad guest at his ease and to try and distract his thoughts from the awful anxiety and grief under which he was labouring Have I heard the yarn before eh Faith not that I know of cap en returned the doctor pro tem in his free and easy manner Begorrah the joke s too much ag inst meself sor for me to be afther tillin the story too often Never mind that it will make it all the more interesting to us said the skipper with a knowing wink to mister Stokes both of them knowing Garry s old stories only too well but at such a time as this they would have listened to anything if it would only serve to distract the poor colonel s thoughts for a few minutes and they chuckled in recollection of the many jokes against himself that Garry had perpetrated Fire away with your yarn Bedad then here goes began O Neil with a grin Ye must know colonel if you will have it that I was only a sucking sawbones so to spake at the toime Faith I was a medical studint in my first year having barely mastered the bones The bones interrupted the skipper What the deuce do you mean man Sure the inthroductory study of anatomy sor explained Garry rather grandiloquently going on with his yarn Well one foine day whin I an another fellow who d kept the same terms as mesilf were walking the hospital wonderin whin we d be able to pass the college sure the hall porter comes into the ward we were in an axes if we knew where Professor Lancett the house surgeon was to be found as he was wanted at once Faix says Terence Mahony my chum the other medical studint who was with me He s gone to say the Lord Lieutenant who s been struck down with the maysles an the divvle only knows whin he ll get back from the castle sure What s the matter O Dowd Who wants ould Lancett at this outlandish toime of day The hall porter took Mahony s chaff faith in all sober sayriousness It s moighty sorry I am says he Master Lancett s gone to the castle though proud I am for ould Trinity s sake sayin as how the Lord Lieutenant has for to send to us sure bekase them murtheren sassa docthers that he brought from over the say with him from Inkland ain t a patch on our chaps But faix sor a poor woman as the professor knows is took moighty bad in her inside some of her neighbours says an wants help at onst Who is it O Dowd I asks Do you know where she lives Mistress Flannagan s her name says the porter She s Mistress Lancett s ould la ndress sor a cantankerous ould woman too an wid the divvle of a temper She lives jist out of Dame Strate sure in Abbey Lane Any one ll till ye the place sure What say you to goin to say the poor crayture says I to Terence Mahony We ll lave word where we re gone an I m sure mister Lancett will be plaised to hear we re looking afther the ould lady Begorrah that he will sor agreed O Dowd the porter It s moighty kind of you two young gintlemen going for to say her an I ll make a p int of lettin the docther know whin he comes back from the Lord Liftinnint All right O Dowd says I Mind you till the professor an he can thin follow us up on his return to the college that is if he loikes With that off the two of us wint on our errind of mercy though it was lucky I lift that message with O Dowd as ye ll larn prisintly It didn t take us long to find the house where the sick woman was for as we turned into the strate a dirty ould hag smoking a short pipe came up to us with a smirk on her ugly phiz God save Ireland says she addressing Terence Be yez the docther jintlemen from the hospital avic Faix we re that says my companion the pair of us Thin come along says she Mistress Flannagan is dyin to say you sure The soight of yez is good for sore eyes Begorrah says Terence I wouldn t have come at all at all if she hadn t been dyin the poor crayture Where is she In the corner there returns the old hag removing her dirty little black dhudeen of a pipe for a minnit from between her teeth in order to spake the bether She s a sottin in that cheir there as she hav been since the mornin widout sayin a worrd to mortial saol afther she tould us to sind for the docther May the divvle fly away with me but Peggy Flannagan can be obstinate in foith whin she likes Terence Mahony and I then poked our noses into the corner of the room the old hag stirrin the turf fire on the hearth to give us a bit of loight an then we saw the ould crayture who looked as broad as she was long sittin in a big armchere an starin at us with large open eyes But though she was breythin hard loike a grampus she didn t spake nothin What s the mather my good woman says Mahony going up to her an spaking kindly to the poor crayture Let me feel your pulse He caught hold of her hand which hung down the side of the chere and fumbled at the wrist for some toime the ould woman starin an sayin nothin at all at all Faith Garry O Neil I can t foind any pulse on her at all at all She must be di d worse luck Och you omahdaun can t ye say her eyes open says I Git out o the way an let me thry Begorrah though I couldn t fale any pulse at all aythar She s in a faint I think says Terence pretendin for to know all about it We had jist sich a case in hospital t other day It s oine of suspended animation Blatheration Terence I cried at hearing this You ll be a case of suspended animation yoursilf by and bye Faith how s that says he What do you mean Why whin you re hung me bhoy for your ignorance of your profession Sure one can say with half an eye the poor crayture is sufferin from lumbago or peritonitas on the craynium faith As we were arguin the p int the ould hag who had introduced us brought our discussion to an end jist as Terence made up his mind that the case was cholera or elephantiasis or something else equally ridiculous Bad cess to the obstinate cantankerous ould crayture cried she catching the poor sick woman by the scruff of the neck an shakin her violently backwards an forrads afther which she banged the poor thing violently on the sate of the chere Will ye now spake to their honours or will ye not Won t ye now She be that stubborn said she turnin to us did ye ivver see anythin loike it afore Mahony then tould her to put out her tongue but the divvle a bit of her tongue saw we Nor would she say a worrd as to her ailment to give us a clue though I believe on me oath colonel we mintioned ivery complaint known in the Pharmacopaia Terence even axin civilly if she had chilblames in the throat for it was the depth of winter at the toime to prevent her talkin But our coaxin was all in vain loike the ould hag s shaking Faith not a worrd moved our patient She was that in all conscience sure Begorrah I ll sind a bucket of could wather over her an say if that ll tach her manners said the ould hag who tould us her own name was Biddy Flynne on our giving her an odd sixthpence for a dhrop of drink It s a shame to bring yez honours out for nothin She was jist going to do what she had threatened sure enough whin providentially in walked the professor from the college He d been listenin outside the door I believe all the toime Terence an mesilf were talkin an arguin about the ould dame s complaint puzzlin our brains to find out what was the mather with her for the baste of a man had a broad grin on his face loike that you say on a mealy petaty whin the jacket pales off of it whin he toorned round to us afther examinin poor Mistress Flannagan now all a heap on her chere Faith I must complimint you jintlemin on the profound skill an knowledge you have shown in your profession says he I don t think I ivver heard a more ignorant or illeterate diagnosis of a case since I ve been professor at Trinity College He was a moighty polite man was Professor Lancett Terence an I both agrayed on his sayin this an thought our fortunes were made an we d git our diplomas at once without any examination sure But his nixt remark purty soon took the consate out of both of us It s lucky for you two dunder headed ignoramases he went on to say in a nasty sneerin way the baste had with him whin he was angry and was any way put out Preshous lucky for you Misther Terence Mahony an you too Garry O Neil that I chanced to come afther you thinkin ye d be up to some mischief or else ye d have put your foot in it with a vengeance an murthered between you this poor harmless ould woman lying here I am ashamed and disgusted with you He thin prosayded to till what the poor crayture was sufferin from an what d ye think her complaint was colonel Jist give a guess now jist to oblige me sure Great Scot cried the American smiling at O Neil s naive manner and the happy and roguish expression on his face our guest s appearance having been much improved by the food of which he had partaken as well as the stimulant which had put some little colour into his pale cheeks I m sure I can t guess But what was it sir for you have excited my curiosity CHAPTER EIGHTEEN A BLACK BUSINESS Be jabers sor exclaimed the Irishman in his very broadest brogue and with a comical grin on his face that certainly must have eclipsed that of which he complained in the professor of his college who had caught him and his fellow student trespassing on his medical preserves To till the truth an shame the divvle colonel the poor ould crayture whose complaint we couldn t underconstumble at all at all sure was sufferin from a fit of apoplexy a thing aisy enough to recognise by any docther of experience though faith it moight have been Grake to us We were all very much amused and had a good laugh at this naive confession even Colonel Vereker sharing in the general mirth in spite of his profound melancholy and the pain he felt from his wounded leg which made him wince every now and again I noticed during the narration of the story Garry O Neil had thus told with the utmost good humour it must be confessed at his own expense as indeed he had made us understand beforehand that it would be By George cried the skipper after having his laugh out you ll be the death of me some day with your queer yarns if you can t manage to do for me with your professional skill or by the aid of your drugs and lotions poisons most of em and all your murderous looking instruments besides No fear of that cap en you re too tough a customer rejoined the doctor with a knowing look in the direction of mister Stokes who had made himself purple in the face and was panting and puffing on his seat trying to recover his breath Faith though sor talkin of medical skill the sooner I say afther that leg of our fri nd here the better I m thinkin With the best of wills assented the colonel who had finished his luncheon by this time and certainly presented a much improved appearance to that he had worn when entering the saloon I am quite at your service doctor and promise to be as quiet as that first patient of yours of whom you ve just told us Belay that colonel none o your chaff about the ould leddy if you love me sure growled Garry pretending to be indignant as he knelt down on the cabin floor and slit up the leg of the colonel s trousers so as to inspect the wound His nonsensical quizzing manner changed instantly however on seeing the serious state of the injured limb and he ejaculated in a subdued tone of voice Holy Moses Why sir said the patient quietly what s the matter now Ah an ye are axin what s the mather cried Garry in a still more astonished tone Faith it s wantin to know I am how the divvle you ve iver been able to move about at all at all colonel with that thing there Look at it now an till me what ye think of it yoursilf me darlint May the saints presairve us but did any one iver say such a leg It was in truth a fearful looking object being swollen to the most abnormal proportions from the ankle joint to the thigh while the skin was of a dark hue save where some extravasated blood clustered about a small punctured orifice just above the knee Colonel Vereker laughed and shrugged his shoulders The fortune of war he explained One of those brutes shot me where that mark is but I think the bullet travelled all round my thigh and lodged somewhere in the groin I fancy for I feel a lump there Sure I wonder you can fale anythin cried Garry who was probing for the missile all the time A man that can walk about faith loike an opera dancer with a blue mouldy leg loike that can t have much faling at all at all I m thinkin Ah groaned his patient at last on his touching the obnoxious bullet near the spot the colonel had indicated Whew that hurts at any rate doctor Just be aisy a minnit me darlint said the other soothingly exchanging his probe for a pair of forceps and proceeding deftly to extract the leaden messenger An if ye can t be aisy faith try an be as aisy as ye can In another second he had it out with a triumphant and gleeful shout Ah ejaculated the colonel the excessive pain causing him to clench his teeth with an audible snap Faith you may say ah now as much as you please said Garry as he held out the villainous looking bullet gripped in his forceps For there s the baste that did you all the damage an we ll soon pull you up alannah with that ugly paice of mischief out of the way sure Oh dear me the poor colonel exclaimed as the doctor went on dressing the wound and afterwards set to to bandage the whole leg swathing it round like a mummy with lint and then saturating it with some liniment to allay the swelling Would to God all the mischief could be as easily made good Oh my little Elsie my darling little girl Cheer up colonel cheer up whispered the skipper coming in from the state room on the starboard side of the saloon whither he had gone to hunt up some special cigars while Garry O Neil was accomplishing his surgical operation We re going ahead as fast as steam and a good ship can carry us and we ll rescue your child I ll wager before nightfall Have a smoke now my friend and while you re trying one of the Havanah s which never paid duty and are none the worse for that you can tell us how it all happened from the beginning to the end I should like to hear the account of your voyage right through colonel and how those blacks came to board you Certainly said Colonel Vereker leaning back in his easy chair when Garry O Neil had made an end of bandaging his leg and accepting one of the choice cigars the skipper offered him I will tell you willingly captain and you gentlemen turning round and bowing to us the sad story of our thrice ill fated voyage Thrice ill fated repeated mister Stokes inquiringly the chief being rather argumentative by nature and possessing what he called a strictly logical turn of mind But how s that sir The colonel had his answer quite ready I said thrice ill fated advisedly sir he replied removing his cigar from his lips to emit a cloud of perfumed smoke and then restoring the fragrant roll of tobacco to the mouth again In the first place sir from my having been unlucky enough ever to start upon the voyage at all Secondly from the fact of a calm delaying us when passing between Puerto Rico and San Domingo thereby enabling those treacherous negro scoundrels to see our ship in time to put out for us from the shore and thirdly because Captain Alphonse would not take my advice and use strong measures when the mutiny originally broke out which might have prevented the terrible events that afterwards occurred But sir if you will allow me I shall get along better by telling you what happened just in my own way Certainly sir immediately replied mister Stokes profuse in his apologies Pray pardon my interruption The colonel bowed in token of his forgiveness and then resumed his yarn Our ship the Saint Pierre of Marseilles Jacques Alphonse master and part owner sailed from La Guayra on October twenty five barely a fortnight ago said he In addition to her captain of course she carried two mates and a crew of twenty five hands all told and she was bound for Liverpool with a general cargo of cocoa coffee and hides besides a mixed assortment of indigo orris root sarsaparilla and other raw drugs for the English market Were you and your little daughter the only passengers No Senor Applegarth replied the other There were also on board Monsieur and Madame Boisson from Caracas returning home to Europe after a lengthened residence in the Venezuelan capital where they had carried on a large millinery business supplying the dusky senoritas of the hybrid Spanish and native republic with the latest Parisian modes Don Miguel the proprietor of an extensive estancia in the interior and little mister Johnson a Britisher of not much account in your country I guess not a gentleman at all events in my humble opinion He was travelling for some mercantile house in London connected with the manufactory of chocolates or sweets or something of that sort I cannot say I cared much for the lot as they were not people of my class so I did not allow my Elsie my darling my pet to associate with them more than could be helped save with Madame Boisson who was a kind good natured sort of woman though decidedly vulgar Oh dear me It was a thousand pities we ever started on that disastrous voyage It was unlucky from the very first Faith interposed Garry O Neil But how was that sor We were too late in reaching La Guayra in the first instance replied Colonel Vereker I had planned my friend to take the French steamer for Brest but on arriving at the port I found she had already left and while deliberating about what I should do under the circumstances for there would not be another mail boat for a fortnight at least I met Captain Alphonse He was an old friend of mine a friend of long standing so on his telling me that his vessel was going to sail on the following day and would probably convey me to Brest where he said he would have to report himself prior to proceeding to Liverpool with his cargo quite as soon as I should arrive if I waited for the next steamer I made up my mind to accompany him But colonel suggested Captain Applegarth you might have gone direct to England by one of the West India mail steamers which touch at La Guayra on their route homeward from Colon I know that my friend said the other I could have caught one of them the following week This would not have suited my purpose however sir I wished to proceed direct to Brest for I could get easily on to Paris where I intended placing my little Elsie at school in the convent of L enfant Jesu at Neuilly under the guardianship of some good nuns by whom her poor mother was educated and brought up It was a promise my friend to the dead I see colonel rejoined the skipper apologetically lighting his cigar again having allowed it to go out while listening to the other I see sir Go on I m all attention Well then continued the colonel these preliminaries being all arranged Elsie and I went aboard the Saint Pierre a full rigged sailing ship of some eight hundred tons the morning of the twenty eighth of last month and on the evening of the same day as I have already told you we made sail and quitted the anchorage where the ship had been loading abreast of San Miguel a port that guards the roadstead to the eastward where it is open to the sea Aye I know La Guayra well colonel put in the skipper at this point showing that he was following every detail I was in the Royal Mail Line when I was a nipper before joining my present company I recollect the night we sailed resumed the other paying no attention to Captain Applegarth s remark but speaking with his eyes fixed as if in a dream and seeing mentally before him the scenes he described The moon was shining brightly when we got under way lighting up the Trinchera bastion and making the mountains in the background seem higher than they were from the deep shadows they cast over the town lying below This latter lay embosomed amid a mass of tall cocoanut trees and gorgeous palms with other tropical foliage and had a shining beach of white sand immediately in its front stretching round the curling bay on which the surf broke in the moonlight with a phosphorescent glow and a hollow sound as if beating over a grave Heavens It was the grave of all my dearest hopes and plans for that sir was one of the few last peaceful nights I have of late known and very probably ever shall know again Faith don t say that now sir cried out Garry at this You ll have a peaceful one to night sure or I m no prophet Begorrah though I niver was so far as that goes The skipper grinned at this sympathetic interpolation and the colonel s sombre face lighted up a bit as he turned his pathetic eyes on the speaker as if wishing to share his hopefulness Ah doctor you do not know what grief and anguish are like he said mournfully But to go on with my story I may tell you that had our voyage progressed like our start I should have nothing to deplore for the land breeze filling our sails we bore away buoyantly from the Venezuelan coast the ship shaping a course north by west towards the Mona passage as the channel way is called from a rock in its centre lying between Hayti and Puerto Rico This route is held to be the best I believe for passing out into the open Atlantic from the labyrinthine groups of islands and innumerable islets that gem the blue waters of the Caribbean Sea It is a course too which by its directness and the northerly current and westerly wind there to be met saves a lot of useless tacking about and beating to windward as you no doubt captain very well know The skipper nodded his head You re quite a sailor colonel he said approvingly Where did you manage to pick up your knowledge of navigation and sea faring matters if I may ask the question sir In the many voyages I have made during a somewhat adventurous life replied the other I have invariably kept my ears and eyes open captain There are many things thus to be learnt I have found out from experience which although seemingly unimportant in themselves frequently turn out afterwards to be of very great use to us sometimes indeed almost unexpectedly so Aye aye colonel My opinion sir right down to the ground said the skipper looking towards me Just you put that in your pipe Dick Haldane and smoke it Yes young sir added Colonel Vereker emphasising this piece of advice That rule of life has stood me in good stead on more than one occasion both on land and on shipboard Had I not learnt something of the ways of your sailors for instance I might not have thought of lashing the Saint Pierre s helm amidships on the breaking out of the mutiny and so prevented all our going to the bottom subsequently when it came on to blow for all of us were then fighting for our lives and no one had time to attend to the ship save in the way of letting go what ropes were handiest Aye that may be well enough colonel observed the skipper in his dry fashion But your argument cuts both ways If your helm hadn t been lashed down remember the ship would have been yawing about and drifting in this direction and that and we should probably have come across her long ago like that boat from which we picked you up instead of her bearing away right before the wind and our having to go in chase of her sir as we are now doing It is true I did not think of that returned the colonel impulsively half starting from his seat in his excitement We must be near her now captain though surely We must find them and I must see my little girl again Kape aisy me darlint kape aisy here interposed Garry O Neil before Captain Applegarth could answer the question Sure mister Fosset promised to give us the worrd whin she hove in sight an you re only distarbin yoursilf for nothing colonel More s the pity too mabruchal whin your leg is progressin so illigantly an the swillin goin down as swately as possible Now kape aisy if only to oblige me Faith colonel me profissional reputation s at shtake The Irishman all the time he was talking was carefully attending to the injured limb loosening a bandage here tightening another there and keeping the lint dressing moist the while with a lotion which he applied gently to the surface by means of a sponge So impressed alike by his tender solicitude thus practically shown on his behalf as much as by his opportune admonition the colonel was forced to remain quiet I wish he d be quick about it he muttered to himself Well doctor as you will not let me move I suppose you will let me go on with my tale that is if it interests you Aye aye I want to hear everything said the skipper And fire away colonel there s plenty of time for you to reel off your yarn before we overhaul the chase All right then I will proceed replied the other All went well with us on the voyage until the afternoon of the third day after sailing from La Guayra when unfortunately the weather changed and the westerly wind which had favoured us so far suddenly failed us after wafting us through the Mona Passage and we became becalmed off Cap San Engano to the northward of Hayti Hayti exclaimed old mister Stokes waking up from a short nap he had been having on the sly and pretending to be keenly alive to the conversation That s the famous black republic ain t it Famous black pandemonium you mean retorted the colonel fiercely his eyes flashing at once with fire Excuse me sir but I have seen so much of these negro brutes who ape the airs of civilisation and yet after a century of freedom are more uncivilised in their habits and mode of life than the African slaves their forefathers whom Toussaint L Overture as he styled himself their leader freed from the yoke of their French masters a hundred years ago that I feel the glorious name republic to be dishonoured when associated with such vile wretches wretches a thousand times worse than the Fantees of the West Coast from whom they originally sprang My dear sir said mister Stokes aghast at the tempest he had raised by his innocent remark you surprise me Heavens you would be surprised sir if you knew these Haytians as I know them to be continued the colonel his indignation still struggling for the mastery a race of devil worshippers and cannibals who confound liberty with license and have added all the vices of civilisation to the inherent savagery of their innate animal nature Ah sir I should like to tell you a great deal more but have not the time now I am afraid I am forgetting myself Where was I Becalmed off Cape San Engano promptly replied the skipper sailor fashion at least so you said colonel but I fancy you must have had a little rougher weather in that latitude than you mentioned at first We had said Colonel Vereker meaningly Towards nightfall we drifted with the current more inshore Captain Alphonse not dropping our anchor as we expected the land breeze would spring up at sunset This did not come for an hour later however for already darkness had begun to surround us and we could see the fireflies illuminating the brush beyond the beach But this wasn t all observed sir Just as our sails filled again and the ship slowly drew out into the offing we heard the splash of oars in the water astern It was a boat coming after us propelled by a dozen oars at least pulling as hard as those handling them knew how a shot or two from the shore and the sound of musket balls ripping the water explaining in some way the reason for their anxiety to get beyond the range of the firing on which account they sought the shelter of the Saint Pierre of course at least so we thought Who goes there shouted out Captain Alphonse who was standing alone with me close to the taffrail Poor devils there is probably another insurrection at Port au Prince and President Salomon up or down again He is always one or the other every year or so and these poor fellows may be flying to save their miserable necks Who goes there Who goes there But whether wanting all their energy for their oars or for some other reason known to themselves those in the boat made no reply to our hail and the next moment ere the ship gathered way sufficient to gain on them they were alongside their long unwieldy craft grating against the ship s timbers beneath her counter Look out there forrads cried Captain Alphonse seeing the boat making apparently for our bows but before a hand could be raised to prevent them without asking permission in any way or offering the slightest apology or excuse in advance for their conduct a number of negroes jumped out of her and began climbing aboard the Saint Pierre Heavens gentlemen clad in little beyond Nature s own covering as the majority of the intruders were and looking in the dim light as black as the ace of spades they seemed like so many demons come to take possession of our unfortunate ship as indeed they were Oh dear me CHAPTER NINETEEN THE MARQUIS DE POMME ROSE A pretty kettle of fish that exclaimed the skipper pitching the butt end of his cigar through one of the stern ports as he got up from his seat and began to pace up and down the saloon in his usual quarter deck fashion You must have been mad colonel to let them come aboard so quietly and in such a manner too Stay you have not heard all said the other As the black rascals tumbled over the side one of them called out something in the French tongue This sir at once disarmed Captain Alphonse who had prevented me from teaching them good manners which I otherwise should have done for I had my six shooter ready with the barrels all loaded being always prepared for any such little unpleasantness by my experiences in Venezuela where a man often carries his life in his own hands But Captain Alphonse would not let me fire though by heavens I would have accounted for half a dozen of them I know before they had advanced beyond the precincts of the ship No no be quiet cried he knocking my arm up to prevent my taking aim at the leader of the gang whom I had spotted dead in the eye These are my countrymen It was no use my talking after that sir The sound of the French tongue which these blacks of Hayti speak with a better accent than the gamins of Paris gained over Captain Alphonse while Madame Boisson declared the whole episode truly charming her fat husband who was entirely under her thumb shrugging his shoulders and giving them both encouragement and a welcome These charming compatriots of theirs therefore being allowed to take us by storm without let or hindrance now advanced aft when their ringleader a plausible scoundrel who described himself as the Marquis de Pomme Rose or some other similar shoddy title belonging to the black peerage of Hayti to which I did not give heed at the time beyond in my own mind thinking it ridiculous and that it was probably a name made up for the occasion this man came up to Captain Alphonse with a smile on his black face and told a wonderful story which he had calculated would excite our pity while allaying our fears There had been another revolution at Port au Prince he said as Captain Alphonse had surmised A band of patriots of whom he the speaker had the honour to be the chief had attempted to depose the reigning despot Salomon from his post of president but that that astute gentleman got wind of the conspiracy in time and as he had a very efficacious mode of quickly dealing with those opposed to him in political matters the nigger marquis and his fellow plotters thought it best to seek refuge in flight Salomon of course at once despatched his myrmidons after them but having a few hours start of the pursuers the runaway revolutionists contrived to clear off from Port au Prince concealing themselves in the mountain fastnesses at the eastern end of the island Here while in hiding they saw the Saint Pierre rounding Cape San Engano Subsequently observing that she was becalmed they waited for nightfall when they stole a boat that lay on the shore and pulled out towards our ship just avoiding capture in the nick of time the regiment of black soldiers Salomon had sent after them having hit upon their trail and being so close up behind that they were able to open fire on them ere the boat got into deep water two of the fugitive patriots being struck by the bullets that came whistling in their rear The marquis was of the belief that we were bound for Cuba so he declared at all events at the moment and he asked Captain Alphonse with the utmost indifference to give him and his companions a passage thither assuring him that he would be handsomely rewarded for so doing by some of their friends belonging to the Haytian revolutionary party who had established their headquarters at Havana In reply to this request Captain Alphonse declared he was desolated but that unfortunately the Saint Pierre was bound for Europe and not to the greater Antilles but strange to say for I was watching him keenly the while our friend the marquis did not appear either surprised or dismayed at his supposition as to our destination turning out to be so erroneous as he would have been so I thought had he been speaking the truth in his original narrative and acting in good faith towards us From that moment sir something in my mind seemed to warn me against the black villain though I had been previously rather prepossessed in his favour by his manner and bearing in spite of a strong antipathy to republicans of his complexion Ah colonel whispered the skipper I suppose it comes from living amongst them too much but I see you don t like negroes No you mistake my meaning greatly if you think that Senor Applegarth Black white or yellow the colour makes no difference to me providing the individual I may have to deal with be a man in the true sense of the word In the old days before our war I had a good deal to do with niggers for my father and his father before him owned a large plantation in Louisiana and long before President Lincoln issued his proclamation of emancipation every hand on our estate was a free man so you see sir I do not advocate slavery at all events But between slavery and unbridled liberty there is Senor Applegarth a wide margin and though I do not look upon a nigger in the abstract as either a brute beast or a human chattel still I do not consider him quite fit to govern himself nor do I regard him in the light of my brother sir nor even as my equal in any way The skipper laughed What s bred in the bone colonel you know the rest said he Your old experience in the Southern States prejudices you against the race Pardon me rejoined Colonel Vereker warmly I don t dislike them at all On the contrary I have found some negroes more faithful than any white man of my acquaintance being true to the death and I know that if I came across to morrow any of the old hands on our Louisianian plantation whom my father made free I should be as glad to see them as they would be to meet me But sir at the same time allowing all this I cannot admit the negro to be on an equality with the white races They are inferior I am certain alike in intelligence disposition and nature and I hold him as little qualified for self government on the European system as a child is fit to be entrusted with a case of razors for playthings Hayti is an illustration of this sir All right my dear sir said the skipper good humouredly glad to see the colonel taken out of himself and forgetting his grief about his little daughter for the moment in the discussion Carry on we re listening to you His enthusiasm however did not last very long Heavens Senor Applegarth and you too gentlemen he went on in a changed tone I have cause to love those Haytian scoundrels well I tell you Well sirs to proceed with my story the terrible end of which I have nearly reached this dog of a black rascal the so called marquis seemed quite content much to my surprise when Captain Alphonse told him we were not bound for Cuba but for Liverpool It was all the same to him he said and as they were going the longer voyage perhaps Captain Alphonse would allow him and his companions to work out their passage by assisting the crew in the navigation of the ship Captain Alphonse was delighted at this for we had only half a dozen good seamen on board the rest of the hands being a lot of half bred mulattoes and niggers some of the scourings of South America whom he had picked up at La Guayra most of whom knew how to handle a cutlass better than a rope so the proposed addition to the strength of our ship s company was a very acceptable one particularly as the Marquis pointed out two of his companions as being expert sailors and qualified pilots and navigators Ha You kept your eye on those gentry colonel I bet you did Yes sir They were the first I spotted when the row began but I m anticipating matters The divvle a bit sor interposed Garry O Neil Let me jist change the dressin of your leg an ye can polish off the rist of the rascals as soon as ye plaize A thousand thanks returned the other shifting his position to allow his leg to be attended to They did not disclose their purpose though or show their hand as they say at the game of monte all at once for moved by their voluntary offer to help work the ship Captain Alphonse promised the marquis who when making this offer had urged a request to that effect calculating on the captain s generosity to put in and leave the lot at Bermuda should they make a fair passage up to the parallel of that island but in the event of their being delayed by foul winds or the voyage appearing as if it must be a long one the Haytians must be contented to cross the ocean The bargain was struck at once this proviso being accepted with alacrity as it just suited their purpose and never saw I men work as those Haytians worked in the way of tumbling up at all hours and pulling and hauling shaking out reefs and setting fresh sail the next day or two when the weather was contrary and we had to tack about a good deal to windward in getting out into the open Atlantic Heavens How they exerted themselves so much so that I quite shared Captain Alphonse s admiration for them but unlike him I watched them and I noticed that they and the coloured men of our crew who had been picked up at La Guayra seemed on a more friendly footing than was altogether warranted by the short time they had been on board Captain Alphonse and the other passengers however would not see this But sir I had an old negro servant on board with me who had followed my fortunes from the States to Venezuela after the war Louisiana then being no longer a fit place for a white man to live in Poor old Cato he was the most faithful soul the Almighty ever put breath into Him I acquainted with my suspicions and sent amongst the blacks to gather what information he could of their designs for I was confident sirs they had not boarded us for nothing and were hatching some deep plot with a view very probably of getting possession of our ship in order the better to further the interests of the revolutionary party to which they belonged that was opposed to Salomon the president in power Whatever their object might be however I distrusted them in every way believing them indeed actuated by other motives than such as might be prompted by their political aspirations my suspicions being confirmed by the looks and bearing of the gang who seemed capable of any atrocity judging them by their villainous faces and generally hang dog appearance besides which they were continually whispering together amongst themselves and consorting and confabbing with the mulattoes and other coloured men belonging to the crew In addition to that Senor Applegarth and you too gentlemen I noticed that our friend the marquis although he gave himself great airs on account of the aristocratic blood and descent to which he lay claim pretending to think himself much superior in position to both Captain Alphonse and myself and regarding poor Cato my servant as mere dirt under his feet albeit the faithful negro was of a like colour to himself did not esteem it beneath his high dignity to associate with the scum of the forecastle and bandy ribald obscenities when he believed himself unobserved with his fellow scoundrels Aye I watched my gentleman carefully and so too did my poor faithful Cato CHAPTER TWENTY THE SEVENTH OF NOVEMBER My faithful negro however continued the colonel pausing at this point to puff out another cloud of smoke from his fragrant cigar well he was unable to learn anything of the Haytians though he tried to make friends of them for they always stopped their talk amongst themselves on his approach and would only reply to his overtures in monosyllables expressive of distrust accompanied by contemptuous gestures that angered poor Cato greatly for as he considered that he belonged to me he felt the insult to be directed not only at himself but at the whole family Golly massa he said to me after a couple or so of attempts that proved fruitless to ingratiate himself into the confidence of the gang you just wait I catch dem black raskils nappin by an bye you see massa You see speshly dat tarn markiss He managed this sooner than he thought and pretty smartly too for the very next day he caught the noble scoundrel who was his particular aversion walking off with a pair of pistols from Captain Alphonse s cabin On Cato coming up and stopping him in the very act the marquis put down the pistols quickly saying in his off hand manner that he was merely examining the locks remarking how well they were made But said Cato guess he no bamboozle dis chile The following day sirs was the seventh of November last Friday that awful that terrible day Cato who had been away forward early in the morning to see about our breakfast came back aft with a terrified face Yay massa said he guess dose tam niggars up to sumfin I se hear um say dey smell de lan an de time was rive to settle de white trash dat what dey say an take ship One ob de tam raskel see me come out of gully an say cut um tongue out if I se tell youse massa Of course on hearing this I put Captain Alphonse immediately on his guard and we locked up all the spare arms and ammunition until we should require the same excepting our own revolvers and three other pistols which we served out to the two mates and the boatswain all of whom were good men and brave Frenchmen Monsieur Boisson when he was asked if he would have one shrugged his shoulders and said he was a simple passenger he did not understand fighting it was not his affair while little mister Johnson said he was an Englishman and preferred using his fists Don Miguel had a pistol of his own Jingo The emergency we dreaded came soon enough sir indeed sooner than we expected and it was fortunate we had been forewarned It was just after the noontide hour I recollect that well for Captain Alphonse had just taken the altitude of the sun to ascertain our position when as he came up from his cabin where he had gone to consult his chronometers and work out the reckoning as you sailors call it that that black devil the marquis mounted the poop with a simpering and fawning air Ah well captain said he with a very polite bow where do you make us out to be monsieur Near the Bermudas yet My word yes replied Captain Alphonse We are some ten leagues or so the westward of the islands but we re bearing up now as you see to reach them And what time monsieur said the marquis speaking louder so that some of the other niggers who were on the deck below could hear what he said Do you think it will be possible for us to land My companions and myself monsieur as you can well imagine are most anxious to get ashore as soon as possible so that we may procure a ship to take us on to Havana But yes your anxiety is natural enough responded poor Captain Alphonse suspecting nothing from this I hope to approach near enough to Port Saint George to put you ashore some time in the afternoon Ohe below there cried out the Haytian in reply to this addressing his companions in the waist who I noticed were gradually edging themselves more and more aft Do you hear that my brave boys We are going to land at last Get the boat ready This was evidently a signal for he shouted out the last words in a still higher key than that in which he had been speaking You need not hurry my friend said the captain surprised at this order and smiling at the Haytian s impulsiveness as he thought it There will be plenty of time for lowering the boat when we come in sight of land I think differently monsieur rejoined the other scowling and assuming an arrogant tone for the first time I say the time is Now This he yelled out at the top of his voice Instantly the gang of blacks made a rush at the poop on both sides at once and Captain Alphonse clutched at his revolver which he had in his pocket but was unable to get it out in time Mine however was in my hand and ready cocked Houly Moses ejaculated Garry O Neil his Irish blood making him all attention now at the mere mention of fighting I hope ye let em have it hot sor Guess I did replied Colonel Vereker grimly dropping unconsciously into his native vernacular which up to now he had almost seemed to have forgotten from his long residence amongst a Spanish speaking race You may bet your bottom dollar on that sir I aimed at that scoundrel the marquis but he jumped backward in his fright and his foot catching in one of the ringbolts he tumbled right over the poop rail on to the deck below the shot I had intended for him dropping the black pilot his constant companion and who was invariably behind him He dropped down as dead as a herring Don Miguel who luckily had just come up from the saloon being handy with his revolver from the rough times he had experienced like myself in Venezuela settled another darkie while little Johnson the Englishman caught up a long hand spike bigger than himself and with it knocked down two of the Haytians to his own cheek Madame Boisson meanwhile was screaming for her husband her brave Hercules to come to the rescue but the brave Hercules had locked himself in his cabin as my little Elsie told me afterwards for fortunately the poor child was not feeling well and I had desired her to remain below during the hot noontide heat of the sun and she also said she could hear him crying and sobbing and calling down imprecations on everybody including my wife and himself for both being in such a position Madame Boisson hammering at the door all the time and after finding he would not reopen to her appeal for help apostrophising him as a coward a pig During this time we were pretty busy on deck the second mate Basseterre and another French seaman who was with him in the crossjack yard having come down from aloft to our assistance Captain Alphonse got his revolver out when he and Don Miguel and I giving them a volley altogether and the others supporting us with what weapons they had we rushed the rascals off the poop quicker than they came up the lot returning to the forecastle along with the marquis who I was very glad to see had cut his face considerably by his tumble Captain Alphonse thereupon seeing the coast clear sang out for Housi his second officer and the boatswain who he thought were away forward to come up aft and join us so that we might all be together but instead of these men Cato my own black servant ran up the poop ladder and told us in much trepidation that Monsieur Housi with the boatswain Rigault and one of the French sailors were imprisoned in the forepeak while the two white sailors and the steward were hard and fast in the main hold whither they had descended to get some provisions the mutineers slipping on the hatchway cover over them on the marquis that devil giving the signal Ah my poor fellows cried Captain Alphonse That then means there are only ourselves left Good heavens What shall we do Why hoist a signal of distress I suggested at once We are near Bermuda on the cruising ground of the English men of war and as these scoundrels have no friends or assistance I daresay we ll be able to hold out here until some vessel bears up to our aid Good my friend replied Captain Alphonse who with Basseterre the second mate and Don Miguel remained to keep guard with their revolvers both seated on top of the skylight hatchway which commanded the approaches to the poop by way of the ladders while I with the last of the white sailors ran aft Then I called out Hoist the French flag I knew that the locker with the flags was in the wheel house close to the taffrail and there being no one to interfere with us the negro who had been attending the helm having bolted the moment I pulled out my revolver at the first alarm the traitor flying to join the other mutineers my sailor and I soon ferretted out an old ensign the Tricolour when binding it on to the signal halliards we hoisted it about half way up the peak of our spanker whence it could best be seen by a passing ship Did you know what that signal meant colonel said Captain Applegarth in an inquiring tone that you had a death aboard eh Si senor Oh yes of course repeated the colonel correcting himself almost as soon as he spoke for his lapse again into the Spanish tongue There were half a dozen dead Haytians there whom by the way Captain Alphonse and I presently pitched over the side But beyond that sir I believe all sailors regard a flag hoisted in that way half mast high as it is termed to be a signal of distress Without doubt sir answered the skipper I was only testing your nautical experience that s all I am glad then I did not make a blunder about it as I thought I had done from your question returned Colonel Vereker quite seriously not noticing that the skipper was only poking fun at him in his way and did not mean anything beyond a bit of chaff Well sir after hoisting the flag the French sailor and I seized the opportunity to lash the helm amidships so as to keep the Saint Pierre on her course for we could not spare him to do the steering and Captain Alphonse and Don Miguel with the plucky little Englishman and myself had all our work to do watching the mutineers with our revolvers After a time as the rascals kept pretty quiet in their part of the ship and as my poor little daughter Elsie had been a long time now shut up below I thought she might come up on the poop to get a breath of fresh air while it was still light there being no fear of the blacks assailing us again so long as they knew we could see to shoot straight and had our weapons handy So I sent Cato down to fetch her on deck and she came up the next moment all full of curiosity and alarm as you may imagine the little one wanting to know what had occurred for the reports of my revolver and the subsequent stillness had occasioned her great fright Madame Boisson and her husband the brave Hercules being but poor comforters All at once while I was explaining to her about the flag telling her that we had hoisted it in order to summon any passing ship to our assistance she suddenly went to the side and looked over the bulwarks towards the north The next moment she gave vent to a cry of joy Oh my father she suddenly exclaimed You have only just hoisted the flag in time There s a big steamer Look look there it is and coming up to help us Where where Where is it I cannot see it Nonsense Elsie you are dreaming my child I said looking out eagerly to where she pointed but could see nothing There s no ship there little one and I felt angry at the false alarm But my father you are wrong still insisted the child as positive as you please I can see the vessel there in the distance quite plainly See how the black smoke comes puffing out of the chimneys I laughed at this Little darling said I there was no ship and there are no chimneys on board ships at sea Sailors call them funnels my dearest one She pretended to pout on my thus catching her tripping in her talk Well my father said she with a shrug of her shoulders as is her habit sometimes I may be wrong about the chimneys but I am not wrong about seeing a ship Why my father there she is now coming closer and closer and quite near so near that I can see yes I can see I am quite sure a big boy there Look look father dear There he is in front of the smoke He has quite a pleasant face Elsie turned in my direction as she spoke and though I was still gazing all the while I could see nothing and I was vexed very vexed with my little girl for her persistency in the matter Why it has gone quite disappeared she cried out the instant after on rushing to the side and looking over What does it mean Why did she not come and help if she saw the flag You have dreamt it little one I replied shortly as I had done before It s a freak of the imagination and you fancied it you funny little woman But it was a curious incident though sir was it not at such a time with our hearts all full of expectancy and hope Captain Applegarth was greatly excited by the narrative and so it may readily be believed was I He asked abruptly When did this happen Tell me colonel at once It is strange very so The other looked up with surprise while mister Stokes stared at him with wonder and the Irishman opened his big blue eyes wide to the full I have already told you sir replied Colonel Vereker very quickly As I told you before it was the seventh of November last Friday Yes but I mean what time of the day sir Oh I should think about five o clock in the afternoon Perhaps a little later as the sun was going down I recollect at the time I could not restrain my astonishment at this It must be the very ship I saw I thought to myself Is the young lady slight in figure and has she long golden coloured hair hanging loose about her head sir I eagerly asked almost breathless in my excitement And tell me too did she have a large black Newfoundland or retriever dog by her side that same evening sir Colonel Vereker seemed even more astonished by this question of mine than I had been by his reply to Captain Applegarth the moment before My brave young sir said he using this somewhat grandiloquent form of addressing me I suppose in remembrance of the slight service I had done him by swimming with the line to the drifting boat when we picked up him and his companion My little Elsie is tall and slight for her age and her hair is assuredly of a golden hue ah yes like liquid sunshine though how you my good young gentleman who to my knowledge can never have seen her face to face in this life can know the colour of her hair or what she is like I must confess that passes my comprehension But the dog sir That is stranger still remarked Colonel Vereker I had forgotten to mention that I brought with me on board the Saint Pierre from my old home at Caracas a splendid Russian wolf hound as faithful a creature as my poor negro servant Cato His name is Ivan and he is now I sincerely hope and trust guarding my little darling girl as I would have done if I had remained with her for not a living soul would dare to touch her with him there Ivan would tear them limb from limb first He is a large greyish black dog with a rough shaggy coat and in reply to your enquiry I must tell you he was on the poop of the ship by the side of my child at the very time that she declared she saw that steamer which I myself could not see anywhere For the moment I was unable to speak I was so overcome at this unexpected confirmation of the sight I had seen on that eventful Friday night though I had afterwards been inclined to disbelieve the evidence of my own senses as everybody else had done even the skipper at last joining in with the opinion of mister Fosset and all the rest save the boatswain old Masters Yes yes every one them imagined that I had dreamt of the ghost ship as they called my vision and that I had not seen it at all But this statement from the colonel absolutely staggered the skipper and he looked from me to the American and back again at me in the most bewildering manner possible the old chief mister Stokes and Garry O Neil staring at the pair of us with equal amazement By George the girl and the dog the girl and the dog Why it s the very same ship as you say Haldane it must be so and by George my boy you were right after all By George you were at length exclaimed the skipper in a voice the genuineness of whose astonishment could not be doubted Colonel Vereker I would not have credited this had any one told it me and sworn to the truth of it on oath but the proof is so strong that I cannot possibly disbelieve it sir though it is to my mind a downright impossibility according to every argument of common sense It is certainly the most wonderful thing that has ever happened to me and the most wonderful thing that I have ever heard of since I have been at sea Heavens cried the other But why You surprise me sir Aye colonel rejoined the skipper But I am going to surprise you more Now don t laugh at me and don t think me an idiot and gone off my head sir when I tell you that this lad Dick Haldane here whether by reason of some mirage or other I cannot tell for it s beyond my understanding altogether distinctly saw your ship with her signal of distress and says he saw your little daughter with the dog by her side aboard her last Friday night at sunset More than that sir he described to me at the time exactly as you have done now colonel everything he saw even to the very hue of the young girl s hair and the colour and texture of the dog s coat It is altogether marvellous and indeed incredible Well but said Colonel Vereker slowly and pausing between every word as if trying to comprehend it all Why how is that sir Your ship colonel must have been more than five hundred miles away from ours at the time that is all CHAPTER TWENTY ONE BUTCHERED Dios exclaimed Colonel Vereker Are you certain of this sir Captain Applegarth shrugged his shoulders Ask mister Stokes here and your doctor there mister O Neil whether they did not hear Haldane s yarn about your ship five days ago sir before we ever clapped eyes on you said he in a slightly aggrieved tone as if he thought his word was being doubted Why colonel this poor lad was becoming the butt for everybody s chaff on board on account of it Gracious cried the other This is indeed really wonderful Aye colonel and more than that But for the lad seeing this mirage or whatever else it was and telling me about it we would not have gone off our course in search of you to render what assistance we could yours being the ship in distress Haldane reported having sighted to the southward This divergence from our track sir took us into the very teeth of the gale which we encountered later on that same evening and conduced to our breaking down Faith put in Garry O Neil that s thrue for sure sor This breakdown of ours colonel led to our drifting to the southward into the trail of the Gulf Stream continued the skipper following up the strange sequence of events as they occurred one by one Your ship the real ship I mean was drifting north and east meanwhile carried along by the same current and then it came about that although apparently going in opposite directions and acted on by different causes our tracks crossed each other on the chart last night at least that is my opinion I see I see cried Colonel Vereker quickly interrupting him and in a state of great excitement Thank God But for that you would never have sighted our drifting boat and picked up myself and poor Captain Alphonse Thank God Senor Haldane saw us in that mysterious way It seems to have been an interposition of heaven to warn you of our peril and bring you to our aid Just so colonel that s what I think myself now said the skipper impressively taking off his cap and looking upward with a grave reflective air Aye and I thank God too for putting us in the way of helping you with all my heart sir Ah observed old mister Stokes who had remained silent the while The ways of Providence are as wonderful as they are mysterious There was a pause after this in our conversation which no one seemed anxious to break till Garry O Neil spoke Faith sor you haven t tould us yit how ye come by this wound in your leg an about that poor chap in yander he said to the colonel nodding his head in the direction of Captain Applegarth s inner state cabin where the French captain was lying in his cot Sure we re dyin to hear the end of your scrimmage with those black divvles Colonel Vereker heaved a sigh Well I ought not to doubt that the good God is watching over my little darling daughter after what I have just learnt my friends said he in a more hopeful tone than his depressed manner indicated looking round at us with his large melancholy dark eyes I ought not to despair Certainly not sir I dare say we ll soon overhaul the ship now for we re more than an hour and a half in chase of her at full speed remarked the skipper recovering himself from his fit of abstraction and looking at his watch to see the time Go on colonel go on please and tell us the end of your story There is little more for you to hear sir replied the other settling himself back in his seat again after mister O Neil had once more dressed the wound in his leg Before it was dark that terrible night I sent Elsie below while Captain Alphonse with myself stayed up on the poop for the first watch each of us with a loaded revolver besides having a box of cartridges handy on the skylight near by should we want to replenish our ammunition But the Haytians sir had evidently had enough of us for that evening making no further attempts to attack us as the hours wore on They were as watchful as ourselves though for as Cato anon trying to creep forwards so as to release the French sailors confined under the main hatchway had a narrow escape of his life a heavy spar being suddenly let down by the run almost on top of his head when he ventured out on the exposed deck This was at midnight when the second mate Basseterre and Don Miguel with the French sailor Duval relieved Captain Alphonse and me taking the middle watch Next morning however soon after Captain Alphonse and I with the little Englishman had resumed charge of the poop and the others were resting alas my friends without my knowledge or sanction poor Cato made another attempt to reach the hatchway which unfortunately resulted in his death Hearing Ivan growl and my little daughter cry out as if something had frightened her I had gone down to the cabin shortly after daylight to see what was the matter cautioning Captain Alphonse who hardly needed my caution not to leave his post for a moment and not thinking of Cato who had disappeared from the top of the companion way and had gone below to Elsie heard her cry I thought and gone to her even before myself He was not in the cabin however nor did I find anything much the matter with my child who had evidently unconsciously cried out in some dream she had Ivan of course gushing in sympathy and waking her up So telling Elsie to compose herself and go off to sleep again as everything was going on all right and there was nothing to be alarmed about beyond the snoring of Monsieur and Madame Boisson at the further end of the cabin I feeling greatly relieved returned on deck I looked round for Cato at once naturally for our forces were not so strong that one would not be missed especially such a one as he But my faithful negro was nowhere in sight Captain Alphonse said too he had not seen him during my absence below nor indeed for some time prior to my going down to the cabin I then searched the wheel house aft without discovering him Cato I called out where are you Come here immediately My poor servant did not answer but that black fiend the pseudo marquis advanced from the forepart of the deck sheltering himself you may be sure from my aim in the rear of the windlass bitts which were in a line between us You will have to call louder he cried with a mocking laugh like that of a hyena and full of devilish glee I assure you much louder my friend before that spy slave of yours will ever be able to answer you again Heavens I feared the worst then Poor Cato They had caught him reconnoitring What have you done with him you son of Satan I yelled out full of rage and anger and with a terrible foreboding If you have hurt a hair of his head I will make you pay dearly for it I can tell you you fiend The malicious murdering wretch only replied to my threat with another mocking laugh which his companions echoed as if enjoying a joke while I noticed them dragging at a shapeless mass from the forecastle forwards Kick the carrion aft I heard the inhuman brute say to his followers Let the white trash see the dog s carcass He will then believe what I have said Name of God and know what is in store for himself My God Senor Applegarth and you gentlemen I can hardly tell you what followed It is all too horrible The sight of what I saw will haunt me to my grave For the shapeless mass I had observed slowly raised itself up from the deck and I saw that it was my poor Cato The savages had hacked the unfortunate man to pieces with their knives He recognised me poor creature and appeared to try to speak but only made an inarticulate noise between a sob and a groan that rings in my ears now while the blood gushed from his mouth as he fell forwards facing me dead huddled up in a heap again upon the deck Those devils incarnate besides mutilating his limbs had would you believe it cut out his tongue as they had before threatened for warning us of their treachery God in heaven exclaimed Captain Applegarth stopping in his quick walk up and down the saloon and bringing his fist down on the table with a bang that made the glasses in the swinging tray above jump and rattle two of them indeed falling over and smashing into fragments on the floor The infernal demons Can such things be It is dreadful All of us were equally horror stricken and indignant at the colonel s terrible recital even old mister Stokes waking up and stretching out his hand to the skipper as if pledging himself to what he wished to urge before he spoke Horrible horrible sir he panted out his anger taking away his breath and affecting his voice But we ll avenge the poor fellow and kill the rascals when we come up with them won t we sir There s my hand on it anyway I did not and could not say anything no I couldn t but you can pretty well imagine the oath I mentally registered Not so Garry O Neil though The Irishman s face flamed with rage and anger Kill them sor cried he springing to his feet from the chair in which he had been seated alongside the colonel whose injured limb he had been carefully attending to again all the while his reddish beard and moustache bristling and his steel blue eyes flashing out veritable sparks it seemed of fire Faith killin s too good for em sure the haythen miscreants I d boil em alive sor or roast em in the stoke hold begorrah if I had me own way with em I would sor so hilp me Moses if all the howly saints whose names be praised an the blessed ould Pope too prayed me to spare em Och the murtherin bastes the daymans the divvles He was almost beside himself in his rage and passionate invective So much so indeed that mister Stokes despite his own hearty sympathy with the like cause looked at the infuriated Irishman in great trepidation for his face was flushed and his hair seemed actually to stand on end while his words tumbled out of his mouth pell mell jostling each other in their eagerness to find utterance The chief really fancied I believe that he had suddenly gone mad as he literally fumed with fury After a few moments however Garry cooled down a bit restraining himself by a violent effort and he turned to his whilom patient with an apologetic air Faith sor I fancied I had that divvle your fri nd the markiss sure be the throat said he with a feeble attempt at a grin and biting his lips to keep in his feelings while he dropped his arms which he had been whirling round his head like a maniac only just before By the powers wouldn t I throttle the baste swately if I had hould of him once in these two hands of mine Colonel Vereker stretched out both his impulsively and gripped those of Garry O Neil Heavens he cried with tears in his eyes You are a white man sir I can t say more than that and I am proud to know you Och niver moind that colonel said the Irishman putting aside the compliment the highest the colonel thought he could give Till us what you did sure afther the poor maimed crayture was murthered by that Haytian divvle Faith I loathe the baste I hate him like pizen though I haven t sane him yit more s the pity but it ll be a bad job for him when I do clap my peepers on him I could not do much said the other proceeding with his account of the struggle with the mutineers on board the Saint Pierre but Captain Alphonse and myself emptied our revolvers at the scoundrels and floored three of them before they retreated back into the forecastle but the marquis the greatest scoundrel of the whole lot escaped scot free though I fired four shots at him point blank as he dodged behind the mainmast and windlass bits keeping well under cover and mocking my efforts to get a straight aim The villain I think bears a charmed life Niver you fear sor put in Garry in answer to this remark His father ould Nick is keepin him for somethin warm whin I git hould of him Faith sor you can bet your boots on that sure Colonel Vereker smiled sadly at the impulsive Irishman s remark He could see that he had moved every fibre of his feeling heart and warm nature and that he was following every incident of his terrible story of atrocities and sufferings with an all engrossing interest I rushed to the poop ladder to make for the mocking brute intending to grip him by the neck as you have suggested sir said he when by heavens I would have choked the life out of his vile carcass But Captain Alphonse prevented me My God dear friend he cried catching hold of me round the body in his powerful arms so that I could not move a step Remember the little one your little daughter who would have no one to protect her should these rabble kill you Besides my friend the good Cato is dead now and the useless sacrifice of your life of both our lives probably if you go forwards and perhaps too the life of the little one who cannot even help herself will never bring back the breath to the brave lad s body No no colonel I promise you said he at the same time kissing the tips of his fingers and elevating his shoulders in his French fashion We will do something better than that Only wait be patient We will avenge him you will see but I pray you do nothing rash for the sake of the little one CHAPTER TWENTY TWO ALL ADRIFT Aye colonel sang out the skipper as if in response to these words of the French captain to avenge him that s what all of us here have sworn to do I know for I can answer for them as if I were speaking for myself Yes and so we will too We ll avenge him the poor fellow whom they butchered We will by George Begorrah exclaimed Garry O Neil You can count on me for one on that job as I tould ye before and I don t care how soon we begin it cap en And me too put in old mister Stokes again becoming very enthusiastic The whole lot must be punished sir when we catch them I thought so said the skipper looking round at us and then turning to the colonel with a proud air You see sir we re all unanimous for I can answer for this lad Haldane here though the poor chap s too bashful to speak for himself I know what the gallant youth can do already said the other looking at me kindly as I held up my head like the rest but with a very red face Thank you gentlemen all for your promises Well then on my friend Captain Alphonse putting the matter in the way he did to make an end of my story I held back and all that day it was last Saturday we remained on the defensive we five holding the after part of the ship and the Haytians and mutineers of our crew the forecastle All of us though kept on the watch they looking out for land we for help in response to our signal flag half mast high But neither party saw what they looked out and longed for no corner of land on the horizon gratified the desire of their eyes no ship hove in sight to bless ours with the promise of relief The next morning Sunday it came on to blow and our vessel was taken aback and nearly foundered Fortunately though the mutineers not interfering most of them being seasick forwards Captain Alphonse and Basseterre started down into the waist to cast off all the sheets and halliards they could reach letting everything fly whereupon we drove before the wind and so escaped any mishap from this source at all events Probably on account of their prostration from the effects of sea sickness our enemies did not molest us in any way throughout the day but towards the morning my little Elsie came up the companion way in a state of great terror saying she heard a sort of scratching in the hold below and that Ivan her dog was growling as if he smelt somebody trying to get in though we could not hear the dog on deck from the noise of the wind and sea and a lot of loose ropes and swinging spars which were making a terrible row aloft I went down at once with her and without even taking the trouble to listen I could clearly distinguish the sound of tapping beneath the cabin deck despite the confused jabbering of Monsieur Boisson and the shrill tones of his wife I knelt down then and put my ear to the planking Monsieur Boisson watching me with his bottle brush sort of hair standing straight up on end with fright and Madame who I thought had more courage than he though such evidently I now saw was not the case well she was rolling on one of the saloon settees in a fit of hysterics screaming and yelling at the top of her voice Who s there I called out in French Are you one of those Haytians or a friend and one of us Answer I will know who it is when you speak I am a friend came back instantly in Spanish Let me out sir I am nearly stifled down here The three of us who were locked in the main hatch have worked through the cargo and broken the after bulkhead making our way here but we can t get out of this for the trap is fastened down sir It was Pedro Gomez the steward who had gone down into the hold with two of the white sailors just before the outbreak of the mutiny to obtain some salt pork and other food for the use of the very scoundrels who had imprisoned them and who probably believed they had all three died by this time like poor Cato only through suffocation instead of being murdered as he was Needless to say I immediately drew back the bolts of the hatchway cover leading down into the after hold which was just under the flooring of little Elsie s cabin and released the three overjoyed not only at finding alive those whom we had thought dead but doubly so at having such a welcome addition to our small force of five I couldn t rely upon that coward Boisson opposed as we were to the thirty whom the enemy still mustered after deducting those we shot Why with this adventitious aid we could now attack the cursed wretches in their stronghold instead of our merely remaining on the defensive waiting for them to assail us as we had been forced to do all along I thought it best however not to let the Haytian scoundrels know of this increase to our strength until the morrow believing that if we waited till daylight we might be able to take them more completely then by surprise and ensure a victory for in the dark we might get mixed up and firing at random hit our friends as well as our foes So I went up above and spoke to Captain Alphonse who agreed with me about it and we planned a pleasant little fete for the morning This broke auspiciously enough the sun rising on a tolerably calm sea while the strong wind of the previous evening had graduated down to a gentle breeze from the south west But hardly had we made all our arrangements as to the distribution of arms and settling our form of attack when our plans were upset by the villainous marquis advancing aft with a pistol in his hand supported by another of the scoundrels a negro like himself from Port au Prince and black as a coal but a regular giant in size and who likewise held a revolver Heavens They had previously been without firearms wherein lay our superiority in spite of numbers but these weapons now put us almost on level terms notwithstanding the reinforcement we had received Where could they have got em sir said little mister Johnson to me he and Captain Alphonse and myself being in counsel together at the time it being the watch below of Don Miguel and Basseterre and the sailor Duval all three of whom were asleep in the wheel house recruiting for their night duty They didn t have no firearms yesterday colonel I ll swear Do you think they ve murdered the mate and bo sun forrads and robbed em As a similar idea flashed through my mind that devil the marquis answered the little Englishman s question as I too had feared Oh my friend he called out as I covered him with my revolver from my rampart behind the poop rail on the top of the ladder where a roll of tarpaulin served us for shelter Don t be too handy with your pistol We have got firearms too now Stop a minute I have got something to say to you You had better make haste with your speech then said I My finger is itching to pull the trigger and you know to your cost I m a dead shot You will not do much good by killing me he retorted with that mocking hyena laugh of his which always exasperated me so much I want to tell you that we know you have got three more men with you now than you had yesterday for we searched the hold this morning and found the nest empty and the birds flown But recollect my friend we can get to you aft through the cargo in the same way as those white livered wretches have done Bah I m not afraid of your threats you black devil I replied although my heart went down to my boots at the thought of my darling child being caught unawares and being left to the mercy of such demons We have scuttled the after part of the ship and at the least noise being heard in the hold we will let in the water and drown you all like rats in a hole and see how you like that This idea which occurred to me on the spur of the instant evidently impressed the scoundrel for I could see a change come over his ugly face Let us make a compromise he suggested after a pause during which he whispered to his companion the giant negro both keeping much behind the mainmast You can take that boat you have there at the stern the lot of you if you like and leave us the ship My word that s a very good proposal marquis said Captain Alphonse coming to my side You won t interfere with us I suppose if we go away and give you absolute power to do what you please with the Saint Pierre eh Assuredly not my friend we promise that eagerly replied the scoundrel deceived by the manner of my poor friend You can take anything you like of your personal effects too you and the other whites Ah but my friend you are too good said Captain Alphonse firing quickly as he spoke at the marquis who had incautiously exposed himself thinking we had been gulled by his proposal and were ready to fall into the trap he had cunningly prepared for us Take that you pig for my answer His revolver gave out a sharp crack and simultaneously with the report the other s pistol fell from his hand the scoundrel s elbow being shattered by the shot Ere I could send a shot in the same direction to finish him off the big negro who had accompanied him to the front instantly dragged back the marquis howling with rage and pain behind the shelter of the mainmast and then picking up his revolver for him the two of them blazed amongst us pretty securely from that retreat without however doing any damage to our side A bullet of mine though flattened the big negro s nose a little more than Nature had already done for him and which did not improve his beauty as you can well believe We kept on popping away at them whenever we saw we had a shot the whole of this day well that was only yesterday but appears ages ago to me sirs We kept on firing without materially diminishing their strength but they only replied feebly to our fire with an occasional shot fired at intervals making up by their shouting and demoniacal yells for their failure to harm us more effectively From this we became convinced that they were obliged to husband their ammunition having no more cartridges beyond those still remaining in the chambers of the revolvers they were using which had been loaded when served out to Monsieur Henri and the boatswain to whom the weapons originally belonged There was likewise little doubt but that the mutineers had robbed those poor fellows after murdering them like poor Cato in the forecastle as the little Englishman had surmised Towards sunset later on in the afternoon last night that was Senor Applegarth remember we sighted your vessel in the distance Heavens She looked to us in our desperate strait as an angel of mercy might appear to the spirits of the damned in hell and at once the thought of abandoning our accursed ship which that fiend of a black marquis unwillingly suggested rapidly matured itself into a resolve But our intentions in carrying out this determination were very different to his for we believed that with your help we should the sooner be able to overcome the rascally gang and re conquer the vessel we might be compelled ere long to surrender all of us now being pretty well worn out with the struggle This is grand this is magnificent cried Captain Alphonse when I unfolded this scheme to him for sirs I may say with pardonable pride it was my plan entirely It is good tactique to beat the retreat sometimes in war They retreat that they may the more easily advance Don Miguel was also of a like opinion and so was the little Englishman mister Johnson whose snobbishness had by this time been completely put in the shade by his manly pluck and straightforwardness while as for Basseterre the mate and the French sailors they implicitly believed all that Captain Alphonse approved of must infallibly be right Our first idea was to attract your attention without letting the Haytians see what we were up to as to the best of our belief they had no inkling of your proximity so we were puzzling our brains how to let you learn our need in some quiet way when little mister Johnson suggested our burning a devil composed of wet gunpowder piled up in the form of a cone This was accordingly done and the devil when lit placed on the top of the wheel house all the rest of those around discharging their revolvers in rapid succession at the rascals on the forecastle to take off their attention while the firework fizzed and flared up This signal however sirs did not appear to be observed by your vessel It was though interposed the skipper We thought you were burning a blue light to let us read your name astern but you were too far off for that Ah we did not know that and the failure discouraged us replied the colonel Still whether we were observed or not we noticed your steamer was lying to and we made up our minds to try and reach her if possible should we be able to get out of the Saint Pierre before those rascally blacks got wind of our scheme and tried to prevent our leaving So we set about our preparations forthwith The four French sailors were ordered to prepare the boat which hung from the stern davits and to get it ready for lowering it being now dark enough to conceal their movements while Captain Alphonse and Basseterre kept guard over the approach to the poop on our side and Don Miguel and the Englishman defended the other ladder leading up from the lower deck Leaving these at their respective stations I went down into the saloon accompanied by Pedro Gomez the steward to procure some tinned meats and biscuits with some barricoes of water and other things to provision the boat intending also to warn Monsieur and Madame Boisson of our contemplated departure not forgetting also you may be sure to make every arrangement for the safety of my child who with the dog her constant companion had remained below with the ex milliner and her husband though these two had retired to their cabin whence I could not get them to stir either by threat of being left behind or any entreaty No they were both as obstinate as mules in their cowardice and foolish fears Madame declared they had been betrayed and asserted they could die but once while monsieur le brave Hercule on his part said he washed his hands of all responsibility It was not his affair he considered himself perfectly satisfied and gave me to understand he would not interfere on either side except I expect the victorious one Finding all remonstrances in vain I was just going to force them away against their will when suddenly there came a loud shout from the deck above and the hasty tramp of feet overhead which was at once responded to by Madame Boisson with a shriek at the top of her voice while monsieur cursed everybody in a whining voice Telling Elsie to stop where she was until I returned for her I rushed up the companion way followed by Pedro Gomez only to find everything all but lost The French sailors it seems so mister Johnson told me afterwards in a few hurried words of explanation had got into a fog over the falls of the boat they had been sent to lower and seeing the clumsy way they were setting to work at the job both Basseterre and Captain Alphonse thoughtlessly left their post to show the men the proper way to do the task ordered Alas though in a second while the whole lot of them all had their backs turned to the Haytians these demons grasping the opportunity in a moment rushed up on the poop by the port ladder way now unguarded Captain Alphonse hearing the noise of their approach faced about fronting his foes like a tiger at bay and drew his revolver from his belt But sir he was too late Ere he could put up his hand to guard himself for I could see it all in an instant as I emerged from the companion hatchway the giant negro who had abandoned his pistol for a hand spike brought down this fearful weapon with a tremendous thwack on the side of my poor friend s head with the result you have seen Aye faith said Garry O Neil It must have been a terrible blow sure sor It was replied the colonel grimly It knocked him down like a bullock and then before I could interfere the big brute took up Captain Alphonse all bleeding and senseless as he was but still breathing and chucked him into the sea That was the negro s last act however for as he broke into a huge guffaw of triumph over the ghastly deed I fired my revolver the barrel of which I shoved almost into his mouth and blew his brains out Hooray exclaimed the impulsive Garry O Neil on hearing this Faith I ounly wish colonel I had been there with ye Begorrah I d have made em hop at it sure I bet sor After that continued the narrator we had some stiff work for five minutes or so but by keeping the skylight between us the continuous fire of our four revolvers at such short range proved too much for them and we succeeded in driving the blacks off the poop The whole lot of them retreated back to the forecastle leaving five of their number dead about the decks besides half a dozen or so of the others badly wounded all of us fortunately escaping with only a few slight bruises from blows from the Haytian s clubs and hand spikes the only weapons they used All save poor Captain Alphonse that is for it was only when the coast was clear of the scoundrels and the poop safe again that I had time to think of him Pedro Gomez remaining with Basseterre and one of the sailors to guard the port ladder way with their six shooters loaded and levelled in front commanding all approach aft in the same way as the mate and poor Captain Alphonse had done in the first instance I went off with all haste to the stern gallery to see what had become of my unfortunate friend taking the other three sailors with me for though taking part in the general scrimmage when the blacks invaded the poop so unexpectedly Don Miguel and Johnson had stuck valiantly to their post by the starboard rail and so I had no fear of another surprise on now proceeding aft It was still light enough to distinguish objects near and as I looked over the side what was my astonishment to see his body yet afloat not far from the ship Aye sir there he was and stranger still as my eye caught sight of him the poor fellow unconsciously no doubt raised one hand out of the dark water with a quick convulsive action just as though he were beckoning to me and imploring me to save him On noticing this a fact of course which showed plainly enough that he was still alive without thinking of what I was doing I jumped on a projecting bollard and dived from the deck of the ship into the sea I soon rose to the surface when swimming up to the almost lifeless body in a few strokes I caught hold of a portion of the poor fellow s clothing and commenced turning it towards the stern of the vessel just underneath the davits whence the boat we had been preparing for our flight was suspended all ready for lowering and with the French sailors standing by above Look sharp I sang out to them from the water Look sharp there Lower away In their haste and flurry however the men mistook my order and thinking I had said cut away instead of lower away one of the fools who held a cutlass he had caught up to defend himself with when those infernal niggers rushed at us the confounded idiot made a sweeping cut at the falls from which the boat hung severing them at one blow Down came the little craft at once with a splash almost on the top of me and though she managed to ship some water through her sudden immersion she quickly righted herself on an even keel right side up By George I d have keel hauled em wrong side down cried the skipper out of all patience at hearing of this piece of gross stupidity The damned awkward lubbers Yes sir French sailors are not like English ones nor do they resemble our American shellbacks who do know a thing or two replied the colonel Well gentlemen to make an end of my story I may tell you that I had some difficulty in lifting the body of poor Captain Alphonse into the boat when I had clutched hold of the gunwale but after a time I succeeded in getting him into the bows rolling him over the side anyhow Then I tried to get in myself by the stern and had just flung one of my legs over when that villain the black marquis catching sight of me from the forecastle ahead of which the boat somehow or other had drifted by this time fired at me with probably the last cartridge he had left in his pistol and which the devil no doubt had reserved for me Be jabers exclaimed Garry O Neil unable to keep silent any longer The baste An sure that s how you came by that wound in the groin faith Yes sir doctor The shot struck me when I was all of a heap and where it went heaven only knows till you probed the wound and extracted the bullet I must have tumbled into the boat while in a state of insensibility like poor Captain Alphonse for I do not recollect anything that occurred immediately after I felt the sting of the shot as I was hit and when I came to myself again I was horrified to find I was far away from the ship which I could only dimly discern in the distance But this did not daunt me at first for I thought I should be able to row alongside again and get taken aboard through one of the stern ports but will you believe it when I came to search the boat for the oars which Basseterre had expressly told those clumsy sailors in my hearing to be sure to put into the boat the very first thing of all can you credit it lo and behold not a scull nor oar was in her not a stick of any sort or kind whatever The lubbers said Captain Applegarth indignant again as he paced backwards and forwards impatiently casting an occasional hurried glance at the tell tale suspended from the deck above the saloon table the shifting dial of which showed we were now changing course to the westward The damned lubbers the damn The colonel here broke in with This discovery I think broke my heart cried he heaving a heavy sigh It took the last flickering gleam of hope away from me and I sank back again to the bottom of the boat appalled and terrified in my mind by the reflections and thoughts of what might happen to my darling child and those others whom I had left on board the Saint Pierre deprived at one fell blow of both Captain Alphonse and myself When daylight dawned after a night that seemed a century long so full of pain and awful thought it was to me I saw the Saint Pierre low down on the horizon to the westward of where I and my poor friend Captain Alphonse were drifting on the desert sea The sight of the ship again even in the distance and the warmth of the sun s bright beams which made the stagnant blood circulate in my veins once more gave me hope and renewed courage for I recollected and thought that after all there were eight white men still left on board the ill fated vessel to keep possession of her and defend my little one eight good men and true not counting that dastardly coward Boisson who was skulking below But sir the wind and tide wafted the Saint Pierre away beyond my vision and and sirs the the end of it all you all know better than I can tell you Aye put in the skipper we saw your boat adrift at least old Masters did I ll give him the credit for that Then we picked you up and here you are Hardly had the skipper uttered these words completing the colonel s story when mister Fosset suddenly poked his head through the skylight over the after end of the saloon the hatch of which opened out on the deck of the poop above Nor was the first mate merely satisfied with the abrupt intrusion of his figurehead into our midst for he rattled the glass of the skylight in no very gentle fashion at the same time the better I suppose to attract our attention though we were all staring open mouthed at him already all startled by his unexpected appearance on the scene But he rattled the glass all the same as he looked down upon us none the less aye all the more rattled it with a will frightening us all Hi Cap en Cap en Applegarth he sang out at the very top of his voice as excited as you please That ship s in sight the ship s in sight at last sir She s hull down to leeward about seven miles off But we re overhauling her fast now sir hand over hand CHAPTER TWENTY THREE WITHIN HAIL By George is that so ejaculated the skipper starting off with a mad clutch at his cap which he had thrown off on to a locker close by in the heat of his excitement during the colonel s yarn I ll be on the bridge in a jiffey Thank God for that news Hooray shouted Garry O Neil as we all immediately jumped from our seats on hearing this joyful intelligence long though it had been in coming even the poor colonel sliding his bandaged leg off its supporting chair and standing on his feet prepared to follow the skipper on deck without a moment s delay Be the powers I knew we d overhaul them divvles before sundown Faith an I tould ye so colonel I tould ye so you know I did But just then an unexpected interruption arrested us as we all moved towards the companion way to regain the deck above Look here colonel cried a voice from the skipper s state room aft where the commander of the Saint Pierre was supposed to be reposing in an almost insensible condition Get out of here you are not worth being angry with Begorrah it s your poor fri nd in there said Garry O Neil to the colonel What s the poor crayture parleyvooing about instid of slaypin loike a Christian whin he s got the chance Sure I ll have to stop his jaundering there or he ll niver git betther Stay a moment he s beginning again poor fellow remarked the colonel holding up his hand Listen You villains take that called out the Frenchman in a louder key and in a tone of anger as if battling with the blacks on board the Saint Pierre over again and then after a pause we heard a piteous cry My God they are going to shoot me Look Look To the rescue colonel quickly quickly to the rescue Bedad he s in a bad way entoirely said Garry as he and the colonel with myself at their heels entered the after cabin where we saw Captain Alphonse sitting up in the skipper s cot and gesticulating frantically What can he be after sayin now sor He is going over the boat scene on the poop of our unfortunate vessel when the Haytian blacks as I told you made at him and the other sailor before I rushed up from below too late to save him poor fellow explained the colonel He s calling out for help as I suppose he did then though I didn t hear him It sounds moighty queer anyhow continued the Irishman Whisht There he s at it again What does that extraordinary lingo mean now I can t make h id nor tale of it sor Hoist the flag immediately Close furl the main topsail exclaimed the poor wounded man in short jerky sentences as he sat up there in the swinging cot with his hands tearing at the bandage that was bound round his head looking as if he had just risen from the dead and reminding me of a picture I once saw depicting the raising of Lazarus His eyes were rolling too in wild delirium and after gazing at us fixedly for a second or two without a sign of recognition on his pallid face he fell back prostrate again on the mattress crying out in a pitiful wail Alas for the ship Too late too late too late Heavens said the colonel turning to Garry Can t you do anything for him I ll put somethin coolin on the dressin an that ll make the poor chap s h id aisier replied the other suiting the action to the word Ice sure ud be betther but faith there isn t a morsel aboard Whatever he did apply however had a quieting influence and presently after tossing from side to side convulsively Captain Alphonse closed his great staring eyes and began to snore stertorously Heaven be praised cried Colonel Vereker He s sleeping again now Faith an a good job too for him poor crayture said Garry He s in a bad way I till you sor an he d betther die aisy whin he s about it sure than kickin up a row that won t help him What returned the colonel Do you think he s going to die Begorrah all the docthers in the worrld wouldn t save him My poor friend my poor friend cried the colonel I will stay with him then to the end so as to soothe his last moments There was evidently a struggle going on in Colonel Vereker s mind between his desire to do his duty as he thought to the dying man and his natural anxiety to be on deck participating in all the excitement of the chase after the runaway ship and the coming fight with the Haytians when the black rascals would be called to a final account for all the misery and bloodshed they had caused Garry O Neil saw this and pooh poohed the idea of the colonel remaining below Faith there ain t the laste bit of good sor in yer stoppin down here at all at all said he in his brisk energetic way The poor chap won t be afther stirrin ag in for the next two hours or more an if he does bedad he won t ricognise ye or any one ilse for that matther But sir doctor Houly Moses I till you colonel there ain t no use in your stoppin another minnit impatiently cried the good natured Irishman interrupting his half hearted expostulator Jist you clear out of this at once an go on deck an say the foightin with those murtherin bleyguards I ll moind my paychant now till that old thaife Weston s finished all the schraps lift in the plates an bottles from lunch an thin faith he shall take charge of him an I ll come up too to say the foon Now be off wid ye colonel dear you ll say the poor chap ag in afther the rumpus is over Dick Haldane me darlint hind the colonel the loan of yer arrum alannah There now off ye both go Away wid ye So saying he fairly pushed us out of the cabin and the colonel limping by my side and using my shoulder as a crutch as he had previously done we both went up the companion ladder and gained the poop The scene here presented a striking contrast to that we had just left the fresh air bright sun and sparkling sea all speaking of life and movement in exchange for the stuffy atmosphere of the darkened saloon and its association of illness and approaching death A stiff breeze was blowing now from the southward and running as we were to the northward right before it the skipper had ordered all our square sails forward to be set so as to take every advantage of the wind in addition to our steam power the old barquey prancing away full speed ahead with her topsails and fore canvas bellied out to their utmost extent their leech lifting occasionally with a flicker as she outran the breeze and the clew gallant blocks rattling as the sheets slackened and grew taut again while the wind hummed through the canvas aloft like a thousand bees buzzing about the rigging The black smoke too was rushing up the funnel and whirling in the air overhead uncertain which direction to take from the speed of the vessel inclining it to trail away aft while the stiff southerly breeze blew it forwards so we carried it all along with us hung up above our dog vane like an awning as we careered onwards raising a deep furrow of swelling water on either side as we cut through the dancing sunlit waves and leaving a long white wake astern that shone through the blue far away behind in the distance to where sea and sky melted into one far away on the horizon line Old Masters the boatswain was on the poop when the colonel and I came up from below in the very act of hauling in the patent log to ascertain our speed Well said I as he looked at the index of the ungainly thing which is something of a cross between a shark hook and a miniature screw propeller What s she doing bo sun Doing Wot she s a doing on sir he replied repeating my own words and mouthing them over with much gusto Why sir she s going sixteen knots still and the bloomin old grampus has been keeping it up since four bells She carries the wind with her too for jist as we bore up north awhile ago astern the chase I m blessed if the breeze didn t shift round likewise to the south ard keepin astern of us as before Where is the chase I asked not being able to see forwards on account of the swelling foresail and other intervening objects I suppose she s right ahead eh No sir Jist come here alongside o me at the taffrail said he Now foller my finger sir Look there she is two points off our starboard bow She was hull down jist now but we re rising her fast sir See there she be right under the foreyard there I looked in the direction he indicated and could very faintly in the distance see something white like a sail almost out of sight on the ocean ahead But Masters said I having no glass with me to bring her nearer and seeing she was too far off for me to distinguish her with the naked eye are you certain she s the same craft As sartin Master Haldane he answered solemnly aye as sartin as that when we goes aboard her as go aboard her we must we shall both be a goin to our death That s the ghost ship Master Haldane as you and I ve seed three times afore May I die this minute if she ain t Die don t talk such nonsense Masters It ain t no nonsense Master Haldane he retorted and looking the picture of misery and unhappiness That there ship means no good to you nor me nor to none of them as seed her afore I knows It s her sure enuff No mortal ship could sail on like that continually since Friday right afore the wind and still allers be a crossin our hawser though her canvas be tore to ribbings and never a man aboard as we ve seed It ain t nat ral nohow Aye she be the ghost ship and no mistake and God help us all I noticed at the moment a telescope lying on the top of the saloon skylight which mister Fosset must have left behind him in his haste when he came from the bridge to hail the skipper and then hurried back to his post so quickly catching up the glass I scanned the distant sail which grew more perceptible every minute Yes there was no doubt about it She was a full rigged ship running before the wind but going a bit every now and then off her course as if under no proper guidance or management while all her sails were torn and hanging anyhow and her spars and rigging apparently at sixes and sevens as though she had been terribly mauled by the weather For Heaven s sake tell me cried the colonel who had approached me unobserved while I was looking through the telescope Tell me is she there Can you see her Yes sir said I I can see her and it s the same ship I saw the other night It is the Saint Pierre Ha he exclaimed his black eyes flashing into a passion that made him forget his lameness as he strode to the side of the vessel where resting one hand on the rail he shook the other menacingly at the ill fated craft now with her hull well above the horizon Ah you black devils we ll settle you at last Meanwhile the skipper who had gone up to join mister Fosset on the bridge after leaving us below so suddenly was making his way aft again and on the colonel turning round from the rail he found him at his back looking over his shoulder at the ship we were approaching The skipper was all agog with excitement By George he exclaimed We re closing on her fast now colonel How soon Senor Applegarth do you think we ll be before we re alongside her In about half an hour at the outside sir unless something gives way We would have been up to her before if she had been lying to but she s going ahead too like ourselves and not making bad way either considering the state she s in aloft and her yawing this way and that It is wonderful how she keeps on Oh dear oh dear she s possessed as your companion here said just now to the young Senor Haldane Oh you mustn t mind what the bo sun says observed the skipper He s chock full of the old superstitions of the sea and makes mountains out of molehills The deuce he s not far wrong about the Saint Pierre though for if ever a ship had the devil aboard I m sure she has in the shape of that villainous black marquis Then the sooner the better for us to see about Scotching your de il cried the skipper with a laugh that meant business I knew I m now going to call the hands aft and prepare for the fight and they shall have it hot I can tell you said he Have you got arms enough for them sir Those rascals will make a stubborn resistance and there s a big lot of them still left in the ship remember The skipper laughed outright at this Lord bless you colonel said he the steamers of our line are fitted out in their way very like men of war and I have enough rifles and cutlasses in the arm chest below to rig out more than twice the number of the crew we carry besides revolvers for all the officers This however will be short and sharp work as we re going to run your black devils by the beard so I shall only serve out cutlasses But you ll spare me a revolver Senor Applegarth I left mine as you are aware behind me said he with a smile and I should like to have another shot or two at my friend the marquis Aye aye colonel you shall have one and a good one too and so shall all those who know how to use a pistol properly but for close hand to hand fighting I prefer cold steel myself Colonel Vereker joined in the skipper s grim chuckle which suited his mood well Yes sir that s true he rejoined but a revolver isn t to be sneezed at all the same No colonel your leg ll bear witness to that said the skipper as he turned to me Run down quickly Haldane to the arm chest in my state room here are the keys and pick out a dozen or so cutlasses and boarding pikes with a revolver apiece for all on the quarter deck and half a dozen rounds of ammunition You can get Weston to help you to bring the lot up here Look smart I want to serve them out at once as we re now coming up with the chase and there s no time to lose Down I scuttled into the saloon with the skipper s bunch of keys and calling the steward to help me went into the after cabin where Garry O Neil still remained wetting the bandage round the head of the French captain and doing it too with greater delicacy of touch than the most experienced and flippant of hospital nurses Garry was delighted when I told him what I came about Houly Moses he ejaculated why that s the virry job for me sure Here Weston you ugly thaife of a son of a gun come here There s going to be some rare foightin on deck prisintly an as I know ye don t loike to be afther spoilin that beautiful mug o yours you jist sit down there alannah an moind this poor chap here till I come below ag in whilst I help Musther Haldane too with thim murtherin arms that give one a could chill faith to look at bad cess to em He gave me a sly wink as he said this which was unperceived by Weston who accepted the proposed change of duty with an alacrity that showed he had no stomach for warfare procedure and Garry and I very speedily took up a bundle of weapons each on to the poop laying them down close beside the skipper who stood against the rail Ah doctor said the colonel who was sitting down near by on the skylight hatchway resting himself before the battle should begin on seeing Garry come up the companion how s my poor friend now Faith he s still unconshus replied he handing him a big revolver with a cartridge belt attached ah sure I spect he ll remain so too colonel till you ve had toime to polish off the rest of thim schoindrels we re afther Indade it s going off loike that the poor crayture will be I m afeard whin it comes to the ind I don t think he ll ayther spake or move ag in in this loife But Garry was mistaken in this diagnosis of his as events turned out but ere he could say another word just then as the colonel was going to make a reply to him the skipper hammered on the deck with a marling spike to attract attention and give a hail at the very top of his voice that made us all jump it was so loud and unexpected Ahoy there forrad he shouted in stentorian tones that rang fore and aft like a trumpet Bo sun send the hands aft Say cap en sang out mister Fosset from the bridge shall I call up the fellows down below in the stoke hold sir Aye Ring the engine room gong I want every man jack on deck that mister Stokes can spare tell him so While old Masters was sounding his boatswain s pipe and while busy feet were tramping aft the men were beginning to cluster in the waist immediately below the back of the poop And here Captain Applegarth stood stern and erect like an old lion his cap off and his wavy grey hair fluffed out over his head by the wind While this was happening we could hear the distant sound of the engine room bell and then there came a hail from mister Fosset mister Stokes is sending up every one from below sir yelled out the first mate He says he can manage by himself now that we re nearly up to the chase with the help of a couple of the other firemen and the engineers and stokers the whole lot of them in a batch have volunteered to come on deck and join the boarding party That s your sort my hearty cried the skipper enthusiastically looking down at the sea of excited faces below gazing up expectantly at his awaiting the stirring words they knew to be coming all having got wind of the approaching fray Now men I have summoned the lot of you aft because well because I ve got something to say to you Bully for you old man exclaimed one of the men amidst a grand roar while I could distinguish distinctly above the other voices of the crew Accra Prout the mulatto cook s laugh as he called out approvingly Golly dat so sonny Heavens ejaculated Colonel Vereker seemingly like myself to recognise the voice at once who s that said he sharply Accra Prout who stood a head taller than any other of the men clustered round him caught sight of the colonel as the latter cast his eyes downwards rising from his seat and coming to the side of the skipper and the mulatto s eyes grew as large as saucers while his eyeballs rolled in delight and his wide mouth extended itself from ear to ear Bress de Lor he cried out with all a darkey s emphatic enthusiasm breaking into a huge guffaw that was almost hysterical bress de Lor it s de massa it s Mass Vereker from de plantation for surh Yes it s me myself sure enough Prout and I m right glad to see you said the colonel equally delighted There Senor Applegarth didn t I tell you any of my old Louisianian hands would like to see me again in spite of what I said about those infernal niggers who seized our ship Aye you did colonel you did replied the skipper waving his hand in the air but never mind that now I m going to speak to the crew Now me bhoys altogether cried Garry O Neil looking over the top of the booby hatch over the companion way three cheers for the cap en horray Horray roared the lot below with a kindred enthusiasm Horray Horray We re almost within hail now of the chase sir sang out mister Fosset from the bridge when the echo of the last deafening cheer had died away I m going to slow down so that we can sheer up alongside That s just what I was waiting for said the skipper in answer to this Now men you see that ship ahead of us Aye called out the foremost hand who had before spoken the usual leader and the wit of the fo c s le the ghost ship cap en Well ghost ship devil ship or whatever she may be my lads we re going to board her and rescue a young lady a child in age the daughter of my friend Colonel Vereker here and a lot of white men like yourselves who are now at the mercy of a gang of black demons who have murdered the rest of the passengers and crew and taken possession of the vessel Are you going to stand by me lads His answer was another deafening cheer heartier and louder even than the first Ah I thought I could reckon on your help cried the skipper in a tone of proud satisfaction glancing round at the colonel I have got your tools handy for you too my lads and if you will come up to the poop in single file by the port ladder going down again by the starboard gangway each shall be supplied in turn mister O Neil please serve out the cutlasses and boarding pikes Now my men way aloft there Single file and no crushing mind and we ll get the job done all the quicker Ere he had finished speaking the arming of the men had already begun and within a very few minutes the cutlasses and long boarding pikes had all been distributed every man having some weapon Now bo sun pipe the men to their stations sang out the skipper who appeared to have already matured his plan of action Starboard watch forrad port watch aft and all the stokers and firemen amidships under the bridge Have a couple of hands too in the forechains with a hawser and grapnel ready to make fast to the ship when we come alongside her Aye aye sir hailed back Masters Starboard watch ahoy Away forrads with you along o me Our engines had already slackened speed and the helm being put down we came up to the wind to leeward of the ship and not a half cable s length away from her broadside on Stand by there forrad shouted the skipper Ship ahoy there Surrender or we ll run you aboard A wild savage yell came back in reply from a number of half naked negroes who were mustered on the after part of the vessel as well as on the forecastle not a single white man being visible while her Tricolour flag so conspicuous before and which I fancied having seen but half an hour or so previously when looking at her through the telescope was now no longer to be seen Could our worst fears have been realised Another savage yell almost confirmed the thought Heavens exclaimed Colonel Vereker rendered almost frantic with grief and excitement and noticing the appalling evidences of the Haytians triumph while we stared aghast at each other My poor darling child and those brave fellows I left behind where are they all where are they For God s sake find them Alas alas those black devils have murdered them all CHAPTER TWENTY FOUR A FREE FIGHT But hardly had the colonel given vent to his despairing exclamation expressive alike of his own dismay and ours also when the bitter feeling of disappointment at being too late that had for the moment weighed down upon us crushing our enthusiasm was suddenly banished and the hearts of all filled with renewed hope and fierce determination We were not too late after all No For as we gazed in blank surprise at the howling mob of Haytians who appeared to have gained complete possession of the Saint Pierre and were dancing about and gesticulating in their wild devilish fashion calling out to us with wild derisive cries as if mocking at our efforts to save those whom they had already butchered a bright flame of fire flashed out from the skylight hatch of the doomed ship followed by the sharp crack of a revolver and at the same instant one of the half naked devils massed on the poop leaped into the air and then fell on his face flat on the deck uttering a yell of agony as he writhed his limbs in the throes of death An exulting cheer broke from all of us in the Star of the North on seeing this every man gripping his weapon tightly and setting his teeth hard ready for action as the two vessels sidled up nearer and nearer Then if word were wanted to spur us on the skipper gave that word with a vengeance By George my lads we re in time yet to save the child and our other white comrades he cried out loudly at the same time jumping into the mizzen rigging where he hung on the shrouds with one hand while in the other he held a cutlass which he had hastily clutched up whirling it round his lionlike old grey head See men they ve retreated to the cabin below where they re fighting for their lives to the last Tumble up my lads and save them like the British sailors that you are Boarders away As he said this mister Fosset who was still on the bridge conning the old barquey having at once ported our helm on the skipper holding up his cutlass taking this for a signal we came broadside on slap against the hull of the other ship with a jolt that shook her down to her very kelson rolling a lot of the darkies who were grouped aft off their legs like so many ninepins At the same moment before the two craft had time to glide apart both having way upon them old Masters forward and Parrell the quartermaster who was stationed in the waist of our vessel just under the break of the poop hooked on grapnels with hawsers attached to the weather rigging of the Saint Pierre and ere the skipper s rallying cry and our answering cheer had died away drowned by the voice of our escaping steam rushing up the funnels on the engines coming to a stop now that their duty for the nonce was done there we were moored hard and fast together alongside the whilom dreaded ghost ship Then with another wild hurrah that made the ringbolts in the deck jingle and swamped the sound of the rushing steam and everything the men closing up behind the skipper who led us so gallantly over the side far in advance brave hearted old sea dog that he was bounded across the intervening bulwarks and were the next instant engaged in all the maddening excitement of a hand to hand tussle with the black villains pistol shot sword cut and pike thrust coming in turn into play amid a babel of hoarse shouts of rage and cheers and savage yells mingled with the swish of blows from capstan bars the loud reports of revolvers fired off at close range and the heavy thud of falling bodies as they tumbled headlong on the deck ever and anon accompanied by some cry of agony or groan of pain too deep for utterance Aye it was a discord of devilry that must have appeared a veritable pandemonium to the spirits of the air were any such looking down on the wrathful sanguinary scene from the clear blue heavens above all radiant now with a golden glow that came from the west where the declining sun was just beginning to sink below the horizon Fuaghaballah may the divvle take the hindmost cried Garry O Neil leaping after the skipper on to the poop of the Saint Pierre a revolver in his right fist and a cutlass in his left laying about him with a will amongst the mass of infuriated negroes who tried to resist his rush clutching at his legs and arms in vain for he seemed bewitched Come on wid ye me darlints an let us make mincemate of em faith I followed in his wake but a crowd of our men some of whom had served in the navy and were accustomed to the work pushed me on one side going into the thick of the fight themselves and all was such a jumble of confusion that I hardly knew where I was until a pretty tidy tap on the top of my head as Garry would have said brought back my recollection in a very effective manner when I found myself right in front of an extremely ugly looking negro whose appearance was not improved by a slice having been taken off the side of his face and from which blood was streaming down all over his black body and that destitute of clothing I noticed that this gentleman had a long piece of wood like a boat stretcher in his hands with which he had evidently given me the gentle reminder I have mentioned being brought to this conclusion by the fact that the rascal had it raised ready to deal another blow Putting up my arm instinctively to ward off the impending stroke that I saw coming I cocked and levelled my revolver at him in an instant Before I could fire however some one behind me shoved me aside again and crash came a heavy capstan bar down upon the negro s skull which I heard crack like a walnut shell as he dropped dead on his face Golly Mass Hald n exclaimed Accra Prout our stalwart mulatto cook whose sinuous arm had thus incontinently settled the dispute between my sable opponent and myself I se guess dis chile gib dat black debble goss noh ow But ere I could say a word to him for his timely aid Accra Prout had bounded onward in front and I then saw he was following Colonel Vereker who had managed somehow or other in spite of his lameness to gain the deck of his old ship along with the rest of us Crack crack crack went his revolver with venomous iteration from the other side of the vessel where he was standing by the bulwarks close to the hatchway of the companion ladder leading to the cabin below which he was apparently endeavouring to reach while a crowd of Haytians barred his further progress towards those imprisoned in the cabin whom they thus prevented his releasing a fresh foe starting up for every one he disposed of and a rough and terrible fight going on all round him all the time Top a minnit Mass V reker shouted Accra Prout darting into the middle of the throng clearing a pathway for himself with the capstan bar I se here I se come help you soon A thousand devils hissed a tall black near by a man with a large crinkly ink black moustache and certainly with the most satanic visage I had ever beheld before A thousand devils repeated he giving him a thrust with a large knife that pierced poor Accra s arm and making him drop the capstan bar Take care of yourself beast A cry from the colonel told me who this was Ah villain villain he sang out looking him full in the face and grinding his teeth and trying with all his might but vainly to get at him through the press of struggling figures by whom he was surrounded I ve been looking for you Marquis des Coupgorges The black scoundrel gave out a shrill laugh like that of a hyena as Colonel Vereker had described it to us when telling his yarn Pardon me sir I am here he yelled out mockingly I am here I do not run away like your white trash Why don t you come and fight me Bah I spit on you my fine plantation colonel When I get at you I will serve you just as I did your sly slave the other day whom you sent to betray us though you yourself were too great a coward to come amongst us yes to come amongst us yourself Aha colonel He said this in plain English which language he spoke as fluently as he did French the native language of Hayti uttering his abusive threats loud enough for us to hear every syllable but though I aimed at him while he was speaking twice point blank and my revolver spoke out quite as loudly as he while the colonel likewise shot at him and the skipper made a slash in his direction with his cutlass the miscreant escaped all our attacks without a single wound dodging away from us amongst his dusky compatriots who were now pretty thickly mixed up with our men in a fierce melee at the further end of the poop overlooking the waist below In the midst of this awful scrimmage there came a wild rush aft of all the remaining blacks who had been engaged with some of the hands amidships pursued by our second boarding party led by mister Fosset and Stoddart who had made their way over the bows and cleared the fo c s le fighting onward step by step along the upper deck and hemmed in fast thus between two fires the black desperadoes made a last stand refusing to surrender or throw down their arms in spite of all promises of quarter on our part All of them could see for themselves how completely overmatched they were and must have known the utter uselessness of attempting any further resistance to us but the mutineers of the negro portion of the Saint Pierre s crew who were now in the majority feared to give in owing to the fact of their believing they would be ultimately hanged if taken alive after the atrocities they had committed so being of the opinion they were bound to be killed in any case they determined apparently if die they must they would die fighting Whatever might be their motive or conviction I will give them the credit of being plucky and must say that they fought bravely though with a ferocity that was more than savage to the bitter end their last rally on the break of the poop being the fiercest episode of the fray several hand to hand combats going on at one and the same time with hand pikes and capstan bars whirling about over the heads of those engaged where cutlass cuts were met with knife thrusts from the formidable long bladed weapons the negroes carried in their hands only to sheathe them in the bodies of their white antagonists My brain got dizzy as I watched the mad turmoil and my blood was at fever heat taking part in the fight too you may be sure whenever I saw an opening and dealing a blow here or parrying one there as chance arose with the best of them young though I was and totally inexperienced in such matters It was coming near to the finish being too warm work to continue much longer and I think all of us had had pretty well enough of it when looking round for Colonel Vereker whom I suddenly missed from among the combatants I saw him struggling with one of the blacks in a regular rough and tumble tussle on the deck The two were rolling about close to the after skylight from whence we had observed the flash of the pistol shot as we approached the ship and which the colonel had been trying to get near to ever since he boarded her but had been prevented from reaching by one obstacle or another until now when this negro clutched hold of him and forced him back again He and the Haytian were tightly locked in a deadly embrace the negro gripping him with both arms round the body and the colonel endeavouring to release his revolver hand the two rolling over and over on the deck towards the rail forward Ha muttered the colonel who was hard pressed through his set teeth Only let me get free Strangely enough the glass of the skylight above the spot where the pair were struggling was instantly shattered from within as if in response to his muttered cry and with a loud bark that could have been heard a mile off a big dog burst forth from the opening making straight for the colonel and his relentless foe Then there came a startled yell from the negro who releasing his late antagonist staggered to his feet Holy name of he screamed out in wild affright but he had not time to reach the concluding word of his sentence the name of his patron saint no doubt the devil For before he could get so far giving a fierce growl the dog at once sprang up at him his fangs meeting in the Haytian s throat whereupon the latter toppling backwards over the poop rail fell into the waist below with the dog hanging on to him and I noticed presently that both were dead the brave animal who had come so opportunely to the rescue of the colonel his master being stabbed to the heart by a knife which the negro still held in his lifeless hand while his own neck had been torn to pieces by the dog whom death could not force to relinquish his grip Immediately running up to the colonel who was feebly trying to rise his wrestle with the black having crippled his wounded leg and arm I helped him to his feet as quickly as I could while others clustered round to shelter us Poor Ivan true as steel in death as in life he faintly muttered glancing from the break of the poop on the two bodies huddled together below the blood of the faithful dog flowing with that of his ruthless foe into a crimson pool that was gradually extending its borders from the middle of the deck to the lee scuppers He has defended my little Elsie I am sure to the last likewise even as he defended me I hope and trust my child is still safe in the cabin Help me aft my lad to see quick quick Of course I assisted him as well as I could under the circumstances but as he limped along towards the companion hatchway the leader of the desperadoes that villainous marquis who I thought had met with his just deserts long since not having seen him for some little time among the other fighters most unexpectedly jumped from the rigging in front of the colonel and aimed a vindictive blow at him with a marline spike This must have settled the colonel if it had fallen on his uncovered head Fortunately though dropping quickly the colonel s arm I fended off the blow with the revolver I held in my hand while at the same time I gave the scoundrel a drive in the face that must have astonished his black lordship a good deal for my clenched fist met him square on the mouth and shook his teeth making them rattle as well as disarranging the twist of his crinkly moustache He came at me with a snarl like an angry tiger and then hugging me tight with his hideous black face thrust close against mine and his muscular arms pressed tightly around my ribs he squeezed every ounce of breath out of my body I thought my last hour had come But help came to my aid from a most unlooked for quarter Ah you blackguard cried a voice that sounded dimly in my ears my head at the time seeming to be whirling round like the arms of a windmill from the sense of suffocation and the rush of blood to the brain Coward miscreant you are here again Breathless though I was I was so surprised and indeed frightened at the voice and accent of the speaker which I immediately recognised that I at once came to myself and opened wide my half closed eyes Good heavens Shall I ever forget the sight Yes it was Captain Alphonse whom I had last seen only half an hour or so previously in the skipper s cot on board the Star of the North when Garry O Neil said he would probably never wake to consciousness again in this life or move out of the skipper s state room Here he was though all the same looking like an apparition from the dead wild ghastly awful but quite sufficiently in his senses to recognise his terrible enemy the pseudo marquis It is a scene I shall never forget as I remarked before Like poor Ivan and with equal ferocity the Frenchman sprang at the ugly villain s throat the whole lot of us tumbling headlong on the deck together which caused the wretch to release me in order to protect himself from Captain Alphonse who kneeling on the top of him hammered him against the bulwarks as though trying to beat the life out of him Making a last desperate effort the Haytian marquis gripped his antagonist round the waist as he previously gripped me dragging him down beside him again and then as the two came with all their might against the side of the ship where the port flap was loose the whole of the planking gave way and poor Captain Alphonse with that scoundrel the black marquis crashed through the splintering wood together falling with a heavy splash overboard into the sea beneath going to the bottom locked in each other s arms a terrible ending to the terrible episode of this their last meeting For the minute the colonel seemed overwhelmed with grief at this awful and sudden termination of poor Captain Alphonse s life and we would all sooner have seen him die unconsciously if not quietly in his bed but such are the ways of Providence and we cannot control them But this day certainly witnessed a series of surprises so it seemed to me the most wonderful things happening every moment Colonel Vereker had dragged himself as well as he could up to where I lay on the deck after being set free from the bearlike hug of the negro helping me up on my legs in the same Good Samaritan way in the which I had saved him shortly before and we were both looking over the side talking excitedly of the dreadful catastrophe that had just happened and wondering whether the poor captain s body would rise to the surface again when all of a sudden something bright crossing the deck caught my eye like a flash of light and I heard the sound of light and hurried footsteps Wheeling round hastily I was amazed at the beautiful object that met my gaze for I saw standing there only a pace or two off a lovely young girl with a profusion of long silky hair of a bright golden hue that streamed in a tangled mass over her shoulders and reaching down almost to her feet My father my dear father she exclaimed in broken and ecstatic tones her voice sounding to me like the soft cooing of a dove as she flew and nestled herself into the outstretched arms of the colonel who had also turned round at her approach some sympathetic feeling having warned him of her coming telling him who it was even before he saw her Oh my father my father At last at last And then unable to control herself longer she burst into a passion of tears and sobs Colonel Vereker on his part was equally overcome God be thanked cried he raising his face to heaven clasping her at the same time fondly to his heart and kissing her trembling lips again and again My darling one my own little daughter whom I thought I had lost for ever but whom the good God has preserved to be the delight of my eyes again my little one my precious For a few minutes I too had a lump in my throat but turned aside and then not wishing to appear to be observing them I left them alone and went off to another part of the ship CHAPTER TWENTY FIVE HORS DE COMBAT A grand hurrah just then burst forth from the deck below us where the skipper and most of the men were massed telling as plainly as triumphant cheer could tell that the fight was ended and that victory had crowned our arms with success I rushed back to tell the colonel On hearing my footsteps however little Elsie turned round and caught sight of me Oh my father said she untwining herself from the colonel s embrace though she still nestled up close to him as she stared at me shyly with a puzzled look on her mignonne face Why who is this young sir my father I seem to know him and yet I do not remember having ever seen him before Look at him again darling one said her father petting her caressingly while another hearty cheer went up from the hands in the waist He is Senor Dick Haldane a gallant young gentleman whom you must thank my little daughter for having saved my life At this the graceful young girl advanced a step or two towards me and catching hold of my hand before I could prevent her kissed it greatly to my confusion as albeit it was an act expressive amongst the Spanish with whom she had been brought up of deferential courtesy and gratitude but it made me blush up to my eyes and feel hot all over A thousand thanks sir she began but as she raised her eyes to my face in thus giving utterance to her thanks for having as the colonel had told her saved her father s life a flood of recollection seemed to come upon her and she exclaimed Ah I remember now My father yes he is like the gentleman whom I saw on the deck of the steamer that awful night when the negroes rose up against us last Friday was it not But it seems so long ago to me You you naughty papa would not believe that your little girl had seen anything at all not even a ship but that I only fancied it in my foolishness However there is the same steamer that I saw pointing with her finger to the Star of the North and here is the same for I am sure he is the same the very same young officer Am I not right And looking up at her father she exclaimed Your little girl told the truth after all And you young lady said I smiling at her recognition of me strange coincidence as it was corroborating my own experience of the same eventful night yes you are the same little girl I saw on board the ghost ship as all the men here called your vessel not believing likewise my story that I had seen her or you either Yes I would have known you anywhere You are the girl whom I saw with the dog The next moment I could have bitten my tongue out though for my thoughtlessness in alluding to the poor dog for at the bare mention of him Elsie s face which had a sort of absent wandering look about it still at once lighted up and she glanced round in all directions Ah I declare I had quite forgotten Ivan in the joy and happiness of seeing you again my father she exclaimed excitedly Where is he the brave fellow Ivan Ivan you dear old dog Come here come here sir directly She looked round again with a half smile playing about the corners of her pretty rosebud of a mouth and a joyous light in her eyes expecting her faithful friend and companion would come bounding up to her side but she now waited and watched and listened in vain there being no response to her summons either by bark or bound or wag of poor Ivan s bushy tail Nor would there be any more for his ringing bark was hushed his body and tail alike stiff and cold while his noble heart which only throbbed with affection for those whom he loved when living had stopped beating for aye My dear child poor Ivan is dead said Colonel Vereker tenderly after a short pause drawing the young girl up to him so that she might not see the gruesome sight on the deck below The brave dog sacrificed his life for mine and but for his help little one I should not now be by your side This account of the poor animal s heroic end however did not comfort little Elsie who gave a startled glance at her father s face where seeing something there that made her comprehend her loss she buried her golden head on his breast sobbing as though her heart would break Poor poor dear Ivan he never left me once never my father since you you went out of the cabin that last night and told him to watch me she exclaimed presently in halting accents between her convulsive sobs neither the colonel or myself dry eyed as we listened to her tale you may be sure But but all at once after all the noise and that dreadful firing that seems now to go through my ears I I heard your voice quite distinctly on the deck and so too did poor Ivan for I saw him instantly put up his ears while he whined and looked beseechingly at us Well after that my child said the colonel on her stopping for the moment overcome with emotion what happened next He made a dash at the cabin table and jumped up on it and then the poor fellow growled savagely at some one outside Then then before I could hold him back he made a most desperate spring and sprung right up through the glass roof on the top of the sky skylight and he must have cut himself very very much Poor poor doggie And now you say my poor Ivan is dead and that I shall never see the dear good faithful creature again Oh my father At this point the young girl again broke down Nor were her tears a mere passing tribute of grief For though dead Ivan is not forgotten like some people the remembrance of whom is as evanescent as the scent of the flowers that hypocritical mourners may ostentatiously scatter upon their graves his little mistress little no longer preserving his memory yet green in her heart of hearts close to which she wears always a small locket containing likenesses of her father and mother together with a miniature of Ivan her father s preserver with a tiny lock added from the brave dog s curly black coat Some ultra sanctimonious persons may feel inclined to cavil with this association on Elsie s part of immortal beings as they would style her parents and the recollection she cherishes of a dead brute because forsooth they hold that her four footed favourite had no soul but were these gentry to broach the subject before her being a somewhat outspoken young lady from her foreign bringing up which puts her beyond the pale of boarding school punctiliousness she would probably urge that she estimated poor Ivan s sagacious instinct combined with his courage and noble self sacrifice at a far higher level than the paltry apology for a soul that passes current for the genuine article with matter of fact religionists of the stamp of her questioner But Elsie was little Elsie still at the time of which I am speaking and too young perhaps for such thoughts to occur to her mind which at the moment was too full of her loss The cheering that had followed the last tussle of our men with the black mutineers had now ceased and all these things happening you must understand much more rapidly than I can talk or attempt to chronicle them the skipper with mister Fosset and Garry O Neil came hurriedly up on the poop Both expressed their unbounded delight at seeing the child was safe and in the care of her father Sure an what s the little colleen cryin for eagerly inquired Garry his smoke begrimed face which bore ample evidence of the desperate struggle in which he had been so gallantly engaged wearing a look of deep commiseration as he gazed from her father to me and then again at her Faith I hope she s not been hurt or frightened No thank God replied the colonel huskily Grieving for her poor dog Ivan who Och yes I saw the noble baste interrupted Garry in his quick enthusiastic way Begorrah colonel he fought betther than any two legged Christian amongst us an I can t say more than that for him sure paice to his name Before he could say anything further and you know he was a rare one to talk when once he commenced the skipper advanced again holding out his hand to the colonel exclaiming Yes thank God you are all right and that your little child is safe and escaped any harm from those scoundrels except her nerves probably being much shaken but that she will soon recover at her age and I told you she should be restored to you you know By George Though we ve paid them out at last for demon s work aboard here The devils ejaculated Colonel Vereker savagely his mood changing as he recollected all he had seen and suffered at their hands Have you killed them all All but half a dozen of the rascals whom we had a rare hunt after through the hold and fo c s le before we could collar them They are fast bound now though lashed head and feet to the mainmast bitts and it will puzzle them to wriggle themselves loose from old Masters double hitches I know Besides which two of our men are guarding there with boarding pikes in their hands and orders to run em through the gizzard if they offer to stir Faith observed Garry O Neil reflectively It was as purty a bit of foighting as I ivver took a hand in whilst it lasted But let us go and see what has become of all those chaps below all those you mentioned as belonging to the French crew whom you left on board with your daughter went on the skipper We saw the flash of a pistol you remember when we came up alongside and somebody must have prevented those villains from getting into the cabin or else He stopped here and looked meaningly at Elsie Heavens exclaimed the colonel attempting to rise but falling back on the hen coop along the side of the bulwarks he had been using for a temporary seat he seemed so utterly exhausted Ah those brave fellows I was almost forgetting them but I can t move Senor Applegarth or I should have gone down before this to see what had become of my old comrades but I m helpless as you see Elsie now lifted her head looked up and turned towards the skipper They are all wounded said she clasping her hands together and with a look of fright on her face Two of the men the French sailors I mean and the English gentleman That s the little Britisher I told you about who was so plucky explained the colonel mister Johnson Well my father continued the young girl these three rushed down the stairs into the cabin shortly before the steamer thumped against the side of our ship when I thought we were all going down to the bottom of the sea Yes my child said the colonel encouragingly go on and tell us what happened next The English gentleman spoke to me and said that the terrible negroes had conquered them all on deck but that he and the two Frenchmen had escaped from them in time and were going to barricade the doorway leading down from above to prevent the black men from coming below and murdering us all He told me though did the kind English gentleman that I must not be frightened and all would come right in the end for that they had seen a very large steamer approaching coming quite close to us and that they would be able he thought to hold out until we were all rescued They then piled up heaps and heaps of things against the door at the foot of the stairs where the sailors remained then the Englishman stood on the table under the skylight to keep the negroes from getting through there It was the Englishman who fired at them through the glass for he was the only one who had a pistol and he made a hole and then through that we heard all the shrieks and the noise of the pistols and your voice my father Ivan heard and then he jumped up through the hole making a much bigger one and ran to your rescue my dear dear father But what has become of Monsieur Boisson and Madame all this time where were they asked the colonel on Elsie thus concluding the account of what had occurred under her immediate notice a little sob escaping her involuntarily at the mention of her poor dog s name and at the recollection of what she had just witnessed Did they do anything my dear child to help themselves or you No my father she replied apparently surprised at the question They are still in the big cabin at the end of the saloon where you left them when you went away and I m afraid they are very ill indeed for all the time the firing was going on overhead Madame was screeching and screaming and I am sure I heard Monsieur groaning a good deal He was doing so again just now before I found my way upstairs to you to find you and to see what had happened everything had become so suddenly still after all the noise and and those awful horrible yells of the negroes oh I I can hear them still She turned quite pale when uttering the last words words spoken with visible effort shuddering all over and hiding her face again on her father s shoulder Faith sor don t ask her any more questions cried Garry but we d betther be sayin afther those poor fellows ourselves an at once too Do quickly sir doctor said the colonel and I only wish I could come with you but Now jist you shtop where ye are me friend rejoined Garry putting out his hand to prevent his stirring from his seat Sure the cap en an me with Dick Haldane here will be enough to look afther em all With this he made for the companion way and descended the stairs as Elsie ignorant of nautical nomenclature called the ladder the skipper following close behind him On getting to the bottom we found the panels of the door smashed in though of hard oak strengthened with cross battens of the same stout wood which showed to what fierce assault it had been subjected the furniture piled up against it from within having duly prevented the negroes from finally forcing an entrance as well no doubt as our appearance on the scene This barricade had however been now partly removed probably to allow of little Elsie s exit and quickly pitching the remaining obstacles aside the three of us managed to squeeze ourselves inside the cabin which was in such a state of confusion with the long table overturned to serve as a breastwork for the gallant defenders and the settees and lockers turned away from the deck as well as the glass of the skylight all smashed that it looked like a veritable Hurrah s vest as we sailors say On a pile of cushions belonging to the lounge aft the only piece of furniture that was left intact in the place I believe lay the brave men who had stubbornly held the ship to the last against the mutineers All were covered with blood and blackened by powder and so utterly worn out from fatigue in battling throughout the night and day that had almost elapsed since the colonel had left them besides being crippled by the injuries they had received in the fray that they hardly moved on our entrance though one a little chap whom I judged to be the Englishman spoken of by the colonel and Elsie brightened up as we bent over him a look of satisfaction and content stealing over his drawn and haggard face as we cauld see from the rays of the setting sun streaming down through the broken skylight exposing the utter desolation around He was the first to speak I m afeard you ve come too late for us sirs said he slowly with a deep groan of pain Those damned niggers have done for me one of them giving me a dig of his knife in the ribs did it through the doorway just now when the fight were nearly over You might do summat though for my companions here who stood up to the darkies like Britons in spite of them being only Frenchmen though that ain t their fault But how s the little girl I hope she s all right Tell her father if he s alive and I feel almost sure I heard his voice awhile ago up on deck tell him that I kept my word sirs and fought for her to the last I think I m dying now and I must leave off But listen while I ve a little breath for I want to say something My name is Robert Johnson and my old mother God bless her lives at Camberwell near London You ll find all my papers in my pocket and a letter with the address and if any of you chances to be going back to England as I were worse luck you d be doing a favour by seein her and letting her know why I didn t turn up home this Christmas as I promised her I know you will I m going now I m so tired Good night to you all good night good As he said this he gradually fell back on the cushion he was resting against and his eyes closed Captain Applegarth and I both thought him dead Not so however Garry O Neil Sure he s ounly fainted exclaimed the Irishman run Dick me bhoy an say if there s sich a thing as a stooard s pantry knockin about anywheres in those latituodes wid a dhrop of water convanient That an a taste of this aqua vitae here which the saints be praised I took the precawshin to put in me pocket afore we shtarted on this blissid and excoitin skermoish this will very soon fetch back a little loife into the plucky little beggar ag in I had no difficulty in finding the steward s pantry and a breaker of water with a tin dipper attached speedily carrying some back and by our joint ministrations and with it bathing his face and hands and pouring some between his lips little mister Johnson at last opened his eyes and began to breathe After a time and a certain amount of patience he opened his eyes wider and became conscious and later on was induced to swallow down a mixture out of his own special bottle that Garry carried and we were at last delighted to see quite a broad grin spread over his round good natured and somewhat comical face By Jingo sir said he after a pause and rather long silence and after he had drained off the last drop of the elixir with a sigh of gratitude that evidently came from his heart you ve saved my life this time and no mistake I never thought I should taste a drop of good brandy again in this world CHAPTER TWENTY SIX WE PART COMPANY While Garry O Neil and I were attending to the two French sailors who though they had been a good bit knocked about in the course of the protracted struggle were not seemingly very seriously hurt suffering more indeed from want of proper food and rest than from the slight wounds they had received we heard loud cries and a sort of dull moaning that appeared to proceed from the after part of the saloon Going thither at once Captain Applegarth knocked with his knuckles on the panel of the closed door of one of the larger state rooms running athwart the ship from whence the sounds proceeded Hullo within there he shouted what s the matter What s the row Come out A shrill scream was the only response to his inquiries What s the matter repeated the skipper speaking in a gentler tone You have nothing to fear We re all friends here The cries and confused noises continued however and the skipper thereupon resumed his knocking this time more forcibly and with his fists aided by a kick from his heavy boot against the lower part of the still closed door At this imperative summons the shrieking ceased and we heard a feeble voice within calling out in French Mercy for the love of God we could distinguish amidst a plentitude of sobs and violent groans in a deeper key Ah brave Haytians Have pity and spare our lives Hang it all you cowards we re not those cursed Haytians and I wish you could have been left to their mercy It is only what you deserve roared the skipper infuriated and out of all patience at the Frenchwoman s mistake and her appealing in such terms to the murderous scoundrels of whom we had made so summary an end We re Englishmen we re your friends I tell you true hearted British sailors who have come to rescue you so open the door But Madame Boisson who of course was his interlocutrice behind the door remained obdurate Ah the false English she cried down with the pigs At this the skipper laughed grimly and all standing near him were much amused She s a good specimen of her race cried the captain They always abuse other nations and cry out that they are betrayed when ill luck comes to them instead of trying to help themselves as we perfidious Englishmen do Finding it impossible to persuade her though to open the door of the cabin which was bolted and barred within the skipper sang out to me to go on deck and ask Elsie Vereker to come down and try what she could do thinking that the obstinate prisoner would doubtless recognise the girl s voice and so through her means be made more amenable to reason No sooner said than done Up I went and down the companion way I returned anon accompanied not only by Miss Elsie but by the colonel as well Garry O Neil who hurried up the ladder after me with that intent insisting on his coming below so that he could the better attend to his wounded leg which had broken out again and needed fresh dressing and after some little difficulty Garry got him down in safety Thanks to Elsie s pleadings Madame Boisson at length capitulated promising to come out of her retreat as soon as she had had time to make her toilet By George exclaimed the skipper overhearing this and turning with an ironical grin to the colonel who had his leg upon a chair and Garry bustling about him busy with bandages she s a true Frenchwoman as I said at the first Fancy after being imprisoned there in that stuffy cabin for four and twenty hours and imagining herself and husband might be murdered every minute by a lot of pirate scoundrels thinking of nothing but titifying herself instead of thanking God for their escape and rushing out at the very first opportunity eager to be free Strange creatures Heavens exclaimed the colonel smiling at the other s outburst It is true but they re all alike and I ve seen a good many of them my friend Presently out sailed Madame Boisson who I noticed was a middle aged and well preserved woman attired in an elaborate dressing gown with a profusion of bows and ribbons fluttering about it and with a good deal of pearl powder or some other cosmetic of that sort on her face and her cheeks tinted here and there with well colour Despite her screams and hysterics however there was no trace of a tear in her twinkling black eyes although her fat little husband who ambled meekly in her train betrayed signs of great emotion his red face all swollen from crying and otherwise looking like a whipped cur Madame made a most gracious salute to us all and glancing at me with a spice of coquetry to which she was evidently not unaccustomed was pleased to observe that I was un beau garcon In returning the skipper s polite bow she happened to notice the poor wounded sailors lying on the cushions by the companion and the blood all sprinkled about a sight at which she turned up her nose declaring very volubly that the place was like a pigsty unfit for any lady to enter and expressing her surprise at those common seamen being attended to and allowed to remain in the saloon she having always understood that that apartment was only for the use of the first class passengers The skipper who understood her well enough as I did too having learnt the language at a French school near Rouen was very angry at her remarks Those men said he in his best Parisian are your own countrymen all that are left of those who died to preserve the lives of you and your husband there who ought to be ashamed of himself for skulking below while they were fighting on deck Monsieur looked foolish but said nothing in reply to this Madame sniffed and flashed her glittering black eyes as if she could annihilate him at a glance My brave Hercules she cried indignantly be easy You have been out in the Bois and have established your reputation as a hero and have no need to notice the insulting remarks of this Englishman But for you she added turning angrily to the colonel this would not have happened I Good Heavens exclaimed Colonel Vereker greatly astonished at her turning on him thus Why it was I who did all in my power to prevent Captain Alphonse from allowing those cursed blacks on board the ship in the first instance but you and Monsieur Boisson both of you persuaded him to the contrary My God dear Hercules see how we are calumniated said the irate Frenchwoman rather illogically turning to her miserable atom of a husband who gesticulated and shrugged his shoulders in response and looking over the skipper and Colonel Vereker as if neither existed she went on to remark to Elsie who however did not appear to relish very much her conversation or endearments that some persons whom she would not condescend to name were of monsters the most infamous and ungrateful men indeed of the gutter but that she the little one was an angel Here the skipper put an end to the interview He had evidently seen and had enough of the Boissons husband and wife and ascending the companion ladder at the same time as Garry and myself I heard him muttering to himself as he went along and just caught the following words To think brave men lose valuable save such theirs too dreadful She frivolous he a damned coward laying a rather strong emphasis on the last words We afterwards went down again Garry and I and managed between us to bring up little mister Johnson the brave fellow having picked up wonderfully after the attention we had given him and the knife thrust he had received from the negro was found to have only grazed his ribs and he was anxious for fresh air after his long imprisonment below and to see and judge for himself how things were looking on deck after our scrimmage Here the light was waning and there was a good deal to be done I think Fosset said the skipper to our worthy first mate who had been ordering matters forward while the former had come aft we had better muster the hands first so as to know who s missing I m afraid several of our poor fellows have lost the number of their mess in the fight Aye sir they have replied mister Fosset Poor Stoddart s gone for one Poor fellow I am sorry exclaimed the captain with much feeling We couldn t have lost a better man for he was about the best we had on board poor fellow a good engineer a good mess mate and good at everything he handled besides being the finest fellow that ever wore shoe leather How did it happen He was knifed by one of those black devils sir as he led the boarders forrad Poor Stoddart I am sorry to lose you Well there s no use crying over spilt milk and all my words will never bring him back again mister O Neil just muster the men in the waist and let us know the worst at once Faith ye re roight sor we d betther count noses an have the job over returned Garry sotto voce singing out in a louder key to the survivors of the fray who were grouped in the waist about the mainmast where the remaining Haytians who had not been killed outright were tied up feet to the wrists as the skipper had told Colonel Vereker when he came up Now all you Star of the Norths that are still alive come over here to starboard the chaps that are d id sure can shtop where they are The hands laughed at this Hibernian way of putting the matter to them and answered their names readily on Garry proceeding to read out the muster roll from a paper he had drawn out of his pocket all that is save those that had fallen eight in number including poor Stoddart our energetic second engineer and one of his firemen who had volunteered to swell the boarding party as well as six of our best sailors amongst the foremast hands Of the rest of the crew four were badly hurt and a few slightly wounded Spokeshave was one of these latter having unfortunately the end of his nose that prominent feature of his cut clean off by a slash from a cutlass but the majority we were glad to find mostly escaped unscathed Seeing old Masters all right I thought of his morbid forebodings before we came up with the ship and determined to take a rise out of him I m awfully sorry about the old bo sun I said with a wink to Garry right behind his back He wasn t a bad seaman but an awful old grumbler and so superstitious that he funked his own shadow and daren t walk up a hatchway in the dark Poor old chap though it s a pity he s dead I shall miss him if only from not hearing his continued growling over things that might happen Well I m blessed cried old Masters completely flabbergasted at this exordium of mine I never thought Mister Haldane to hear you speak ag in me like that I allays believed you was a friend that I did I pretended not to see him and so too did Garry O Neil tumbling to my game as the saying goes while I went on with my chaff How did he die I asked Was he killed at the first rush Faith I can t say corrictly replied Garry in a very melancholy tone of voice I m afeard care carried him off somehow or other as it killed the cat for he war the most disconsolate doleful down hearted chap I ivver saw piping the hands to dinner An so he s d id Poor old bo sun we ll nivver see his loike ag in Lord bless you cried old Masters angrily stepping up nearer and confronting us I m not dead at all I tell you I tell you I m not I m blessed if I am Can t you see me here alive and hearty afore you Look at me Ah it s his ghost I said with an affected and tremulous start He told me poor fellow he felt himself doomed and nothing could save him and I suppose his spirit wants to prove to me he wasn t a liar as I always thought he was the old sinner This was too much for Garry and he couldn t hold in any longer and both of us roared at Masters who looked scared and though angry and highly incensed with us at first was only too glad at its being but a joke and not a fact that he was dead to bear us any ill feeling long We were horrified when we were told later on while we were committing to the deep the corpses of those slain negroes and white men impartially sharing the same grave beneath the placid sea at rest like themselves the breeze having died away again soon after sunset that Etienne Brago and Francois Terne the two wounded sailors we had left below with the Boissons and little mister Johnson and the colonel and Elsie of course that these were the only ones left of the thirty odd souls on board the Saint Pierre when she sailed from La Guayra a fortnight before After all the bodies had been buried in their watery tomb not forgetting that of poor Ivan who we all thought merited an honoured place by the side of his biped brethren of valour well after all this had been done the skipper had the pumps rigged and the decks sluiced down to wash away all traces of the fray A council of war was then held between us all on the poop the skipper of course presiding and the colonel coming up from the cabin to take part in the proceedings as well as old mister Stokes from our ship where he had remained attending singlehanded to the duties of the engine room denying himself as Garry O Neil remarked all the foin of the foighting This conclave had been called for the purpose of deciding what was to be done with the Saint Pierre and the captured black pirates from whom we had salvaged her and without much deliberation it was pretty soon decided on the colonel s suggestion to send the ship to her destined port Liverpool taking the negroes in her so that they could be tried before a proper court in England for the offence they had committed It s of no use your fetching them up to New York said the colonel for though I m an American myself and am proud of my nationality I must confess those Yanks of the north mix up dollars and justice in a way that puzzles folk that are not accustomed to their way of holding the scales The skipper was of the same opinion as Colonel Vereker so the matter having been settled a navigating party was selected to work the Saint Pierre across the Atlantic with Garry O Neil as chief officer The skipper was unable to spare mister Fosset and Garry was all the more fit in every way for the part as he would be able to look after the wounded French sailors who would naturally go in the ship as they were the principal witnesses against the blacks on the charges that would be brought against them of piracy on the high seas It was dark when all these details were finally arranged and all of them went back aboard on our vessel for rest and refreshment the colonel and his daughter of course accompanying us Madame and Monsieur Boisson however could not be made to leave the ship saying they would not do so Madame that is said it and the brave Hercule following her lead as usual would not leave said she repeatedly until they once more touched terra firma and not wishing they should be starved for their obstinacy the skipper ordered Weston to look after the happy pair and provide them with food at the same time as he did the wounded and prisoners The two vessels remained for the night still lashed alongside for better security all hands being too tired out besides to be able to do anything further beyond turning in and getting as much rest and sleep as they could after the fatigue and excitement of the day Next morning at sunrise Garry O Neil went back to his ship with his crew of eight men all the skipper was able to spare him and by breakfast time they had made her all atauto bending new sails which they found below in the forepeak in place of the tattered rags that hung from some of the yards and otherwise making good defects preparing the vessel for her passage home We were all sorry to part with Garry even for the short period that would elapse before he would rejoin the old barquey for he was the life of all us aboard but the same regret was not felt for Master Spokeshave when we saw him go over the side to accompany the Irishman the skipper having so decreed as his assistant navigator the damage to his nose not necessarily affecting his taking the sun though it might interfere with the little beggar s altitudes of another character By eight bells all the details necessary under the circumstances were satisfactorily arranged including the transfer of the effects belonging to the colonel and Miss Elsie these two preferring to voyage with us unlike their whilom passengers the Boissons who remained in their old quarters going with Captain Garry as we all dubbed our mess mate on his promotion to a separate command and half an hour or so later a splendid breeze just then springing up from the westwards and flecking the still blue water with buoyant life the two ships parted company amid a round of enthusiastic cheers that only grew faint as the distance widened them apart the Saint Pierre sailing off right before the wind with everything set below and aloft across the ocean on her course for Saint George s Channel while we braced our yards sharp up and bore away full speed ahead in the opposite direction bound for New York which port we safely reached without further mishap four days later CHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN I GO TO VENEZUELA You d better stick to us said the skipper to Colonel Vereker who talked of taking the next Cunard steamer which was advertised to leave on the morrow as the Star of the North was being berthed in our company s dock on the East River I m only going to stop here long enough to discharge our cargo and ship a fresh one which is all ready and waiting for us and then sir we ll make tracks as our friends the Yankees say right away over the herring pond to Liverpool as fast as steam and sail can carry the old barquey Better stick to us colonel and see the voyage out All right Senor Applegarth replied the colonel who could not drop his Spanish phraseology all at once though otherwise gradually returning to his and our own native tongue and becoming less of a foreigner in every way I will return with you Both were as good as their word he and little Elsie coming home with us and the skipper making the passage from Sandy Hook to the Mersey in eight days from land to land the fastest run we had ever yet achieved across the Atlantic whether outward or homeward bound But quick as we were the Saint Pierre managed to reach Liverpool before we did the pilot who boarded us off the Skerries bringing the news that she had gone up the river a tide ahead of us This piece of intelligence was confirmed beyond question by Garry O Neil coming off in the company s tug that sheered alongside as we dropped anchor in the stream later on midway between the Prince s landing stage and the Birkenhead shore the manager of our line being anxious to compliment the skipper on his successful rescue of the French ship the percentage on whose valuable cargo for bringing her safely to port and thus saving all loss to the underwriters would more than repay any damage done for the detention of our vessel when engaged on the errand of mercy and justice that took her off her course In addition likewise to the thanks of the company and the underwriters the skipper was also presented with a handsome gold chronometer watch by the committee of Lloyds besides participating in the amount awarded by the charterers of the Saint Pierre for the salvage of the ship though in this latter apportionment it was only fair to mention that we all shared officers and crew alike I for my part coming into the sudden possession of such a tidy little sum of ready money that I felt myself a comparative millionaire When talking with Garry whom it is almost needless to say all hands were glad to see again the men cheering him lustily as he crossed the gangway from the tug he told us that though otherwise they had had a fairly pleasant voyage after parting company with us off the Azores the Boissons gave him a good deal of trouble Madame he said worried his life out by making eyes at him when he went below at meal times while on deck he was never safe for a moment from her embarrassing attentions unless in desperation as he was often forced to do he went aloft to get out of her way Faith an sure that warn t the worst of it nayther complained Garry in his humorous way Though the vain silly ould crayture bate Banagher for flirtin an indade bates ivviry other of her sex God bless em that I ve ivver clapt eyes on yet that quare little Frenchy chap her husband he the little sparrow must neades git jallous an makes out it s all my fault an

moighty saur at me if we chanced to mate on deck aye faith as saur as a babby that s been weaned on butthermilk Why inquired the skipper when we had both a good laugh at Garry and his account of the Boisson episode have they left then the ship for good Faith yis sor bag an baggage the blissid pair of em an moighty pleased I wor to say the backs of em But how about the trial of those black devils those pirates then won t they be required as witnesses against the murderers No sor replied Garry The polis officers that came aboard whin we got into dock sid they didn t want monsieur nor madame neither as they didn t know a ha porth of the jambolle worse luck they bein below all the toime The magistrates think the two French sailors who re goin on foine by the same token and the colonel all of whom were on deck an saw everything that went on would be sufficient witnisses aga n the Haytian scoundrels Oh said the skipper have these men been brought up before the magistrates Aye yestherday afthernoon sor an they ve been raymanded whativer that may mane it ought to have been rayprimanded I m thinkin an a cat o nine tails if they had their desarts till next Tuesday The magisthrates belayvin the ould Star of the North wid you cap en wid the colonel aboard to give ividence ag saint the mutineers that they wouldn t be in from New York afore then not knowin what the ould barquey could do in the way of stayming as you an I do sor an that she d arrive faith to day All happened as Garry O Neil informed us the Haytians and mutineer blacks of the Saint Pierre s crew being brought up again before the magistrates the week following our arrival home when after hearing the additional evidence against them given by Colonel Vereker and the skipper the six black and mahogany coloured rascals were committed for trial at the next assizes which we were told would not be held for another month on the charge of piracy and murder on the high seas The colonel took advantage of the interval that would necessarily have to elapse before his presence would again be required in court to escort Miss Elsie to Paris and place her under the care of the sisters at the convent at Neuilly where I think I told you before he said her mother had been brought up and educated while the skipper and others of us belonging to the Star of the North being compelled to remain within handy reach of the authorities in case our presence at the trial might be required the opportunity was seized to lay the old barquey up in dry dock and give her a thorough overhaul within and without though the engines as proved by our rapid passage here were none the worse for our breakdown in mid Atlantic thanks to the skill and exertions of poor Stoddart and the rest of old mister Stokes staff Most of us in this way got a short holiday while awaiting the assizes which I spent with my mother and sister taking home with me the money I had been awarded as my share of the Saint Pierre s salvage which had made me fancy myself a temporary Croesus Alas though the sum large though it was for a young fellow to find unexpectedly in his pocket went but a very short step in satisfying the rapacious wolf I found at my mother s door when I reached the little cottage where she lived with my sister Janet in one of the suburbs of Liverpool A bubble company whose directors had all been selected for their religious bias rather than their business qualifications burst at one fell coup almost in the very hour of my return home dissipating into thin air as the Latin poet has it all the savings of a lifetime which my mother had invested in the swindle the provision left behind by my father when he died for her use and the subsequent benefit of my sister and myself The devout rogue who had managed the concern to his own worldly interest and that of his fellow religionists carried on the same so they said in a pious and eminently Christian way no doubt respected alike in the eyes of God and men according to the loudly voiced tenets of the particular sect to which he and his company directors mostly belonged but he managed all the same to carry off to a remote and friendly land outside the pale of international law and where dividends need no longer be paid to clamorous creditors a considerable amount of portable property of a valuable nature amongst which probably was our inheritance my mother s capital Under these circumstances it behoved me to consider how I could best aid my poor mother and sister then left suddenly destitute through no fault of their own Fortunately I had the means ready at hand In our constant association on board the Star of the North after his rescue from the drifting boat in which he greatly exaggerated the help I was able to render him Colonel Vereker was kind enough to notice me much more than my subordinate position on board would have seemed to warrant and in a conversation we had together during the voyage home from New York after asking me what my prospects were he made me an offer to accompany him back to Venezuela on his return promising me should I accept a good salary to start with and a fair chance of ultimately making my fortune Loving the sea and my profession however with all a sailor s love besides being attached to my old ship and her officers I felt no inclination then to give up what I had learnt to look upon as my legitimate calling and turn landsman so although I had the highest admiration for the colonel coupled with more than a liking for his young daughter between whom and myself there seemed such a mysterious sympathy on the evening of my sighting the Saint Pierre when the captain declared we were some hundreds of miles apart I reluctantly and so it seemed to me ungraciously declined his proposal telling him I preferred sticking to the skipper and the old barquey But the colonel very kindly would not take my refusal at first as final and when setting out for Paris to take Elsie to her convent school she taking leave of me with many tears and assurances that under any circumstances she would always remain mio amiquito my little friend pledging herself too to be if allowed at the school a constant correspondent if I would write to her sometimes to let her know where I was Well the kind good hearted man taking as he said a deep interest in my welfare for Elsie s sake as well as for my own assured me that he would keep his generous offer open until the period arrived for his ultimate departure for South America on the termination of the trial of the Haytian pirates and their mutineer accomplices So recollecting all this in my hour of need I naturally turned to the colonel and told him of my trouble on his return to Liverpool for the assizes at which by the way the black scoundrels and their allies were sentenced to five years penal servitude the judge regretting his inability to impose a heavier punishment from the fact of proof being wanted of the active participation of the prisoners in the atrociously cruel murder of Cato and the other diabolical work perpetrated on board the ill fated ship We were all glad when this matter with the examination and sickening details that it entailed was finally settled and we were at liberty to go where we liked Colonel Vereker more than justified my confidence in him Heavens my boy you must and shall be as my son he said wringing my hand in a grip that I knew would be faithful unto death Come with me and I will make a man of you and a rich one too Dick Haldane But how shall I manage about my mother and sister sir said I hesitatingly How shall I manage about them during my absence You can make over your salary to them for you will not want anything while at Caracas as you will live with me as my private secretary he replied with another hearty shake of my hand The money shall be paid to your mother regularly by my agent here so that you need have no fears on that score as to her support But I do not want you to decide such an important change in your life without proper consideration and the advice of your friends my boy Go and consult Senor Applegarth who I know is an old friend of yours as well as being your captain and then if he and your other friends advise your acceptance of my offer and your mother and sister are willing to part with you why then Dick you may consider the matter settled and you some day will be very thankful you accepted my offer The skipper did not hesitate for one moment in giving his opinion though like most of my mess mates he was good enough to say how sorry he would be to part with me and how he would miss me Go by all means my lad said he By George it s a chance that doesn t come twice in a fellow s lifetime and you may consider your fortune as good as made mister Fosset and Garry O Neil were equally enthusiastic Faith now sor observed the latter with a comical air of assured deference at my future dignified position as he imagined it would be I hope ye ll remember ye r humble ould fri nd Garry whim ye re Prisidint of the Venezuelan Raypublic mid a lot of yaller divvles for lackeys an so many dollars that ye won t know what to do wid em Begorrah it s wishin I am I stood in ye r shoes alannah an I wouldn t care for to call the Pope me ouncle God bless him Spokeshave though sneered at my success in gaining so good a friend as the colonel but owing to the accident to the top of his nose which being still bandaged or rather court plastered up and not tending to add to his beauty he was not able to turn it up and sniff in his former irritating way that always exasperated me so much As for old Masters his face became the picture of woe when I informed him I was leaving the ship and the company s service You mark my words Master Haldane said he in his most sepulchral manner many a one afore you has throwed up the sea and what good has it done em No good Them that goes to sea oughter stick to the sea that s what I says and if they throws it up though I hopes you won t they allus live to repent it I be truly sorry you be goin and ah Master Haldane I sed as how summet ud come of our seein that there blessed ghost ship And so something has happened bo sun and a precious lot too my hearty said I jokingly as I stood on the gangway preparatory to going over the side But never mind that now old shipmate Good bye to you men and thank you all for your kindness to me from the time I first sailed with you as a youngster I really believe I could see a tear in the old bo sun s eye as he wished me farewell with the rest of them the crew manning the rigging to give me a hearty cheer and send off that could be heard across the Mersey Thus it was that I took leave of the old barquey and my mother s consent having been obtained before I finally settled with the colonel no further arrangements had to be perfected beyond obtaining and preparing my kit and a hasty run to the cottage to pay a last visit to my old mother and sister Janet and wish them farewell for a few years when I looked forward to returning to England and finding them both well and happy and in more comfortable and prosperous circumstances That same afternoon Colonel Vereker and I started off by train from Liverpool for Southampton at which latter port we embarked in the outward bound West India mail steamer sailing for Colon en route to Venezuela CHAPTER TWENTY EIGHT DURING SEVEN YEARS We reached La Guayra and from thence Caracas safely enough in spite of the country just then passing through the acute stage of one of its periodical revolutions that had supervened on the top of an earthquake which convulsions of nature and society are characteristic features of Venezuela like as the chief products of its fertile soil are cocoa and patriots the latter being almost as great an article of export as the former especially after a political crisis and consisting of all sorts and conditions of men who whether born subjects or alien intriguers are all desirous of serving their natural or adopted mother country for a consideration Colonel Vereker was largely interested in an extensive gold mine in the interior where he put me as his overseer This was not an unwise measure for his own sake apart from any motive he had in advancing my welfare his real reason for appointing me to the post for with the exception of the captain of the mine a Frenchman the majority of those employed were half caste Spaniards and Portuguese all of whom studied their several individual pockets rather than the interest of their employer while the main body of workers were peons and mezites bastard mulattoes with a large intermixture of negro blood who valued their own lives as little as they did the lives of those with whom they had to deal I had plenty of work to do here looking after all these scoundrels having to keep my eyes open as much as possible in order to prevent wholesale robbery as far as I could although it was utterly impossible to prevent petty pilfering of the ore on its way from the mine to Puerto Cabello its general port for transhipment to Europe to swell the treasure chest of the exiled However by adopting the old Latin maxim Suaviter in modo fortiter in re treating all without hauteur which some of the insolent half caste Spanish creoles affected and yet keeping my revolver ready with my powder dry so as to be prepared for any emergency I managed to get along very well with the mixed lot I was set over winning golden opinions from every one but a few of the worst characters It sounds as if I were boasting but this is something for a young Englishman to be able to say in a country which though it is the veritable El Dorado of poor Drake s dreams and has possibly a future of wealth and prosperity before it when it comes under the rule of the Anglo Saxon race whether of ourselves or of our cousins in Yankee land it does not much matter for we are all of the same race and enterprising spirit can be better described in respect of its present condition by a shorter and far more expressive word Amongst my other duties I had charge of all the colonel s voluminous correspondence he having a mortal hatred to all letter writing in any shape or form and in addition to my good patron s business communications was entrusted with the task of despatching a lengthy epistle every other mail they went fortnightly from La Guayra to France informing Miss Elsie of our doings the colonel himself adding the briefest of postscripts to his pequina nina as he invariably termed her and always enclosing some remembrance for his little daughter to show that his love exceeded any epistolary proof of the same as well as a more substantial token of a handsome cheque for her maintenance and education forwarded to the care of the mother superior of the convent Of all my manifold duties this was the pleasantest I had to perform being as grateful as water poured on the parched soil of my exile amongst an alien people antagonistic to me in everything and with whom I had to shape a steady course and preserve a stiff weather helm as sailors say to avoid open rupture and assassination the Venezuelese sticking at nothing especially when that nothing happened to be one whom for some sufficient reason to their minds they deemed an enemy and they chanced to be behind his back and as I told you before I steered clear of many enemies but I could never learn to trust them as a people Yes my happiest hours at San Felipe were spent in writing to little Elsie who answered my own letters as well as those I despatched on behalf of the colonel with unvarying punctuality holding to the promise she spontaneously gave in England when we parted on her going to school at which time she had no idea of my ever accompanying her father to South America Similarly the saddest task that could have been laid on my shoulders fell to my lot five years later when the mysterious attraction by which I had been drawn towards her as a boy had grown into the most absorbing affection a love that filled my heart And I had to write and tell her I who would cheerfully have laid down my life to save her a pang to tell her of her dear father s death This occurred just as poor Colonel Vereker had arranged for my returning with him to the capital of the State where another revolution the sixth I believe since I had been in the country had broken out with the object as the object of all these explosions of the mob invariably was to depose the reigning party in power and put the leaders of the popular movement for the time being in the power of the deposed authorities The colonel who had a good deal staked on the issue of the struggle took up arms on the side of the cause he esteemed just that to which the most respectable of the inhabitants to a man adhered as he had taken up arms before for the party of law and order amongst whom he was looked up to not only as a skilled soldier and tactician but a stalwart partisan his very name being a tower of strength Alas though no opportunity was afforded him now to display his valour on the battlefield and lead his hosts to victory for while we were en route for Caracas a dastardly hound of a creole whose blood was a mixture of the beast elements part Spaniard part Portuguese part negro well this treacherous brute assassinated Colonel Vereker in the most cowardly fashion I was by and saw it all The vile murderer came up to my poor friend as we were resting in a posada on the road from San Felipe and while engaging him in an apparently friendly conversation respecting the political points of the rising he suddenly stabbed the dear old man in the back with a long stiletto which he had hidden up his wide shirt sleeves Fortunately I was there and I had time to send a bullet through his brain from my revolver before the wretch could stir a yard from the spot but this could not save my noble hearted kind generous protector a man who had been more than a father to me and for whom I had the utmost affection and respect No the death of the scoundrel could not save him for the wound the cowardly scoundrel had inflicted was mortal My dear friend and companion only survived long enough to confide his daughter to my care and give me his blessing ere he died drawing his last breath in my arms a smile on his face and dauntless to the end as he pressed my hand and uttered the usual parting phrase he had learnt from his Spanish associates Hasta la manana Good bye till to morrow It was a long to morrow indeed After seeing the last tribute of respect paid to the colonel s remains the gallant fellow being buried close to the posada where he had met with his untimely end and a cross which I carved myself placed above his lonely grave sheltered by a noble palm that stood erect as he had done when living a monument of nature s handiwork I resumed my journey to Caracas in order to carry out my lost friend s last directions The alcalde who acted as the colonel s agent and was largely in his confidence being an acquaintance of many years standing produced a copy of Colonel Vereker s will for my inspection assuring me that this had been drawn up during his last visit to the State capital while all his affairs were in the most perfect order the poor gentleman as the alcalde expressed it being under the opinion that he would not have long to live a presentiment of death I have often found many people to have had Generous and thoughtful for others to the end he had not forgotten me in this his last testament showing that the regard he had already displayed for my welfare was no mere temporary fancy On the contrary much to my astonishment he had bequeathed to me quite half his fortune all his share indeed in the Gondifera mine while all his realised property which was invested in good English and American securities out of the reach of the grasping hand of the hungerful Venezuelan patriots all this he left to his daughter Elsie From a codicil too appended to the document more in the form of a sacred charge than a legal instrument reading between the lines I could perceive that the large hearted man had fathomed the secret desire of my heart though secret it evidently was not to him loving Elsie as he did albeit in a different fashion for after enjoining upon me to regard his little daughter s interests even as he had studied mine he added that should fate bring us together in the future as had happened so strangely in the past his dearest wish would be gratified for he had already learnt to care for me and to look upon me as his son Of course nothing of this was mentioned when writing to tell Elsie of the awful event and dreadful calamity that had befallen her although later on before I was able to return to England when her education was completed and the good nuns wrote to me as her father s executor to say the time had arrived for taking her away from the convent unless she wished to change her religion and join the sisterhood to both of which courses I was of course bitterly opposed and as you may imagine was delighted when Elsie herself requested to be allowed to leave I must however have accidentally have shown my feelings towards her and have let the cat out of the bag in the letter I sent home to my mother in answer to the last communication from Neuilly asking her to take charge of my darling Elsie until I came home to win and claim her I imagined this from something that leaked out afterwards and from the somewhat altered tone of Elsie s letters to me from the date of her leaving France to live with my mother for though affectionate enough they had a certain little air of constraint about them and though she spoke of various objects of interest to both of us and of different persons whom she and I knew and places she went to she never by any chance ever mentioned herself never after the letters she sent me containing the passionate outpouring of her inmost heart on receiving the news of her father s death albeit all this she would feel perfectly certain was to me a sacred confidence Slight as the change was in her subsequent correspondence I noticed it and it worried me and determined me to have the matter cleared up as soon as I possibly could Meanwhile however I had to fulfil the colonel s last trust and as I knew what his intentions had been in regard to the crisis in Venezuelan affairs at the time when an assassin s hand prevented him from acting the part he intended to play in the existing revolution I thought I should be only carrying out his wishes in putting myself in his place as far as it lay in my power to do so So soon after coming to Caracas and settling the details of the colonel s last depositions making my own will in my turn in case of accidents though in what way is best known to myself I went to the headquarters of the Government troops and joined the army of General Gomez Under this able leader I fought in several engagements that were fierce and sanguinary as all such fratricidal contests are and ever have been in the annals of civil war at San Sebastien Carapana Tarasca and elsewhere our guerilla struggle extending over the whole extensive country in almost every direction where there was a town to sack or property to plunder until at last the insurgent patriots were conquered and peace restored All this took a long time and then having had enough and to spare of fighting and bloodshed and tired of mining too I disposed of my interest in the Gondifera mine and at last sailed for Europe bidding a long adieu to Venezuela and everything belonging to it my journey home being hastened by a somewhat tenderer letter than usual from Elsie who had read a paragraph in the papers about my having been wounded at the battle of San Sebastien though of course I had not mentioned anything about the affair to her or my mother as it was a mere flea bite and of no consequence and I feared to have alarmed them needlessly had I said anything about it in my letters to them at home

6099_230928_000003_000000	train-clean-360	Fellows who knock about the world sailoring and so on cannot help coming to the conclusion that its compass is narrower than stay at home folk might be inclined to believe for you can hardly stir a step without knocking across some one whom you previously imagined to have been miles and miles away separated perhaps by an ocean from yourself 
none	none	I had scarcely stepped into the train from Southampton bound Londonwards en route for Liverpool having only landed from the mail steamer that brought me direct all the way from Colon that very morning when whom should I see looking at me from the opposite corner of the railway carriage but a big bushy haired brown bearded man whom I did not know from Adam Faith exclaimed this gentleman after a moment s scrutiny a broad grin lighting up his face and his eyes twinkling with a comical expression that would alone have made me recognise him had I not heard his delightful to me at any rate Irish brogue ye re ayther Dick Haldane or the divvle stretching out both hands to grasp mine 
6099_230928_000006_000000	train-clean-360	I was as pleased to see him as may readily be believed as the genial Irishman was to see me I was sure even without his telling me so 
none	none	Well said I after we had pretty nigh wrung each other s hands off in friendly greeting and how are you all getting on aboard the dear old barquey I want to hear about everybody Begorrah Dick give me toime to recover me bre th me bhoy an thin I ll till ye ivverythin and then he continued in a bashful sort of way unlike his usual off hand manner I ve lift the say for good an sit up for a docther ashore on me own hook faith Why I exclaimed in great surprise how s that Bedad you d betther axe y r sister

6099_230928_000013_000001	train-clean-360	 This is indeed a surprise 
none	none	Then it all came out Garry telling a long yarn about his calling at my mother s house to ask about me some few months back and meeting there Elsie whom he had no difficulty in identifying he said as the little girl of the ghost ship though she had grown a bit taller and was more good looking than he remembered her at the time he saw her on board the Saint Pierre 
6099_230928_000014_000001	train-clean-360	But good looking as she was he did not think her to be compared to my sister Janet with whom he had evidently fallen in love at first sight and very deeply so too 
6099_230928_000015_000000	train-clean-360	On his subsequently declaring his passion impetuous as usual after a very short acquaintance my mother insisted as a first step to entertaining his suit that he should leave the sea as he had another profession by which he was quite capable of supporting a wife as well as himself if he so pleased 
none	none	Faith and I wint an bought a practis at onst havin a snig little sum stowed away in the bank continued Garry the savin s of me pay for the last five year an more besides that money we all got for salvagin the French ship sure of which I nivver spint a ha poth But aven thin Dick ould chap yer dear ould mother wern t satisfied bless her ould heart She sid that yer sisther an mesilf wu ld have to wait to git marri d till you came home ye spalpeen an not thin aven if so be as how ye d turn nasty an disagreyable an refuse yer consint Faith ye won t now will ye or bedad I ll be afther breakin ivvrey bone in y r body avic an thin have to plasther ye up ag in To avoid such a terrible contingency I there and then gave my hearty consent to the arrangement he and Janet with my mother s concurrence had thus planned without my knowledge although really if I had been inclined to grumble at not being informed previously of what now so unexpectedly transpired I had only time and distance to blame not the parties concerned for the engagement was of so recent a date that the news of it though on the way through the post had not reached Venezuela when I left 
6099_230928_000018_000000	train-clean-360	After I had answered a lot of Garry O Neil s questions concerning myself and the time I had passed in South America speaking too of poor Colonel Vereker whose death he had learnt from my mother I began again asking in my turn all about my old shipmates and of course his own also 
none	none	Faith the skipper is foine and flourishin he informed me an the ould barquey as good an as sound as ivver she was

none	none	Begorrah ye ll laugh an be amused but he s marri d to a wife as big as one of thim grannydeers we onst took in the ould barquey to Bermuda d ye rimimber Faith she s saix feet hoigh an broad in the b ame in proporshi n They make a purty couple bedad an they do say she kapes him in order Do ye rickolict what an argufyin chap Spokeshave was aboard I should think I did indeed replied I I think he was the most cantankerous little beast I ever came across in my life either afloat or ashore Faith ye wouldn t say that same now Dick rejoined Garry with much earnestness The poor little beggar s as make as a cat for he daren t call his sowl his own 
6099_230928_000030_000000	train-clean-360	I asked after some of the other men belonging to my old ship including Accra Prout whom the colonel wished to accompany us to Venezuela the mulatto refusing on the plea that though he should always love his old massa he could not go with him for one insurmountable reason 
none	none	Guess I d hav sociate wid dem tam black raskels daan thaar massa an dis chile no like dat nohow I se nebbah sparrage my famerly by sociatin wid niggahs massa nebbah De Prouts long good old plantation stock an raise in Lousianner This supercilious autocrat it must be borne in mind all the time being more than half a negro himself though for that matter his heart was better and his disposition braver than many a white man who would have despised his coloured skin Some of the other hands about whom I inquired had left the old barquey and shipped aboard other vessels so Garry told me but at this I was not much surprised sailors as a rule being fond of change and very unconservative in their habits 
6099_230928_000034_000000	train-clean-360	With suchlike conversation my old mess mate and I beguiled our long railway journey to Liverpool which we reached the same evening but before we had quite exhausted our respective questions and answers respecting everybody we had ever met or known during the time he and I had been to sea together 
6099_230928_000035_000000	train-clean-360	My meeting with my dear mother and sister after so long an absence abroad can be well imagined and so too my first interview with Elsie whom I should hardly have known again for how can I describe her beauty and grace and though I had been prepared in some measure from accounts my mother had sent me still they exceeded my expectations 
none	none	It would be impossible if I tried to picture her for a month of Sundays as Captain Applegarth used to say on board the old barquey when he thought a fellow spent too much time over a job 
6099_230928_000037_000000	train-clean-360	So to make a long story short and to avoid all further explanation it need only be added that one fine day last summer when the trees were all green and leafy and the flowers abloom and happy birds filling the air with song Elsie and I were married 
none	none	Garry O Neil joined his lot with that of my sister at the same time the two brides being given away respectively by the skipper who managed to run the Star of the North home in time for the wedding and old mister Stokes the chief engineer of the old barquey who had only to cross the road instead of the Atlantic to get to our house as he lived near to us now he also was present Captain Applegarth who was a very old friend of my mother s and a kind one too likewise lived in a good substantial house surrounded by a lovely garden in our pretty picturesque old village To all whom it may concern it may in conclusion be mentioned that this double barrelled affair took place in the quaint old fashioned non ritualistic semi Gothic and many galleried old village church of which so few remain now in England situated close to our cottage and where our widowed mother had in our childhood taught us to lisp our first prayers to heaven our dead father resting in the ivy grown and flower adorned graveyard adjoining The nuptial knot was tied by Parson Goldwire as everybody called him in the neighbourhood assisted by Matthew Jacon the equally elderly parish clerk without whose joint ministration on the occasion neither Janet nor myself would have believed the marriage ceremony had been properly solemnised both my sister and myself standing in much awe of the learned divine and his inseparable double and holding to the creed that the austere pair represented the very quintessence of orthodoxy CHAPTER THIRTY A PRESENTMENT OF THE PAST 
6368-230929-0000	train-other-500	After Elsie and I got spliced to use the old familiar language of my boyhood the expressive argot of the sea for which I shall always retain a passionate love
6368-230929-0001	train-other-500	only second to that I bear towards my dear wife we set off for the Continent having determined to spend the happy period of our honeymoon abroad
none	none	 like the fine folk of the fashionable world with whom 
6368-230929-0002	train-other-500	though there is little in common between us their ways otherwise not being our ways nor their thoughts ambitions hopes or desires in any respect akin to ours
none	none	 First we went up the Seine to Rouen 
6368-230929-0003	train-other-500	where I had passed a couple of years of my school life studying French and teaching the young scions
none	none	 of the Gallic race with whom I was associated 
6368-230929-0004	train-other-500	for the time the exigencies of football as we play the game in Lancashire varied by an occasional illustrative exhibition explanatory of the merits of la boxe Anglaise
6368-230929-0005	train-other-500	Time passed swiftly with so sweet and sympathetic a companion our tastes were similar both taking the greatest delight in ancient buildings and lovely scenery
6368-230929-0006	train-other-500	the weather too was charming and altogether we were as happy as two mortals can be on this earth Elsie and I saw all that was to be seen in the old city we first visited
6368-230929-0007	train-other-500	which in addition to its architectural beauties should have a special charm for all Englishmen from the fact of the dauntless Richard Coeur
none	none	 de Lion 
6368-230929-0008	train-other-500	having such an affection for the town that he bequeathed it his lion heart and then we journeyed on through la belle Normandie loitering here and there at those historic spots
6368-230929-0009	train-other-500	woven into the life of our country spots where artists of all nations love to linger We stayed anon at slow sedate Caen as still as the stone for which it is celebrated
6368-230929-0010	train-other-500	and that furnished the building material of Winchester Cathedral Bayeux boastful of its antique tapestry and Dol and Saint Servan
none	none	 and away beyond Sainte Michel so like and yet unlike the like named Saint Michael s Mount of Cornwall 
6368-230929-0011	train-other-500	in our own sea girt isle that it might have been chipped out of the same block by its grand handycraftsman to serve as a replica until entering brighter Bretaigne in the sunny south of France
6368-230929-0012	train-other-500	where the landmarks of the past seem to stand out in bolder relief we visited Nantes and other places of interest and jogging on thence through Angouleme and
none	none	 Poictiers 
6368-230929-0013	train-other-500	halting a day at Poictiers to fight our Plantagenet
none	none	 battles o er again 
6368-230929-0014	train-other-500	we finally ended our pilgrimage at Bordeaux At this wonderfully picturesque port whose semi ancient quaintly modern aspect strangely attracted us both we anchored awhile
6368-230929-0015	train-other-500	remaining many weeks in excess of the customary limit of the traditional honeymoon ours being an indefinite one and only to be completed we trust when Elsie and I cease to breathe
6368-230929-0016	train-other-500	Late in the autumn when the leaves had begun to turn russet and brown and the air of a morning assumed a crisper and more bracing tone telling us plainly as these signs tell that summer had fled for good and aye
6368-230929-0017	train-other-500	and winter was coming by and by we bade adieu to dear old Bordeaux and taking a steamer there bound for the
none	none	 Thames 
6368-230929-0018	train-other-500	having had enough of railways and land travel we started to voyage home by sea my native element
none	none	 On the evening of the second day that had elapsed since losing sight of Pointe de Graves at the mouth of the Garonne 
6368-230929-0019	train-other-500	towards sunset we had weathered Ushant and were shaping a course up Channel north east
none	none	 so as to clear the dangerous Casquettes rocks of Guernsey 
6368-230929-0020	train-other-500	when I noticed a large ship close hauled on the starboard tack steaming inwards for the French coast as if heading for Brest her nearest port At that moment the tired sun
6368-230929-0021	train-other-500	which previously appeared to linger above the horizon uncertain whether to go or to stay dipped suddenly as we were looking at him a pale yellow radiance succeeding the dazzling beams
6368-230929-0022	train-other-500	that had well nigh blinded us shining straight in our eyes while the afterglow mounting rapidly into the western sky became more and more vivid each moment two purple islands of cloud
6368-230929-0023	train-other-500	which floated across this refulgent background having the lower edges dyed of a rich crimson that seemed to set the sea on fire and tipped the spars and sails of the passing ship with flame She was flying the French Tricolor
6368-230929-0024	train-other-500	and as our steamer went by saluting her with a couple of blasts from her steam whistle in friendly greeting the stranger vessel as a return in accordance with the time honoured rule of nautical etiquette always observed on such occasions
6368-230929-0025	train-other-500	dipped her ensign This action coupled with the similarity of the scene and its surroundings the ship in the distance with her flag half on the hoist the sunset glow and the fact of my being on board a steamer
6368-230929-0026	train-other-500	then as now brought back to my mind at once
none	none	 the incidents of that memorable evening of the past 
6368-230929-0027	train-other-500	more than seven years ago now the vraisemblance between the two being simply astounding Elsie dearest Elsie I cried with a start as the strange coincidence of the presentment struck me
6368-230929-0028	train-other-500	the date being even identical
none	none	 Do you remember what day of the month this is querida mia 
6368-230929-0029	train-other-500	Why of course Dick I do she answered nestling up to my side as if for protection for we were sitting in a warm corner by the taffrail just abaft the wheel house and screened from the observation
6368-230929-0030	train-other-500	of the rest of the passengers who were walking up and down the deck as usual after dinner Why Dick dear it s the seventh of November your birthday you know
6368-230929-0031	train-other-500	surely you have not already forgotten the little present I gave you this morning my likeness in a locket for your watch chain a miniature done by that clever artist at Orleans
6368-230929-0032	train-other-500	and you told me you would always wear it for my sake Dick my husband where is your memory No my little one
none	none	 I have not forgotten it said I kissing her 
6368-230929-0033	train-other-500	thinking she was going to cry at what she thought was forgetfulness on my part Here it is next my heart like yourself said I laughingly But Elsie alma mia
6368-230929-0034	train-other-500	I was thinking of another anniversary and a Friday evening too to make it all the more wonderful Don t you recollect now Oh Dick my dear husband she whispered
none	none	 seizing my arm and gazing out over the taffrail 
6368-230929-0035	train-other-500	at the ship all ablaze now from the reflection of the sky and nearly hull down to leeward I see I see What a strange coincidence It is really wonderful
6368-230929-0036	train-other-500	It is my darling said I But it was more extraordinary still that you should have seen me that memorable evening now more than seven years ago
none	none	 and when I too saw the Saint Pierre with you on her deck 
6368-230929-0037	train-other-500	and more wonderful still when the captain and some of the crew even
none	none	 to this day insist we were actually several hundreds of miles apart Ah but you are near me now though thank God 
6368-230929-0038	train-other-500	she cried looking up into my face with the most charming expression of delight causing me to be foolish in bestowing another little kiss on her upturned face I don t know how it was
6368-230929-0039	train-other-500	but whether the ships were as far apart as the captain and the others say or whether they were not
none	none	 I did see your ship 
6368-230929-0040	train-other-500	and you on her as I told my dear dear father at the time and he himself did not believe it Dick dear
none	none	 it must have been the gift of second sight 
6368-230929-0041	train-other-500	as the Scotch people call it There was a nun at the convent who had it and could tell so she said when anything was about to happen to any of her family though she couldn t predict events concerning persons
6368-230929-0042	train-other-500	who were not blood relations as she termed them Don t be frightened Dick
none	none	 but I do think that I must really possess 
6368-230929-0043	train-other-500	the same faculty Well if that is the case sweetheart said I there must be some psychological affinity between us and we are both endowed with the same weird gift although the possession of the same
6368-230929-0044	train-other-500	has never been brought to the knowledge of us except on that one memorable occasion That cannot be otherwise explained but the fact of the two ships meeting afterwards may very
6368-230929-0045	train-other-500	readily be accounted for under the circumstances The winds and currents of the ocean drifted them together
none	none	 like as they did us dear Don t you think so She did not answer for a moment 
6368-230929-0046	train-other-500	and as our steamer speeded on her way the glow in the sky gradually faded and darkness crept over the face of the sea the flashing light of Ushant whirling its luminous arms round in rapid rotation
6368-230929-0047	train-other-500	like some spectral windmill away in the distance over our lee where the French ship had long since disappeared Presently my Elsie who had been looking down into the now gloomy depths alongside
6368-230929-0048	train-other-500	musing over the bitter sweet memories of the past lifted her eyes to mine glancing heavenwards No Dick my dearest said she speaking at last
6368-230929-0049	train-other-500	a certain hesitation and catch in her throat and a tear in the broken intonation of her voice
none	none	 Dick I ve been thinking and and it was a power greater than that of the winds and seas that brought us together It was God THE END End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Ghost Ship by
