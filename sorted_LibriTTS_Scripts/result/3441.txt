none	none	 that Sa adan having broken into the palace of King Jamak and pounded to pieces those therein the survivors cried out Quarter Quarter and Sa adan said to them Pinion your King So they bound Jamak and took him up and Sa adan drove them before him like sheep and brought them to Gharib s presence after the most part of the citizens had perished by the enemy s swords When the King of Babel came to himself he found himself bound and heard Sa adan say I will sup to night off this King Jamak whereupon he turned to Gharib and cried to him I throw myself on thy mercy Replied Gharib Become a Moslem and thou shalt be safe from the Ghul and from the vengeance of the Living One who ceaseth not So Jamak professed Al Islam with heart and tongue and Gharib bade loose his bonds Then he expounded The Faith to his people and they all became True Believers after which Jamak returned to the city and despatched thence provaunt land henchmen to Gharib and wine to the camp before Babel where they passed the night On the morrow Gharib gave the signal for the march and they fared on till they came to Mayyafarikin FN one which they found empty for its people had heard what had befallen Babel and had fled to Cufa city and told Ajib When he heard the news his Doom day appeared to him and he assembled his braves and informing them of the enemy s approach ordered them make ready to do battle with his brother s host after which he numbered them and found them thirty thousand horse and ten thousand foot FN two So needing more he levied other fifty thousand men cavalry and infantry and taking horse amid a mighty host rode forwards till he came upon his brother s army encamped before Mosul and pitched his tents in face of their lines Then Gharib wrote a writ and said to his officers Which of you will carry this letter to Ajib Whereupon Sahim sprang to his feet and cried O King of the Age I will bear thy missive and bring thee back an answer So Gharib gave him the epistle and he repaired to the pavilion of Ajib who when informed of his coming said Admit him and when he stood in the presence asked him Whence comest thou Answered Sahim From the King of the Arabs and the Persians son in law of Chosroe King of the world who sendeth thee a writ so do thou return him a reply Quoth Ajib Give me the letter accordingly Sahim gave it to him and he tore it open and found therein In the name of Allah the Compassionating the Compassionate

none	none	As soon as this letter shall come to thy hand do thou confess the Unity of the Bountiful King Causer of causes and Mover of the clouds FN three and leave worshipping idols An thou do this thing thou art my brother and ruler over us and I will pardon thee the deaths of my father and mother nor will I reproach thee with what thou hast done 
7832_258250_000013_000010	train-clean-360	But an thou obey not my bidding behold I will hasten to thee and cut off thy head and lay waste thy dominions 
7832_258250_000013_000011	train-clean-360	Verily I give thee good counsel and the Peace be on those who pace the path of salvation and obey the Most High King When Ajib read these words and knew the threat they contained his eyes sank into the crown of his head and he gnashed his teeth and flew into a furious rage 
none	none	Then he tore the letter in pieces and threw it away which vexed Sahim and he cried out upon Ajib saying Allah wither thy hand for the deed thou hast done With this Ajib cried out to his men saying Seize yonder hound and hew him in pieces with your hangers FN four So they ran at Sahim but he bared blade and fell upon them and slew of them more than fifty braves after which he cut his way out though bathed in blood and won back to Gharib who said What is this case O Sahim And he told him what had passed whereat he grew livid for rage and crying Allaho Akbar God is most great bade the battle drums beat So the fighting men donned their hauberks and coats of straitwoven mail and baldrick d themselves with their swords the footmen drew out in battle array whilst the horsemen mounted their prancing horses and dancing camels and levelled their long lances and the champions rushed into the field 
7832_258250_000013_000014	train-clean-360	Ajib and his men also took horse and host charged down upon host

7832_258250_000015_000001	train-clean-360	Then ruled the Kazi of Battle in whose ordinance is no wrong for a seal is on his lips and he speaketh not and the blood railed in rills and purfled earth with curious embroidery heads grew gray and hotter waxed battle and fiercer 
none	none	Feet slipped and stood firm the valiant and pushed forwards whilst turned the faint heart and fled nor did they leave fighting till the day darkened and the night starkened Then clashed the cymbals of retreat and the two hosts drew apart each from other and returned to their tents where they righted Next morning as soon as it was day the cymbals beat to battle and derring do and the warriors donned their harness of fight and baldrick d FN five their blades the brightest bright and with the brown lance bedight mounted doughty steed every knight and cried out saying This day no flight And the two hosts drew out in battle array like the surging sea The first to open the chapter FN six of war was Sahim who crave his destrier between the two lines and played with swords and spears and turned over all the Capitula of combat till men of choicest wits were confounded Then he cried out saying Who is for fighting 
7832_258250_000015_000005	train-clean-360	Who is for jousting 
7832_258250_000017_000005	train-clean-360	Who is for jousting 
7832_258250_000015_000006	train-clean-360	Let no sluggard come out nor weakling Whereupon there rushed at him a horseman of the Kafirs as he were a flame of fire but Sahim let him not stand long before him ere he overthrew him with a thrust 
7832_258250_000015_000007	train-clean-360	Then a second came forth and he slew him also and a third and he tare him in twain and a fourth and he did him to death nor did they cease sallying out to him and he left not slaying them till it was noon by which time he had laid low two hundred braves 
7832_258250_000015_000008	train-clean-360	Then Ajib cried to his men Charge once more and sturdy host on sturdy host down bore and great was the clash of arms and battle roar 
none	none	The shining swords out rang the blood in streams ran and footman rushed upon footman Death showed in van and horse hoof was shodden with skull of man nor did they cease from sore smiting till waned the day and the night came on in black array when they drew apart and returning to their tents passed the night there As soon as morning morrowed the two hosts mounted and sought the field of fight and the Moslems looked for Gharib to back steed and ride under the standards as was his wont but he came not So Sahim sent to his brother s pavilion a slave who finding him not asked the tent pitchers FN seven but they answered We know naught of him Whereat he was greatly concerned and went forth and told the troops who refrained from battle saying An Gharib be absent his foe will destroy us Now there was for Gharib s absence a cause strange but true which we will set out in order due 
7832_258250_000015_000012	train-clean-360	And it was thus 
none	none	When Ajib returned to his camp on the preceding Night he called one of his guardsmen by name Sayyar and said to him O Sayyar I have not treasured thee save for a day like this and now I bid thee enter among Gharib s host and pushing into the marquee of their lord bring him hither to me and prove how wily thy cunning be And Sayyar said I hear and I obey So he repaired to the enemy s camp and stealing into Gharib s pavilion under the darkness of the Night when all the men had gone to their places of rest stood up as though he were a slave to serve Gharib who present being athirst called to him for water So he brought him a pitcher of water drugged with Bhang and Gharib could not fulfill his need ere he fell down with head distancing heels whereupon Sayyar wrapped him in his cloak and carrying him to Ajib s tent threw him down at his feet Quoth Ajib O Sayyar what is this Quoth he This be thy brother Gharib whereat Ajib rejoiced and said The blessings of the Idols light upon thee Loose him and wake him So they made him sniff up vinegar and he came to himself and opened his eyes then finding himself bound and in a tent other than his own exclaimed There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah the Glorious the Great Thereupon Ajib cried out at him saying Dost thou draw on me O dog and seek to slay me and take on me thy blood wreak of thy father and thy mother I will send thee this very day to them and rid the world of thee Replied Gharib Kafir hound soon shalt thou see against whom the wheels of fate shall revolve and who shall be overthrown by the wrath of the Almighty King Who wotteth what is in hearts and Who shall leave thee in Gehenna tormented and confounded Have ruth on thyself and say with me There is no god but the God and Abraham is the Friend of God When Ajib heard Gharib s words he sparked and snorted and railed at his god the stone and called for the sworder and the leather rug of blood but his Wazir who was at heart a Moslem though outwardly a Miscreant rose and kissing ground before him said Patience O King deal not hastily but wait till we know the conquered from the conqueror 
7832_258250_000015_000019	train-clean-360	If we prove the victors we shall have power to him and if we be beaten his being alive in our hands will be a strength to us And the Emirs said The Minister speaketh sooth 
7832_258250_000015_000020	train-clean-360	 And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say 
7832_258250_000016_000000	train-clean-360	When it was the Six Hundred and Thirty ninth Night 
none	none	She continued It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Ajib purposed to slay Gharib the Wazir rose and said Deal not hastily for we have always power to kill him So Ajib bade lay his brother Gharib in irons and chain him up in his own tent and set a thousand stout warriors to guard him Meanwhile Gharib s host when they awoke that morning and found not their King were as sheep sans a shepherd but Sa adan the Ghul cried out at them saying O folk don your war gear and trust to your Lord to defend you So Arabs and Ajams mounted horse after clothing themselves in hauberks of iron and skirting themselves in straight knit mail and sallied forth to the field the Chiefs and the colours moving in van 
7832_258250_000017_000002	train-clean-360	Then dashed out the Ghul of the Mountain with a club on his shoulder two hundred pounds in weight and wheeled and careered saying Ho worshippers of idols come ye out and renown it this day for tis a day of onslaught 
7832_258250_000017_000003	train-clean-360	Whoso knoweth me hath enough of my mischief and whoso knoweth me not I will make myself known to him 
none	none	I am Sa adan servant of King Gharib Who is for jousting 
7832_258250_000017_000006	train-clean-360	Who is for fighting Let no faintheart come forth to me to day nor weakling And there rushed upon him a Champion of the Infidels as he were a flame of fire and drove at him but Sa adan charged home at him and dealt him with his club a blow which broke his ribs and cast him lifeless to the earth 
none	none	Then he called out to his sons and slaves saying Light the bonfire and whoso falleth of the Kafirs do ye dress him and roast him well in the flame then bring him to me that I may break my fast on him So they kindled a fire midmost the plain and laid thereon the slain till he was cooked when they brought him to Sa adan who gnawed his flesh and crunched his bones When the Miscreants saw the Mountain Ghul do this deed they were Frighted with sore Wright but Ajib cried out to his men saying Out on you Fall upon the Ogre and hew him in hunks with your scymitars So twenty thousand men ran at Sa adan whilst the footmen circled round him and rained upon him darts and shafts so that he was wounded in four and twenty places and his blood ran down upon the earth and he was alone Then the host of the Moslems crave at the heathenry calling for help upon the Lord of the three Worlds and they ceased not from fight and fray till the day came to an end when they drew apart But the Infidels had captured Sa adan as he vere a drunken man for loss of blood and they bound him fast and set him by Gharib who seeing the Ghul a prisoner said There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah the Glorious the Great O Sa adan what case is this O my lord replied Sa adan it is Allah extolled and exalted be He who ordaineth joy and annoy and there is no help but this and that betide And Gharib rejoined Thou speakest sooth O Sa adan But Ajib passed the night in joy and he said to his men Mount ye on the morrow and fall upon the Moslems so shall not one of them be left alive And they replied Hearkening and obedience This is how it fared with them but as regards the Moslems they passed the Night dejected and weeping for their King and Sa adan but Sahim said to them O folk be not concerned for the aidance of Almighty Allah is nigh Then he waited till midnight when he assumed the garb of a tent pitcher and repairing to Ajib s camp made his way between the tents and pavilions till he came to the King s marquee where he saw him seated on his throne surrounded by his Princes 
7832_258250_000017_000012	train-clean-360	So he entered and going up to the candles which burnt in the tent snuffed them and sprinkled levigated henbane on the wicks after which he withdrew and waited without the marquee till the smoke of the burning henbane reached Ajib and his Princes and they fell to the ground like dead men 
none	none	Then he left them and went to the prison tent where he found Gharib and Sa adan guarded by a thousand braves who were overcome with sleep 
7832_258250_000017_000014	train-clean-360	So he cried out at the guards saying Woe to you 
none	none	Sleep not but watch your prisoners and light the cressets Presently he filled a cresses with firewood on which he strewed henbane and lighting it went round about the tent with it till the smoke entered the nostrils of the guards and they all fell asleep drowned by the drug when he entered the tent and finding Gharib and Sa adan also insensible he aroused them by making them smell and sniff at a sponge full of vinegar he had with him 
7832_258250_000017_000016	train-clean-360	Thereupon he loosed their bonds and collars and when they saw him they blessed him and rejoiced In him 
7832_258250_000017_000017	train-clean-360	After this they went forth and took all the arms of the guards and Sahim said to them Go to your own camp while he re entered Ajib s pavilion and wrapping him in his cloak lifted him up and made for the Moslem encampment 
none	none	And the Lord Compassionate protected him so that he reached Gharib s tent in safety and unrolled the cloak before him Gharib looked at its contents and seeing his brother Ajib bound cried out Allaho Akbar God is Most Great Aidance 
7832_258250_000017_000021	train-clean-360	Victory And he blessed Sahim and bade him arouse Ajib 
7832_258250_000017_000022	train-clean-360	So he made him smell the vinegar mixed with incense and he opened his eyes and finding himself bound and shackled hung down his head earth wards 
none	none	And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Six Hundred and Fortieth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that after Sahim had aroused Ajib whom he had made insensible with henbane and had brought to his brother Gharib the captive opened his eyes and feeling himself bound and shackled hung down his head earthwards Thereupon cried Sahim O Accursed lift thy head So he raised his eyes and found himself amongst Arabs and Ajamis and saw his brother seated on the throne of his estate and the place of his power wherefore he was silent and spake not Then Gharib cried out and said Strip me this hound So they stripped him and came down upon him with whips till they weakened his body and subdued his pride after which Gharib set over him a guard of an hundred knights And when this fraternal correction had been administered they heard shouts of There is no God but the God and God is Most Great from the camp of the Kafirs Now the cause of this was that ten days after his nephew King Al Damigh Gharib s uncle had set out from Al Jazirah with twenty thousand horse and on nearing the field of battle had despatched one of his scouts to get news The man was absent a whole day at the end of which time he returned and told Al Damigh all that had happened to Gharib with his brother So he waited till the Night when he fell upon the Infidels crying out Allaho Akbar and put them to the edge of the biting scymitar When Gharib heard the Takbir FN eight he said to Sahim Go find out the cause of these shouts and war cries So Sahim repaired to the field of battle and questioned the slaves and camp followers who told him that King Al Damigh had come up with twenty thousand men and had fallen upon the idolaters by Night saying By the virtue of Abraham the Friend I will not forsake my brother s son but will play a brave man s part and beat back the host of Miscreants and please the Omnipotent King So Sahim returned and told his uncle s derring do to Gharib who cried out to his men saying Don your arms and mount your steeds and let us succour my father s brother So they took horse and fell upon the Infidels and put them to the edge of the sharp sword By the morning they had killed nigh fifty thousand of the Kafirs and made other thirty thousand prisoners and the rest of Ajib s army dispersed over the length and breadth of earth Then the Moslems returned in victory and triumph and Gharib rode out to meet his uncle whom he saluted and thanked for his help Quoth Al Damigh I wonder if that dog Ajib fell in this day s affair Quoth Gharib O uncle be of good cheer and keep thine eyes cool and clear know that he is with me in chains When Al Damigh heard this he rejoiced with exceeding joy and the two kings dismounted and entered the pavilion but found no Ajib there whereupon Gharib exclaimed O glory of Abraham the Friend with whom be peace adding Alas what an ill end is this to a glorious day and he cried out to the tent pitchers saying Woe to you Where is my enemy who oweth me so much Quoth they When thou mountedst and we went with thee thou didst not bid us guard him and Gharib exclaimed There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah the Glorious the Great But Al Damigh said to him Hasten not nor be concerned for where can he go and we in pursuit of him Now the manner of Ajib s escape was in this wise His page Sayyar had been ambushed in the camp and when he saw Gharib mount and ride forth leaving none to guard his enemy Ajib he could hardly credit his eyes So he waited awhile and presently crept to the tent and taking Ajib who was senseless for the pain of the bastinado on his back made off with him into the open country and fared on at the top of his speed from early night to the next day till he came to a spring of water under an apple tree There he set down Ajib from his back and washed his face whereupon he opened his eyes and seeing Sayyar said to him O Sayyar carry me to Cufa that I may recover there and levy horsemen and soldiers wherewith to overthrow my foe and know O Sayyar that I am anhungered So Sayyar sprang up and going out to the desert caught an ostrich poult and brought it to his lord Then he gathered fuel and deftly using the fire sticks kindled a fire by which he roasted the bird which he had hallal d FN nine and fed Ajib with its flesh and gave him to drink of the water of the spring till his strength returned to hits after which he went to one of the Badawi tribal encampments and stealing thence a steed mounted Ajib upon it and journeyed on with him for many days till they drew near the city of Cufa The Viceroy of the capital came out to meet and salute the King whom he found weak with the beating his brother had inflicted upon him and Ajib entered the city and called his physicians When they answered his summons he bade them heal him in less than ten days time they said We hear and we obey and they tended him till he became whole of the sickness that was upon him and of the punishment Then he commanded his Wazirs to write letters to all his Nabobs and vassals and he indited one and twenty writs and despatched them to the governors who assembled their troops and set out for Cufa by forced marches And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Six Hundred and Forty first Night She continued It hath reached me O auspicious King that Ajib sent orders to assemble the troops who marched forthright to Cufa Meanwhile Gharib being troubled for Ajib s escape despatched in quest of him a thousand braves who dispersed on all sides and sought him a day and a Night but found no trace of him so they returned and told Gharib who called for his brother Sahim but found him not whereat he was sore concerned fearing for him from the shifts of Fortune And lo Sahim entered and kissed ground before Gharib who rose when he saw him and asked Where hast thou been O Sahim He answered O King I have been to Cufa and there I find that the dog Ajib hath made his way to his capital and is healed of his hurts eke he hath written letters to his vassals and sent them to his Nabobs who have brought him troops When Gharib heard this he gave the command to march so they struck tents and fared for Cufa When they came in sight of the city they found it compassed about with a host like the surging main having neither beginning nor end So Gharib with his troops encamped in face of the Kafirs and set up his standards and darkness fell down upon the two hosts whereupon they lighted camp fires and kept watch till daybreak Then King Gharib rose and making the Wuzu ablution prayed a two bow prayer according to the rite of our father Abraham the Friend on whom be the Peace after which he commanded the battle drums to sound the point of war Accordingly the kettle drums beat to combat and the standards fluttered whilst the fighting men armour donned and their horses mounted and themselves displayed and to plain fared Now the first to open the gate of war was King Al Damigh who urged his charger between the two opposing armies and displayed himself and played with the swords and the spears till both hosts were confounded and at him marvelled after which he cried out saying Who is for jousting Let no sluggard come out to me nor weakling for I am Al Damigh the King brother of Kundamir the King Then there rushed forth a horseman of the Kafirs as he were a flame of fire and crave at Al Damigh without word said but the King received him with a lance thrust in the breast so dour that the point issued from between his shoulders and Allah hurried his soul to the fire the abiding place dire Then came forth a second he slew and a third he slew likewise and they ceased not to come out to him and he to slay them till he had made an end of six and seventy fighting men Hereupon the Miscreants and men of might hung back and would not encounter him but Ajib cried out to his men and said Fie on you O folk if ye all go forth to him one by one he will not leave any of you sitting or standing Charge on him all at once and cleanse of them our earthly wone and strew their heads for your horses hoofs like a plain of stone So they waved the ewe striking flag and host was heaped upon host blood rained in streams upon earth and railed and the Judge of battle ruled in whose ordinance is no upright The fearless stood firm on feet in the stead of fight whilst the faint heart gave back and took to flight thinking the day would never come to an end nor the curtains of gloom would be drawn by the hand of Night and they ceased not to battle with swords and to smite till light darkened and murk starkened Then the kettle drums of the Infidels beat the retreat but Gharib refusing to stay his arms crave at the Paynimry and the Believers in Unity the Moslems followed him How many heads and hands they shore how many necks and sinews they tore how many knees and spines they mashed and how many grown men and youths they to death bashed With the first gleam of morning grey the Infidels broke and fled away in disorder and disarray and the Moslems followed them till middle day and took over twenty thousand of them whom they brought to their tents in bonds to stay Then Gharib sat down before the gate of Cufa and commanded a herald to proclaim pardon and protection for every wight who should leave the worship to idols dight and profess the unity of His All might the Creator of mankind and of light and night So was made proclamation as he bade in the streets of Cufa and all that were therein embraced the True Faith great and small then they issued forth in a body and renewed their Islam before King Gharib who rejoiced in them with exceeding joy and his breast broadened and he threw off all annoy Presently he enquired of Mardas and his daughter Mahdiyah and being told that he had taken up his abode behind the Red Mountain he called Sahim and said to him Find out for me what is become of thy father Sahim mounted steed without stay or delay and set his berry brown spear in rest and fared on in quest till he reached the Red Mountain where he sought for his father yet found no trace of him nor of his tribe however he saw in their stead an elder of the Arabs a very old man broken with excess of years and asked him of the folk and whither they were gone Replied he O my son when Mardas heard of Gharib s descent upon Cufa he feared with great fear and taking his daughter and his folk set out with his handmaids and negroes into the wild and word and I wot not whither he went So Sahim hearing the Shaykh s words returned to Gharib and told him thereof whereat he was greatly concerned Then he sat down on his father s throne and opening his treasuries distributed largesse to each and every of his braves And he took up his abode in Cufa and sent out spies to get news of Ajib He also summoned the Grandees of the realm who came and did him homage as also did the citizens and he bestowed on them sumptuous robes of honour and commended the Ryots to their care And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Six Hundred and Forty second Night She pursued It hath reached me O auspicious King that Gharib after giving robes of honour to the citizens of Cufa and com mending the Ryots to their care went out on a day of the days to hunt with an hundred horse and fared on till he came to a Wady abounding in trees and fruits and rich in rills and birds It was a pasturing place for roes and gazelles to the spirit a delight whose scents reposed from the langour of fight They encamped in the valley for the day was dear and bright and there passed the night On the morrow Gharib made the Wuzu ablution and prayed the two bow dawn prayer offering up praise and thanks to Almighty Allah when lo and behold there arose a clamour and confusion in the meadows and he bade Sahim go see what was to do So Sahim mounted forthright and rode till he espied goods being plundered and horses haltered and women carried off and children crying out Whereupon he questioned one of the shepherds saying What be all this and they replied This is the Harim of Mardas Chief of the Banu Kahtan and his good and that of his clan for yesterday Jamrkan slew Mardas and made prize of his women and children and household stuff and all the belonging of his tribe It is his wont to go a raiding and to cut off highways and waylay wayfarers and he is a furious tyrant neither Arabs nor Kings can prevail against him and he is the scourge and curse of the country Now when Sahim heard these news of his sire s slaughter and the looting of his Harim and property he returned to Gharib and told him the case wherefore fire was added to his fire and his spirit chafed to wipe out his shame and his blood wit to claim so he rode with his men after the robbers till he overtook them and fell upon them crying out and saying Almighty Allah upon the rebel the traitor the infidel and he slew in a single charge one and twenty fighting men Then he halted in mid field with no coward s heart and cried out Where is Jamrkan Let him come out to me that I may make him quaff the cup of disgrace and rid of him earth s face Hardly had he made an end of speaking when forth rushed Jamrkan as he were a calamity of calamities or a piece of a mountain cased in steel He was a mighty huge FN ten Amalekite and he crave at Gharib without speech or salute like the fierce tyrant he was And he was armed with a mace of China steel so heavy so potent that had he smitten a hill he had smashed it Now when he charged Gharib met him like a hungry lion and the brigand aimed a blow at his head with his mace but he evaded it and it smote the earth and sank therein half a cubit deep Then Gharib took his battle flail and smiting Jamrkan on the wrist crushed his fingers and the mace dropped from his grasp whereupon Gharib bent down from his seat in selle and snatching it up swiftlier than the blinding leven smote him therewith full on the flat of the ribs and he fell to the earth like a long stemmed palm tree So Sahim took him and pinioning him haled him off with a rope and Gharib s horsemen fell on those of Jamrkan and slew fifty of them the rest fled nor did they cease flying till they reached their tribal camp and raised their voices in clamour whereupon all who were in the Castle came out to meet them and asked the news They told the tribe what had passed and when they heard that their chief was a prisoner they set out for the valley vying one with other in their haste to deliver him Now when King Gharib had captured Jamrkan and had seen his braves take flight he dismounted and called for Jamrkan who humbled himself before him saying I am under thy protection O champion of the Age Replied Gharib O dog of the Arabs dost thou cut the road for the servants of Almighty Allah and fearest thou not the Lord of the Worlds O my master asked Jamrkan and who is the Lord of the Worlds O dog answered Gharib and what calamity dost thou worship He said O my lord I worship a god made of dates FN eleven kneaded with butter and honey and at times I eat him and make me another When Gharib heard this he laughed till he fell backwards and said O miserable there is none worship worth save Almighty Allah who created thee and created all things and provideth all creatures with daily bread from whom nothing is hid and He over all things is Omnipotent Quoth Jamrkan And where is this great god that I may worship him Quoth Gharib O fellow know that this god s name is Allah the God and it is He who fashioned the heavens and the earth and garred the trees to grow and the waters to flow He created wild beasts and birds and Paradise and Hell fire and veileth Himself from all eyes seeing and of none being seen He and He only is the Dweller on high Extolled be His perfection There is no god but He When Jamrkan heard these words the ears of his heart were opened his skin shuddered with horripilation and he said O my lord what shall I say that I may become of you and that this mighty Lord may accept of me Replied Gharib Say There is no god but the God and Abraham the Friend is the Apostle of God So he pronounced the profession of the Faith and was written of the people of felicity Then quoth Gharib Say me hast thou tasted the sweetness of Al Islam and quoth the other Yes whereupon Gharib cried Loose his bonds So they unbound him and he kissed ground before Gharib and his feet Now whilst this was going on behold they espied a great cloud of dust that towered till it walled the word And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Six Hundred and Forty third Night She pursued It hath reached me O auspicious King that Jamrkan islamised and kissed the ground between the hands of Gharib and as they were thus behold a great cloud of dust towered till it walled the wold and Gharib said to Sahim Go and see for us what it be So he went forth like a bird in full flight and presently returned saying O King of the Age this dust is of the Banu Amir the comrades of Jamrkan Whereupon quoth Gharib to the new Moslem Ride out to thy people and offer to them Al Islam an they profess they shall be saved but an they refuse we will put them to the sword So Jamrkan mounted and driving steed towards his tribesmen cried out to them and they knew him and dismounting came up to him on foot and said We rejoice in thy safety O our lord Said he O folk whoso obeyeth me shall be saved but whoso gainsayeth me I will cut him in twain with this scymitar And they made answer saying Command us what thou wilt for we will not oppose thy commandment Quoth he Then say with me There is no god but the God and Abraham is the Friend of God They asked O our lord whence haddest thou these words And he told them what had befallen him with Gharib adding O folk know ye not that I am your chief in battle plain and where men of cut and thrust are fain and yet a man single handed me to prisoner hath ta en and made me the cup of shame and disgrace to drain When they heard his speech they spoke the word of Unity and Jamrkan led them to Gharib at whose hands they renewed their profession of Al Islam and wished him glory and victory after they had kissed the earth before him Gharib rejoiced in them and said to them O folk return to your people and expound Al Islam to them but all replied O our lord we will never leave thee whilst we live but we will go and fetch our families and return to thee And Gharib said Go and join me at the city of Cufa So Jamrkan and his comrades returned to their tribal camp and offered Al Islam to their women and children who all to a soul embraced the True Faith after which they dismantled their abodes and struck their tents and set out for Cufa driving before them their steeds camels and sheep During this time Gharib returned to Cufa where the horsemen met him in state He entered his palace and sat down on his sire s throne with his champions ranged on either hand Then the spies came forwards and informed him that his brother Ajib had made his escape and had taken refuge with Jaland FN twelve bin Karkar lord of the city of Oman and land of Al Yaman whereupon Gharib cried aloud to his host O men make you ready to march in three days Then he expounded Al Islam to the thirty thousand men he had captured in the first affair and exhorted them to profess and take service with him Twenty thousand embraced the Faith but the rest refused and he slew them Then came forward Jamrkan and his tribe and kissed the ground before Gharib who bestowed on him a splendid robe of honour and made him captain of his vanguard saying O Jamrkan mount with the Chiefs of thy kith and kin and twenty thousand horse and fare on before us to the land of Jaland bin Karkar Hearkening and obedience answered Jamrkan and leaving the women and children of the tribe in Cufa he set forward Then Gharib passed in review the Harim of Mardas and his eye lit upon Mahdiyah who was among the women wherewith he fell down fainting They sprinkled rose water on his face till he came to himself when he embraced Mahdiyah and carried her into a sitting chamber where he sat with her and they twain lay together that night without fornication Next morning he went out and sitting down on the throne of his kingship robed his uncle Al Damigh with a robe of honour and appointed him his viceroy over all Al Irak commending Mahdiyah to his care till he should return from his expedition against Ajib and when the order was accepted he set out for the land of Al Yaman and the City of Oman with twenty thousand horse and ten thousand foot Now when Ajib and his defeated army drew in sight of Oman King Jaland saw the dust of their approach and sent to find out its meaning scouts who returned and said Verily this is the dust of one highs Ajib lord of Al Irak And Jaland wondered at his coming to his country and when assured of the tidings he said to his officers Fare ye forth and meet him So they went out and met him and pitched tents for him at the city gate and Ajib entered in to Jaland weeping eyed and heavy hearted Now Jaland s wife was the daughter of Ajib s paternal uncle and he had children by her so when he saw his kinsman in this plight he asked for the truth of what ailed him and Ajib told him all that had befallen him first and last from his brother and said O King Gharib biddeth the folk worship the Lord of the Heavens and forbiddeth them from the service of simulacres and other of the gods When Jaland heard these words he raged and revolted and said By the virtue of the Sun Lord of Life and Light I will not leave one of thy brother s folk in existence But where didst thou quit them and how many men are they Answered Ajib I left them in Cufa and they be fifty thousand horse Whereupon Jaland called his Wazir Jawamard FN thirteen saying Take thee seventy thousand horse and fare to Cufa and bring me the Moslems alive that I may torture them with all manner of tortures So Jawamard departed with his host and fared through the first day and the second till the seventh day when he came to a Wady abounding in trees and rills and fruits Here he called a halt And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Six Hundred and Forty fourth Night She pursued It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Jaland sent Jawamard with his army to Cufa they came upon a Wady abounding in trees and rills where a halt was called and they rested till the middle of the Night when the Wazir gave the signal for departure and mounting rode on before them till hard upon dawn at which time he descended into a well wooded valley whose flowers were fragrant and whose birds warbled on boughs as they swayed gracefully to and fro and Satan blew into his sides and puffed him up with pride and he improvised these couplets and cried I plunge with my braves in the seething sea Seize the foe in my strength and my valiancy And the doughtiest knights wot me well to be Friend to friend and fierce foe to mine enemy I will load Ghanb with the captive s chains Right soon and return in all Joy and glee For I ve donned my mail and my weapons wield And on all sides charge at the chivalry FN fourteen Hardly had Jawamard made an end of his verses when there came out upon him from among the trees a horseman of terrible mien covered and clad in steely sheen who cried out to him saying Stand O riff raff of the Arabs Doff thy dress and ground thine arms gear and dismount thy destrier and be off with thy life When Jawamard heard this the light in his eyes became darkest night and he drew his sabre and drove at Jamrkan for he it was saying O thief of the Arabs wilt thou cut the road for me who am captain of the host of Jaland bin Karkar and am come to bring Gharib and his men in bond When Jamrkan heard these words he said How cooling is this to my heart and liver And he made at Jawamard versifying in these couplets I m the noted knight in the field of fight Whose sabre and spear every foe affright Jamrkan am I to my foes a fear With a lance lunge known unto every knight Gharib is my lord nay my pontiff my prince Where the two hosts dash very lion of might An Imam of the Faith pious striking awe On the plain where his foes like the fawn take flight Whose voice bids folk to the faith of the Friend False doubling idols and gods despite Now Jamrkan had fared on with his tribesmen ten days journey from Cufa city and called a halt on the eleventh day till midnight when he ordered a march and rode on devancing them till he descended into the valley aforesaid and heard Jawamard reciting his verses So he crave at him as the driving of a ravening lion and smiting him with his sword clove him in twain and waited till his captains came up when he told them what had passed and said to them Take each of you five thousand men and disperse round about the Wady whilst I and the Banu Amir fall upon the enemy s van shouting Allaho Akbar God is Most Great When ye hear my slogan do ye charge them crying like me upon the Lord and smite them with the sword We hear and we obey answered they and turning back to their braves did his bidding and spread themselves about the sides of the valley in the twilight forerunning the dawn Presently lo and behold up came the army of Al Yaman like a flock of sheep filling plain and steep and Jamrkan and the Banu Amir fell upon them shouting Allaho Akbar till all heard it Moslems and Miscreants Whereupon the True Believers ambushed in the valley answered from every side and the hills and mountains responsive cried and all things replied green and dried saying God is Most Great Aidance and Victory to us from on High Shame to the Miscreants who His name deny And the Kafirs were confounded and smote one another with sabres keen whilst the True Believers and pious fell upon them like flames of fiery sheen and naught was seen but heads flying and blood jetting and faint hearts hieing By the time they could see one another s faces two thirds of the Infidels had perished and Allah hastened their souls to the fire and abiding place dire The rest fled and to the deserts sped whilst the Moslems pursued them to slay and take captives till middle day when they returned in triumph with seven thousand prisoners and but six and twenty thousand of the Infidels escaped and the most of them wounded Then the Moslems collected the horses and arms the loads and tents of the enemy and despatched them to Cufa with an escort of a thousand horse And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Six Hundred and Forty fifth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that Jamrkan in his battle with Jawamard slew him and slew his men and after taking many prisoners and much money and many horses and loads sent them with an escort of a thousand riders to Cufa city Then he and the army of Al Islam dismounted and expounded The saving Faith to the prisoners who made profession with heart and tongue whereupon they released them from bonds and embraced them and rejoiced in them Then Jamrkan made his troops who had swelled to a mighty many rest a day and a night and marched with the dawn intending to attack Jaland bin Karkar in the city Of Oman whilst the thousand horse fared back to Cufa with the loot When they reached the city they went in to King Gharib and told him what had passed whereat he rejoiced and gave them joy and turning to the Ghul of the Mountain said Take horse with twenty thousand and follow Jamrkan So Sa adan and his sons mounted and set out amid twenty thousand horse for Oman Meanwhile the fugitives of the defeated Kafirs reached Oman and went in to Jaland weeping and crying Woe and Ruin whereat he was confounded and said to them What calamity hath befallen you So they told him what had happened and he said Woe to you How many men were they They replied O King there were twenty standards under each a thousand men When Jaland heard these words he said May the sun pour no blessing on you Fie upon you What shall twenty thousand overcome you and you seventy thousand horse and Jawamard able to withstand three thousand in field of fight Then in the excess of his rage and mortification he bared his blade and cried out to those who were present saying Fall on them So the courtiers drew their swords upon the fugitives and annihilated them to the last man and cast them to the dogs Then Jaland cried aloud to his son saying Take an hundred thousand horse and go to Al Irak and lay it waste altogether Now this son s name was Kurajan and there was no doughtier knight in all the force for he could charge single handed three thousand riders So he and his host made haste to equip themselves and marched in battle array rank following rank with the Prince at their head glorying in himself and improvising these couplets I m Al Kurajan and my name is known To beat all who in wold or in city wone How many a soldier my sword at will Struck down like a cow on the ground bestrown How many a soldier I ve forced to fly And have rolled their heads as a ball is thrown Now I ll drive and harry the land Irak FN fifteen And like rain I ll shower the blood of fone And lay hands on Ghanb and his men whose doom To the wise a warning shall soon be shown The host fared on twelve days journey and while they were still marching behold a great dust cloud arose before them and walled the horizon and the whole region So Kurajan sent out scouts saying Go forth and bring me tidings of what meaneth this dust They went till they passed under the enemy s standards and presently returning said O King verily this is the dust of the Moslems Whereat he was glad and said Did ye count them And they answered We counted the colours and they numbered twenty Quoth he By my faith I will not send one man at arms against them but will go forth to them alone by myself and strew their heads under the horses hooves Now this was the army of Jamrkan who espying the host of the Kafirs and seeing them as a surging sea called a halt so his troops pitched the tents and set up the standards calling upon the name of the All wise One the Creator of light and gloom Lord of all creatures Who seeth while Him none see the High to infinity extolled and exalted be He There is no God but He The Miscreants also halted and pitched their tents and Kurajan said to them Keep on your arms and in armour sleep for during the last watch of the night we will mount and trample yonder handful under feet Now one of Jamrkan s spies was standing nigh and heard what Kurajan had contrived so he returned to the host and told his chief who said to them Arm yourselves and as soon as it is Night bring me all the mules and camels and hang all the bells and clinkets and rattles ye have about their necks Now they had with them more than twenty thousand camels and mules So they waited till the Infidels fell asleep when Jamrkan com mended them to mount and they rose to ride and on the Lord of the Worlds they relied Then said Jamrkan Drive the camels and mules to the Miscreants camp and push them with your spears for goads They did as he bade and the beasts rushed upon the enemy s tents whilst the bells and clinkets and rattles jangled FN sixteen and the Moslems followed at their heels shouting God is Most Great till all the hills and mountains resounded with the name of the Highmost Deity to whom belong glory and majesty The cattle hearing this terrible din took fright and rushed upon the tents and trampled the folk as they lay asleep And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Six Hundred and Forty sixth Night She continued It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Jamrkan fell upon them with his men and steeds and camels and the camp lay sleeping the idolaters started up in confusion and snatching up their arms fell upon one another with smiting till the most part was slaughtered And when the day broke they looked and found no Moslem slain but saw them all on horseback armed and armoured wherefore they knew that this was a sleight which had been played upon them and Kurajan cried out to the remnant of his folk O sons of whores what we had a mind to do with them that have they done with us and their craft hath gotten the better of our cunning And they were about to charge when lo and behold a cloud of dust rose high and walled the horizon sky when the wind smote it so that it spired aloft and spread pavilion wise in the lift and there it hung and presently appeared beneath it the glint of helmet and gleam of hauberk and splendid warriors baldrick d with their tempered swords and holding in rest their supple spears When the Kafirs saw this they held back from the battle and each army sent out to know the meaning of this dust scouts who returned with the news that it was an army of Moslems Now this was the host of the Mountain Ghul whom Gharib had despatched to Jamrkan s aid and Sa adan himself rode in their van So the two hosts of the True Believers joined company and rushing upon the Paynimry like a flame of fire plied them with keen sword and Rudaynian spear and quivering lance what while day was darkened and eyes for the much dust starkened The valiant stood fast and the faint hearted coward fled and to the wilds and the words swift sped whilst the blood over earth was like torrents shed nor did they cease from fight till the day took flight and in gloom came the night Then the Moslems drew apart from the Miscreants and returned to their tents where they ate and slept till the darkness fled away and gave place to smiling day when they prayed the dawn prayer and mounted to battle Now Kurajan had said to his men as they drew off from fight for indeed two thirds of their number had perished by sword and spear O folk to morrow I will champion it in the stead of war where cut and thrust jar and where braves push and wheel I will take the field So as soon as light was seen and morn appeared with its shine and sheen took horse the hosts twain and shouted their slogans amain and bared the brand and hent lance in hand and in ranks took stand The first to open the door of war was Kurajan who cried out saying Let no coward come out to me this day nor craven Whereupon Jamrkan and Sa adan stood by the colours but there ran at him a captain of the Banu Amir and the two crave each at other awhile like two rams butting Presently Kurajan seized the Moslem by the jerkin under his hauberk and dragging him from his saddle dashed him to the ground where he left him upon which the Kafirs laid hands on him and bound him and bore him off to their tents whilst Kurajan wheeled about and careered and offered battle till another captain came out whom also he took prisoner nor did he leave to do thus till he had made prize of seven captains before mid day Then Jamrkan cried out with so mighty a cry that the whole field made reply and heard it the armies twain and ran at Kurajan with a heart in rageful pain improvising these couplets Jamrkan am I and a man of might Whom the warriors fear with a sore affright I waste the forts and I leave the walls To wail and weep for the wights I smite Then O Kurajan tread the rightful road And quit the paths of thy foul upright Own the One True God who dispread the skies And made founts to flow and the hills pegged tight An the slave embrace the True Faith he ll scape Hell pains and in Heaven be decks and dight When Kurajan heard these words he sparked and snorted and foully abused the sun and the moon and crave at Jamrkan versifying with these couplets I m Kurajan of this age the knight And my shade to the lions of Shara FN seventeen is blight I storm the forts and snare kings of beasts And warriors fear me in field of fight Then Harkye Jamrkan if thou doubt my word Come forth to the combat and try my might When Jamrkan heard these verses he charged him with a stout heart d they smote each at other with swords till the two hosts lamented for them and they lunged with lance and great was the clamour between them nor did they leave fighting till the time of mid afternoon prayer was passed and the day began to wane Then Jamrkan crave at Kurajan and smiting him on the breast with his mace FN eighteen cast him to the ground as he were the trunk of a palm tree and the Moslems pinioned him and dragged him off with ropes like a camel Now when the Miscreants saw their Prince captive a hot fever fit of ignorance seized on them and they bore down upon the True Believers thinking to rescue him but the Moslem champions met them and left most of them prostrate on the earth whilst the rest turned and sought safety in flight seeking surer site while the clanking sabres their back sides smite The Moslems ceased not pursuing them till they had scattered them over mount and word when they returned from them to the spoil whereof was great store of horses and tents and so forth good look to it for a spoil Then Jamrkan went in to Kurajan and expounded to him Al Islam threatening him with death unless he embraced the Faith But he refused so they cut off his head and stuck it on a spear after which they fared on towards Oman FN nineteen city But as regards the Kafirs the survivors returned to Jaland and made known to him the slaying of his son and the slaughter of his host hearing which he cast his crown to the ground and buffeting his face till the blood ran from his nostrils fell fainting to the floor They sprinkled rose water on his head till he came to himself and cried to his Wazir Write letters to all my Governors and Nabobs and bid them leave not a smiter with the sword nor a lunger with the lance nor a bender of the bow but bring them all to me in one body So he wrote letters and despatched them by runners to the Governors who levied their power and joined the King with a prevailing host whose number was one hundred and eighty thousand men Then they made ready tents and camels and noble steeds and were about to march when behold up came Jamrkan and Sa adan the Ghul with seventy thousand horse as they were lions fierce faced all steel encased When Jaland saw the Moslems trooping on he rejoiced and said By the virtue of the Sun and her resplendent light I will not leave alive one of my foes no not one to carry the news and I will lay waste the land of Al Irak that I may take my wreak for my son the havoc making champion bold nor shall my fire be quenched or cooled Then he turned to Ajib and said to him O dog of Al Irak twas thou broughtest this calamity on us But by the virtue of that which I worship except I avenge me of mine enemy I will do thee die after foulest fashion When Ajib heard these words he was troubled with sore trouble and blamed himself but he waited till nightfall when the Moslems had pitched their tents for rest Now he had been degraded and expelled the royal camp together with those who were left to him of his suite so he said to them O my kinsmen know that Jaland and I are dismayed with exceeding dismay at the coming of the Moslems and I know that he will not avail to protect me from my brother nor from any other so it is my counsel that we make our escape whilst all eyes sleep and flee to King Ya arub bin Kahtan FN twenty for that he hath more of men and is stronger of reign They hearing his advice exclaimed Right is thy rede whereupon he bade them kindle fires at their tent doors and march under cover of the night They did his bidding and set out so by daybreak they had already fared far away As soon as it was morning Jaland mounted with two hundred and sixty thousand fighting men clad cap a pie in hauberks and cuirasses and strait knit mail coats the kettle drums beat a point of war and all drew out for cut and thrust and fight and fray Then Jamrkan and Sa adan rode out with forty thousand stalwart fighting men under each standard a thousand cavaliers doughty champions foremost in champaign The two hosts drew out in battles and bared their blades and levelled their limber lances for the drinking of the cup of death The first to open the gate of strife was Sa adan as he were a mountain of syenite or a Marid of the Jinn Then dashed out to him a champion of the Infidels and the Ghul slew him and casting him to the earth cried out to his sons and slaves saying Light the fire and roast me this dead one They did as he bade and brought him the roast and he ate it and crunched whilst the Kafirs stood looking on from afar and they cried out Oh for aid from the light giving Sun and were affrighted at the thought of being slain by Sa adan Then Jaland shouted to his men saying Slay me yonder loathsome beast Whereupon another captain of his host drove at the Ghul but he slew him and he ceased not to slay horseman after horseman till he had made an end of thirty men With this the blamed Kafirs held back and feared to face him crying Who shall cope with Jinns and Ghuls But Jaland raised his voice saying Let an hundred horse charge him and bring him to me bound or slain So an hundred horse set upon Sa adan with swords and spears and he met them with a heart firmer than flint proclaiming the unity of the Requiting King whom no one thing diverteth from other thing Then he cried aloud Allaho Akbar and smiting them with his sword made their heads fly and in one onset he slew of them four and seventy whereupon the rest took to flight So Jaland shouted aloud to ten of his captains each commanding a thousand men and said to them Shoot his horse with arrows till it fall under him and then lay hands on him Therewith ten thousand horse drove at Sa adan who met them with a stout heart and Jamrkan seeing this bore down upon the Miscreants with his Moslems crying out God is Most Great Before they could reach the Ghul the enemy had slain his steed and taken him prisoner but they ceased not to charge the Infidels till the day grew dark for dust and eyes were blinded and the sharp sword clanged while firm stood the valiant cavalier and destruction overtook the faint heart in his fear till the Moslems were amongst the Paynims like a white patch on a black bull And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Six Hundred and Forty seventh Night She pursued It hath reached me O auspicious King that battle raged between the Moslems and the Paynims till the True Believers were like a white patch on a black bull Nor did they stint from the mellay till the darkness fell down when they drew apart after there had been slain of the Infidels men without compt Then Jamrkan and his men returned to their tents but they were in great grief for Sa adan so that neither meat nor sleep was sweet to them and they counted their host and found that less than a thousand had been slain But Jamrkan said O folk to morrow I will go forth into the battle plain and place where cut and thrust obtain and slay their champions and make prize of their families after taking them captives and I will ransom Sa adan therewith by the leave of the Requiting King whom no one thing diverteth from other thing Wherefore their hearts were heartened and they joyed as they separated to their tents Meanwhile Jaland entered his pavilion and sitting down on his sofa of estate with his folk about him called for Sa adan and forthright on his coming said to him O dog run wood and least of the Arab brood and carrier of firewood who was it slew my son Kurajan the brave of the age slayer of heroes and caster down of warriors Quoth the Ghul Jamrkan slew him captain of the armies of King Gharib Prince of cavaliers and I roasted and ate him for I was anhungered When Jaland heard these words his eyes sank into his head for rage and he bade his swordbearer smite Sa adan s neck So he came forward in that intent whereupon Sa adan stretched himself mightily and bursting his bonds snatched the sword from the headsman and hewed off his head Then he made at Jaland who threw himself down from the throne and fled whilst Sa adan fell on the bystanders and killed twenty of the King s chief officers and all the rest took to flight Therewith loud rose the crying in the camp of the Infidels and the Ghul sallied forth of the pavilion and falling upon the troops smote them with the sword right and left till they opened and left a lane for him to pass nor did he cease to press forward cutting at them on either side till he won free of the Miscreants tents and made for the Moslem camp Now these had heard the uproar among their enemies and said Haply some calamity hath befallen them But whilst they were in perplexity behold Sa adan stood amongst them and they rejoiced at his coming with exceeding joy more especially Jamrkan who saluted him with the salam as did other True Believers and gave him joy of his escape Such was the case with the Moslems but as regards the Miscreants when after the Ghul s departure they and their King returned to their tents Jaland said to them Ofolk by the virtue of the Sun s light giving ray and by the darkness of the Night and the light of the Day and the Stars that stray I thought not this day to have escaped death in mellay for had I fallen into yonder fellow s hands he had eaten me as I were a kernel of wheat or a barley corn or any other grain They re plied O King never saw we any do the like of this Ghul And he said O folk to morrow do ye all don arms and mount steed and trample them under your horses hooves Meanwhile the Moslems had ended their rejoicings at Sa adan s return and Jamrkan said to them To morrow I will show you my derring do and what behoveth the like of me for by the virtue of Abraham the Friend I will slay them with the foulest of slaughters and smite them with the bite of the sword till all who have under standing confounded at them shall stand But I mean to attack both right and left wings so when ye see me drive at the King under the standards do ye charge behind me with a resolute charge and Allah s it is to decree what thing shall be Accord ingly the two sides lay upon their arms till the day broke through night and the sun appeared to sight Then they mounted swiftlier than the twinkling of the eyelid the raven of the wold croaked and the two hosts looking each at other with the eye of fascina tion formed in line array and prepared for fight and fray The first to open the chapter of war was Jamrkan who wheeled and careered and offered fight in field and Jaland and his men were about to charge when behold a cloud of dust uprolled till it walled the wold and overlaid the day Then the four winds smote it and away it floated torn to rags and there appeared beneath it cavaliers with helms black and garb white and many a princely knight and lances that bite and swords that smite and footmen who lion like knew no affright Seeing this both armies left fighting and sent out scouts to reconnoitre and report who thus had come in main and might So they went and within the dust cloud disappeared from sight and returned after awhile with the news aright that the approaching host was one of Moslems under the command of King Gharib When the True Believers heard from the scouts of the coming of their King they rejoiced and driving out to meet him dismounted and kissed the earth between his hands And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Six Hundred and Forty eighth Night She pursued It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the Moslems saw the presence of their King Gharib they joyed with exceeding joy and kissing the earth between his hands saluted him and get around him whilst he welcomed them and rejoiced in their safety Then they escorted him to their camp and pitched pavilions for him and set up standards and Gharib sat down on his couch of estate with his Grandees about him and they related to him all that had befallen especially to Sa adan Meanwhile the Kafirs sought for Ajib and finding him not among them nor in their tents told Jaland of his flight whereat his Doomsday rose and he bit his fingers saying by the Sun s light giving round he is a perfidious hound and hath fled with his rascal rout to desert ground But naught save force of hard fighting will serve us to repel these foes so fortify your resolves and hearten your hearts and beware of the Moslems And Gharib also said to the True Believers Strengthen your courage and fortify your hearts and seek aid of your Lord beseeching him to vouchsafe you the victory over your enemies They replied O King soon thou shalt see what we will do in battle plain where men cut and thrust amain So the two hosts slept till the day arose with its sheen and shone and the rising sun rained light upon hill and down when Gharib prayed the two bow prayer after the rite of Abraham the Friend on whom be the Peace and wrote a letter which he despatched by his brother Sahim to the King of the Kafirs When Sahim reached the enemies camp the guards asked him what he wanted and he answered them I want your ruler FN twenty one Quoth they Wait till we consult him anent thee and he waited whilst they went in to their Sovran and told him of the coming of a messenger and he cried Hither with him to me So they brought Sahim before Jaland who said to him Who hath sent thee Quoth he King Gharib sends me whom Allah hath made ruler over Arab and Ajam receive his letter and return its reply Jaland took the writ and opening it read as follows In the name of Allah the Compassionating the Compassionate the One the All knowing the supremely Great the Immemorial the Lord of Noah and Salih and Hud and Abraham and of all things He made The Peace be on him who followeth in the way of righteousness and who feareth the issues of frowardness who obeyeth the Almighty King and followeth the Faith saving and preferreth the next world to any present thing But afterwards O Jaland none is worthy of worship save Allah alone the Victorious the One Creator of night and day and the sphere revolving alway Who sendeth the holy Prophets and garreth the streams to flow and the trees to grow who vaulted the heavens and spread out the earth like a carpet below Who feedeth the birds in their nests and the wild beasts in the deserts for He is Allah the All powerful the Forgiving the Long suffering the Protector whom eye comprehendeth on no wise and who maketh night on day arise He who sent down the Apostles and their Holy Writ Know O Jaland that there is no faith but the Faith of Abraham the Friend so cleave to the Creed of Salvation and be saved from the biting glaive and the Fire which followeth the grave But an thou refuse Al Islam look for ruin to haste and thy reign to be waste and thy traces untraced And lastly send me the dog Ajib hight that I may take from him my father s and mother s blood wit When Jaland had read this letter he said to Sahim Tell thy lord that Ajib hath fled he and his folk and I know not whither he is gone but as for Jaland he will not forswear his faith and to morrow there shall be battle between us and the Sun shall give us the victory So Sahim returned to his brother with this reply and when the morning morrowed the Moslems donned their arms and armour and bestrode their stout steeds calling aloud on the name of the All conquering King Creator of bodies and souls and magnifying Him with Allaho Akbar Then the kettle drums of battle beat until earth trembled and sought the field all the lordly warriors and doughty champions The first to open the gate of battle was Jamrkan who crave his charger into mid plain and played with sword and javelin till the understanding was amazed after which he cried out saying Ho who is for tilting Ho who is for fighting Let no sluggard come out to me to day nor weakling I am the slayer of Kurajan bin Jaland who will come forth to avenge him When Jaland heard the name of his son he cried out to his men O whore sons bring me yonder horseman who slew my son that I may eat his flesh and drink his blood So an hundred fighting men charged at Jamrkan but he slew the most part of them and put their chief to flight which feat when Jaland saw he cried out to his folk At him all at once and assault him with one assault Accordingly they waved the awe striking banners and host was heaped on host Gharib rushed on with his men and Jamrkan did the same and the two sides met like two seas together clashing The Yamani sword and spear wrought havoc and breasts and bellies were rent whilst both armies saw the Angel of Death face to face and the dust of the battle rose to the skirts of the sky Ears went deaf and tongues went dumb and doom from every side came on whilst valiant stood fast and faint heart fled and they ceased not from fight and fray till ended the day when the drums beat the retreat and the two hosts drew apart and returned each to its tents And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Six Hundred and Forty ninth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when King Gharib ended the battle and the two hosts drew apart and each had returned to his own tents he sat down on the throne of his realm and the place of his reign whilst his chief officers ranged themselves about him and he said I am sore concerned for the flight of the cur Ajib and I know not whither he has gone Except I overtake him and take my wreak of him I shall die of despite Whereupon Sahim came forward and kissing the earth before him said O King I will go to the army of the Kafirs and find out what is come of the perfidious dog Ajib Quoth Gharib Go and learn the truth anent the hog So Sahim disguised himself in the habit of the Infidels and became as he were of them then making for the enemy s camp he found them all asleep drunken with war and battle and none were on wake save only the guards He passed on and presently came to the King s pavilion where he found King Jaland asleep unattended so he crept up and made him smell and sniff up levigated Bhang and he became as one dead Then Sahim went out and took a male mule and wrapping the King in the coverlet of his bed laid him on its back after which he threw a mat over him and led the beast to the Moslem camp Now when he came to Gharib s pavilion and would have entered the guards knew him not and prevented him saying Who art thou He laughed and uncovered his face and they knew him and admitted him When Gharib saw him he said What bearest there O Sahim and he replied O King this is Jaland bin Karkar Then he uncovered him and Gharib knew him and said Arouse him O Sahim So he made him smell vinegar FN twenty two and frankincense and he cast the Bhang from his nostrils and opening his eyes found himself among the Moslems whereupon quoth he What is this foul dream and closing his eyelids again would have slept but Sahim dealt him a kick saying Open thine eyes O accursed So he opened them and asked Where am I and Sahim answered Thou art in the presence of King Gharib bin Kundamir King of Irak When Jaland heard this he said O King I am under thy protection Know that I am not at fault but that who led us forth to fight thee was thy brother and the same cast enmity between us and then fled Quoth Gharib Knowest thou whither he is gone and quoth Jaland No by the light giving sun I know not whither Then Gharib bade lay him in bonds and set guards over him whilst each captain returned to his own tent and Jamrkan while wending said to his men O sons of my uncle I purpose this night to do a deed wherewith I may whiten my face with King Gharib Quoth they Do as thou wilt we hearken to thy commandment and obey it Quoth he Arm yourselves and muffling your steps while I go with you let us fare softly and disperse about the Infidels camp so that the very ants shall not be ware of you and when you hear me cry Allaho Akbar do ye the like and cry out saying God is Most Great and hold back and make for the city gate and we seek aid from the Most High So the folk armed themselves cap a pie and waited till the noon of Night when they dispersed about the enemy s camp and tarried awhile when lo and behold Jamrkan smote shield with sword and shouted Allaho Akbar Thereupon they all cried out the like till rang again valley and mountain hills sands and ruins The Miscreants awoke in dismay and fell one upon other and the sword went round amongst them the Moslems drew back and made for the city gates where they slew the warders and entering made themselves masters of the town with all that was therein of treasure and women Thus it befel with Jamrkan but as regards King Gharib hearing the noise and clamour of God is Most Great he mounted with his troops to the last man and sent on in advance Sahim who when he came near the field of fight saw that Jamrkan had fallen upon the Kafirs with the Banu Amir by night and made them drink the cup of death So he returned and told all to his brother who called down blessings on Jamrkan And the Infidels ceased not to smite one another with the biting sword and expending their strength till the day rose and lighted up the land when Gharib cried out to his men Charge O ye noble and do a deed to please the All knowing King So the True Believers fell upon the idolaters and plied upon every false hypocritical breast the keen sword and the quivering spear They sought to take refuge in the city but Jamrkan came forth upon them with his kinsmen who hemmed them in between two mountain ranges and slew an innumerable host of them and the rest fled into the wastes and words And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Six Hundred and Fiftieth Night She continued It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the Moslem host charged upon the Miscreants they hewed them in pieces with the biting scymitar and the rest fled to the wastes and words nor did the Moslems cease pursuing them with the sword till they had scattered them abroad in the plains and stony places Then they returned to Oman city and King Gharib entered the palace of the King and sitting down on the throne of his kingship with his Grandees and Of ficers ranged right and left sent for Jaland They brought him in haste and Gharib ex pounded to him Al Islam but he rejected it wherefore Gharib bade crucify him on the gate of the city and they shot at him with shafts till he was like unto a porcupine Then Gharib honourably robed Jamrkan and said to him Thou shalt be lord of this city arid ruler thereof with power to loose and to bind therein for it was thou didst open it with thy sword and thy folk And Jamrkan kissed the King s feet thanked him and wished him abiding victory and glory and every blessing Morever Gharib opened Jaland s treasuries and saw what was therein of coin whereof he gave largesse to his captains and standard bearers and fighting men yea even to the girls and children and thus he lavished his gifts ten days long After this one night he dreamt a terrible dream and awoke troubled and trembling So he aroused his brother Sahim and said to him I saw in my vision that we were in a wide valley when there pounced down on us two ravening birds of prey never in my life saw I greater than they their legs were like lances and as they swooped we were in sore fear of them Replied Sahim O King this be some great enemy so stand on thy guard against him Gharib slept not the rest of the night and when the day broke he called for his courser and mounted Quoth Sahim Whither goest thou my brother and quoth Gharib I awoke heavy at heart so I mean to ride abroad ten days and broaden my breast Said Sahim Take with thee a thousand braves but Gharib replied I will not go forth but with thee and only thee So the two brothers mounted and seeking the dales and leasows fared on from Wady to Wady and from meadow to meadow till they came to a valley abounding in streams and sweet smelling flowers and trees laden with all manner eatable fruits two of each kind Birds warbled on the branches their various strains the mocking bird trilled out her sweet notes fain and the turtle filled with her voice the plain There sang the nightingale whose chant arouses the sleeper and the merle with his note like the voice of man and the cushat and the ring dove whilst the parrot with its eloquent tongue answered the twain The valley pleased them and they ate of its fruits and drank of its waters after which they sat under the shadow of its trees till drowsiness overcame them and they slept glory be to Him who sleepeth not As they lay asleep lo two fierce Marids swooped down on them and taking each one on his shoulders towered with them high in air till they were above the clouds So Gharib and Sahim awoke and found themselves betwixt heaven and earth whereupon they looked at those who bore them and saw that they were two Marids the head of the one being as that of a dog and the head of the other as that of an ape FN twenty three with hair like horses tails and claws like lions claws and both were big as great palm trees When they espied this case they exclaimed There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah the Glorious the Great Now the cause of this was that a certain King of the Kings of the Jinn highs Mura ash had a son called Sa ik who loved a damsel of the Jinn named Najmah FN twenty four and the twain used to foregather in that Wady under the sem blance of two birds Gharib and Sahim saw them thus and deeming them birds shot at them with shafts but wounding only Sa ik whose blood flowed Najmah mourned over him then fearing lest the like calamity befal herself snatched up her lover and flew with him to his father s palace where she cast him down at the gate The warders bore him in and laid him before his sire who seeing the pile sticking in his rib exclaimed Alas my son Who hath done with thee this thing that I may lay waste his abiding place and hurry on his destruction though he were the greatest of the Kings of the Jann Thereupon Sa ik opened his eyes and said O my father none slew me save a mortal in the Valley of Springs Hardly had he made an end of these words when his soul departed whereupon his father buffeted his face till the blood streamed from his mouth and cried out to two Marids saying Hie ye to the Valley of Springs and bring me all who are therein So they betook themselves to the Wady in question where they found Gharib and Sahim asleep and snatching them up carried them to King Mura ash FN twenty five And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Six Hundred and Fifty first Night She continued It hath reached me O auspicious King that the two Marids after snatching up Gharib and Sahim in their sleep carried them to Mura ash king of the Jann whom they saw seated on the throne of his kinship as he were a huge mountain with four heads on his body FN twenty six the first that of a lion the second that of an elephant the third that of a panther and the fourth that of a lynx The Marids set them down before Mura ash and said to him O King these twain be they we found in the Valley of Springs Thereupon he looked at them with wrathful eyes and sparked and snorted and shot sparks from his nostrils so that all who stood by feared him Then said he O dogs of mankind ye have slain my son and lighted fire in my liver Quoth Gharib Who is thy son and who hath seen him Quoth Mura ash Were ye not in the Valley of Springs and did ye not see my son there in the guise of a bird and did ye not shoot at him with wooden bolts that he died Replied Gharib I know not who slew him and by the virtue of the Great God the One the Immemorial who knoweth things all and of Abraham the Friend we saw no bird neither slew we bird or beast Now when Mura ash heard Gharib swear by Allah and His greatness and by Abraham the Friend he knew him for a Moslem he himself being a worshipper of Fire not of the All powerful Sire so he cried out to his folk Bring me my Goddess FN twenty seven Accordingly they brought a brazier of gold and setting it before him kindled therein fire and cast on drugs whereupon there arose therefrom green and blue and yellow flames and the King and all who were present prostrated themselves before the brazier whilst Gharib and Sahim ceased not to attest the Unity of Allah Almighty to cry out God is Most Great and to bear witness to His Omnipotence Presently Mura ash raised his head and seeing the two Princes standing in lieu of falling down to worship said to them O dogs why do ye not prostrate yourselves Replied Gharib Out on you O ye accursed Prostration befitteth not man save to the Worshipful King who bringeth forth all creatures into beingness from nothingness and maketh water to well from the barren rockwell Him who inclineth heart of sire unto new born scion and who may not be described as sitting or standing the God of Noah and Salih and Hud and Abraham the Friend Who created Heaven and Hell and trees and fruit as well FN twenty eight for He is Allah the One the All powerful When Mura ash heard this his eyes sank into his head FN twenty nine and he cried out to his guards saying Pinion me these two dogs and sacrifice them to my Goddess So they bound them and were about to cast them into the fire when behold one of the crenelles of the palace parapet fell down upon the brazier and brake it and put out the fire which became ashes flying in air Then quoth Gharib God is Most Great He giveth aid and victory and He forsaketh those who deny Him worshipping Fire and not the Almighty King Presently quoth Mura ash Thou art a sorcerer and hast bewitched my Goddess so that this thing hath befallen her Gharib replied O madman an the fire had soul or sense it would have warded off from self all that hurteth it When Mura ash heard these words he roared and bellowed and reviled the Fire saying By my faith I will not kill you save by the fire Then he bade cast them into gaol and calling an hundred Marids made them bring much fuel and set fire thereto So they brought great plenty of wood and made a huge blaze which flamed up mightily till the morning when Mura ash mounted an elephant bearing on its back a throne of gold dubbed with jewels and the tribes of the Jinn gathered about him in their various kinds Presently they brought in Gharib and Sahim who seeing the flaming of the fire sought help of the One the All conquering Creator of night and day Him of All might whom no sight comprehendeth but who comprehendeth all sights for He is the Subtle the All knowing And they ceased not humbly beseeching Him till behold a cloud arose from West to East and pouring down showers of rain like the swollen sea quenched the fire When the King saw this he was affrighted he and his troops and entered the palace where he turned to the Wazirs and Grandees and said to them How say ye of these two men They replied O King had they not been in the right this thing had not befallen the fire wherefore we say that they be true men which speak sooth Rejoined Mura ash Verily the Truth hath been displayed to me ay and the manifest way and I am certified that the worship of the fire is false for were it goddess it had warded off from itself the rain which quenched it and the stone which broke its brazier and beat it into ashes Wherefore I believe in Him Who created the fire and the light and the shade and the heat And ye what say ye They answered O King we also hear and follow and obey So the King called for Gharib and embraced him and kissed him between the eyes and then summoned Sahim whereupon the bystanders all crowded to kiss their hands and heads And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Six Hundred and Fifth second Night She pursued It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Mura ash and his men found salvation in the Saving Faith Al Islam he called for Gharib and Sahim and kissed them between the eyes and so did all the Grandees who crowded to buss their hands and heads Then Mura ash sat down on the throne of his kingship and seating Gharib on his right and Sahim on his left hand said to them O mortals what shall we say that we may become Moslems Replied Gharib Say There is no god but the God and Abraham is the Friend of God So the King and his folk professed Al Islam with heart and tongue and Gharib abode with them awhile teaching them the ritual of prayer But presently he called to mind his people and sighed whereupon quoth Mura ash Verily trouble is gone and joy and gladness are come Quoth Gharib O King I have many foes and I fear for my folk from them Then he related to him his history with his brother Ajib from first to last and the King of the Jinns said O King of men I will send one who shall bring thee news of thy people for I will not let thee go till I have had my fill of thy face Then he called two doughty Marids by name Kaylajan and Kurajan and after they had done him homage he bade them repair to Al Yaman and bring him news of Gharib s army They replied To hear is to obey and departed Thus far concerning the brothers but as regards the Moslems they arose in the morning and led by their captains rode to King Gharib s palace to do their service to him but the eunuchs told them that the King had mounted with his brother and had ridden forth at peep o day So they made for the valleys and mountains and followed the track of the Princes till they came to the Valley of Springs where they found their arms cast down and their two gallant steeds grazing and said The King is missing from this place by the glory of Abraham the Friend Then they mounted and sought in the valley and the mountains three days but found no trace of them whereupon they began the mourning ceremonies and send ing for couriers said to them Do ye disperse yourselves about the cities and sconces and castles and seek ye news of our King Harkening and obedience cried the couriers who dispersed hither and thither each over one of the Seven Climes and sought everywhere for Gharib but found no trace of him Now when the tidings came to Ajib by his spies that his brother was lost and there was no news of the missing he rejoiced and going in to King Ya arub bin Kahtan sought of him aid which he granted and gave him two hundred thousand Amalekites wherewith he set out for Al Yaman and sat down before the city of Oman Jamrkan and Sa adan sallied forth and offered him battle and there were slain of the Moslems much folk so the True Believers retired into the city and shut the gates and manned the walls At this moment came up the two Marids Kaylajan and Kurajan and seeing the Moslem beleaguered waited till nightfall when they fell upon the miscreants and plied them with sharp swords of the swords of the Jinn each twelve cubits long if a man smote therewith a rock verily he would cleave it in sunder They charged the Idolaters shouting Allaho Akbar God is Most Great He giveth aid and victory and forsaketh those who deny the Faith of Abraham the Friend and whilst they raged amongst the foes fire issued from their mouths and nostrils and they made great slaughter amongst them Thereupon the Infidels ran out of their tents offering battle but seeing these strange things were confounded and their hair stood on end and their reason fled So they snatched up their arms and fell one upon other whilst the Marids shore off their heads as a reaper eareth grain crying God is Most Great We are the lads of King Gharib the friend of Mura ash King of the Jinn The sword ceased not to go round amongst them till the night was half spent when the Misbelievers imagining that the mountains were all Ifrits loaded their tents and treasure and baggage upon camels and made off and the first to fly was Ajib And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Six Hundred and Fifty third Night She resumed It hath reached me O auspicious King that the Misbelievers made off and the first to fly was Ajib Thereupon the Moslems gathered together marvelling at this that had betided the Infidels and fearing the tribesmen of the Jinn But the Marids ceased not from pursuit till they had driven them far away into the hills and words and but fifty thousand Rebels FN thirty of two hundred thousand escaped with their lives and made for their own land wounded and sore discomforted Then the two Jinns returned and said to them O host of the Moslems your lord King Gharib and his brother Sahim salute you they are the guests of Mura ash King of the Jann and will be with you anon When Gharib s men heard that he was safe and well they joyed with exceeding joy and said to the Marids Allah gladden you twain with good news O noble spirits So Kurajan and Kaylajan returned to Mura ash and Gharib and acquainted them with that which had happened whereat Gharib finding the two sitting together felt heart at ease and said Allah abundantly requite you Then quoth King Mura ash O my brother I am minded to show thee our country and the city of Japhet FN thirty one son of Noah on whom be peace Quoth Gharib O King do what seemeth good to thee So he called for three noble steeds and mounting he and Gharib and Sahim set out with a thousand Marids as they were a piece of a mountain cloven lengthwise They fared on solacing themselves with the sight of valleys and mountains till they came to Jabarsa FN thirty two the city of Japhet son of Noah on whom be peace where the townsfolk all great and small came forth to meet King Mura ash and brought them into the city in great state Then Mura ash went up to the palace of Japhet son of Noah and sat down on the throne of his kingship which was of alabaster ten stages high and latticed with wands of gold wherefrom hung all manner coloured silks The people of the city stood before him and he said to them O seed of Yafis bin Nuh what did your fathers and grandfathers worship They replied We found them worshipping Fire and followed their example as thou well knowest O folk rejoined Mura ash we have been shown that the fire is but one of the creatures of Almighty Allah Creator of all things and when we knew this we submitted ourselves to God the One the All powerful Maker of night and day and the sphere revolving alway Whom compre hendeth no sight but Who comprehendeth all sights for He is the Subtle the All wise So seek ye Salvation and ye shall be saved from the wrath of the Almighty One and from the fiery doom in the world to come And they embraced Al Islam with heart and tongue Then Mura ash took Gharib by the hand and showed him the palace and its ordinance and all the marvels it contained till they came to the armoury wherein were the arms of Japhet son of Noah Here Gharib saw a sword hanging to a pin of gold and asked O King whose is that Mura ash answered Tis the sword of Yafis bin Nuh wherewith he was wont to do battle against men and Jinn The sage Jardum forged it and graved on its back names of might FN thirty three It is named Al Mahik the Annihilator for that it never descendeth upon a man but it annihilateth him nor upon a Jinni but it crusheth him and if one smote therewith a mountain twould overthrow it When Gharib heard tell of the virtues of the sword he said I desire to look on this blade and Mura ash said Do as thou wilt So Gharib put out his hand and hending the sword drew it from its sheath whereupon it flashed and Death crept on its edge and glittered and it was twelve spans long and three broad Now Gharib wished to become owner of it and King Mura ash said An thou canst smite with it take it Tis well Gharib replied and took it up and it was in his hand as a staff wherefore all who were present men and Jinn marvelled and said Well done O Prince of Knights Then said Mura ash Lay thy hand on this hoard for which the Kings of the earth sigh in vain and mount that I may show thee the city Then they took horse and rode forth the palace with men and Jinns attending them on foot And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Six Hundred and Fifty fourth Night She pursued It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Gharib and King Mura ash rode forth the palace of Japhet with men and Jinns attending them on foot they passed through the streets and thoroughfares of the town by palaces and deserted mansions and gilded doorways till they issued from the gates and entered gardens full of trees fruit bearing and waters welling and birds speaking and celebrating the praises of Him to whom belong Majesty and Eternity nor did they cease to solace themselves in the land till nightfall when they returned to the palace of Japhet son of Noah and they brought them the table of food So they ate and Gharib turned to the King of the Jann and said to him O King I would fain return to my folk and my force for I know not their plight after me Replied Mura ash By Allah O my brother I will not part with thee for a full month till I have had my fill of thy sight Now Gharib could not say nay so he abode with him in the city of Japhet eating and drinking and making merry till the month ended when Mura ash gave him great store of gems and precious ores emeralds and balass rubies diamonds and other jewels ingots of gold and silver and likewise ambergis and musk and brocaded silks and else of rarities and things of price Moreover he clad him and Sahim in silken robes of honour gold inwoven and set on Gharib s head a crown jewelled with pearls and diamonds of inestimable value All these treasures he made up into even loads for him and calling five hundred Marids said to them Get ye ready to travel on the morrow that we may bring King Gharib and Sahim back to their own country And they answered We hear and we obey So they passed the night in the city purposing to depart on the morrow but next morning as they were about to set forth behold they espied a great host advancing upon the city with horses neighing and kettle drums beating and trumpets braying and riders filling the earth for they numbered threescore and ten thousand Marids flying and diving under a King called Barkan Now this Barkan was lord of the City of Carnelian and the Castle of Gold and under his rule were five hill strongholds in each five hundred thousand Marids and he and his tribe worshipped the Fire not the Omnipotent Sire He was a cousin of Mura ash the son of his father s brother and the cause of his coming was that there had been among the subjects of King Mura ash a misbelieving Marid who professed Al Islam hypocritically and he stole away from his people and made for the Valley of Carnelian where he went in to King Barkan and kissing the earth before him wished him abiding glory and prosperity Then he told him of Mura ash being converted to Al Islam and Barkan said How came he to tear himself away from his faith FN thirty four So the rebel told him what had passed and when Barkan heard it he snorted and sparked and railed at Sun and Moon and sparkling Fire saying By the virtue of my faith I will surely slay mine uncle s son and his people and this mortal nor will I leave one of them alive Then he cried out to the legions of the Jinn and choosing of them seventy thousand Marids set out and fared on till he came to Jabarsa FN thirty five the city of Japhet and encamped before its gates When Mura ash saw this he despatched a Marid saying Go to this host and learn all that it wanteth and return hither in haste So the messenger rushed away to Barkan s camp where the Marids flocked to meet him and said to him Who art thou Replied he An envoy from King Mura ash whereupon they carried him in to Barkan before whom he prostrated himself saying O my lord my master hath sent me to thee to learn tidings of thee Quoth Barkan Return to thy lord and say to him This is thy cousin Barkan who is come to salute thee And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Six Hundred and Fifty fifth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the Marid envoy of Mura ash was borne before Barkan and said to him O my lord my master hath sent me to thee to learn tidings of thee Barkan replied Return to thy lord and say to him This is thy cousin Barkan who is come to salute thee So the messenger went back and told Mura ash who said to Gharib Sit thou on thy throne whilst I go and salute my cousin and return to thee Then he mounted and rode to the camp of his uncle s son Now this was a trick FN thirty six of Barkan to bring Mura ash out and seize upon him and he said to his Marids whom he had stationed about him When ye see me embrace him FN thirty seven lay hold of him and pinion him And they replied To hear is to obey So when King Mura ash came up and entered Barkan s pavilion the owner rose to him and threw his arms round his neck whereat the Jann fell upon Mura ash and pinioned him and chained him Mura ash looked at Barkan and said What manner of thing is this Quoth Barkan O dog of the Jann wilt thou leave the faith of thy fathers and grandfathers and enter a faith thou knowest not Rejoined Mura ash O son of my uncle indeed I have found the faith of Abraham the Friend to be the True Faith and all other than it vain Asked Barkan And who told thee of this and Mura ash answered Gharib King of Irak whom I hold in the highest honour By the right of the Fire and the Light and the Shade and the Heat cried Barkan I will assuredly slay both thee and him And he cast him into gaol Now when Mura ash s henchman saw what had befallen his lord he fled back to the city and told the King s legionaries who cried out and mounted Quoth Gharib What is the matter And they told him all that had passed whereupon he cried out to Sahim Saddle me one of the chargers that King Mura ash gave me Said Sahim O my brother wilt thou do battle with the Jinn Gharib replied Yes I will fight them with the sword of Japhet son of Noah seeking help of the Lord of Abraham the Friend on whom be the Peace for He is the Lord of all things and sole Creator So Sahim saddled him a sorrel horse of the horses of the Jinn as he were a castle strong among castles and he armed and mounting rode out with the legions of the Jinn hauberk d cap a pie Then Barkan and his host mounted also and the two hosts drew out in lines facing each other The first to open the gate of war was Gharib who crave his steed into the mid field and bared the enchanted blade whence issued a glittering light that dazzled the eyes of all the Jinn and struck terror to their hearts Then he played FN thirty eight with the sword till their wits were wildered and cried out saying Allaho Akbar I am Gharib King of Irak There is no Faith save the Faith of Abraham the Friend Now when Barkan heard Gharib s words he said This is he who seduced my cousin from his religion so by the virtue of my faith I will not sit down on my throne till I have decapitated this Gharib and suppressed his breath of life and forced my cousin and his people back to their belief and whoso baulketh me him will I destroy Then he mounted an elephant paper white as he were a tower plastered with gypsum and goaded him with a spike of steel which ran deep into his flesh whereupon the elephant trumpeted and made for the battle plain where cut and thrust obtain and when he drew near Gharib he cried out to him saying O dog of mankind what made thee come into our land to debauch my cousin and his folk and pervert them from one faith to other faith Know that this day is the last of thy worldly days Gharib replied Avaunt FN thirty nine O vilest of the Jann Therewith Barkan drew a javelin and making it quiver FN forty in his hand cast it at Gharib but it missed him So he hurled a second javelin at him but Gharib caught it in mid air and after poising it launched it at the elephant It smote him on the flank and came out on the other side whereupon the beast fell to the earth dead and Barkan was thrown to the ground like a great palm tree Before he could stir Gharib smote him with the flat of Japhet s blade on the nape of the neck and he fell upon the earth in a fainting fit whereupon the Marids swooped down on him and surrounding him pinioned his elbows When Barkan s people saw their king a prisoner they drove at the others seeking to rescue him but Gharib and the Islamised Jinn fell upon them and gloriously done for Gharib indeed that day he pleased the Lord who answereth prayer and slaked his vengeance with the talisman sword Whomsoever he smote he clove him in sunder and before his soul could depart he became a heap of ashes in the fire whilst the two hosts of the Jinn shot each other with flamy meteors till the battle field was wrapped in smoke And Gharib tourneyed right and left among the Kafirs who gave way before him till he came to King Barkan s pavilion with Kaylajan and Kurajan on his either hand and cried out to them Loose your lord So they unbound Mura ash and broke his fetters and And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Six Hundred and Fifty sixth Night She continued It hath reached me O auspicious King that when King Gharib cried out to Kaylajan and Kurajan saying Loose your lord they unbound Mura ash and broke his fetters and he said to them Bring me my arms and my winged horse Now he had two flying steeds one of which he had given to Gharib and the other he had kept for himself and this he mounted after he had donned his battle harness Then he and Gharib fell upon the enemy flying through the air on their winged horses and the true believing Jinn followed them shouting Allaho Akbar God is Most Great till plains and hills valleys and mountains re worded the cry The Infidels fled before them and they returned after having slain more than thirty thousand Marids and Satans to the city of Japhet where the two Kings sat down on their couches of estate and sought Barkan but found him not for after capturing him they were diverted from him by stress of battle where an Ifrit of his servants made his way to him and loosing him carried him to his folk of whom he found part slain and the rest in full flight So he flew up with the King high in air and sat him down in the City of Carnelian and Castle of Gold where Barkan seated himself on the throne of his kingship Presently those of his people who had survived the affair came in to him and gave him joy of his safety and he said O folk where is safety My army is slain and they took me prisoner and have rent in pieces mine honour among the tribes of the Jann Quoth they O King tis ever thus that kings still afflict and are afflicted Quoth he There is no help but I take my wreak and wipe out my shame else shall I be for ever disgraced among the tribes of the Jann Then he wrote letters to the Governors of his fortresses who came to him right loyally and when he reviewed them he found three hundred and twenty thousand fierce Marids and Satans who said to him What is thy need And he replied Get ye ready to set out in three days time whereto they rejoined Harkening and obedience On this wise it befel King Barkan but as regards Mura ash when he discovered his prisoner s escape it was grievous to him and he said Had we set an hundred Marids to guard him he had not fled but whither shall he go from us Then said he to Gharib Know O my brother that Barkan is perfidious and will never rest from wreaking blood revenge on us but will assuredly assemble his legions and return to attack us wherefore I am minded to forestall him and follow the trail of his defeat whilst he is yet weakened thereby Replied Gharib This is the right rede and will best serve our need and Mura ash said Oh my brother let the Marids bear thee back to thine own country and leave me to fight the battles of the Faith against the Infidels that I may be lightened of my sin load But Gharib rejoined By the virtue of the Clement the Bountiful the Veiler I will not go hence till I do to death all the misbelieving Jinn and Allah hasten their souls to the fire and dwelling place dire and none shall be saved but those who worship Allah the One the Victorious But do thou send Sahim back to the city of Oman so haply he may be healed of his ailment For Sahim was sick So Mura ash cried to the Marids saying Take ye up Sahim and these treasures and bear them to Oman city And after replying We hear and we obey they took them and made for the land of men Then Mura ash wrote letters to all his Governors and Captains of fortresses and they came to him with an hundred and sixty thousand warriors So they made them ready and departed for the City of Carnelian and the Castle of Gold covering in one day a year s journey and halted in a valley where they encamped and passed the night Next morning as they were about to set forth behold the vanguard of Barkan s army appeared whereupon the Jinn cried out and the two hosts met and fell each upon other in that valley Then the engagement was dight and there befel a sore fight as though an earthquake shook the site and fair plight waxed foul plight Earnest came and jest took flight and parley ceased twixt wight and wight FN forty one whilst long lives were cut short in a trice and the Unbelievers fell into disgrace and despite for Gharib charged them proclaiming the Unity of the Worshipful the All might and shore through necks and left heads rolling in the dust nor did night betide before nigh seventy thousand of the Miscreants were slain and of the Moslemised over ten thousand Marids had fallen Then the kettle drums beat the retreat and the two hosts drew apart And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased Baying her permitted say When it was the Six Hundred and Fifty seventh Night She resumed It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the two hosts drew apart Gharib and Mura ash returned to their tents after wiping their weapons and supper being set before them they ate and gave each other joy of their safety and the loss of their Marids being so small As for Barkan he returned to his tent grieving for the slaughter of his champions and said to his officers O folk an we tarry here and do battle with them on this wise in three days time we shall be cut off to the last wight Quoth they And how shall we do O King Quoth Barkan We will fall upon them under cover of night whilst they are deep in sleep and not one of them shall be left to tell the tale So take your arms and when I give the word of command attack and fall on your enemies as one Now there was amongst them a Marid named Jandal whose heart inclined to Al Islam so when he heard the Kafirs plot he stole away from them and going in to King Mura ash and King Gharib told the twain what Barkan had devised whereupon Mura ash turned to Gharib and said to him O my brother what shall we do Gharib replied To night we will fall upon the Miscreants and chase them into the wilds and the words if it be the will of the Omnipotent King Then he summoned the Captains of the Jann and said to them Arm yourselves you and yours and as soon as tis dark steal out of your tents on foot hundreds after hundreds and lie in ambush among the mountains and when ye see the enemy engaged among the tents do ye fall upon them from all quarters Hearten your hearts and rely on your Lord and ye shall certainly conquer and behold I am with you So as soon as it was dark Night the Infidels attacked the camp invoking aid of the fire and light but when they came among the tents the Moslems fell upon them calling for help on the Lord of the Worlds and saying O Most Merciful of Mercifuls O Creator of all createds till they left them like mown grass cut down and dead Nor did morning dawn before the most part of the unbelievers were species without souls and the rest made for the wastes and marshes whilst Gharib and Mura ash returned triumphant and victorious and making prize of the enemy s baggage they rested till the morrow when they set out for the City of Carnelian and Castle of Gold As for Barkan when the battle had turned against him and most of his lieges were slain he fled through the dark with the remnant of his power to his capital where he entered his palace and assembling his legionaries said to them O folk whoso hath aught of price let him take it and follow me to the Mountain Kaf to the Blue King lord of the Pied Palace for he it is who shall avenge us So they took their women and children and goods and made for the Caucasus mountain Presently Mura ash and Gharib arrived at the City of Carnelian and Castle of Gold to find the gates open and none left to give them news whereupon they entered and Mura ash led Gharib that he might show him the city whose walls were builded of emeralds and its gates of red carnelian with studs of silver and the terrace roofs of its houses and mansions reposed upon beams of lign aloes and sandle wood So they took their pleasure in its streets and alleys till they came to the Palace of Gold and entering passed through seven vestibules when they drew near to a building whose walls were of royal balass rubies and its pavement of emerald and jacinth The two Kings were astounded at the goodliness of the place and fared on from vestibule to vestibule till they had passed through the seventh and happened upon the inner court of the palace wherein they saw four daises each different from the others and in the midst a jetting fount of red gold compassed about with golden lions FN forty two from whose mouths issued water These were things to daze man s wit The estrade at the upper end was hung and carpeted with brocaded silks of various colours and thereon stood two thrones of red gold inlaid with pearls and jewels So Mura ash and Gharib sat down on Barkan s thrones and held high state in the Palace of Gold And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Six Hundred and Fifty eighth Night She pursued It hath reached me O auspicious King that Mura ash and Gharib took seat on Barkan s thrones and held high state Then said Gharib to Mura ash What thinkest thou to do And Mura ash replied O King of mankind have despatched an hundred horse to learn where Barkan is that we may pursue him Then they abode three days in the palace the scouting Marids returned with the news that Barkan had fled to the Mountain Kaf and craved protection of the Blue King who granted it whereupon quoth Mura ash to Gharib What sayest thou O my brother and quoth Gharib Except we attack them they will attack us So they bade the host make ready for departure and after three days they were about to set out with their troops when the Marids who had carried Sahim and the presents back to Oman returned and kissed ground before Gharib He questioned them of his people and they replied After the last affair thy brother Ajib leaving Ya arub bin Kahtan fled to the King of Hind and submitting his case sought his protection The King granted his prayer and writing letters to all his governors levied an army as it were the surging sea having neither beginning nor end wherewith he purposeth to invade Al Irak and lay it waste When Gharib heard this he said Perish the Misbelievers Verily Allah Almighty shall give the victory to Al Islam and I will soon show them hew and foin Said Mura ash O King of humans by the virtue of the Mighty Name I must needs go with thee to thy kingdom and destroy thy foes and bring thee to thy wish Gharib thanked him and they rested on this resolve till the morrow when they set out intending for Mount Caucasus and marched many days till they reached the City of Alabaster and the Pied Palace Now this city was fashioned of alabaster and precious stones by Barik bin Faki father of the Jinn and he also founded the Pied Palace which was so named because edified with one brick of gold alternating with one of silver nor was there builded aught like it in all the world When they came within half a day s journey of the city they halted to take their rest and Mura ash sent out to reconnoitre a scout who returned and said O King within the City of Alabaster are legions of the Jinn for number as the leaves of the trees or as the drops of rain So Mura ash said to Gharib How shall we do O King of Mankind He replied O King divide your men into four bodies and encompass with them the camp of the Infidels then in the middle of the Night let them cry out saying God is Most Great and withdraw and watch what happeneth among the tribes of the Jinn So Mura ash did as Gharib counselled and the troops waited till midNight when they encircled the foe and shouted Allaho Akbar Ho for the Faith of Abraham the Friend on whom be the Peace The Misbelievers at this cry awoke in affright and snatching up their arms fell one upon other till the morning when most part of them were dead bodies and but few remained Then Gharib cried out to the True Believers saying Up and at the remnant of the Kafirs Behold I am with you and Allah is your helper So the Moslems crave at the enemy and Gharib bared his magical blade Al Mahik and fell upon the foe lopping off noses and making heads wax hoary and whole ranks turn tail At last be came up with Barkan and smote him and bereft him of life and he fell down drenched in his blood On like wise he did with the Blue King and by undurn hour not one of the Kafirs was left alive to tell the tale Then Gharib and Mura ash entered the Pied Palace and found its walls builded of alternate courses of gold and silver with door sills of crystal and keystones of greenest emerald In its midst was a fountain adorned with bells and pendants and figures of birds and beasts spouting forth water and thereby a dais FN forty three furnished with gold brocaded silk bordered or embroidered with jewels and they found the treasures of the palace past count or description Then they entered the women s court where they came upon a magnificent serraglio and Gharib saw among the Blue King s woman folk a girl clad in a dress worth a thousand dinars never had he beheld a goodlier About her were an hundred slave girls upholding her train with golden hooks and she was in their midst as the moon among stars When he saw her his reason was confounded and he said to one of the waiting women Who may be yonder maid Quoth they This is the Blue King s daughter Star o Morn And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Six Hundred and Fifty ninth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Gharib asked the slave women saying Who may be yonder maid they replied This is Star o Morn daughter to the Blue King Then Gharib turned to Mura ash and said to him O King of the Jinn I have a mind to take yonder damsel to wife Replied Mura ash The palace and all that therein is live stock and dead are the prize of thy right hand for hadst thou not devised a stratagem to destroy the Blue King and Barkan they had cut us off to the last one wherefore the treasure is thy treasure and the folk thy thralls Gharib thanked him for his fair speech and going up to the girl gazed steadfastly upon her and loved her with exceeding love forgetting Fakhr Taj the Princess and even Mahdiyah Now her mother was the Chinese King s daughter whom the Blue King had carried off from her palace and perforce deflowered and she conceived by him and bare this girl whom he named Star o Morn by reason of her beauty and loveliness for she was the very Princess of the Fair Her mother died when she was a babe of forty days and the nurses and eunuchs reared her till she reached the age of seventeen but she hated her sire and rejoiced in his slaughter So Gharib put his palm to hers FN forty four and went in unto her that night and found her a virgin Then he bade pull down the Pied Palace and divided the spoil with the true believing Jinn and there fell to his share one and twenty thousand bricks of gold and silver and money and treasure beyond speech and count Then Mura ash took Gharib and showed him the Mountain Kaf and all its marvels after which they returned to Barkan s fortress and dismantled it and shared the spoil thereof Then they repaired to Mura ash s capital where they tarried five days when Gharib sought to revisit his native country and Mura ash said O King of mankind I will ride at thy stirrup and bring thee to thine own land Replied Gharib No by the virtue of Abraham the Friend I will not suffer thee to weary thyself thus nor will I take any of the Jinn save Kaylajan and Kurajan Quoth the King Take with thee ten thousand horsemen of the Jinn to serve thee but quoth Gharib I will take only as I said to thee So Mura ash bade a thousand Marids carry him to his native land with his share of the spoil and he commanded Kaylajan and Kurajan to follow him and obey him and they answered Hearkening and obedience Then said Gharib to the Marids Do ye carry the treasure and Star o Morn for he himself thought to ride his flying steed But Mura ash said to him This horse O my brother will live only in our region and if it come upon man s earth twill die but I have in my stables a sea horse whose fellow is not found in Al Irak no nor in all the world is its like So he caused bring forth the horse and when Gharib saw it it interposed between him and his wits FN forty five Then they bound it and Kaylajan bore it on his shoulders and Kurajan took what he could carry And Mura ash embraced Gharib and wept for parting from him saying O my brother if aught befal thee wherein thou art powerless send for me and I will come to thine aid with an army able to lay waste the whole earth and what is thereon Gharib thanked him for his kindness and zeal for the True Faith and took leave of him whereupon the Marids set out with Gharib and his goods and after traversing fifty years journey in two days and a Night alighted near the city of Oman and halted to take rest Then Gharib sent out Kaylajan to learn news of his people and he returned and said O King the city is beleaguered by a host of Infidels as they were the surging sea and thy people are fighting them The drums beat to battle and Jamrkan goeth forth as champion in the field When Gharib heard this he cried aloud God is Most Great and said to Kaylajan Saddle me the steed and bring me my arms and spear for to day the valiant shall be known from the coward in the place of war and battle stead So Kaylajan brought him all he sought and Gharib armed and belting in baldrick Al Mahik mounted the sea horse and made toward the hosts Quoth Kaylajan and Kurajan to him Set thy heart at rest and let us go to the Kafirs and scatter them abroad in the wastes and wilds till by the help of Allah the All powerful we leave not a soul alive no not a blower of the fire But Gharib said By the virtue of Abraham the Friend I will not let you fight them without me and behold I mount Now the cause of the coming of that great host was right mar vellous FN forty six And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Six Hundred and Sixtieth Night She continued It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Gharib had bidden Kaylajan go and learn news of his people the Jinn fared forth and presently returning said Verily around thy city is a mighty host Now the cause of its coming was that Ajib having fled the field after Ya arub s army had been put to the rout said to his people O folk if we return to Ya arub bin Kahtan he will say to us But for you my son and my people had not been slain and he will put us to death even to the last man Wherefore methinks we were better go to Tarkanan King of Hind and beseech him to avenge us Replied they Come let us go thither and the blessing of the Fire be upon thee So they fared days and nights till they reached King Tarkanan s capital city and after asking and obtaining permission to present himself Ajib went in to him and kissed ground before him Then he wished him what men use to wish to monarchy and said to him O King protect me so may protect thee the sparkling Fire and the Night with its thick darkness Tarkanan looked at Ajib and asked Who art thou and what dost thou want to which the other answered I am Ajib King of Al Irak my brother hath wronged me and gotten the mastery of the land and the subjects have submitted themselves to him Moreover he hath embraced the faith of Al Islam and he ceaseth not to chase me from country to country and behold I am come to seek protection of thee and thy power When Tarkanan heard Ajib s words he rose and sat down and cried By the virtue of the Fire I will assuredly avenge thee and will let none serve other than my goddess the Fire And he called aloud to his son saying O my son make ready to go to Al Irak and lay it waste and bind all who serve aught but the Fire and torment them and make example of them yet slay them not but bring them to me that I may ply them with various tortures and make them taste the bitterness of humiliation and leave them a warning to whoso will be warned in this our while Then he chose out to accompany him eighty thousand fighting men on horseback and the like number on giraffes FN forty seven besides ten thousand elephants bearing on their backs seats FN forty eight of sandal wood latticed with golden rods plated and studded with gold and silver and shielded with pavoises of gold and emerald moreover he sent good store of war chariots in each eight men fighting with all kinds of weapons Now the Prince s name was Ra ad Shah FN forty nine and he was the cham pion of his time for prowess having no peer So he and his army equipped them in ten days time then set out as they were a bank of clouds and fared on two months journey till they came upon Oman city and encompassed it to the joy of Ajib who thought himself assured of victory Jamrkan and Sa adan and all their fighting men sallied forth into the field of fight whilst the kettle drums beat to battle and the horses neighed At this moment up came King Gharib who as we have said had been warned by Kaylajan and he urged on his destrier and entered among the Infidels waiting to see who should come forth and open the chapter of war Then out rushed Sa adan the Ghul and offered combat whereupon there issued forth to him one of the champions of Hind but Sa adan scarce let him take stand in front ere he smote him with his mace and crushed his bones and stretched him on the ground and so did he with a second and a third till he had slain thirty fighting men Then there dashed out at him an Indian cavalier by name Battash al Akran FN fifty uncle to King Tarkanan and of his day the doughtiest man reckoned worth five thousand horse in battle plain and cried out to Sa adan saying O thief of the Arabs hath thy daring reached that degree that thou shouldst slay the Kings of Hind and their champions and capture their horsemen But this day is the last of thy worldly days When Sa adan heard these words his eyes waxed blood red and he crave at Battash and aimed a stroke at him with his club but he evaded it and the force of the blow bore Sa adan to the ground and before he could recover himself the Indians pinioned him and haled him off to their tents Now when Jamrkan saw his comrade a prisoner he cried out saying Ho for the Faith of Abraham the Friend and clapping heel to his horse ran at Battash They wheeled about awhile till Battash charged Jamrkan and catching him by his jerkin FN fifty one tare him from his saddle and cast him to the ground whereupon the Indians bound him and dragged him away to their tents And Battash ceased not to overcome all who came out to him Captain after Captain till he had made prisoners of four and twenty Chiefs of the Moslems whereat the True Believers were sore dismayed When Gharib saw what had befallen his braves he drew from beneath his knee FN fifty two a mace of gold weighing six score pounds which had belonged to Barkan King of the Jann And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Six Hundred and Sixty first Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Gharib beheld what had befallen his braves he drew forth a golden mace 
8422-258258-0000	train-other-500	which had belonged to Barkan King of the Jann and clapped heel to his sea horse
none	none	 which bore him like the wind gust into mid field 
8422-258258-0001	train-other-500	Then he let drive at Battash crying out God is Most Great He giveth aid and victory and He abaseth whoso reject the Faith of Abraham the Friend and smote him with the mace
none	none	 whereupon he fell to the ground and Gharib 
8422-258258-0002	train-other-500	turning to the Moslems saw his brother Sahim and said to him Pinion me this hound When Sahim heard his brother s words he ran to Battash and bound him hard and fast and bore him off
8422-258258-0003	train-other-500	whilst the Moslem braves wondered who this knight could be and the Indians said one to other Who is this horseman which came out from among them and hath taken our Chief prisoner Meanwhile
none	none	 Gharib continued to offer battle and there issued forth to him a captain of the Hindis whom he felled to earth with his mace and Kaylajan and Kurajan pinioned him and delivered him over to Sahim nor did Gharib leave to do thus 
8422-258258-0004	train-other-500	till he had taken prisoner two and fifty of the doughtiest Captains of the army of Hind Then the day came to an end and the kettle drums beat the retreat
none	none	 whereupon Gharib left the field

8422-258258-0030	train-other-500	wilt thou contend with Kings

8422-258258-0031	train-other-500	he said to him Who art thou among the Kings And Ajib answered saying I am thy brother and this day is the last of thy worldly days Now

none	none	 whilst Gharib 
8422-258258-0035	train-other-500	rejoiced in the capture of his enemy and repeated these couplets of the poet I have won my wish and my need have scored

8422-258258-0045	train-other-500	It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the kettledrums beat the retreat the two Kings parted and returned each to his own place
none	none	 where his people gave him joy of his safety And the Moslems said to Gharib Tis not thy wont O King to prolong a fight and he replied O folk I have done battle with many royalties FN fifty six and champions but never 
8422-258258-0046	train-other-500	saw I a harder hitter than this one Had I chosen to draw Al Mahik upon him I had mashed his bones and made an end of his days but I delayed with him thinking to take him prisoner
8422-258258-0047	train-other-500	and give him part enjoyment in Al Islam
none	none	 Thus far concerning Gharib 
8422-258258-0048	train-other-500	but as regards Ra ad Shah he returned to his marquee and sat upon his throne when his Chiefs came in to him and asked him of his adversary and he answered
8422-258258-0049	train-other-500	By the truth of the sparkling Fire never in my life saw I the like of yonder brave But to morrow I will take him prisoner and lead him away dejected and abject
8422-258258-0050	train-other-500	Then they slept till daybreak when the battle drums beat to fight and the swords in baldric were dight
none	none	 and war cries were cried amain 
8422-258258-0051	train-other-500	and all mounted their horses of generous strain and drew out into the field filling every wide place and hill and plain
none	none	 The first to open the door of war was the rider outrageous and the lion rageous King Gharib 
8422-258258-0052	train-other-500	who crave his steed between the two hosts and wheeled and careered over the field crying Who is for fray who is for fight Let no sluggard come out to me this day nor dullard
8422-258258-0053	train-other-500	Before he had made an end of speaking out rushed Ra ad Shah riding on an elephant as he were a vast tower
none	none	 in a eat girthed with silken bands 
8422-258258-0054	train-other-500	and between the elephant s ears at the driver bearing in hand a hook wherewith he goaded the beast

8422-258258-0055	train-other-500	and casting the meshes over them draw the running noose and drag the rider off his horse and make him prisoner and thus had he conquered many cavaliers
none	none	 So as Gharib came up to him 
8422-258258-0056	train-other-500	he raised his hand and despreading the net over him pulled him on to the back of the elephant and cried out to the beast to return to the Indian camp
none	none	 But Kaylajan and Kurajan had not left Gharib 
8422-258258-0057	train-other-500	and when they beheld what had befallen their lord they laid hold of the elephant
none	none	 whilst Gharib strove with the net till he rent it in sunder Upon this the two Marids seized Ra ad Shah 
8422-258258-0058	train-other-500	and bound him with a cord of palm fibre Then the two armies drove each at other and met with a shock like two seas crashing or two mountains together dashing
8422-258258-0059	train-other-500	whilst the dust rose to the confines of the sky and blinded was every eye The battle waxed fierce and fell the blood ran in rills
8422-258258-0060	train-other-500	nor did they cease to wage war with lunge of lance and sway of sword in lustiest way till the day darkened and the night starkened
none	none	 when the drums beat the retreat and the two hosts drew asunder FN fifty nine Now the Moslems were evilly entreated that day by reason of the riders on elephants and giraffes FN sixty and many of them were killed and most of the rest were wounded This was grievous to Gharib 
8422-258258-0061	train-other-500	who commanded the hurt to be medicined and turning to his Chief Officers asked them what they counselled
none	none	 Answered they O King tis only the elephants and giraffes that irk us were we but quit of them we should overcome the enemy Quoth Kaylajan and Kurajan 
8422-258258-0062	train-other-500	We twain will unsheath our swords and fall on them and slay the most part of them But there came forward a man of Oman who had been privy counsellor to Jaland and said
8422-258258-0063	train-other-500	O King I will be surety for the host an thou wilt but hearken to me and follow my counsel
none	none	 Gharib 
8422-258258-0064	train-other-500	turned to his Captains and said to them Whatsoever this wise man shall say to you that do And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day
none	none	 and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Six Hundred and Sixty fourth Night She pursued It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Gharib said to his Captains Whatsoever this wise man shall say to you 
8422-258259-0000	train-other-500	that do they replied Hearing and obeying So the Omani chose out ten captains and asked them How many braves have ye under your hands and they answered
none	none	 Ten thousand fighting men Then he carried them into the armoury and armed five thousand of them with harquebuses and other five thousand with cross bows and taught them to shoot with these new weapons FN sixty one Now as soon as it was day the Indians came out to the field armed cap a pie with the elephants giraffes and champions in their van whereupon Gharib and his men mounted and both hosts drew out and the big drums beat to battle Then the man of Oman cried out to the archers and harquebusiers to shoot and they plied the elephants and giraffes with shafts 
8422-258259-0001	train-other-500	and leaden bullets which entered the beasts flanks whereat they roared out and turning upon their own ranks trod them down with their hoofs
none	none	 Presently the Moslems charged the Misbelievers and outflanked them right and left whilst the elephants and giraffes trampled them and drove them into the hills and words 
8422-258259-0002	train-other-500	whither the Moslems followed hard upon them with the keen edged sword and but few of the giraffes and elephants escaped
none	none	 Then King Gharib 
8422-258259-0003	train-other-500	and his folk returned rejoicing in their victory and on the morrow they divided the loot and rested five days after which King Gharib sat down on the throne of his kingship and
8422-258259-0004	train-other-500	sending for his brother Ajib said to him O dog why hast thou assembled the Kings against us But He who hath power over all things hath given us the victory over thee
8422-258259-0005	train-other-500	So embrace the Saving Faith and thou shalt be saved and I will forbear to avenge my father and mother on thee therefor and I will make thee King again as thou west
8422-258259-0006	train-other-500	placing myself under thy hand But Ajib said I will not leave my faith So

8422-258259-0009	train-other-500	Put forth thy hand and I will testify that there is no god but the God and that Abraham the Friend is the Apostle of God
none	none	 At this Gharib rejoiced and said to him 
8422-258259-0010	train-other-500	Is thy heart indeed stablished in the sweetness of this Belief And he answered saying Yes O my lord
none	none	 Then quoth Gharib O Ra ad Shah wilt thou go to thy country and thy kingdom and quoth he O my lord my father will put me to death for that I have left his faith Gharib rejoined 
8422-258259-0011	train-other-500	I will go with thee and make thee king of the country and constrain the folk to obey thee by the help of Allah the Bountiful the Beneficent And Ra ad Shah kissed his hands and feet

were and whither they were bound whereto they made answer We are en route for Al Irak to slay Gharib and all who company him When the Marids heard these words they repaired to the pavilion of the Persian general whose name was Rustam and waited till the soldiers slept when they took up Rustam bed and all and made for the castle where Gharib lay They arrived there by midnight and going to the door of the King s pavilion cried Permission which when he heard he sat up and said Come in So they entered and set down the couch with Rustam asleep thereon Gharib asked Who be this and they answered This be a Persian Prince whom we met coming with a great host thinking to slay thee and thine and we have brought him to thee that he may tell thee what thou hast a mind to know Fetch me an hundred braves cried Gharib and they fetched them whereupon he bade them Draw your swords and stand at the head of this Persian carle Then they awoke him and he opened his eyes and finding an arch of steel over his head shut them again crying What be this foul dream But Kaylajan pricked him with his sword point and he sat up and said Where am I Quoth Sahim Thou art in the presence of King Gharib son in law of the King of the Persians What is thy name and whither goest thou When Rustam heard Gharib s name he bethought himself and said in his mind Am I asleep or awake Whereupon Sahim dealt him a buffet saying Why dost thou not answer And he raised his head and asked Who brought me from my tent out of the midst of my men Gharib answered These two Marids brought thee So he looked at Kaylajan and Kurajan and skited in his bag trousers Then the Marids fell upon him baring their tusks and brandishing their blades and said to him Wilt thou not rise and kiss ground before King Gharib And he trembled at them and was assured that he was not asleep so he stood up and kissed the ground between the hands of Gharib saying The blessing of the Fire be on thee and long life be thy life O King Gharib cried O dog of the Persians fire is not worshipful for that it is harmful and profiteth not save in cooking food Asked Rustam Who then is worshipful and Gharib answered Alone worshipworth is God who formed thee and fashioned thee and created the heavens and the earth Quoth the Ajami What shall I say that I may become of the party of this Lord and enter thy Faith and quoth Gharib Say There is no god but the God and Abraham is the Friend of God So Rustam pronounced the profession of the Faith and was enrolled among the people of felicity Then said he to Gharib Know O my lord that thy father in law King Sabur seeketh to slay thee and indeed he hath sent me with an hundred thousand men charging me to spare none of you Gharib rejoined Is this my reward for having delivered his daughter from death and dishonour Allah will requite him his ill intent But what is thy name The Persian answered My name is Rustam general of Sabur and Gharib Thou shalt have the like rank in my army adding But tell me O Rustam how is it with the Princess Fakhr Taj May thy head live O King of the age What was the cause of her death Rustam replied O my lord no sooner hadst thou left us than one of the Princess s women went in to King Sabur and said to him O my master didst thou give Gharib leave to lie with the Princess my mistress whereto he answered No by the virtue of the fire and drawing his sword went in to his daughter and said to her O foul baggage why didst thou suffer yonder Badawi to sleep with thee without dower or even wedding She replied O my papa twas thou gayest him leave to sleep with me Then he asked Did the fellow have thee but she was silent and hung down her head Hereupon he cried out to the midwives and slave girls saying Pinion me this harlot s elbows behind her and look at her privy parts So they did as he bade them and after inspecting her slit said to him O King she hath lost her maidenhead Whereupon he ran at her and would have slain her but her mother rose up and threw herself between them crying O King slay her not lest thou be for ever dishonoured but shut her in a cell till she die So he cast her into prison till nightfall when he called two of his courtiers and said to them Carry her afar off and throw her into the river Jayhun and tell none They did his commandment and indeed her memory is forgotten and her time is past And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Six Hundred and Sixty eighth Night She pursued It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Gharib asked news of Fakhr Taj Rustam informed him that she had been drowned in the river by her sire s command And when Gharib heard this the world waxed wan before his eyes and he cried By the virtue of Abraham the Friend I will assuredly go to yonder dog and overwhelm him and lay waste his realm Then he sent letters to Jamrkan and to the governors of Mosul and Mayyafarikin and turning to Rustam said to him How many men hadst thou in thine army He replied An hundred thousand Persian horse and Gharib rejoined Take ten thousand horse and go to thy people and occupy them with war I will follow on thy trail So Rustam mounted and taking ten thousand Arab horse made for his tribe saying in himself I will do a deed shall whiten my face with King Gharib So he fared on seven days till there remained but half a day s journey between him and the Persian camp when dividing his host into four divisions he said to his men Surround the Persians on all sides and fall upon them with the sword They rode on from eventide till midnight when they had compassed the camp of the Ajamis who were asleep in security and fell upon them shouting God is Most Great Whereupon the Persians started up from sleep and their feet slipped and the sabre went round amongst them for the All knowing King was wroth with them and Rustam wrought amongst them as fire in dry fuel till by the end of the night the whole of the Persian host was slain or wounded or fled and the Moslems made prize of their tents and baggage horses camels and treasure chests Then they alighted and rested in the tents of the Ajamis till King Gharib came up and seeing what Rustam had done and how he had gained by stratagem a great and complete victory he invested him with a robe of honour and said to him O Rustam it was thou didst put the Persians to the rout wherefore all the spoil is thine So he kissed Gharib s hand and thanked him and they rested till the end of the day when they set out for King Sabur s capital Meanwhile the fugitives of the defeated force reached Isbanir and went in to Sabur crying out and saying Alas and Well away and Woe worth the day Quoth he What hath befallen you and who with his mischief hath smitten you So they told him all that had passed and said Naught befel us except that thy general Rustam fell upon us in the darkness of the night because he had turned Moslem nor did Gharib come near us When the King heard this he cast his crown to the ground and said There is no worth left us Then he turned to his son Ward Shah FN sixty three and said to him O my son there is none for this affair save thou Answered Ward Shah By thy life O my father I will assuredly bring Gharib and his chiefs of the people in chains and slay all who are with him Then he numbered his army and found it two hundred and twenty thousand men So they slept intending to set forth on the morrow but next morning as they were about to march behold a cloud of dust arose and spread till it walled the world and baffled the sight of the farthest seeing wight Now Sabur had mounted to farewell his son and when he saw this mighty great dust he let call a runner and said to him Go find me out the cause of this dust cloud The scout went and returned saying O my lord Gharib and his braves are upon you whereupon they unloaded their bat beasts and drew out in line of battle When Gharib came up and saw the Persians ranged in row he cried out to his men saying Charge with the blessing of Allah So they waved the flags and the Arabs and the Ajamis crave one at other and folk were heaped upon folk Blood ran like water and all souls saw death face to face the brave advanced and pressed forward to assail and the coward hung back and turned tail and they ceased not from fight and fray till ended day when the kettle drums beat the retreat and the two hosts drew apart Then Sabur commanded to pitch his camp hard over the city gate and Gharib set up his pavilions in front of theirs and every one went to his tent And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Six Hundred and Sixty ninth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the two hosts drew apart every one went to his tent until the morning As soon as it was day the two hosts mounted their strong steeds and levelled their lances and wore their harness of war then they raised their slogan cries and drew out in battle array whilst came forth all the lordly knights and the lions of fights Now the first to open the gate of battle was Rustam who urged his charger into mid field and cried out God is most Great I am Rustam champion in chief of the Arabs and Ajamis Who is for tilting who is for fighting Let no sluggard come out to me this day nor weakling Then there rushed forth to him a champion of the Persians the two charged each other and there befel between them a sore fight till Rustam sprang upon his adversary and smote him with a mace he had with him seventy pounds in weight and beat his head down upon his breast and he fell to the earth dead and in his blood drowned This was no light matter to Sabur and he commanded his men to charge so they crave at the Moslems invoking the aid of the light giving Sun whilst the True Believers called for help upon the Magnanimous King But the Ajamis the Miscreants outnumbered the Arabs the Moslems and made them drain the cup of death which when Gharib saw he drew his sword Al Mahik and crying out his war cry fell upon the Persians with Kaylajan and Kurajan at either stirrup nor did he leave playing upon them with blade till he hewed his way to the standard bearer and smote him on the head with the flat of his sword whereupon he fell down in a fainting fit and the two Marids bore him off to their camp When the Persians saw the standard fall they turned and fled and for the city gates made but the Moslems followed them with the blade and they crowded together to enter the city so that they could not shut the gates and there died of them much people Then Rustam and Sa adan Jamrkan and Sahim Al Damigh Kaylajan and Kurajan and all the braves Mohammedan and the champions of Faith Unitarian fell upon the misbelieving Persians in the gates and the blood of the Kafirs ran in the streets like a torrent till they threw down their arms and harness and called out for quarter whereupon the Moslems stayed their swords from the slaughter and drove them to their tents as one driveth a flock of sheep Meanwhile Gharib returned to his pavilion where he doffed his gear and washed himself of the blood of the Infidels after which he donned his royal robes and sat down on his chair of estate Then he called for the King of the Persians and said to him O dog of the Ajams what moved thee to deal thus with thy daughter How seest thou me unworthy to be her baron And Sabur answered saying O King punish me not because of that deed which I did for I repent me and confronted thee not in fight but in my fear of thee FN sixty four When Gharib heard these words he bade throw him flat and beat him So they bastinadoed him till he could no longer groan and cast him among the prisoners Then Gharib expounded Al Islam to the Persians and one hundred and twenty thousand of them embraced The Faith and the rest he put to the sword Moreover all the citizens professed Al Islam and Gharib mounted and entered in great state the city Isbanir Al Madain Then he went into the King s palace and sitting down on Sabur s throne gave robes and largesse and distributed the booty and treasure among the Arabs and Persians wherefore they loved him and wished him victory and honour and endurance of days But Fakhr Taj s mother remembered her daughter and raised the voice of mourning for her and the palace was filled with wails and cries Gharib heard this and entering the Harim asked the women what ailed them whereupon the Princess s mother came forward and said O my lord thy presence put me in mind of my daughter and how she would have joyed in thy coming had she been alive and well Gharib wept for her and sitting down on his throne called for Sabur and they brought him stumbling in his shackles Quoth Gharib to him O dog of the Persians what didst thou do with thy daughter I gave her to such an one and such an one quoth the King saying Drown her in the river Jayhun So Gharib sent for the two men and asked them Is what he saith true Answered they Yes but O King we did not drown her nay we took pity on her and left her on the bank of the Jayhun saying Save thyself and return not to the city lest the King slay thee and slay us with thee This is all we know of her And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Six Hundred and Seventieth Night She continued It hath reached me O auspicious King that the two men ended the tale of Fakhr Taj with these words And we left her upon the bank of the river Jayhun Now when Gharib heard this he bade bring the astrologers and said to them Strike me a board of geomancy and find out what is come of Fakhr Taj and whether she is still in the bonds of life or dead They did so and said O King of the age it is manifest to us that the Princess is alive and hath borne a male child but she is with a tribe of the Jinn and will be parted from thee twenty years count therefore how many years thou hast been absent in travel So he reckoned up the years of his absence and found them eight years and said There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah the Glorious the Great FN sixty five Then he sent for all Sabur s Governors of towns and strongholds and they came and did him homage Now one day after this as he sat in his palace behold a cloud of dust appeared in the distance and spread till it walled the whole land and darkened the horizon So he summoned the two Marids and bade them reconnoitre and they went forth under the dust cloud and snatching up a horseman of the advancing host returned and set him down before Gharib saying Ask this fellow for he is of the army Quoth Gharib Whose power is this and the man answered O King tis the army of Khirad Shah FN sixty six King of Shiras who is come forth to fight thee Now the cause of Khirad Shah s coming was this When Gharib defeated Sabur s army as hath been related and took him prisoner the King s son fled with a handful of his father s force and ceased not flying till he reached the city of Shiras where he went into King Khirad Shah and kissed ground before him whilst the tears ran down his cheeks When the King saw him in this case he said to him Lift thy head O youth and tell me what maketh thee weep He replied O King a King of the Arabs by name Gharib hath fallen on us and captured the King my sire and slain the Persians making them drain the cup of death And he told him all that had passed from first to last Quoth Khirad Shah Is my wife FN sixty seven well and quoth the Prince Gharib hath taken her Cried the King As my head liveth I will not leave a Badawi or a Moslem on the face of the earth So he wrote letters to his Viceroys who levied their troops and joined him with an army which when reviewed numbered eighty five thousand men Then he opened his armouries and distributed arms and armour to the troops after which he set out with them and journeyed till he came to Isbanir and all encamped before the city gate Hereupon Kaylajan and Kurajan came in to Gharib and kissing his knee said to him O our Lord heal our hearts and give us this host to our share And he said Up and at them So the two Marids flew aloft high in the lift and lighting down in the pavilion of the King of Shiras found him seated on his chair of estate with the Prince of Persia Ward Shah son of Sabur sitting on his right hand and about him his Captains with whom he was taking counsel for the slaughter of the Moslems Kaylajan came forward and caught up the Prince and Kurajan snatched Up the King and the twain flew back with them to Gharib who caused beat them till they fainted Then the Marids returned to the Shirazian camp and drawing their swords which no mortal man had strength to wield fell upon the Misbelievers and Allah hurried their souls to the Fire and abiding place dire whilst they saw no one and nothing save two swords flashing and reaping men as a husbandman reaps corn So they left their tents and mounting their horses bare backed fled and the Marids pursued them two days and slew of them much people after which they returned and kissed Gharib s hand He thanked them for the deed they had done and said to them The spoil of the Infidels is yours alone none shall share with you therein So they called down blessings on him and going forth gathered the booty together and abode in their own homes On this wise it fared with them but as regards Gharib and his lieges And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Six Hundred and Seventy first Night She resumed It hath reached me O auspicious King that after Gharib had put to flight the host of Khirad Shah he bade Kaylajan and Kurajan take the spoil to their own possession nor hare it with any so they gathered the booty and abode in their own homes Meanwhile the remains of the beaten force ceased not flying till they reached the city of Shiras and there lifted up the voice of weeping and began the ceremonial lamentations for those of them that had been slain Now King Khirad Shah had a brother Siran the Sorcerer highs than whom there was no greater wizard in his day and he lived apart from his brother in a certain stronghold called the Fortalice of Fruits FN sixty eight in a place abounding in trees and streams and birds and blooms half a day s journey from Shiras So the fugitives betook them thither and went in to Siran the Sorcerer weeping and wailing aloud Quoth he O folk what garreth you weep and they told him all that had happened especially how the two Marids had carried off his brother Khirad Shah whereupon the light of his eyes became night and he said By the virtue of my faith I will certainly slay Gharib and all his men and leave not one alive to tell the tale Then he pronounced certain magical words and summoned the Red King who appeared and Siran said to him Fare for Isbanir and fall on Gharib as he sitteth upon his throne Replied he Hearkening and obedience and gathering his troops repaired to Isbanir and assailed Gharib who seeing him drew his sword Al Mahik and he and Kaylajan and Kurajan fell upon the army of the Red King and slew of them five hundred and thirty and wounded the King himself with a grevious wound whereupon he and his people fled and stayed not in their flight till they reached the Fortalice of Fruits and went into Siran crying out and exclaiming Woe and Ruin And the Red King said to Siran O sage Gharib hath with him the enchanted sword of Japhet son of Noah and whomsoever he smiteth therewith he severeth him in sunder and with him also are two Marids from Mount Caucasus given to him by King Mura ash He it is who slew the Blue King and Barkan Lord of the Carnelian City and did to death much people of the Jinn When the Enchanter heard this he said to the Red King Go and he went his ways whereupon he resumed his conjurations and calling up a Marid by name Zu azi a gave him a drachm of levigated Bhang and said to him Go thou to Isbanir and enter King Gharib s palace and assume the form of a sparrow Wait till he fall asleep and there be none with him then put the Bhang up his nostrils and bring him to me To hear is to obey replied the Marid and flew to Isbanir where changing himself into a sparrow he perched on the window of the palace and waited till all Gharib s attendants retired to their rooms and the King himself slept Then he flew down and going up to Gharib blew the powdered Bhang into his nostrils till he lost his senses whereupon he wrapped him in the bed coverlet and flew off with him like the storm wind to the Fortalice of Fruits where he arrived at midnight and laid his prize before Siran The Sorcerer thanked him and would have put Gharib to death as he lay senseless under Bhang but a man of his people withheld him saying O Sage an thou slay him his friend King Mura ash will fall on us with all his Ifrits and lay waste our realm How then shall we do with him asked Siran and the other answered Cast him into the Jayhun while he is still in Bhang and he shall be drowned and none will know who threw him in And Siran bade the Marid take Gharib and cast him into Jayhun river And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Six Hundred and Seventy second Night She resumed It hath reached me O auspicious King that the Marid took Gharib and carried him to the Jayhun purposing to cast him therein but it was grievous to him to drown him wherefore he made a raft of wood and binding it with cords pushed it out and Gharib thereon into the current which carried it away Thus fared it with Gharib but as regards his people when they awoke in the morning and went in to do their service to their King they found him not and seeing his rosary on the throne awaited him awhile but he came not So they sought out the head Chamberlain and said to him Go into the Harim and look for the King for it is not his habit to tarry till this time Accordingly the Chamberlain entered the Serraglio and enquired for the King but the women said Since yesterday we have not seen him Thereupon he returned and told the Officers who were confounded and said Let us see if he have gone to take his pleasure in the gardens Then they went out and questioned the gardeners if they had seen the King and they answered No whereat they were sore concerned and searched all the garths till the end of the day when they returned in tears Moreover the two Marids sought for him all round the city but came back after three days without having happened on any tidings of him So the people donned black and made their complaint to the Lord of all worshipping men who cloth as he is fain Meanwhile the current bore the raft along for five days till it brought it to the salt sea where the waves disported with Gharib and his stomach being troubled threw up the Bhang Then he opened his eyes and finding himself in the midst of the main a plaything of the billows said There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah the Glorious the Great Would to Heaven I wot who hath done this deed by me Presently as he lay perplexed concerning his case lo he caught sight of a ship sailing by and signalled with his sleeve to the sailors who came to him and took him up saying Who art thou and whence comest thou He replied Do ye feed me and give me to drink till I recover myself and after I will tell you who I am So they brought him water and victual and he ate and drank and Allah restored to him his reason Then he asked them O folk what countrymen are ye and what is your Faith and they answered We are from Karaj FN sixty nine and we worship an idol called Minkash Cried Gharib Perdition to you and your idol O dogs none is worthy of wor strip save Allah who creased all things who saith to a thing Be and it becometh When they heard this they rose up and fell upon him in great wrath and would have seized him Now he was without weapons but whomsoever he struck he smote down and deprived of life till he had felled forty men after which they overcame him by force of numbers and bound him fast saying We will not slay him save in our own land that we may first show him to our King Then they sailed on till they came to the city of Karaj And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Six Hundred and Seventy third Night She pursued It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the ship s crew seized Gharib and bound him fast they said We will not slay him save in our own land Then they sailed on till they came to the city of Karaj the builder whereof was an Amalekite fierce and furious and he had set up at each gate of the city a magical figure of copper which whenever a stranger entered blew a blast on a trumpet that all in the city heard it and fell upon the stranger and slew him except they embraced their creed When Gharib entered the city the figure stationed at the gate blew such a horrible blast that the King was affrighted and going into his idol found fire and smoke issuing from its mouth nose and eyes Now a Satan had entered the belly of the idol and speaking as with its tongue said O King there is come to thy city one highs Gharib King of Al Irak who biddeth the folk quit their belief and worship his Lord wherefore when they bring him before thee look thou spare him not So the King went out and sat down on his throne and presently the sailors brought in Gharib and set him before the presence saying O King we found this youth shipwrecked in the midst of the sea and he is a Kafir and believeth not in our gods Then they told him all that had passed and the King said Carry him to the house of the Great Idol and cut his throat before him so haply our god may look lovingly upon us But the Wazir said O King it befitteth not to slaughter him thus for he would die in a moment better we imprison him and build a pyre of fuel and burn him with fire Thereupon the King commanded to cast Gharib into gaol and caused wood to be brought and they made a mighty pyre and set fire to it and it burnt till the morning Then the King and the people of the city came forth and the Ruler sent to fetch Gharib but his lieges found him not so they returned and told their King who said And how made he his escape Quoth they We found the chains and shackles cast down and the doors fast locked Whereat the King marvelled and asked Hath this fellow to Heaven up flown or into the earth gone down and they answered We know not Then said the King I will go and question my God and he will inform me whither he is gone So he rose and went in to prostrate himself to his idol but found it not and began to rub his eyes and say Am I in sleep or on wake Then he turned to his Wazir and said to him Where is my God and where is my prisoner By my faith O dog of Wazirs haddest thou not counselled me to burn him I had slaughtered him for it is he who hath stolen my god and fled and there is no help but I take brood wreak of him Then he drew his sword and struck off the Wazir s head Now there was for Gharib s escape with the idol a strange cause and it was on this wise When they had shut him up in a cell adjoining the doomed shrine under which stood the idol he rose to pray calling upon the name of Almighty Allah and seeking deliverance of Him to whom be honour and glory The Marid who had charge of the idol and spoke in its name heard him and fear got hold upon his heart and he said O shame upon me Who is this seeth me while I see him not So he went in to Gharib and throwing himself at his feet said to him O my Lord what must I say that I may become of thy company and enter thy religion Replied Gharib Say There is no god but the God and Abraham is the Friend of God So the Marid pronounced the profession of Faith and was enrolled among the people of felicity Now his name was Zalzal son of Al Muzalzil FN seventy one of the Chiefs of the Kings of the Jinn Then he unbound Gharib and taking him and the idol made for the higher air And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Six Hundred and Seventy fourth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the Marid took up Gharib and the idol and made for the higher air Such was his case but as regards the King when his soldiers saw what had befallen and the slaughter of the Wazir they renounced the worship of the idol and drawing their swords slew the King after which they fell on one another and the sword went round amongst them three days till there abode alive but two men one of whom prevailed over the other and killed him Then the boys attacked the survivor and slew him and fell to fighting amongst themselves till they were all killed and the women and girls fled to the hamlets and forted villages wherefore the city became desert and none dwelt therein but the owl Meanwhile the Marid Zalzal flew with Gharib towards his own country the Island of Camphor and the Castle of Crystal and the Land of the Enchanted Calf so called because its King Al Muzalzil had a pied calf which he had clad in housings brocaded with red gold and worshipped as a god One day the King and his people went in to the calf and found him trembling so the King said O my God what hath troubled thee whereupon the Satan in the calf s belly cried out and said O Muzalzil verily thy son hath deserted to the Faith of Abraham the Friend at the hands of Gharib Lord of Al Irak and went on to tell him all that had passed from first to last When the King heard the words of his calf he was confounded and going forth sat down upon his throne Then he summoned his Grandees who came in a body and he told them what he had heard from the idol whereat they marvelled and said What shall we do O King Quoth he When my son cometh and ye see him embrace him do ye lay hold of him And they said Hearkening and obedience After two days came Zalzal and Gharib with the King s idol of Karaj but no sooner had they entered the palace gate than the Jinn seized on them and carried them before Al Muzalzil who looked at his son with eyes of ire and said to him O dog of the Jann hast thou left thy Faith and that of thy fathers and grandfathers Quoth Zalzal I have embraced the True Faith and on like wise do thou Woe be to thee seek salvation and thou shalt be saved from the wrath of the King Almighty in sway Creator of Night and Day Therewith his father waxed wroth and said O son of adultery dost confront me with these words Then he bade clap him in prison and turning to Gharib said to him O wretch of a mortal how hast thou abused my son s wit and seduced him from his Faith Quoth Gharib Indeed I have brought him out of wrongousness into the way of righteousness out of Hell into Heaven and out of unfaith to the True Faith Whereupon the King cried out to a Marid called Sayyar saying Take this dog and cast him into the Wady of Fire that he may perish Now this valley was in the Waste Quarter FN seventy one and was thus named from the excess of its heat and the flaming of its fire which was so fierce that none who went down therein could live an hour but was destroyed and it was compassed about by mountains high and slippery wherein was no opening So Sayyar took up Gharib and flew with him towards the Valley of Fire till he came within an hour s journey thereof when being weary he alighted in a valley full of trees and streams and fruits and setting down from his back Gharib chained as he was fell asleep for fatigue When Gharib heard him snore he strove with his bonds till he burst them then taking up a heavy stone he cast it down on the Marid s head and crushed his bones so that he died on the spot 
8266_258262_000005_000010	train-clean-360	Then he fared on into the valley And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

excuse hast thou And quoth he Know O my lord that I came out to avenge my mother and my father on Sabur King of the Persians for he would have slain them but my mother escaped and I know not whether he killed my father or not When Gharib heard these words he replied By Allah thou art indeed excusable But who were thy father and mother and what are their names Murad Shah said My sire was Gharib King of Al Irak and my mother Fakhr Taj daughter of King Sabur of Persia When Gharib heard this he gave a great cry and fell down fainting They sprinkled rose water on him till he came to himself when

mounted and repaired to his camp where his comrades met him rejoicing in his safety and asked him of his case but he answered This is no time for questions Then he went in to his mother and told her what had passed whereat she was gladdened with exceeding gladness so he carried her to Gharib and they two embraced and rejoiced in each other Then Fakhr Taj and Murad Shah islamised and expounded The

pilgrimage I turned back for visitation of the tomb of the Prophet whom Allah bless and keep One night as I sat in the garden FN eighty between the tomb and the pulpit I heard a low moaning in a soft voice so I listened to it and it said Have the doves that moan in the lotus tree Woke grief in thy heart and bred misery Or doth memory of maiden in beauty deckt Cause this doubt in thee this despondency O night thou art longsome for love sick sprite Complaining of Love and its ecstacy Thou makest him wakeful who burns with fire Of a love like the live coal s ardency The moon is witness my heart is held By a moonlight brow of the brightest blee I reckt not to see me by Love ensnared Till ensnared before I could reck or see Then the voice ceased and not knowing whence it came to me I abode perplexed but lo it again took up its lament and recited Came Rayya s phantom to grieve thy sight In the thickest gloom of the black haired Night And hath love of slumber deprived those eyes And the phantom vision vexed thy sprite I cried to the Night whose glooms were like Seas that surge and billow with might with might O Night thou art longsome to lover who Hath no aid nor help save the morning light She replied Complain not that I am long Tis love is the cause of thy longsome plight Now at the first of the couplets I sprang up and made for the quarter whence the sound came nor had the voice ended repeating them ere I was with the speaker and saw a youth of the utmost beauty the hair of whose side face had not sprouted and in whose cheeks tears had worn twin trenches And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Six Hundred and Eighty first Night She continued It hath reached me O auspicious King that Abdullah bin Ma amar

hair had not sprouted and in whose cheeks tears had worn twin trenches Quoth I to him Fair befal thee for a youth and quoth he And thee also Who art thou I replied Abdullah bin Ma amar al Kaysi and he said Dost thou want aught I rejoined I was sitting in the garden and naught hath troubled me this night but thy voice With my life would I ransom thee What aileth thee He said Sit thee down So I sat down and he continued I am Otbah bin al Hubab bin al Mundhir bin al Jamuh the Ansari FN eighty one I went out in the morning to the Mosque Al Ahzab FN eighty two and occupied myself there awhile with prayer bows and prostrations after which I withdrew apart to worship privily But lo up came women as they were moons walking with a swaying gait and surrounding a damsel of passing loveliness perfect in beauty and grace who stopped before me and said O Otbah what sayst thou of union with one who seeketh union with thee Then she left me and went away and since that time I have had no tidings of her nor come upon any trace of her and behold I am distracted and do naught but remove from place to place Then he cried out and fell to the ground fainting When he came to himself it was as if the damask of his cheeks were dyed with safflower FN eighty three and he recited these couplets I see you with my heart from far countrie Would Heaven you also me from far could see My heart and eyes for you are sorrowing My soul with you abides and you with me I take no joy in life when you re unseen Or Heaven or Garden of Eternity Said I O Otbah O son of my uncle repent to thy Lord and crave pardon for thy sin for before thee is the terror of standing up to Judgment He replied Far be it from me so to do I shall never leave to love till the two mimosa gatherers return FN eighty four I abode with him till daybreak when I said to him Come let us go to the Mosque Al Ahzab So we went thither and sat there till we had prayed the midday prayers when lo up came the women but the damsel was not among them

them the name of the damsel and they said She is called Rayya daughter of Al Ghitrif al Sulami FN eighty six Whereupon Otbah raised his head and recited these verses My friends Rayya hath mounted soon as morning shone And to Samawah s wilds her caravan is gone My friends I ve wept till I can weep no more Oh say Hath any one a tear that I can take on loan Then said I to him O Otbah I have brought with me great wealth wherewith I desire to succour generous men and by Allah I will lavish it before thee FN eighty seven so thou mayst attain thy desire and more than thy desire Come with me to the assembly of the Ansaris So we rose and went till we entered their assembly when I salam d to them and they returned my greeting civilly Then quoth I O assembly what say ye of Otbah and his father and they replied They are of the princes of the Arabs I continued Know that he is smitten with the calamity of love and I desire your furtherance to Al Samawah And they said To hear is to obey So they mounted with us the whole party and we rode till we drew near the place of the Banu Sulaym Now when Ghitrif heard of our being near he hastened forth to meet us saying Long life to you O nobles whereto we replied And to thee also Behold we are thy guests Quoth he Ye have lighted down at a most hospitable abode and ample and alighting he cried out Ho all ye slaves come down So they came down and spread skin rugs and cushions and slaughtered sheep and cattle but we said We will not taste of thy food till thou have accomplished our need He asked And what is your need and we answered We demand thy noble daughter in marriage for Otbah bin Hubab bin Mundhir the illustrious and well born O my brethren said he she whom you demand is owner of herself and I will go in to her and tell her So he rose in wrath FN eighty eight and went in to Rayya who said to him O my papa why do I see thee show anger And he replied saying Certain of the Ansaris have come upon me to demand thy hand of me in marriage Quoth she They are noble chiefs the Prophet on whom be the choicest blessings and peace intercedeth for them with Allah For whom among them do they ask me Quoth he For a youth known as Otbah bin al Hubab and she said I have heard of Otbah that he performeth what he promised and findeth what he seeketh Ghitrif cried I swear that I will never marry thee to him no never for there hath been reported to me somewhat of thy converse with him Said she What was that But in any case I swear that the Ansaris shall not be uncivilly rejected wherefore do thou offer them a fair excuse How so Make the dowry heavy to them and they will desist Thou sayst well said he and going out in haste told the Ansaris The damsel of the tribe FN eighty nine consenteth but she requireth a dowry worthy herself Who engageth for this I answered I Then said he I require for her a thousand bracelets of red gold and five thousand dirhams of the coinage of Hajar FN ninety and a hundred pieces of woollen cloth and striped stuffs FN ninety one of Al Yaman and five bladders of ambergris Said I Thou shalt have that much dost thou consent and he said I do consent So I despatched to Al Medinah the Illumined FN ninety two a party of the Ansaris who brought all for which I had become surety whereupon they slaughtered sheep and cattle and the folk assembled to eat of the food We abode thus forty days when Ghitrif said to us Take your bride So we sat her in a dromedary litter and her father equipped her with thirty camel loads of things of price after which we farewelled him and journeyed till we came within a day s journey of Al Medinah the Illumined when there fell upon us horsemen with intent to plunder and methinks they were of the Banu Sulaym Otbah drove at them and slew of them much people but fell back wounded by a lance thrust and presently dropped to the earth Then there came to us succour of the country people who drove away the highwaymen but Otbah s days were ended So we said Alas for Otbah oh and the damsel hearing it cast herself down from the camel and throwing herself upon him cried out grievously and repeated these couplets Patient I seemed yet Patience shown by me Was but self guiling till thy sight I see Had my soul done as due my life had gone Had fled before mankind forestalling thee Then after me and thee none shall to friend Be just nor any soul with soul agree Then she sobbed a single sob and gave up the ghost We dug one grave for them and laid them in the earth and I returned to the dwellings of my people where I abode seven years Then I betook me again to Al Hijaz and entering Al Medinah the Illumined for pious visitation said in my mind By Allah I will go again to Otbah s tomb So I repaired thither and behold over the grave was a tall tree on which hung fillets of red and green and yellow stuffs FN ninety three So I asked the people of the place How be this tree called and they answered The tree of the Bride and the Bridegroom I abode by the tomb a day and a night then went my way and this is all I know of Otbah Almighty Allah have mercy upon him And they also tell this tale of HIND DAUGHTER OF AL NU MAN AND AL HAJJAJ FN ninety

her So he took her to wife engaging to give her a dowry of two hundred thousand dirhams in case of divorce and when he went into her he abode with her a long time One day after this he went in to her and found her looking at her face in the mirror and saying Hind is an Arab filly purest bred Which hath been covered by a mongrel mule An colt of horse she throw by Allah well If mule it but results from mulish rule FN ninety five When Al Hajjaj heard this he turned back and went his way unseen of Hind and being minded to put her away he sent Abdullah bin Tahir to her to divorce her So Abdullah went in to her and said to her Al Hajjaj Abu Mohammed saith to thee Here be the two hundred thousand dirhams of thy contingent dowry he oweth thee and he hath deputed me to divorce thee Replied she O Ibn Tahir I gladly agree to this for know that I never for one day took pleasure in him so if we separate by Allah I shall never regret him and these two hundred thousand dirhams I give to thee as a reward for the glad tidings thou bringest me of my release from yonder dog of the Thakafites FN ninety six After this the Commander of the Faithful Abd al Malik bin Marwan heard of her beauty and loveliness her stature and symmetry her sweet speech and the amorous grace of her glances and sent to her to ask her in marriage And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted

loveliness sent to ask her in marriage and she wrote him in reply a letter in which after the glorification of Allah and benediction of His Prophet she said But afterwards Know O Commander of the Faithful that the dog hath lapped in the vase When the Caliph read her answer he laughed and wrote to her citing his saying whom may Allah bless and keep If a dog lap in the vessel of one of you let him wash seven times once thereof with earth and adding Wash the affront from the place of use FN ninety seven With this she could not gainsay him so she replied to him saying after praise and blessing O Commander of the Faithful I will not consent save on one condition and if thou ask me what it is I reply that Al Hajjaj lead my camel to the town where thou tarriest barefoot and clad as he is FN ninety eight When the Caliph read her letter he laughed long and loudly and sent to Al Hajjaj bidding him to do as she wished He dared not disobey the order so he submitted to the Caliph s commandment and sent to Hind telling her to make ready for the journey So she made ready and mounted her litter when Al Hajjaj with his suite came up to Hind s door and as she mounted and her damsels and eunuchs rode around her he dismounted and took the halter of her camel and led it along barefooted whilst she and her damsels and tirewomen laughed and jeered at him and made mock of him Then she said to her tirewoman Draw back the curtain of the litter and she drew back the curtain till Hind was face to face with Al Hajjaj whereupon she laughed at him and he improvised this couplet Though now thou jeer O Hind how many a night I ve left thee wakeful sighing for the light And she answered him with these two We reck not an our life escape from bane For waste of wealth and gear that went in vain Money may be regained and rank re won When one is cured of malady and pain And she ceased not to laugh at him and make sport of him till they drew near the city of the Caliph when she threw down a dinar with her own hand and said to Al Hajjaj O camel driver I have dropped a dirham look for it and give it to me So he looked and seeing naught but the dinar said This is a dinar She replied Nay tis a dirham But he said This is a dinar Then quoth she Praise be Allah who hath given us in exchange for a paltry dirham a dinar Give it us And Al Hajjaj was abashed at this Then he carried her to the palace of the Commander of the Faithful and she went in to him and became his favourite And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Six Hundred and Eighty third Night She pursued It hath reached me O auspicious King that men also tell a tale anent KHUZAYMAH BIN BISHR AND IKRIMAH AL FAYYAZ FN ninety nine There lived once in the days of the Caliph Sulayman bin Abd al Malik FN one hundred a man of the Banu Asad by name Khuzaymah bin Bishr who was famed for bounty and abundant wealth and excellence and righteous dealing with his brethren He continued thus till times grew strait with him and he became in need of the aid of those Moslem brethren on whom he had lavished favour and kindness So they succoured him a while and then grew weary of him which when he saw he went in to his wife who was the daughter of his father s brother and said to her O my cousin I find a change in my brethren wherefore I am resolved to keep my house till death come to me So he shut his door and abode in his home living on that which he had by him till it was spent and he knew not what to do Now Ikrimah al Raba i surnamed Al Fayyaz governor of Mesopotamia FN one hundred one had known him and one day as he sat in his Audience chamber mention was made of Khuzaymah whereupon quoth Ikrimah How is it with him And quoth they He is in a plight past telling and hath shut his door and keepeth the house Ikrimah rejoined This cometh but of his excessive generosity but how is it that Khuzaymah bin Bishr findeth nor comforter nor requiter And they replied He hath found naught of this So when it was night Ikrimah took four thousand dinars and laid them in one purse then bidding saddle his beast he mounted and rode privily to Khuzaymah s house attended only by one of his pages carrying the money When he came to the door he alighted and taking the purse from the page made him withdraw afar off after which he went up to the door and knocked Khuzaymah came out to him and he gave him the purse saying Better thy case herewith He took it and finding it heavy put it from his hand and laying hold of the bridle of Ikrimah s horse asked Who art thou My soul be thy ransom Answered Ikrimah O man I come not to thee at a time like this desiring that thou shouldst know me Khuzaymah rejoined I will not let thee go till thou make thyself known to me whereupon Ikrimah said I am hight Jabir Atharat al Kiram FN one hundred two Quoth Khuzaymah Tell me more But Ikrimah cried No and fared forth whilst Khuzaymah went in to his cousin and said to her Rejoice for Allah hath sent us speedy relief and wealth if these be but dirhams yet are they many Arise and light the lamp She said I have not wherewithal to light it So he spent the night handling the coins and felt by their roughness that they were dinars but could not credit it Meanwhile Ikrimah returned to his own house and found that his wife had missed him and asked for him and when they told her of his riding forth she misdoubted of him and said to him Verily the Wali of Al Jazirah rideth not abroad after such an hour of the night unattended and secretly save to a wife or a mistress He answered Allah knoweth that I went not forth to either of these Tell me then wherefore thou wentest forth I went not forth at this hour save that none should know it I must needs be told Wilt thou keep the matter secret if I tell thee Yes So he told her the state of the case adding Wilt thou have me swear to thee Answered she No no my heart is set at ease and trusteth in that which thou hast told me As for Khuzaymah soon as it was day he made his peace with his creditors and set his affairs in order after which he got him ready and set out for the Court of Sulayman bin Abd al Malik who was then sojourning in Palestine FN one hundred three When he came to the royal gate he sought admission of the chamberlain who went in and told the Caliph of his presence Now he was renowned for his beneficence and Sulayman knew of him so he bade admit him When he entered he saluted the Caliph after the usual fashion of saluting FN one hundred four and the King asked O Khuzaymah what hath kept thee so long from us Answered he Evil case and quoth the Caliph What hindered thee from having recourse to us Quoth he My infirmity O Commander of the Faithful And why said Sulayman comest thou to us now Khuzaymah replied Know O Commander of the Faithful that I was sitting one night late in my house when a man knocked at the door and did thus and thus and he went on to tell him of all that had passed between Ikrimah and himself from first to last Sulayman asked Knowest thou the man and Khuzaymah answered No O Commander of the Faithful he was reserved FN one hundred five and would say naught save I am hight Jabir Atharat al Kiram When Sulayman heard this his heart burned within him for anxiety to discover the man and he said If we knew him truly we would requite him for his generosity Then he bound for Khuzaymah a banner FN one hundred six and made him Governor of Mesopotamia in the stead of Ikrimah Al Fayyaz and he set out for Al Jazirah When he drew near the city Ikrimah and the people of the place came forth to meet him and they saluted each other and went on into the town where Khuzaymah took up his lodging in the Government house and bade take security for Ikrimah and that he should be called to account FN one hundred seven So an account was taken against him and he was found to be in default for much money whereupon Khuzaymah required of him payment but he said I have no means of paying aught Quoth Khuzaymah It must be paid and quoth Ikrimah I have it not do what thou hast to do So Khuzaymah ordered him to gaol And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Six Hundred and Eighty fourth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that Khuzaymah having ordered the imprisonment of Ikrimah Al Fayyaz sent to him again to demand payment of the debt but he replied I am not of those who preserve their wealth at the expense of their honour do what thou wilt Then Khuzaymah bade load him with irons and kept him in prison a month or more till confinement began to tell upon him and he became wasted After this tidings of his plight travelled to the daughter of his uncle who was troubled with sore concern thereat and sending for a freedwoman of hers a woman of abundant judgment and experience said to her Go forthwith to the Emir Khuzaymah s gate and say I have a counsel for the Emir If they ask what it is add I will not tell it save to himself and when thou enterest to him beg to see him in private and when private ask him What be this deed thou hast done Hath Jabir Atharat al Kiram deserved of thee no better reward than to be cast into strait prison and hard bond of irons The woman did as she was bid and when Khuzaymah heard her words he cried out at the top of his voice saying Alas the baseness of it Was it indeed he And she answered Yes Then he bade saddle his beast forthwith and summoning the honourable men of the city repaired with them to the prison and opening the door went in with them to Ikrimah whom they found sitting in evil case worn out and wasted with blows and misery When he looked at Khuzaymah he was abashed and hung his head but the other bent down to him and kissed his face whereupon he raised his head and asked What maketh thee do this Answered Khuzaymah The generosity of thy dealing and the vileness of my requital And Ikrimah said Allah pardon us and thee Then Khuzaymah commanded the jailor to strike off Ikrimah s fetters and clap them on his own feet but Ikrimah said What is this thou wilt do Quoth the other I have a mind to suffer what thou hast suffered Quoth Ikrimah I conjure thee by Allah do not so Then they went out together and returned to Khuzaymah s house where Ikrimah would have farewelled him and wended his way but he forbade him and Ikrimah said What is thy will of me Replied Khuzaymah I wish to change thy case for my shame before the daughter of thine uncle is yet greater than my shame before thee So he bade clear the bath and entering with Ikrimah served him there in person and when they went forth be bestowed on him a splendid robe of honour and mounted him and gave him much money Then he carried him to his house and asked his leave to make his excuses to his wife and obtained her pardon After this he besought him to accompany him to the Caliph who was then abiding at Ramlah FN one hundred eight and he agreed So they journeyed thither and when they reached the royal quarters the chamberlain went in and acquainted the Caliph Sulayman bin Abd al Malik with Khuzaymah s arrival whereat he was troubled and said What is the Governor of Mesopotamia come without our command This can be only on some grave occasion Then he bade admit him and said before saluting him What is behind thee O Khuzaymah Replied he Good O Commander of the Faithful Asked Sulayman What bringeth thee and he answered saying I have discovered Jabir Atharat al Kiram and thought to gladden thee with him knowing thine excessive desire to know him and thy longing to see him Who is he quoth the Caliph and quoth Khuzaymah He is Ikrimah Al Fayyaz So Sulayman called for Ikrimah who approached and saluted him as Caliph and the King welcomed him and making him draw near his sitting place said to him O Ikrimah thy good deed to him hath brought thee naught but evil adding Now write down in a note thy needs each and every and that which thou desirest He did so and the Caliph commanded to do all that he required and that forthwith Moreover he gave him ten thousand dinars more than he asked for and twenty chests of clothes over and above that he sought and calling for a spear bound him a banner and made him Governor over Armenia and Azarbijan FN one hundred nine and Mesopotamia saying Khuzaymah s case is in thy hands an thou wilt continue him in his office and if thou wilt degrade him And Ikrimah said Nay but I restore him to his office O Commander of the Faithful Then they went out from him and ceased not to be Governors under Sulayman bin Abd al Malik all the days of his Caliphate And they also tell a tale of YUNUS THE SCRIBE AND THE CALIPH WALID BIN SAHL There lived in the reign of the Caliph Hisham FN one hundred ten son of Abd al Malik a man called Yunus the Scribe well known to the general and he set out one day on a journey to Damascus having with him a slave girl of surpassing beauty and loveliness whom he had taught all that was needful to her and whose price was an hundred thousand dirhams When they drew near to Damascus the caravan halted by the side of a lake and Yunus went down to a quiet place with his damsel and took out some victual he had with him and a leather bottle of wine As he sat at meat behold came up a young man of goodly favour and dignified presence mounted on a sorrel horse and followed by two eunuchs and said to him Wilt thou accept me to guest Yes replied Yunus So the stranger alighted and said Give me to drink of thy wine Yunus gave him to drink and he said If it please thee sing us a song So Yunus sang this couplet extempore She joineth charms were never seen conjoined in mortal dress And for her love she makes me love my tears and wakefulness At which the stranger rejoiced with exceeding joy and Yunus gave him to drink again and again till the wine got the better of him and he said Bid thy slave girl sing So she improvised this couplet A houri by whose charms my heart is moved to sore distress Nor wand of tree nor sun nor moon her rivals I confess The stranger was overjoyed with this and they sat drinking till nightfall when they prayed the evening prayer and the youth said to Yunus What bringeth thee to our city He replied Quest of wherewithal to pay my debts and better my case Quoth the other Wilt thou sell me this slave girl for thirty thousand dirhams Whereto quoth Yunus I must have more than that He asked Will forty thousand content thee but Yunus answered That would only settle my debts and I should remain empty handed Rejoined the stranger We will take her of thee of fifty thousand dirhams FN one hundred eleven and give thee a suit of clothes to boot and the expenses of thy journey and make thee a sharer in my condition as long as thou livest Cried Yunus I sell her to thee on these terms Then said the young man Wilt thou trust me to bring thee the money to morrow and let me take her with me or shall she abide with thee till I pay down her price Whereto wine and shame and awe of the stranger led Yunus to reply I will trust thee take her and Allah bless thee in her Whereupon the visitor bade one of his pages sit her before him on his beast and mounting his own horse farewelled of Yunus and rode away out of sight Hardly had he left him when the seller bethought himself and knew that he had erred in selling her and said to himself What have I done I have delivered my slave girl to a man with whom I am unacquainted neither know I who he is and grant that I were acquainted with him how am I to get at him So he abode in thought till the morning when he prayed the dawn prayers and his companions entered Damascus whilst he sat perplexed and wotting not what to do till the sun scorched him and it irked him to abide there He thought to enter the city but said in his mind If I enter Damascus I cannot be sure but that the messenger will come and find me not in which case I shall have sinned against myself a second sin Accordingly he sat down in the shade of a wall that was there and towards the wane of day up came one of the eunuchs whom he had seen with the young man whereat great joy possessed Yunus and he said in himself I know not that aught hath ever given me more delight than the sight of this castrato When the eunuch reached him he said to him O my lord we have kept thee long waiting but Yunus disclosed nothing to him of the torments of anxiety he had suffered Then quoth the castrato Knowest thou the man who bought the girl of thee and quoth Yunus No to which the other rejoined Twas Walid bin Sahl FN one hundred twelve the Heir Apparent And Yunus was silent Then said the eunuch Ride and made him mount a horse he had with him and they rode till they came to a mansion where they dismounted and entered Here Yunus found the damsel who sprang up at his sight and saluted him He asked her how she had fared with him who had bought her and she answered He lodged me in this apartment and ordered me all I needed Then he sat with her awhile till suddenly one of the servants of the houseowner came in and bade him rise and follow him So he followed the man into the presence of his master and found him yesternight s guest whom he saw seated on his couch and who said to him Who art thou I am Yunus the Scribe Welcome to thee O Yunus by Allah I have long wished to look on thee for I have heard of thy report How didst thou pass the night Well may Almighty Allah advance thee Peradventure thou repentedest thee of that thou didst yesterday and saidst to thyself I have delivered my slave girl to a man with who I am not acquainted neither know I his name nor whence he cometh Allah forbid O Emir that I should repent over her Had I made gift of her to the Prince she were the least of the gifts that are given unto him And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

twenty one to your nests return Your mournful voices thrill this heart of mine Then back a copse they flew and well nigh took My life and made me tell my secret pine With cooing call they one who s gone as though Their breasts were maddened with the rage of wine Ne er did mine eyes their like for culvers see Who weep yet tear drops never dye their eyne And also these couplets O Zephyr of Najd when from Najd thou blow Thy breathings heap only new woe on woe The turtle bespake me in bloom of morn From the cassia twig an the willow bough She moaned with the moaning of love sick youth And exposed love secret I ne er would show They say lover wearies of love when near And is cured of love an afar he go I tried either cure which ne er cured my love But that nearness is better than farness I know FN one hundred twenty two Yet the nearness of love shall no vantage prove An whoso thou lovest deny thee of love Then said he O Ibrahim sing this song after me and preserving the mode thereof in thy singing teach it to thy slave girls Quoth I Repeat it to me But he answered There needs no repetition thou hast it by heart nor is there more to learn Then he suddenly vanished from my sight At this I was amazed and running to my sword drew it and made for the door of the Harim but found it closed and said to the women What have ye heard Quoth they We have heard the sweetest of singing and the goodliest Then I went forth amazed to the house door and finding it locked questioned the doorkeepers of the old man They replied What old man By Allah no one hath gone in to thee this day So I returned pondering the matter when behold there arose from one of the corners of the house a Vox et praeterea nihil saying O Abu Ishak no harm shall befal thee Tis I Abu Murrah FN one hundred twenty three who have been thy cup companion this day so fear nothing Then I mounted and rode to the palace where I told Al Rashid what had passed and he said Repeat to me the airs thou heardest from him So I took the lute and played and sang them to him for behold they were rooted in my heart The Caliph was charmed with them and drank thereto albeit he was no confirmed wine bibber saying Would he would some day pleasure us with his company as he hath pleasured thee FN one hundred twenty four Then he ordered me a present and I took it and went away And men relate this story anent THE LOVERS OF THE BANU UZRAH FN one hundred twenty five Quoth Masrur the Eunuch The Caliph Harun Al Rashid was very wakeful one night and said to me See which of the poets is at the door to night So I went out and finding Jamil bin Ma amar al Uzri FN one hundred twenty six in the antechamber said to him Answer the Commander of the Faithful Quoth he I hear and I obey and going in with me saluted the Caliph who returned his greeting and bade him sit down Then he said to him O Jamil hast thou any of thy wonderful new stories to tell us He replied Yes O Commander of the Faithful wouldst thou fainer hear that which I have seen with mine eyes or that which I have only heard Quoth the Caliph Tell me something thou hast actually beheld Quoth Jamil Tis well O Prince of True Believers incline thy heart to me and lend me thine ears The Caliph took a bolster of red brocade purfled with gold and stuffed with ostrich feathers and laying it under his thighs propped up both elbows thereon then he said to Jamil Now FN one hundred twenty seven for thy tale O Jamil Thereupon he begun Know O Commander of the Faithful that I was once desperately enamoured of a certain girl and used to pay her frequent visits And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Six Hundred and Eighty ninth Night She pursued It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the Caliph had propped his elbows upon the brocaded cushion he said Out with thy tale O Jamil and the poet begun Know O Commander of the Faithful I was desperately in love with a girl and used often to visit her because she was my desire and delight of all the things of this world After a while her people removed with her by reason of scarcity of pasture and I abode some time without seeing her till I grew restless for desire and longed for her sight and the flesh FN one hundred twenty eight urged me to journey to her One night I could hold out no longer so I rose and saddling my she camel bound on my turban and donned my oldest dress FN one hundred twenty nine Then I baldricked myself with my sword and slinging my spear behind me mounted and rode forth in quest of her I fared on fast till one night it was pitch dark and exceeding black yet I persisted in the hard task of climbing down Wadys and up hills hearing on all sides the roaring of lions and howling of wolves and the cries of the wild beasts My reason was troubled thereat and my heart sank within me but for all that my tongue ceased not to call on the name of Almighty Allah As I went along thus sleep overtook me and the camel carried me aside out of my road till presently something FN one hundred thirty smote me on the head and I woke startled and alarmed and found myself in a pasturage full of trees and streams and birds on the branches warbling their various speech and notes As the trees were tangled I alighted and taking my camel s halter in hand fared on softly with her till I got clear of the thick growth and came out into the open country where I adjusted her saddle and mounted again knowing not where to go nor whither the Fates should lead me but presently peering afar into the desert I espied a fire in its middle depth So I smote my camel and made for the fire When I drew near I saw a tent pitched and fronted by a spear stuck in the ground with a pennon flying FN one hundred thirty one and horses tethered and camels feeding and said in myself Doubtless there hangeth some grave matter by this tent for I see none other than it in the desert So I went up thereto and said Peace be with you O people of the tent and the mercy of Allah and His Blessing Whereupon there came forth to me a young man as youths are when nineteen years old who was like the full moon shining in the East with valour written between his eyes and answered saying And with thee be the Peace and Allah s mercy and His blessing O brother of the Arabs methinks thou hast lost thy way Replied I Even so direct me right Allah have mercy on thee He rejoined O brother of the Arabs of a truth this our land is infested with lions and the night is exceeding dark and dreary beyond measure cold and gloomy and I fear lest the wild beasts rend thee in pieces wherefore do thou alight and abide with me this night in ease and comfort and to morrow I will put thee in the right way Accordingly I dismounted and hobbled my she camel with the end of her halter FN one hundred thirty two then I put off my heavy upper clothes and sat down Presently the young man took a sheep and slaughtered it and kindled a brisk fire after which he went into the tent and bringing out finely powdered salt and spices fell to cutting off pieces of mutton and roasting them over the fire and feeding me therewith weeping at one while and sighing at another Then he groaned heavily and wept sore and improvised these couplets There remains to him naught save a flitting breath And an eye whose babe ever wandereth There remains not a joint in his limbs but what Disease firm fixt ever tortureth His tears are flowing his vitals burning Yet for all his tongue still he silenceth All foemen in pity beweep his woes Ah for freke whom the foeman pitieth By this I knew O Commander of the Faithful that the youth was a distracted lover for none knoweth passion save he who hath tasted the passion savour and quoth I to myself Shall I ask him But I consulted my judgment and said How shall I assail him with questioning and I in his abode So I restrained myself and ate my sufficiency of the meat When we had made an end of eating the young man arose and entering the tent brought out a handsome basin and ewer and a silken napkin whose ends were purfled with red gold and a sprinkling bottle full of rose water mingled with musk I marvelled at his dainty delicate ways and said in my mind Never wot I of delicacy in the desert Then we washed our hands and talked a while after which he went into the tent and making a partition between himself and me with a piece of red brocade said to me Enter O Chief of the Arabs and take thy rest for thou hast suffered more of toil and travel than sufficeth this night and in this thy journey So I entered and finding a bed of green brocade doffed my dress and passed a night such as I had never passed in my life And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Six Hundred and Ninetieth Night She resumed It hath reached me O auspicious King that Jamil spoke saying Never in my life passed I a night like that I pondered the young man s case till the world was dark and all eyes slept when I was aroused by the sound of a low voice never heard I a softer or sweeter I raised the curtain which hung between us and saw a damsel never beheld I a fairer of face by the young man s side and they were both weeping and complaining one to other of the pangs of passion and desire and of the excess of their longing for union FN one hundred thirty three Quoth I By Allah I wonder who may be this second one When I entered this tent there was none therein save this young man And after reflection I added Doubtless this damsel is of the daughters of the Jinn and is enamoured of this youth so they have secluded themselves with each other in this solitary place Then I considered her closely and behold she was a mortal and an Arab girl whose face when she unveiled shamed the shining sun and the tent was lit up by the light of her countenance When I was assured that she was his beloved I bethought me of lover jealousy so I let drop the curtain and covering my face fell asleep As soon as it was dawn I arose and donning my clothes made the Wuzu ablution and prayed such prayers as are obligatory and which I had deferred Then I said O brother of the Arabs wilt thou direct me into the right road and thus add to thy favours He replied At thy leisure O chief of the Arabs the term of the guest rite is three days FN one hundred thirty four and I am not one to let thee go before that time So I abode with him three days and on the fourth day as we sat talking I asked him of his name and lineage Quoth he As for my lineage I am of the Banu Odhrah my name is such an one son of such an one and my father s brother is called such an one And behold O Commander of the Faithful he was the son of my paternal uncle and of the noblest house of the Banu Uzrah Said I O my cousin what moved thee to act on this wise secluding thyself in the waste and leaving thy fair estate and that of thy father and thy slaves and handmaids When he heard my words his eyes filled with tears and he replied Know O my cousin that I fell madly in love of the daughter of my father s brother fascinated by her distracted for her passion possessed as by a Jinn wholly unable to let her out of my sight So I sought her in marriage of her sire but he refused and married her to a man of the Banu Odhrah who went in to her and carried her to his abiding place this last year When she was thus far removed from me and I was prevented from looking on her the fiery pangs of passion and excess of love longing and desire drove me to forsake my clan FN one hundred thirty five and friends and fortune and take up my abode in this desert where I have grown used to my solitude I asked Where are their dwellings and he answered They are hard by on the crest of yonder hill and every night at the dead time when all eyes sleep she stealeth secretly out of the camp unseen of any one and I satisfy my desire of her converse and she of mine FN one hundred thirty six So I abide thus solacing myself with her a part of the night till Allah work out that which is to be wrought either I shall compass my desire in spite FN one hundred thirty seven of the envious or Allah will determine for me and He is the best of determinators Now when the youth told me his case O Commander of the Faithful I was concerned for him and perplexed by reason of my jealousy for his honour so I said to him O son of my uncle wilt thou that I point out to thee a plan and suggest to thee a project whereby please Allah thou shalt find perfect welfare and the way of right and successful issue whereby the Almighty shall do away from thee that thou dreadest He replied Say on O my cousin and quoth I When it is night and the girl cometh set her on my she camel which is swift of pace and mount thou thy steed whilst I bestride one of these dromedaries So will we fare on all night and when the morrow morns we shall have traversed wolds and wastes and thou wilt have attained thy desire and won the beloved of thy heart The Almighty s earth is wide and by Allah I will back thee with heart and wealth and sword And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Six Hundred and Ninety first Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Jamil advised the elopement and night journey promising his aid as long as he lived the youth accepted and said O cousin wait till I take counsel with her for she is quick witted and prudent and hath insight into affairs So continued Jamil when the night darkened and the hour of her coming arrived and he awaiting her at the appointed tide she delayed beyond her usual time and I saw him go forth the door of the tent and opening his mouth inhale the wafts of breeze that blew from her quarter as if to snuff her perfume and he repeated these two couplets Breeze of East who bringest me gentle air From the place of sojourn where dwells my fair O Breeze of the lover thou bearest sign Canst not of her coming some signal bear Then he entered the tent and sat weeping awhile after which he said to me O my cousin some mischance must have betided the daughter of mine uncle or some accident must have hindered her from coming to me this night presently adding But abide where thou art till I bring thee the news And he took sword and shield and was absent a while of the night after which he returned carrying something in hand and called aloud to me So I hastened to him and he said O my cousin knowest thou what hath happened I replied No by Allah Quoth he Verily I am distraught concerning my cousin this night for as she was coming to me a lion met her in the way and devoured her and there remaineth of her but what thou seest So saying he threw down what he had in his hand and behold it was the damsel s turband and what was left of her bones Then he wept sore and casting down his bow FN one hundred thirty eight took a bag and went forth again saying Stir not hence till I return to thee if it please Almighty Allah He was absent a while and presently returned bearing in his hand a lion s head which he threw on the ground and called for water So I brought him water with which he washed the lion s mouth and fell to kissing it and weeping and he mourned for her exceedingly and recited these couplets Ho thou lion who broughtest thyself to woe Thou art slain and worse sorrows my bosom rend Thou hast reft me of fairest companionship Made her home Earth s womb till the world shall end To Time who hath wrought me such grief I say Allah grant in her stead never show a friend Then said he to me O cousin I conjure thee by Allah and the claims of kindred and consanguinity FN one hundred thirty nine between us keep thou my charge Thou wilt presently see me dead before thee whereupon do thou wash me and shroud me and these that remain of my cousin s bones in this robe and bury us both in one grave and write thereon these two couplets On Earth surface we lived in rare ease and joy By fellowship joined in one house and home But Fate with her changes departed us And the shroud conjoins us in Earth s cold womb Then he wept with sore weeping and entering the tent was absent awhile after which he came forth groaning and crying out Then he gave one sob and departed this world When I saw that he was indeed dead it was grievous to me and so sore was my sorrow for him that I had well nigh followed him for excess of mourning over him Then I laid him out and did as he had enjoined me shrouding his cousin s remains with him in one robe and laying the twain in one grave I abode by their tomb three days after which I departed and continued to pay frequent pious visits FN one hundred forty to the place for two years This then is their story O Commander of the Faithful Al Rashid was pleased with Jamil s story and rewarded him with a robe of honour and a handsome present And men also tell a tale concerning THE BADAWI AND HIS WIFE FN one hundred forty one Caliph Mu awiyah was sitting one day in his palace FN one hundred forty two at Damascus in a room whose windows were open on all four sides that the breeze might enter from every quarter Now it was a day of excessive heat with no breeze from the hills stirring and the middle of the day when the heat was at its height and the Caliph saw a man coming along scorched by the heat of the ground and limping as he fared on barefoot Mu awiyah considered him awhile and said to his courtiers Hath Allah may He be extolled and exalted created any miserabler than he who need must hie abroad at such an hour and in such sultry tide as this Quoth one of them Haply he seeketh the Commander of the Faithful and quoth the Caliph By Allah if he seek me I will assuredly give to him and if he be wronged I will certainly succour him Ho boy Stand at the door and if yonder wild Arab seek to come in to me forbid him not therefrom So the page went out and presently the Arab came up to him and he said What dost thou want Answered the other I want the Commander of the Faithful and the page said Enter So he entered and saluted the Caliph And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Six Hundred and Ninety second Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the page allowed him to enter the Badawi saluted the Caliph who said to him Who art thou Replied the Arab I am a man of the Banu Tamim FN one hundred forty three And what bringeth thee here at this season asked Mu awiyah and the Arab answered I come to thee complaining and thy protection imploring Against whom Against Marwan bin al Hakam FN one hundred forty four thy deputy replied he and began reciting Mu awiyah FN one hundred forty five thou general rous lord and best of men that be And oh thou lord of learning grace and fair humanity Thee wards I come because my way of life is strait to me O help and let me not despair thine equity to see Deign thou redress the wrong that dealt the tyrant whim of him Who better had my life destroyed than made such wrong to dree He robbed me of my wife Su ad and proved him worst of foes Stealing mine honour mid my folk with foul iniquity And went about to take my life before th appointed day Hath dawned which Allah made my lot by destiny s decree Now when Mu awiyah heard him recite these verses with the fire flashing from his mouth he said to him Welcome and fair welcome O brother of the Arabs Tell me thy tale and acquaint me with thy case Replied the Arab O Commander of the Faithful I had a wife whom I loved passing dear with love none came near and she was the coolth of mine eyes and the joy of my heart and I had a herd of camels whose produce enabled me to maintain my condition but there came upon us a bad year which killed off hoof and horn and left me naught When what was in my hand failed me and wealth fell from me and I lapsed into evil case I at once became abject and a burden to those who erewhile wished to visit me and when her father knew it he took her from me and abjured me and drove me forth without ruth So I repaired to thy deputy Marwan bin al Hakam and asked his aid He summoned her sire and questioned him of my case when he denied any knowledge of me Quoth I Allah assain the Emir An it please him to send for the woman and question her of her father s saying the truth will appear So he sent for her and brought her but no sooner had he set eyes on her than he fell in love with her so becoming my rival he denied me succour and was wroth with me and sent me to prison where I became as I had fallen from heaven and the wind had cast me down in a far land Then said Marwan to her father Wilt thou give her to me to wife on a present settlement of a thousand dinars and a contingent dowry of ten thousand dirhams FN one hundred forty six and I will engage to free her from yonder wild Arab Her father was seduced by the bribe and agreed to the bargain whereupon Marwan sent for me and looking at me like an angry lion said to me O Arab divorce Su ad I replied I will not put her away but he set on me a company of his servants who tortured me with all manner of tortures till I found no help for it but to divorce her I did so and he sent me back to prison where I abode till the days of her purification were accomplished when he married her and let me go So now I come hither in thee hoping and thy succour imploring and myself on thy protection throwing And he spoke these couplets Within my heart is fire Whichever flameth higher Within my frame are pains For skill of leach too dire Live coals in vitals burn And sparks from coal up spire Tears flood mine eyes and down Coursing my cheek ne er tire Only God s aid and thine I crave for my desire Then he was convulsed FN one hundred forty seven and his teeth chattered and he fell down in a fit squirming like a scotched snake When Mu awiyah heard his story and his verse he said Marwan bin al Hakam hath transgressed against the laws of the Faith and hath violated the Harim of True Believers And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Six Hundred and Ninety third Night She continued It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the Caliph Mu awiyah heard the wild Arab s words he said The son of Al Hakam hath indeed transgressed against the laws of the Faith and hath violated the Harim of True Believers presently adding O Arab thou comest to me with a story the like whereof I never heard Then he called for inkcase and paper and wrote to Marwan as follows Verily it hath reached me that thou transgresseth the laws of the Faith with regard to thy lieges Now it behoveth the Wali who governeth the folk to keep his eyes from their lusts and stay his flesh from its delights And after he wrote many words which quoth he who told me the tale I omit for brevity s sake and amongst them these couplets Thou wast invested woe to thee FN one hundred forty eight with rule for the unfit Crave thou of Allah pardon for thy foul adultery Th unhappy youth to us is come complaining mid his groans And asks for redress for parting grief and saddened me through thee An oath have I to Allah sworn shall never be forsworn Nay for I ll do what Faith and Creed command me to decree An thou dare cross me in whate er to thee I now indite I of thy flesh assuredly will make the vulture free Divorce Su ad equip her well and in the hottest haste With Al Kumayt and Ziban s son hight Nasr send to me Then he folded the letter and sealing it with his seal delivered it to Al Kumayt FN one hundred forty nine and Nasr bin Ziban whom he was wont to employ on weighty matters because of their trustiness who took the missive and carried it to Al Medinah where they went in to Marwan and saluting him delivered to him the writ and told him how the case stood He read the letter and fell a weeping but he went in to Su ad as twas not in his power to refuse obedience to the Caliph and acquainting her with the case divorced her in the presence of Al Kumayt and Nasr after which he equipped her and delivered her to them together with a letter to the Caliph wherein he versified as follows Hurry not Prince of Faithful Men with best of grace thy vow I will accomplish as twas vowed and with the gladdest gree I sinned not adulterous sin when loved her I then how Canst charge me with advowtrous deed or any villainy Soon comes to thee that splendid sun which hath no living peer On earth nor aught in mortal men of Jinns her like shalt see This he sealed with his own signet and gave to the messengers who returned with Su ad to Damascus and delivered to Mu awiyah the letter and when he had read it he cried Verily he hath obeyed handsomely but he exceedeth in his praise of the woman Then he called for her and saw beauty such as he had never seen for comeliness and loveliness stature and symmetrical grace moreover he talked with her and found her fluent of speech and choice in words Quoth he Bring me the Arab So they fetched the man who came sore disordered for shifts and changes of fortune and Mu awiyah said to him O Arab an thou wilt freely give her up to me I will bestow upon thee in her stead three slave girls high bosomed maids like moons with each a thousand dinars and I will assign thee on the Treasury such an annual sum as shall content thee and enrich thee When the Arab heard this he groaned one groan and swooned away so that Mu awiyah thought he was dead and as soon as he revived the Caliph said to him What aileth thee The Arab answered With heavy heart and in sore need have I appealed to thee from the injustice of Marwan bin al Hakam but to whom shall I appeal from thine injustice And he versified in these couplets Make me not Allah save the Caliph one of the betrayed Who from the fiery sands to fire must sue for help and aid Deign thou restore Su ad to this afflicted heart distraught Which every morn and eve by sorest sorrow is waylaid Loose thou my bonds and grudge me not and give her back to me And if thou do so ne er thou shalt for lack of thanks upbraid Then said he By Allah O Commander of the Faithful wert thou to give me all the riches contained in the Caliphate yet would I not take them without Su ad And he recited this couplet I love Su ad and unto all but hers my love is dead Each morn I feel her love to me is drink and daily bread Quoth the Caliph Thou confessest to having divorced her and Marwan owned the like so now we will give her free choice An she choose other than thee we will marry her to him and if she choose thee we will restore her to thee Replied the Arab Do so So Mu awiyah said to her What sayest thou O Su ad Which does thou choose the Commander of the Faithful with his honour and glory and dominion and palaces and treasures and all else thou seest at this command or Marwin bin al Hakam with his violence and tyranny or this Arab with his hunger and poverty So she improvised these couplets This one whom hunger plagues and rags unfold Dearer than tribe and kith and kin I hold Than crowned head or deputy Marwan Or all who boast of silver coins and gold Then said she By Allah O Commander of the Faithful I will not forsake him for the shifts of Fortune or the perfidies of Fate there being between us old companionship we may not forget and love beyond stay and let and indeed tis but just that I bear with him in his adversity even as I shared with him in prosperity The Caliph marvelled at her wit and love and constancy and ordering her ten thousand dirhams delivered her to the Arab who took his wife and went away FN one hundred fifty And they likewise tell a tale of THE LOVERS OF BASSORAH The Caliph Harun al Rashid was sleepless one night so he sent for Al Asma i and Husayn al Khali a FN one hundred fifty one and said to them Tell me a story you twain and do thou begin O Husayn He said Tis well O Commander of the Faithful and thus began Some years ago I dropped down stream to Bassorah to present to Mohammed bin Sulayman al Rabi i FN one hundred fifty two a Kasidah or elegy I had composed in his praise and he accepted it and bade me abide with him One day I went out to Al Mirbad FN one hundred fifty three by way of Al Muhaliyah FN one hundred fifty four and being oppressed by the excessive heat went up to a great door to ask for drink when I was suddenly aware of a damsel as she were a branch swaying with eyes languishing eye brows arched and finely pencilled and smooth cheeks rounded clad in a shift the colour of a pomegranate flower and a mantilla of Sana a FN one hundred fifty five work but the perfect whiteness of her body overcame the redness of her shift through which glittered two breasts like twin granadoes and a waist as it were a roll of fine Coptic linen with creases like scrolls of pure white paper stuffed with musk FN one hundred fifty six Moreover O Prince of True Believers round her neck was slung an amulet of red gold that fell down between her breasts and on the plain of her forehead were browlocks like jet FN one hundred fifty seven Her eyebrows joined and her eyes were like lakes she had an aquiline nose and thereunder shell like lips showing teeth like pearls Pleasantness prevailed in every part of her but she seemed dejected disturbed distracted and in the vestibule came and went walking upon the hearts of her lovers whilst her legs FN one hundred fifty eight made mute the voices of their ankle rings and indeed she was as saith the poet Each portion of her charms we see Seems of the whole a simile I was overawed by her O Commander of the Faithful and drew near her to greet her and behold the house and vestibule and highways breathed fragrant with musk So I saluted her and she returned my salaam with a voice dejected and heart depressed and with the ardour of passion consumed Then said I to her O my lady I am an old man and a stranger and sore troubled by thirst Wilt thou order me a draught of water and win reward in heaven She cried Away O Shaykh from me I am distracted from all thought of meat and drink And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Six Hundred and Ninety fourth Night She pursued It hath reached me O auspicious King that the damsel said O Shaykh I am distracted from all thought of meat and drink Quoth I continued Husayn By what ailment O my lady and quoth she I love one who dealeth not justly by me and I desire one who of me will none Wherefore I am afflicted with the wakefulness of those who wake star gazing I asked O my lady is there on the wide expanse of earth one to whom thou hast a mind and who to thee hath no mind Answered she Yes and this for the perfection of beauty and loveliness and goodliness wherewith he is endowed And why standeth thou in this porch enquired I This is his road replied she and the hour of his passing by I said O my lady have ye ever foregathered and had such commerce and converse as might cause this passion At this she heaved a deep sigh the tears rained down her cheeks as they were dew falling upon roses and she versified with these couplets We were like willow boughs in garden shining And scented joys in happiest life combining Whenas one bough from other self would rend And oh thou seest this for that repining Quoth I O maid and what betideth thee of thy love for this man and quoth she I see the sun upon the walls of his folk and I think the sun is he or haply I catch sight of him unexpectedly and am confounded and the blood and the life fly my body and I abide in unreasoning plight a week or e en a se nnight Said I Excuse me for I also have suffered that which is upon thee of love longing and distraction of soul and wasting of frame and loss of strength and I see in thee pallor of complexion and emaciation such as testify of the fever fits of desire But how shouldst thou be unsmitten of passion and thou a sojourner in the land of Bassorah Said she By Allah before I fell in love of this youth I was perfect in beauty and loveliness and amorous grace which ravished all the Princes of Bassorah till he fell in love with me I asked O maid and who parted you and she answered The vicissitudes of fortune but the manner of our separation was strange and twas on this wise One New Year s day I had invited the damsels of Bassorah and amongst them a girl belonging to Siran who had bought her out of Oman for four score thousand dirhams She loved me and loved me to madness and when she entered she threw herself upon me and well nigh tore me in pieces with bites and pinches FN one hundred fifty nine Then we withdrew apart to drink wine at our ease till our meat was ready FN one hundred sixty and our delight was complete and she toyed with me and I with her and now I was upon her and now she was upon me Presently the fumes of the wine moved her to strike her hand on the inkle of my petticoat trousers whereby it became loosed unknown of either of us and my trousers fell down in our play At this moment he came in unobserved and seeing me thus was wroth at the sight and made off as the Arab filly hearing the tinkle of her bridle And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Six Hundred and Ninety fifth Night She resumed It hath reached me O auspicious King that the maiden said to Husayn al Khali a When my lover saw me playing as I described to thee with Siran s girl he went forth in anger And tis now O Shaykh three years ago and since then I have never ceased to excuse myself to him and coax him and crave his indulgence but he will neither cast a look at me from the corner of his eye nor write me a word nor speak to me by messenger nor hear from me aught Quoth I Harkye maid is he an Arab or an Ajam and quoth she Out on thee He is of the Princes of Bassorah Is he old or young asked I and she looked at me laughingly and answered Thou art certainly a simpleton He is like the moon on the night of its full smooth checked and beardless nor is there any defect in him except his aversion to me Then I put the question What is his name and she replied What wilt thou do with him I rejoined I will do my best to come at him that I may bring about reunion between you Said she I will tell thee on condition that thou carry him a note and I said I have no objection to that Then quoth she His name is Zamrah bin al Mughayrah hight Abu al Sakha FN one hundred sixty one and his palace is in the Mirbad Therewith she called to those within for inkcase and paper and tucking up FN one hundred sixty two her sleeves showed two wrists like broad rings of silver She then wrote after the Basmalah as follows My lord the omission of blessings FN one hundred sixty three at the head of this my letter shows mine insufficiency and know that had my prayer been answered thou hadst never left me for how often have I prayed that thou shouldest not leave me and yet thou didst leave me Were it not that distress with me exceedeth the bounds of restraint that which thy servant hath forced herself to do in writing this writ were an aidance to her despite her despair of thee because of her knowledge of thee that thou wilt fail to answer Do thou fulfil her desire my lord of a sight of thee from the porch as thou passest in the street wherewith thou wilt quicken the dead soul in her Or far better for her still than this do thou write her a letter with thine own hand Allah endow it with all excellence and appoint it in requital of the intimacy that was between us in the nights of time past whereof thou must preserve the memory My lord was I not to thee a lover sick with passion An thou answer my prayer I will give to thee thanks and to Allah praise and so The Peace FN one hundred sixty four Then she gave me the letter and I went away Next morning I repaired to the door of the Viceroy Mohammed bin Sulayman where I found an assembly of the notables of Bassorah and amongst them a youth who adorned the gathering and surpassed in beauty and brightness all who were there and indeed the Emir Mohammed set him above himself I asked who he was and behold it was Zamrah himself so I said in my mind Verily there hath befallen yonder unhappy one that which hath befallen her FN one hundred sixty five Then I betook myself to the Mirbad and stood waiting at the door of his house till he came riding up in state when I accosted him and invoking more than usual blessings on him handed him the missive When he read it and understood it he said to me O Shaykh we have taken other in her stead Say me wilt thou see the substitute I answered Yes Whereupon he called out a woman s name and there came forth a damsel who shamed the two greater lights swelling breasted walking the gait of one who hasteneth without fear to whom he gave the note saying Do thou answer it When she read it she turned pale at the contents and said to me O old man crave pardon of Allah for this that thou hast brought So I went out O Commander of the Faithful dragging my feet and returning to her asked leave to enter When she saw me she asked What is behind thee and I answered Evil and despair Quoth she Have thou no concern of him Where are Allah and His power FN one hundred sixty six Then she ordered me five hundred dinars and I took them and went away Some days after I passed by the place and saw there horsemen and footmen So I went in and lo these were the companions of Zamrah who were begging her to return to him but she said No by Allah I will not look him in the face And she prostrated herself in gratitude to Allah and exultation over Zamrah s defeat Then I drew near her and she pulled out to me a letter wherein was written after the Bismillah My lady but for my forbearance towards thee whose life Allah lengthen I would relate somewhat of what betided from thee and set out my excuse in that thou transgressedst against me whenas thou west manifestly a sinner against thyself and myself in breach of vows and lack of constancy and preference of another over us for by Allah on whom we call for help against that which was of thy free will thou didst transgress against the love of me and so The Peace Then she showed me the presents and rarities he had sent her which were of the value of thirty thousand dinars I saw her again after this and Zamrah had married her Quoth Al Rashid Had not Zamrah been beforehand with us I should certainly have had to do with her myself FN one hundred sixty seven And men tell the tale of ISHAK OF MOSUL AND HIS MISTRESS AND THE DEVIL FN one hundred sixty eight Quoth Ishak bin Ibrahim al Mausili I was in my house one night in the winter time when the clouds had dispread themselves and the rains poured down in torrents as from the mouths of water skins and the folk forbore to come and go about the ways for that which was therein of rain and slough Now I was straitened in breast because none of my brethren came to me nor could I go to them by reason of the mud and mire so I said to my servant Bring me wherewithal I may divert myself Accordingly he brought me meat and drink but I had no heart to eat without some one to keep me company and I ceased not to look out of window and watch the ways till nightfall when I bethought myself of a damsel belonging to one of the sons of Al Mahdi FN one hundred sixty nine whom I loved and who was skilled in singing and playing upon instruments of music and said to myself Were she here with us to night my joy would be complete and my night would be abridged of the melancholy and restlessness which are upon me At this moment one knocked at the door saying Shall a beloved enter in who standeth at the door Quoth I to myself Meseems the plant of my desire hath fruited So I went to the door and found my mistress with a long green skirt FN one hundred seventy wrapped about her and a kerchief of brocade on her head to fend her from the rain She was covered with mud to her knees and all that was upon her was drenched with water from gargoyles FN one hundred seventy one and house spouts in short she was in sorry plight So I said to her O my mistress what bringeth thee hither through all this mud Replied she Thy messenger came and set forth to me that which was with thee of love and longing so that I could not choose but yield and hasten to thee I marvelled at this And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Six Hundred and Ninety sixth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the damsel came and knocked at Ishak s door he went forth to her and cried O my lady what bringeth thee hither through all this mud and she replied Thy messenger came and set forth to me that which was with thee of love and longing so that I could not choose but yield and hasten to thee I marvelled at this but did not like to tell her that I had sent no messenger wherefore I said Praised be Allah for that He hath brought us together after all I have suffered by the mortification of patience Verily hadst thou delayed an hour longer I must have run to thee because of my much love for thee and longing for thy presence Then I called to my boy for water that I might better her plight and he brought a kettle full of hot water such as she wanted I bade pour it over her feet whilst I set to work to wash them myself after which I called for one of my richest dresses and clad her therein after she had doffed the muddy clothes Then as soon as we were comfortably seated I would have called for food but she refused and I said to her Art thou for wine and she replied Yes So I fetched cups and she asked me Who shall sing I O my princess I care not for that One of my damsels I have no mind to that either Then sing thyself Not I Who then shall sing for thee I enquired and she rejoined Go out and seek some one to sing for me So I went out in obedience to her though I despaired of finding any one in such weather and fared on till I came to the main street where I suddenly saw a blind man striking the earth with his staff and saying May Allah not requite with weal those with whom I was When I sang they listened not and when I was silent they made light of me So I said to him Art thou a singer and he replied Yes Quoth I Wilt thou finish thy night with us and cheer us with thy company and quoth he If it be thy will take my hand So I took his hand and leading him to my house said to the damsel O my mistress I have brought a blind singer with whom we may take our pleasure and he will not see us She said Bring him to me So I brought him in and invited him to eat He ate but a very little and washed his hands after which I brought him wine and he drank three cupsful Then he said to me Who art thou and I replied I am Ishak bin Ibrahim al Mausili Quoth he I have heard of thee and now I rejoice in thy company and I O my lord I am glad in thy gladness He said O Ishak sing to me So I took the lute by way of jest and cried I hear and I obey When I had made an end of my song he said to me O Ishak thou comest nigh to be a singer His words belittled me in mine own eyes and I threw the lute from my hand whereupon he said Hast thou not with thee some one who is skilled in singing Quoth I I have a damsel with me and quoth he Bid her sing I asked him Wilt thou sing when thou hast had enough of her singing and he answered Yes So she sang and he said Nay thou hast shown no art Whereupon she flung the lute from her hand in wrath and cried We have done our best if thou have aught favour us with it by way of an alms Quoth he Bring me a lute hand hath not touched So I bade the servant bring him a new lute and he tuned it and preluding in a mode I knew not began to sing improvising these couplets Clove through the shades and came to me in night so dark and sore The lover weeting of herself twas trysting tide once more Naught startled us but her salaam and first of words she said May a beloved enter in who standeth at the door When the girl heard this she looked at me askance and said What secret was between us could not thy breast hold for one hour but thou must discover it to this man However I swore to her that I had not told him and excused myself to her and fell to kissing her hands and tickling her breasts and biting her cheeks till she laughed and turning to the blind man said to him Sing O my lord So he took the lute and sang these two couplets Ah often have I sought the fair how often fief and fain My palming felt the finger ends that bear the varied stain And tickled pouting breasts that stand firm as pomegranates twain And bit the apple of her cheek kissed o er and o er again So I said to her O my princess who can have told him what we were about Replied she True and we moved away from him Presently quoth he I must make water and quoth I O boy take the candle and go before him Then he went out and tarried a long while So we went in search of him but could not find him and behold the doors were locked and the keys in the closet and we knew not whether to heaven he had flown or into earth had sunk Wherefore I knew that he was Iblis and that he had done me pimp s duty and I returned recalling to my self the words of Abu Nowas in these couplets I marvel in Iblis such pride to see Beside his low intent and villainy He sinned to Adam who to bow refused Yet pimps for all of Adam s progeny And they tell a tale concerning THE LOVERS OF AL MEDINAH Quoth Ibrahim the father of Ishak FN one hundred seventy two I was ever a devoted friend to the Barmecide family And it so happened to me one day as I sat at home quite alone a knock was heard at the door so my servant went out and returned saying A comely youth is at the door asking admission I bade admit him and there came in to me a young man on whom were signs of sickness and he said I have long wished to meet thee for I have need of thine aid What is it thou requirest asked I Whereupon he pulled out three hundred dinars and laying them before me said I beseech thee to accept these and compose me an air to two couplets I have made Said I Repeat them to me and Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Six Hundred and Ninety seventh Night She continued It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the youth came in to Ibrahim and placed the gold in his hands saying Prithee accept it and compose me an air to two couplets he replied Recite them to me whereupon he recited By Allah glance of mine thou hast opprest My heart so quench the fire that burns my breast Blames me the world because in him FN one hundred seventy three I live Yet cannot see him till in shroud I rest Accordingly quoth Ibrahim I set the verses to an air plaintive as a dirge and sang it to him whereupon he swooned away and I thought that he was dead However after a while he came to himself and said to me Repeat the air But I conjured him by Allah to excuse me saying I fear lest thou die Would Heaven it were so replied he and ceased not humbly to importune me till I had pity on him and repeated it whereupon he cried out with a grievous cry and fell into a fit worse than before and I doubted not but that he was dead but I sprinkled rose water on him till he revived and sat up I praised Allah for his recovery and laying the ducats before him said Take thy money and depart from me Quoth he I have no need of the money and thou shalt have the like of it if thou wilt repeat the air My breast broadened at the mention of the money and I said I will repeat it but on three conditions the first that thou tarry with me and eat of my victual till thou regain strength the second that thou drink wine enough to hearten thy heart and the third that thou tell me thy tale He agreed to this and ate and drank after which he said I am of the citizens of Al Medinah and I went forth one day a pleasuring with my friends and following the road to Al Akik FN one hundred seventy four saw a company of girls and amongst them a damsel as she were a branch pearled with dew with eyes whose sidelong glances were never withdrawn till they had stolen away his soul who looked on them The maidens rested in the shade till the end of the day when they went away leaving in my heart wounds slow to heal I returned next morning to scent out news of her but found none who could tell me of her so I sought her in the streets and markets but could come on no trace of her wherefore I fell ill of grief and told my case to one of my kinsmen who said to me No harm shall befall thee the days of spring are not yet past and the skies show sign of rain FN one hundred seventy five whereupon she will go forth and I will go out with thee and do thou thy will His words comforted my heart and I waited till al Akik ran with water when I went forthwith my friends and kinsmen and sat in the very same place where I first saw her We had not been seated long before up came the women like horses running for a wager and I whispered to a girl of my kindred Say to yonder damse Quoth this man to thee He did well who spoke this couplet She shot my heart with shaft then turned on heel And flying dealt fresh wound and scarring wheel So she went to her and repeated my words to which she replied saying Tell him that he said well who answered in this couplet The like of whatso feelest thou we feel Patience perchance swift cure our hearts shall heal I refrained from further speech for fear of scandal and rose to go away She rose at my rising and I followed and she looked back at me till she saw I had noted her abode Then she began to come to me and I to go to her so that we foregathered and met often till the case was noised abroad and grew notorious and her sire came to know of it However I ceased not to meet her most assiduously and complained of my condition to my father who assembled our kindred and repaired to ask her in marriage for me of her sire who cried Had this been proposed to me before he gave her a bad name by his assignations I would have consented but now the thing is notorious and I am loath to verify the saying of the folk Then continued Ibrahim I repeated the air to him and he went away after having acquainted me with his abode and we became friends Now I was devoted to the Barmecides so next time Ja afar bin Yahya sat to give audience I attended as was my wont and sang to him the young man s verses They pleased him and he drank some cups of wine and said Fie upon thee whose song is this So I told him the young man s tale and he bade me ride over to him and give him assurances of the winning of his wish Accordingly I fetched him to Ja afar who asked him to repeat his story He did so and Ja afar said Thou art now under my protection trust me to marry thee to her So his heart was comforted and he abode with us When the morning morrowed Ja afar mounted and went in to Al Rashid to whom he related the story The Caliph was pleased with it and sending for the young man and myself commanded me to repeat the air and drank thereto Then he wrote to the Governor of Al Hijaz bidding him despatch the girl s father and his household in honour able fashion to his presence and spare no expense for their outfit So in a little while they came and the Caliph sending for the man commanded him to marry his daughter to her lover after which he gave him an hundred thousand dinars and the father went back to his folk As for the young man he abode one of Ja afar s cup companions till there happened what happened FN one hundred seventy six whereupon he returned with his household to al Medinah may Almighty Allah have mercy upon their souls one and all And they also tell O auspicious King a tale of AL MALIK AL NASIR AND HIS WAZIR There was given to Abu Amir bin Marwan FN one hundred seventy seven a boy of the Christians than whom never fell eyes on a handsomer Al Nasir the conquering Soldan saw him and said to Abu Amir who was his Wazir Whence cometh this boy Replied he From Allah whereupon the other Wilt thou terrify us with stars and make us prisoner with moons Abu Amir excused himself to him and preparing a present sent it to him with the boy to whom he said Be thou part of the gift were it not of necessity my soul had not consented to give thee away And he wrote with him these two couplets My lord this full moon takes in Heaven of thee new birth Nor can deny we Heaven excelleth humble earth Thee with my soul I please and oh the pleasant case No man e er saw I who to give his soul prefer th The thing pleased Al Nasir and he requited him with much treasure and the Minister became high in favour with him After this there was presented to the Wazir a slave girl one of the loveliest women in the world and he feared lest this should come to the King s ears and he desire her and the like should happen as with the boy So he made up a present still costlier than the first and sent it with her to the King And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Six Hundred and Ninety eighth Night She pursued It hath reached me O auspicious King that the Wazir Abu Amir when presented with the beautiful slave girl feared lest it come to the Conquering King s ears and that the like should happen as with the boy so he made up a present still costlier than the first and sent it with her to his master accompanying it with these couplets My lord this be the Sun the Moon thou hadst before So the two greater lights now in thy Heaven unite Conjunction promising to me prosperity And Kausar draught to thee and Eden s long delight Earth shows no charms by Allah ranking as their third Nor King who secondeth our Conquering King in might Wherefore his credit redoubled with al Nasir but after a while one of his enemies maligned him to the King alleging that there still lurked in him a hot lust for the boy and that he ceased not to desire him whenever the cool northern breezes moved him and to gnash his teeth for having given him away Cried the King Wag not thou thy tongue at him or I will shear off thy head However he wrote Abu Amir a letter as from the boy to the following effect O my lord thou knowest that thou wast all and one to me and that I never ceased from delight with thee Albeit I am with the Sultan yet would I choose rather solitude with thee but that I fear the King s majesty wherefore devise thou to demand me of him This letter he sent to Abu Amir by a little foot page whom he enjoined to say This is from such an one the King never speaketh to him When the Wazir read the letter and heard the cheating message he noted the poison draught FN one hundred seventy eight and wrote on the back of the note these couplets Shall man experience lectured ever care Fool like to thrust his head in lion s lair I m none of those whose wits to love succumb Nor witless of the snares my foes prepare Wert thou my sprite I d give thee loyally Shall sprite from body sundered backwards fare When al Nasir knew of this answer he marvelled at the Wazir s quickness of wit and would never again lend ear to aught of insinuations against him Then said he to him How didst thou escape falling into the net And he replied Because my reason is unentangled in the toils of passion And they also tell a tale of THE ROGUERIES OF DALILAH THE CRAFTY AND HER DAUGHTER ZAYNAB THE CONEY CATCHER FN one hundred seventy nine There lived in the time of Harun al Rashid a man named Ahmad al Danaf and another Hasan Shuman FN one hundred eighty hight the twain past masters in fraud and feints who had done rare things in their day wherefore the Caliph invested them with caftans of honour and made them Captains of the Watch for Baghdad Ahmad of the right hand and Hasan of the left hand and appointed to each of them a stipend of a thousand dinars a month and forty stalwart men to be at their bidding Moreover to Calamity Ahmad was committed the watch of the district outside the walls So Ahmad and Hasan went forth in company of the Emir Khalid the Wali or Chief of Police attended each by his forty followers on horse back and preceded by the Crier crying aloud and saying By command of the Caliph None is captain of the watch of the right hand but Ahmad al Danaf and none is captain of the watch of the left hand but Hasan Shuman and both are to be obeyed when they bid and are to be held in all honour and worship Now there was in the city an old woman called Dalilah the Wily who had a daughter by name Zaynab the Coney catcher They heard the proclamation made and Zaynab said to Dalilah See O my mother this fellow Ahmad al Danaf He came hither from Cairo a fugitive and played the double dealer in Baghdad till he got into the Caliph s company and is now become captain of the right hand whilst that mangy chap Hasan Shuman is captain of the left hand and each hath a table spread morning and evening and a monthly wage of a thousand dinars whereas we abide unemployed and neglected in this house without estate and without honour and have none to ask of us Now Dalilah s husband had been town captain of Baghdad with a monthly wage of one thousand dinars but he died leaving two daughters one married and with a son by name Ahmad al Lakit FN one hundred eighty one or Ahmad the Abortion and the other called Zaynab a spinster And this Dalilah was a past mistress in all manner of craft and trickery and double dealing she could wile the very dragon out of his den and Iblis himself might have learnt deceit of her Her father FN one hundred eighty two had also been governor of the carrier pigeons to the Caliph with a solde of one thousand dinars a month He used to rear the birds to carry letters and messages wherefore in time of need each was dearer to the Caliph than one of his own sons So Zaynab said to her mother Up and play off some feint and fraud that may haply make us notorious And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Six Hundred and Ninety ninth Night She resumed It hath reached me O auspicious King that Zaynab thus addressed her dam Up and play off some feint and fraud which may haply make us notorious in Baghdad so perchance we shall win our father s stipend for ourselves Replied the old trot As thy head liveth O my daughter I will play off higher class rogueries in Baghdad than ever played Calamity Ahmad or Hasan the Pestilent So saying she rose and threw over her face the Lisam veil and donned clothes such as the poorer Sufis wear petticoat trousers falling over her heels and a gown of white wool with a broad girdle She also took a pitcher FN one hundred eighty three and filled it with water to the neck after which she set three dinars in the mouth and stopped it up with a plug of palm fibre Then she threw round her shoulder baldrick wise a rosary as big as a load of firewood and taking in her hand a flag made of parti coloured rags red and yellow and green went out crying Allah Allah with tongue celebrating the praises of the Lord whilst her heart galloped in the Devil s race course seeking how she might play some sharping trick upon town She walked from street to street till she came to an alley swept and watered and marble paved where she saw a vaulted gateway with a threshold of alabaster and a Moorish porter standing at the door which was of sandalwood plated with brass and furnished with a ring of silver for knocker Now this house belonged to the Chief of the Caliph s Serjeant ushers a man of great wealth in fields houses and allowances called the Emir Hasan Sharr al Tarik or Evil of the Way and therefor called because his blow forewent his word He was married to a fair damsel Khatun FN one hundred eighty four hight whom he loved and who had made him swear on the night of his going in unto her that he would take none other to wife over her nor lie abroad for a single night And so things went on till one day he went to the Divan and saw that each Emir had with him a son or two Then he entered the Hammam bath and looking at his face in the mirror noted that the white hairs in his beard overlay its black and he said in himself Will not He who took thy sire bless thee with a son So he went in to his wife in angry mood and she said to him Good evening to thee but he replied Get thee out of my sight from the day I saw thee I have seen naught of good How so quoth she Quoth he On the night of my going in unto thee thou madest me swear to take no other wife over thee and this very day I have seen each Emir with a son and some with two So I minded me of death FN one hundred eighty five and also that to me hath been vouchsafed neither son nor daughter and that whoso leaveth no male hath no memory This then is the reason of my anger for thou art barren and knowing thee is like planing a rock Cried she Allah s name upon thee Indeed I have worn out the mortars with beating wool and pounding drugs FN one hundred eighty six and I am not to blame the barrenness is with thee for that thou art a snub nosed mule and thy sperm is weak and watery and impregnateth not neither getteth children Said he When I return from my journey I will take another wife and she My luck is with Allah Then he went out from her and both repented of the sharp words spoken each to other Now as the Emir s wife looked forth of her lattice as she were a Bride of the Hoards FN one hundred eighty seven for the jewellery upon her behold there stood Dalilah espying her and seeing her clad in costly clothes and ornaments said to herself Twould be a rare trick O Dalilah to entice yonder young lady from her husband s house and strip her of all her jewels and clothes and make off with the whole lot So she took up her stand under the windows of the Emir s house and fell to calling aloud upon Allah s name and saying Be present O ye Walis ye friends of the Lord Whereupon every woman in the street looked from her lattice and seeing a matron clad after Sufi fashion in clothes of white wool as she were a pavilion of light said Allah bring us a blessing by the aidance of this pious old person from whose face issueth light And Khatun the wife of the Emir Hasan burst into tears and said to her handmaid Get thee down O Makbulah and kiss the hand of Shaykh Abu Ali the porter and say to him Let yonder Religious enter to my lady so haply she may get a blessing of her So she went down to the porter and kissing his hand said to him My mistress telleth thee Let yonder pious old woman come in to me so may I get a blessing of her and belike her benediction may extend to us likewise And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Seven Hundredth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the handmaid went down and said to the porter Suffer yonder Religious enter to my lady so haply she may get a blessing of her and we too may be blessed one and all the gate keeper went up to Dalilah and kissed her hand but she forbade him saying Away from me lest my ablution be made null and void FN one hundred eighty eight Thou also art of the attracted God wards and kindly looked upon by Allah s Saints and under His especial guardianship May He deliver thee from this servitude O Abu Ali Now the Emir owed three months wage to the porter who was straitened thereby but knew not how to recover his due from his lord so he said to the old woman O my mother give me to drink from thy pitcher so I may win a blessing through thee She took the ewer from her shoulder and whirled it about in air so that the plug flew out of its mouth and the three dinars fell to the ground The porter saw them and picked them up saying in his mind Glory to God This old woman is one of the Saints that have hoards at their command It hath been revealed to her of me that I am in want of money for daily expenses so she hath conjured me these three dinars out of the air Then said he to her Take O my aunt these three dinars which fell from thy pitcher and she replied Away with them from me I am of the folk who occupy not themselves with the things of the world no never Take them and use them for thine own benefit in lieu of those the Emir oweth thee Quoth he Thanks to Allah for succour This is of the chapter of revelation Thereupon the maid accosted her and kissing her hand carried her up to her mistress She found the lady as she were a treasure whose guardian talisman had been loosed and Khatun bade her welcome and kissed her hand Quoth she O my daughter I come not to thee save for thy weal and by Allah s will Then Khatun set food before her but she said O my daughter I eat naught except of the food of Paradise and I keep continual fast breaking it but five days in the year But O my child I see thee chagrined and desire that thou tell me the cause of thy concern O my mother replied Khatun I made my husband swear on my wedding night that he would wive none but me and he saw others with children and longed for them and said to me Thou art a barren thing I answered Thou art a mule which begetteth not so he left me in anger saying When I come back from my journey I will take another wife for he hath villages and lands and large allowances and if he begat children by another they will possess the money and take the estates from me Said Dalilah O my daughter knowest thou not of my master the Shaykh Abu al Hamlat FN one hundred eighty nine whom if any debtor visit Allah quitteth him his debt and if a barren woman she conceiveth Khatun replied O my mother since the day of my wedding I have not gone forth the house no not even to pay visits of condolence or congratulation The old woman rejoined O my child I will carry thee to him and do thou cast thy burden on him and make a vow to him haply when thy husband shall return from his journey and lie with thee thou shalt conceive by him and bear a girl or a boy but be it female or male it shall be a dervish of the Shaykh Abu al Hamlat Thereupon Khatun rose and arrayed herself in her richest raiment and donning all her jewellery said Keep thou an eye on the house to her maid who replied I hear and obey O my lady Then she went down and the porter Abu Ali met her and asked her Whither away O my lady I go to visit the Shaykh Abu al Hamlat answered she and he Be a year s fast incumbent on me Verily yon Religious is of Allah s saints and full of holiness O my lady and she hath hidden treasure at her command for she gave me three dinars of red gold and divined my case without my asking her and knew that I was in want Then the old woman went out with the young lady Khatun saying to her Inshallah O my daughter when thou hast visited the Shaykh Abu al Hamlat there shall betide thee solace of soul and by leave of Almighty Allah thou shalt conceive and thy husband the Emir shall love thee by the blessing of the Shaykh and shall never again let thee hear a despiteful word Quoth Khatun I will go with thee to visit him O my mother But Dalilah said to herself Where shall I strip her and take her clothes and jewellery with the folk coming and going Then she said to her O my daughter walk thou behind me within sight of me for this thy mother is a woman sorely burdened everyone who hath a burden casteth it on me and all who have pious offerings FN one hundred ninety to make give them to me and kiss my hand So the young lady followed her at a distance whilst her anklets tinkled and her hair coins FN one hundred ninety one clinked as she went till they reached the bazar of the merchants Presently they came to the shop of a young merchant by name Sidi Hasan who was very handsome FN one hundred ninety two and had no hair on his face He saw the lady approaching and fell to casting stolen glances at her which when the old woman saw she beckoned to her and said Sit down in this shop till I return to thee Khatun obeyed her and sat down in the shop front of the young merchant who cast at her one glance of eyes that cost him a thousand sighs Then the old woman accosted him and saluted him saying Tell me is not thy name Sidi Hasan son of the merchant Mohsin He replied Yes who told thee my name Quoth she Folk of good repute direct me to thee Know that this young lady is my daughter and her father was a merchant who died and left her much money She is come of marriageable age and the wise say Offer thy daughter in marriage and not thy son and all her life she hath not come forth the house till this day Now a divine warning and a command given in secret bid me wed her to thee so if thou art poor I will give thee capital and will open for thee instead of one shop two shops Thereupon quoth the young merchant to himself I asked Allah for a bride and He hath given me three things to wit coin clothing and coynte Then he continued to the old trot O my mother that where to thou directest me is well but this long while my mother saith to me I wish to marry thee but I object replying I will not marry except on the sight of my own eyes Said Dalilah Rise and follow my steps and I will show her to thee naked FN one hundred ninety three So he rose and took a thousand dinars saying in himself Haply we may need to buy somewhat And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Seven Hundred and First Night She continued It hath reached me O auspicious King that the old woman said to Hasan son of Mohsin the merchant Rise up and follow me and I will show her naked to thee So he rose and took with him a thousand dinars saying in himself Haply we may need to buy somewhat or pay the fees for drawing up the marriage contract The old woman bade him walk behind the young lady at a distance but within shot of sight and said to herself Where wilt thou carry the young lady and the merchant that thou mayest strip them both whilst his shop is still shut Then she walked on and Khatun after her followed by the young merchant till she came to a dyery kept by a master dyer by name Hajj Mohammed a man of ill repute like the colocasia FN one hundred ninety four seller s knife cutting male and female and loving to eat both figs and pomegranates FN one hundred ninety five He heard the tinkle of the ankle rings and raising his head saw the lady and the young man Presently the old woman came up to him and after salaming to him and sitting down opposite him asked him Art thou not Hajj Mohammed the dyer He answered Yes I am he what dost thou want Quoth she Verily folks of fair repute have directed me to thee Look at yonder handsome girl my daughter and that comely beardless youth my son I brought them both up and spent much money on both of them Now thou must know that I have a big old ruinous house which I have shored up with wood and the builder saith to me Go and live in some other place lest belike it fall upon thee and when this is repaired return hither So I went forth to seek me a lodging and people of worth directed me to thee and I wish to lodge my son and daughter with thee Quoth the dyer in his mind Verily here is fresh butter upon cake come to thee But he said to the old woman Tis true I have a house and saloon and upper floor but I cannot spare any part thereof for I want it all for guests and for the indigo growers my clients She replied O my son twill be only for a month or two at the most till our house be repaired and we are strange folk Let the guest chamber be shared between us and thee and by thy life O my son an thou desire that thy guests be ours we will welcome them and eat with them and sleep with them Then he gave her the keys one big and one small and one crooked saying to her The big key is that of the house the crooked one that of the saloon and the little one that of the upper floor So Dalilah took the keys and fared on followed by the lady who forwent the young merchant till she came to the lane wherein was the house She opened the door and entered introducing the damsel to whom said she O my daughter this pointing to the saloon is the lodging of the Shaykh Abu al Hamlat but go thou into the upper floor and loose thy outer veil and wait till I come to thee So she went up and sat down Presently appeared the young merchant whom Dalilah carried into the saloon saying Sit down whilst I fetch my daughter and show her to thee So he sat down and the old trot went up to Khatun who said to her I wish to visit the Shaykh before the folk come Replied the beldame O my daughter we fear for thee Asked Khatun Why so and Dalilah answered Because here is a son of mine a natural who knoweth not summer from winter but goeth ever naked He is the Shaykh s deputy and if he saw a girl like thee come to visit his chief he would snatch her earrings and tear her ears and rend her silken robes FN one hundred ninety six So do thou doff thy jewellery and clothes and I will keep them for thee till thou hast made thy pious visitation Accordingly the damsel did off her outer dress and jewels and gave them to the old woman who said I will lay them for thee on the Shaykh s curtain that a blessing may betide thee Then she went out leaving the lady in her shift and petticoat trousers and hid the clothes and jewels in a place on the staircase after which she betook herself to the young merchant whom she found impatiently awaiting the girl and he cried Where is thy daughter that I may see her But she smote palm on breast and he said What aileth thee Quoth she Would there were no such thing as the ill neighbour and the envious They saw thee enter the house with me and asked me of thee and I said This is a bridegroom I have found for my daughter So they envied me on thine account and said to my girl Is thy mother tired of keeping thee that she marrieth thee to a leper There upon I swore to her that she should not see thee save naked Quoth he I take refuge with Allah from the envious and baring his fore arm showed her that it was like silver Said she Have no fear thou shalt see her naked even as she shall see thee naked and he said Let her come and look at me Then he put off his pelisse and sables and his girdle and dagger and the rest of his raiment except his shirt and bag trousers and would have laid the purse of a thousand dinars with them but Dalilah cried Give them to me that I may take care of them So she took them and fetching the girl s clothes and jewellery shouldered the whole and locking the door upon them went her ways And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Seven Hundred and Second Night She pursued It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the old woman had taken the property of the young merchant and the damsel and wended her ways having locked the door upon them she deposited her spoils with a druggist of her acquaintance and returned to the dyer whom she found sitting awaiting her Quoth he Inshallah the house pleaseth thee and quoth she There is a blessing in it and I go now to fetch porters to carry hither our goods and furniture But my children would have me bring them a panade with meat so do thou take this dinar and buy the dish and go and eat the morning meal with them Asked the dyer Who shall guard the dyery meanwhile and the people s goods that be therein and the old woman answered Thy lad So be it rejoined he and taking a dish and cover went out to do her bidding So far concerning the dyer who will again be mentioned in the tale but as regards the old woman she fetched the clothes and jewels she had left with the druggist and going back to the dyery said to the lad Run after thy master and I will not stir hence till you both return To hear is to obey answered he and went away while she began to collect all the customers goods Presently there came up an ass driver a scavenger who had been out of work for a week and who was an Hashish eater to boot and she called him saying Hither O donkey boy So he came to her and she asked Knowest thou my son the dyer whereto he answered Yes I know him Then she said The poor fellow is insolvent and loaded with debts and as often as he is put in prison I set him free Now we wish to see him declared bankrupt and I am going to return the goods to their owners so do thou lend me thine ass to carry the load and receive this dinar to its hire When I am gone take the handsaw and empty out the vats and jars and break them so that if there come an officer from the Kazi s court he may find nothing in the dyery Quoth he I owe the Hajj a kindness and will do something for Allah s love So she laid the things on the ass and the Protector protecting her made for her own house so that she arrived there in safety and went in to her daughter Zaynab who said to her O my mother my heart bath been with thee What hast thou done by way of roguery Dalilah replied I have played off four tricks on four wights the wife of the Serjeant usher a young merchant a dyer and an ass driver and have brought thee all their spoil on the donkey boy s beast Cried Zaynab O my mother thou wilt never more be able to go about the town for fear of the Serjeant usher whose wife s raiment and jewellery thou hast taken and the merchant whom thou hast stripped naked and the dyer whose customers goods thou hast stolen and the owner of the ass Rejoined the old woman Pooh my girl I reck not of them save the donkey boy who knoweth me Meanwhile the dyer bought the meat panade and set out for the house followed by his servant with the food on head On his way thither he passed his shop where he found the donkey boy breaking the vats and jars and saw that there was neither stuff nor liquor left in them and that the dyery was in ruins So he said to him Hold thy hand O ass driver and the donkey boy desisted and cried Praised be Allah for thy safety O master Verily my heart was with thee Why so Thou art become bankrupt and they have filed a docket of thine insolvency Who told thee this Thy mother told me and bade me break the jars and empty the vats that the Kazi s officers might find nothing in the shop if they should come Allah confound the far One FN one hundred ninety seven cried the dyer My mother died long ago And he beat his breast exclaiming Alas for the loss of my goods and those of the folk The donkey boy also wept and ejaculated Alas for the loss of my ass and he said to the dyer Give me back my beast which thy mother stole from me The dyer laid hold of him by the throat and fell to buffeting him saying Bring me the old woman whilst the other buffeted him in return saying Give me back my beast So they beat and cursed each other till the folk collected around them And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Seven Hundred and Third Night She resumed It hath reached me O auspicious King that the dyer caught hold of the donkey boy and the donkey boy caught hold of the dyer and they beat and cursed each other till the folk collected round them and one of them asked What is the matter O Master Mohammed The ass driver answered I will tell thee the tale and related to them his story saying I deemed I was doing the dyer a good turn but when he saw me he beat his breast and said My mother is dead And now I for one require my ass of him it being he who hath put this trick on me that he might make me lose my beast Then said the folk to the dyer O Master Mohammed dost thou know this matron that thou didst entrust her with the dyery and all therein And he replied I know her not but she took lodgings with me to day she and her son and daughter Quoth one In my judgment the dyer is bound to indemnify the ass driver Quoth another Why so Because replied the first he trusted not the old Woman nor gave her his ass save only because he saw that the dyer had entrusted her with the dyery and its contents And a third said O master since thou hast lodged her with thee it behoveth thee to get the man back his ass Then they made for the house and the tale will come round to them again Mean while the young merchant remained awaiting the old woman s coming with her daughter but she came not nor did her daughter whilst the young lady in like manner sat expecting her return with leave from her son the God attended one the Shaykh s deputy to go in to the holy presence So weary of waiting she rose to visit the Shaykh by herself and went down into the saloon where she found the young merchant who said to her Come hither where is thy mother who brought me to marry thee She replied My mother is dead art thou the old woman s son the ecstatic the deputy of the Shaykh Abu al Hamlat Quoth he The swindling old trot is no mother of mine she hath cheated me and taken my clothes and a thousand dinars Quoth Khatun And me also hath she swindled for she brought me to see the Shaykh Abu al Hamlat and in lieu of so doing she hath stripped me Thereupon he I look to thee to make good my clothes and my thousand dinars and she I look to thee to make good my clothes and jewellery And behold at this moment in came the dyer and seeing them both stripped of their raiment said to them Tell me where your mother is So the young lady related all that had befallen her and the young merchant related all that had betided him and the Master dyer exclaimed Alas for the loss of my goods and those of the folk and the ass driver ejaculated Alas for my ass Give me O dyer my ass Then said the dyer This old woman is a sharper Come forth that I may lock the door Quoth the young merchant Twere a disgrace to thee that we should enter thy house dressed and go forth from it undressed So the dyer clad him and the damsel and sent her back to her house where we shall find her after the return of her husband Then he shut the dyery and said to the young merchant Come let us go and search for the old woman and hand her over to the Wali FN one hundred ninety eight the Chief of Police So they and the ass man repaired to the house of the master of police and made their complaint to him Quoth he O folk what want ye and when they told him he rejoined How many old women are there not in the town Go ye and seek for her and lay hands on her and bring her to me and I will torture her for you and make her confess So they sought for her all round the town and an account of them will presently be given FN one hundred ninety nine As for old Dalilah the Wily she said I have a mind to play off another trick to her daughter who answered O my mother I fear for thee but the beldam cried I am like the bean husks which fall proof against fire and water So she rose and donning a slave girl s dress of such as serve people of condition went out to look for some one to defraud Presently she came to a by street spread with carpets and lighted with hanging lamps and heard a noise of singing women and drumming of tambourines Here she saw a handmaid bearing on her shoulder a boy clad in trousers laced with silver and a little Aba cloak of velvet with a pearl embroidered Tarbush cap on his head and about his neck a collar of gold set with jewels Now the house belonged to the Provost of the Merchants of Baghdad and the boy was his son He had a virgin daughter to boot who was promised in marriage and it was her betrothal they were celebrating that day There was with her mother a company of noble dames and singing women and whenever she went upstairs or down the boy clung to her So she called the slave girl and said to her Take thy young master and play with him till the company break up Seeing this Dalilah asked the handmaid What festivities are these in your mistress s house and was answered She celebrates her daughter s betrothal this day and she hath singing women with her Quoth the old woman to herself O Dalilah the thing to do is to spirit away this boy from the maid And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Seven Hundred and Fourth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the old trot said to herself O Dalilah the thing to do is to spirit away this boy from the maid she began crying out O disgrace O ill luck Then pulling out a brass token resembling a dinar she said to the maid who was a simpleton Take this ducat and go in to thy mistress and say to her Umm al Khayr rejoiceth with thee and is beholden to thee for thy favours and on the day of assembly she and her daughters will visit thee and handsel the tiring women with the usual gifts Said the girl O my mother my young master here catcheth hold of his mamma whenever he seeth her and she replied Give him to me whilst thou goest in and comest back So she gave her the child and taking the token went in whereupon Dalilah made off with the boy to a by lane where she stripped him of his clothes and jewels saying to herself O Dalilah twould indeed be the finest of tricks even as thou hast cheated the maid and taken the boy from her so now to carry on the game and pawn him for a thousand dinars So she repaired to the jewel bazar where she saw a Jew goldsmith seated with a cage full of jewellery before him and said to herself Twould be a rare trick to chouse this Jew fellow and get a thousand gold pieces worth of jewellery from him and leave the boy in pledge for it Presently the Jew looked at them and seeing the boy with the old woman knew him for the son of the Provost of the Merchants Now the Israelite was a man of great wealth but would envy his neighbour if he sold and himself did not sell so espying Dalilah he said to her What seekest thou O my mistress She asked Art thou Master Azariah FN two hundred the Jew having first enquired his name of others and he answered Yes Quoth she This boy s sister daughter of the Shahbandar of the Merchants is a promised bride and to day they celebrate her betrothal and she hath need of jewellery So give me two pair of gold ankle rings a brace of gold bracelets and pearl ear drops with a girdle a poignard and a seal ring He brought them out and she took of him a thousand dinars worth of jewellery saying I will take these ornaments on approval and whatso pleaseth them they will keep and I will bring thee the price and leave this boy with thee till then He said Be it as thou wilt So she took the jewellery and made off to her own house where her daughter asked her how the trick had sped She told her how she had taken and stripped the Shahbandar s boy and Zaynab said Thou wilt never be able to walk abroad again in the town Meanwhile the maid went in to her mistress and said to her O my lady Umm al Khayr saluteth thee and rejoiceth with thee and on assembly day she will come she and her daughters and give the customary presents Quoth her mistress Where is thy young master Quoth the slave girl I left him with her lest he cling to thee and she gave me this as largesse for the singing women So the lady said to the chief of the singers Take thy money and she took it and found it a brass counter whereupon the lady cried to the maid Get thee down O whore and look to thy young master Accordingly she went down and finding neither boy nor old woman shrieked aloud and fell on her face Their joy was changed into annoy and behold the Provost came in when his wife told him all that had befallen and he went out in quest of the child whilst the other merchants also fared forth and each sought his own road Presently the Shahbandar who had looked every where espied his son seated naked in the Jew s shop and said to tile owner This is my son Tis well answered the Jew So he took him up without asking for his clothes of the excess of his joy at finding him but the Jew laid hold of him saying Allah succour the Caliph against thee FN two hundred one The Provost asked What aileth thee O Jew and he answered Verily the old woman took of me a thousand dinars worth of jewellery for thy daughter and left this lad in pledge for the price and I had not trusted her but that she offered to leave the child whom I knew for thy Son Said the Provost My daughter needeth no jewellery give me the boy s clothes Thereupon the Jew shrieked out Come to my aid O Moslems but at that moment up came the dyer and the ass man and the young merchant who were going about seeking the old woman and enquired the cause of their jangle So they told them the case and they said This old woman is a cheat who hath cheated us before you Then they recounted to them how she had dealt with them and the Provost said Since I have found my son be his clothes his ransom If I come upon the old woman I will require them of her And he carried the child home to his mother who rejoiced in his safety Then the Jew said to the three others Whither go ye and they answered We go to look for her Quoth the Jew Take me with you presently adding Is there any one of you knoweth her The donkey boy cried I know her and the Jew said If we all go forth together we shall never catch her for she will flee from us Let each take a different road and be our rendezvous at the shop of Hajj Mas ud the Moorish barber They agreed to this and set off each in a different direction Presently Dalilah sallied forth again to play her tricks and the ass driver met her and knew her So he caught hold of her and said to her Woe to thee Hast thou been long at this trade She asked What aileth thee and he answered Give me back my ass Quoth she Cover what Allah covereth O my son Dost thou seek thine ass and the people s things Quoth he I want my ass that s all and quoth she I saw that thou wast poor so I deposited thine ass for thee with the Moorish barber Stand off whilst I speak him fair that he may give thee the beast So she went up to the Maghrabi and kissed his hand and shed tears He asked her what ailed her and she said O my son look at my boy who standeth yonder He was ill and exposed himself to the air which injured his intellect He used to buy asses and now if he stand he saith nothing but My ass if he sit he crieth My ass and if he walk he crieth My ass Now I have been told by a certain physician that his mind is disordered and that nothing will cure him but drawing two of his grinders and cauterising him twice on either temple So do thou take this dinar and call him to thee saying Thine ass is with me Said the barber May I fast for a year if I do not give him his ass in his fist Now he had with him two journeymen so he said to one of them Go heat the irons Then the old woman went her way and the barber called to the donkey boy FN two hundred two saying Thine ass is with me good fellow come and take him and as thou livest I will give him into thy palm So he came to him and the barber carried him into a dark room where he knocked him down and the journeymen bound him hand and foot Then the Maghrabi arose and pulled out two of his grinders and fired him on either temple after which he let him go and he rose and said O Moor why hast thou used me with this usage Quoth the barber Thy mother told me that thou hadst taken cold whilst ill and hadst lost thy reason so that whether sitting or standing or walking thou wouldst say nothing but My ass So here is thine ass in thy fist Said the other Allah requite thee for pulling out my teeth Then the barber told him all that the old woman had related and he exclaimed Allah torment her and the twain left the shop and went out disputing When the barber returned he found his booth empty for whilst he was absent the old woman had taken all that was therein and made off with it to her daughter whom she acquainted with all that had befallen and all she had done The barber seeing his place plundered caught hold of the donkey boy and said to him Bring me thy mother But he answered saying She is not my mother she is a sharper who hath cozened much people and stolen my ass And lo at this moment up came the dyer and the Jew and the young merchant and seeing the Moorish barber holding on to the ass driver who was fired on both temples they said to him What hath befallen thee O donkey boy So he told them all that had betided him and the barber did the like and the others in turn related to the Moor the tricks the old woman had played them Then he shut up his shop and went with them to the office of the Police master to whom they said We look to thee for our case and our coin FN two hundred three Quoth the Wali And how many old women are there not in Baghdad Say me doth any of you know her Quoth the ass man I do so give me ten of thine officers He gave them half a score archers and they all five went out followed by the sergeants and patrolled the city till they met the old woman when they laid hands on her and carrying her to the house of the Chief of Police stood waiting under his office windows till he should come forth Presently the warders fell asleep for excess of watching with their chief and old Dalilah feigned to follow their example till the ass man and his fellows slept likewise when she stole away from them and going in to the Wali s Harim kissed the hand of the mistress of the house and asked her Where is the Chief of Police The lady answered He is asleep what wouldst thou with him Quoth Dalilah My husband is a merchant of chattels and gave me five Mamelukes to sell whilst he went on a journey The Master of Police met me and bought them of me for a thousand dinars and two hundred for myself saying Bring them to my house So I have brought them And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Seven Hundred and Fifth Night She continued It hath reached me O auspicious King that the old woman entering the Harim of the Police Master said to his wife Verily the Wali bought of me five slaves for one thousand ducats and two hundred for myself saying Bring them to my quarters So I have brought them Hearing the old woman s story she believed it and asked her Where are the slaves Dalilah replied O my lady they are asleep under the palace window whereupon the dame looked out and seeing the Moorish barber clad in a Mameluke habit and the young merchant as he were a drunken Mameluke FN two hundred four and the Jew and the dyer and the ass driver as they were shaven Mamelukes said in herself Each of these white slaves is worth more than a thousand dinars So she opened her chest and gave the old woman the thousand ducats saying Fare thee forth now and come back anon when my husband waketh I will get thee the other two hundred dinars from him Answered the old woman O my lady an hundred of them are thine under the sherbert gugglet whereof thou drinkest FN two hundred five and the other hundred do thou keep for me against I come back presently adding Now let me out by the private door So she let her out and the Protector protected her and she made her way home to her daughter to whom she related how she had gotten a thousand gold pieces and sold her five pursuers into slavery ending with O my daughter the one who troubleth me most is the ass driver for he knoweth me Said Zaynab O my mother abide quiet awhile and let what thou hast done suffice thee for the crock shall not always escape the shock When the Chief of Police awoke his wife said to him I give thee joy of the five slaves thou hast bought of the old woman Asked he What slaves And she answered Why dost thou deny it to me Allah willing they shall become like thee people of condition Quoth he As my head liveth I have bought no slaves Who saith this Quoth she The old woman the brokeress from whom thou boughtest them and thou didst promise her a thousand dinars for them and two hundred for herself Cried he Didst thou give her the money And she replied Yes for I saw the slaves with my own eyes and on each is a suit of clothes worth a thousand dinars so I sent out to bid the sergeants have an eye to them The Wali went out and seeing the five plaintiffs said to the officers Where are the five slaves we bought for a thousand dinars of the old woman Said they There are no slaves here only these five men who found the old woman and seized her and brought her hither We fell asleep whilst waiting for thee and she stole away and entered the Harim Presently out came a maid and asked us Are the five with you with whom the old woman came and we answered Yes Cried the Master of Police By Allah this is the biggest of swindles and the five men said We look to thee for our goods Quoth the Wali The old woman your mistress sold you to me for a thousand gold pieces Quoth they That were not allowed of Allah we are free born men and may not be sold and we appeal from thee to the Caliph Rejoined the Master of Police None showed her the way to the house save you and I will sell you to the galleys for two hundred dinars apiece Just then behold up came the Emir Hasan Sharr al Tarik who on his return from his journey had found his wife stripped of her clothes and jewellery and heard from her all that had passed whereupon quoth he The Master of Police shall answer me this and repairing to him said Dost thou suffer old women to go round about the town and cozen folk of their goods This is thy duty and I look to thee for my wife s property Then said he to the five men What is the case with you So they told him their stories and he said Ye are wronged men and turning to the Master of Police asked him Why dost thou arrest them Answered he None brought the old wretch to my house save these five so that she took a thousand dinars of my money and sold them to my women Whereupon the five cried O Emir Hasan be thou our advocate in this cause Then said the Master of Police to the Emir Thy wife s goods are at my charge and I will be surety for the old woman But which of you knoweth her They cried We all know her send ten apparitors with us and we will take her So he gave them ten men and the ass driver said to them Follow me for I should know her with blue eyes FN two hundred six Then they fared forth and lo they meet old Dalilah coming out of a by street so they at once laid hands on her and brought her to the office of the Wali who asked her Where are the people s goods But she answered saying I have neither gotten them nor seen them Then he cried to the gaoler Take her with thee and clap her in gaol till the morning but he replied I will not take her nor will I imprison her lest she play a trick on me and I be answerable for her So the Master of Police mounted and rode out with Dalilah and the rest to the bank of the Tigris where he bade the lamp lighter crucify her by her hair He drew her up by the pulley and bound her on the cross after which the Master of Police set ten men to guard her and went home Presently the night fell down and sleep overcame the watchmen Now a certain Badawi had heard one man say to a friend Praise be to Allah for thy safe return Where hast thou been all this time Replied the other In Baghdad where I broke my fast on honey fritters FN two hundred seven Quoth the Badawi to himself Needs must I go to Baghdad and eat honey fritters therein for in all his life he had never entered Baghdad nor seen fritters of the sort So he mounted his stallion and rode on towards Baghdad saying in his mind Tis a fine thing to eat honey fritters On the honour of an Arab I will break my fast with honey fritters and naught else And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Seven Hundred and Sixth Night She pursued It hath reached me O auspicious King that the wild Arab mounted horse and made for Baghdad saying in his mind Tis a fine thing to eat honey fritters On the honour of an Arab I will break my fast with honey fritters and naught else and he rode on till he came to the place where Dalilah was crucified and she heard him utter these words So he went up to her and said to her What art thou Quoth she I throw myself on thy protection O Shaykh of the Arabs and quoth lie Allah indeed protect thee But what is the cause of thy crucifixion Said she I have an enemy an oilman who frieth fritters and I stopped to buy some of him when I chanced to spit and my spittle fell on the fritters So he complained of me to the Governor who commanded to crucify me saying I adjudge that ye take ten pounds of honey fritters and feed her therewith upon the cross If she eat them let her go but if not leave her hanging And my stomach will not brook sweet things Cried the Badawi By the honour of the Arabs I departed not the camp but that I might taste of honey fritters I will eat them for thee Quoth she None may eat them except he be hung up in my place So he fell into the trap and unbound her whereupon she bound him in her stead after she had stripped him of his clothes and turband and put them on then covering herself with his burnouse and mounting his horse she rode to her house where Zaynab asked her What meaneth this plight and she answered They crucified me and told her all that had befallen her with the Badawi This is how it fared with her but as regards the watchmen the first who woke roused his companions and they saw that the day had broken So one of them raised his eyes and cried Dalilah Replied the Badawi By Allah I have not eaten all night Have ye brought the honey fritters All exclaimed This is a man and a Badawi and one of them asked him O Badawi where is Dalilah and who loosed her He answered Twas I she shall not eat the honey fritters against her will for her soul abhorreth them So they knew that the Arab was ignorant of her case whom she had cozened and said to one another Shall we flee or abide the accomplishment of that which Allah hath written for us As they were talking up came the Chief of Police with all the folk whom the old woman had cheated and said to the guards Arise loose Dalilah Quoth the Badawi We have not eaten to night Hast thou brought the honey fritters Whereupon the Wali raised his eyes to the cross and seeing the Badawi hung up in the stead of the old woman said to the watchmen What is this Pardon O our lord Tell me what hath happened We were weary with watching with thee on guard and Dalilah is crucified So we fell asleep and when we awoke we found the Badawi hung up in her room and we are at thy mercy O folk Allah s pardon be upon you She is indeed a clever cheat Then they unbound the Badawi who laid hold of the Master of Police saying Allah succour the Caliph against thee I look to none but thee for my horse and clothes So the Wali questioned him and he told him what had passed between Dalilah and himself The magistrate marvelled and asked him Why didst thou release her and the Badawi answered I knew not that she was a felon Then said the others O Chief of Police we look to thee in the matter of our goods for we delivered the old woman into thy hands and she was in thy guard and we cite thee before the Divan of the Caliph Now the Emir Hasan had gone up to the Divan when in came the Wali with the Badawi and the five others saying Verily we are wronged men Who hath wronged you asked the Caliph so each came forward in turn and told his story after which said the Master of Police O Commander of the Faithful the old woman cheated me also and sold me these five men as slaves for a thousand dinars albeit they are free born Quoth the Prince of True Believers I take upon myself all that you have lost adding to the Master of Police I charge thee with the old woman But he shook his collar saying O Commander of the Faithful I will not answer for her for after I had hung her on the cross she tricked this Badawi and when he loosed her she tied him up in her room and made off with his clothes and horse Quoth the Caliph Whom but thee shall I charge with her and quoth the Wali Charge Ahmad al Danaf for he hath a thousand dinars a month and one and forty followers at a monthly wage of an hundred dinars each So the Caliph said Harkye Captain Ahmad At thy service O Commander of the Faithful said he and the Caliph cried I charge thee to bring the old woman before us Replied Ahmad I will answer for her Then the Caliph kept the Badawi and the five with him And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Seven Hundred and Seventh Night She resumed It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the Caliph said to Calamity Ahmad I charge thee to bring the old woman before us he said I will answer for her O Commander of the Faithful Then the Caliph kept the Badawi and the five with him whilst Ahmad and his men went down to their hall FN two hundred eight saying to one another How shall we lay hands on her seeing that there are many old women in the town And quoth Ahmad to Hasan Shuman What counsellest thou Whereupon quoth one of them by name Ali Kitf al Jamal FN two hundred nine to Al Danaf Of what dost thou take counsel with Hasan Shuman Is the Pestilent one any great shakes Said Hasan O Ali why dost thou disparage me By the Most Great Name I will not company with thee at this time and he rose and went out in wrath Then said Ahmad O my braves let every sergeant take ten men each to his own quarter and search for Dalilah All did his bidding Ali included and they said Ere we disperse let us agree to rendezvous in the quarter Al Kalkh It was noised abroad in the city that Calamity Ahmad had undertaken to lay hands on Dalilah the Wily and Zaynab said to her O my mother an thou be indeed a trickstress do thou befool Ahmad al Danaf and his company Answered Dalilah I fear none save Hasan Shuman and Zaynab said By the life of my browlock I will assuredly get thee the clothes of all the one and forty Then she dressed and veiled herself and going to a certain druggist who had a saloon with two doors salamed to him and gave him an ashrafi and said to him Take this gold piece as a douceur for thy saloon and let it to me till the end of the day So he gave her the keys and she fetched carpets and so forth on the stolen ass and furnishing the place set on each raised pavement a tray of meat and wine Then she went out and stood at the door with her face unveiled and behold up came Ali Kitf al Jamal and his men She kissed his hand and he fell in love with her seeing her to be a handsome girl and said to her What dost thou want Quoth she Art thou Captain Ahmad al Danaf and quoth he No but I am of his company and my name is Ali Camel shoulder Asked she Whither fare you and he answered We go about in quest of a sharkish old woman who hath stolen folk s good and we mean to lay hands on her But who art thou and what is thy business She replied My father was a taverner at Mosul and he died and left me much money So I came hither for fear of the Dignities and asked the people who would protect me to which they replied None but Ahmad al Danaf Said the men From this day forth thou art under his protection and she replied Hearten me by eating a bit and drinking a sup of water FN two hundred ten They consented and entering ate and drank till they were drunken when she drugged them with Bhang and stripped them of their clothes and arms and on like wise she did with the three other companions Presently Calamity Ahmad went out to look for Dalilah but found her not neither set eyes on any of his followers and went on till he came to the door where Zaynab was standing She kissed his hand and he looked on her and fell in love with her Quoth she Art thou Captain Ahmad al Danaf and quoth he Yes who art thou She replied I am a stranger from Mosul My father was a vintner at that place and he died and left me much money wherewith I came to this city for fear of the powers that be and opened this tavern The Master of Police hath imposed a tax on me but it is my desire to put myself under thy protection and pay thee what the police would take of me for thou hast the better right to it Quoth he Do not pay him aught thou shalt have my protection and welcome Then quoth she Please to heal my heart and eat of my victual So he entered and ate and drank wine till he could not sit upright when she drugged him and took his clothes and arms Then she loaded her purchase on the Badawi s horse and the donkey boy s ass and made off with it after she had aroused Ali Kitf al Jamal Camel shoulder awoke and found himself naked and saw Ahmad and his men drugged and stripped so he revived them with the counter drug and they awoke and found themselves naked Quoth Calamity Ahmad O lads what is this We were going to catch her and lo this strumpet hath caught us How Hasan Shuman will rejoice over us But we will wait till it is dark and then go away Meanwhile Pestilence Hasan said to the hall keeper Where are the men and as he asked up they came naked and he recited these two couplets FN two hundred eleven Men in their purposes are much alike But in their issues difference comes to light Of men some wise are others simple souls As of the stars some dull some pearly bright Then he looked at them and asked Who hath played you this trick and made you naked and they answered We went in quest of an old woman and a pretty girl stripped us Quoth Hasan She hath done right well They asked Dost thou know her and he answered Yes I know her and the old trot too Quoth they What shall we say to the Caliph and quoth he O Danaf do thou shake thy collar before him and he will say Who is answerable for her and if he ask why thou hast not caught her say thou We know her not but charge Hasan Shuman with her And if he give her into my charge I will lay hands on her So they slept that night and on the morrow they went up to the Caliph s Divan and kissed ground before him Quoth he Where is the old woman O Captain Ahmad But he shook his collar The Caliph asked him why he did so and he answered I know her not but do thou charge Hasan Shuman to lay hands on her for he knoweth her and her daughter also Then Hasan interceded for her with the Caliph saying Indeed she hath not played off these tricks because she coveted the folk s stuff but to show her cleverness and that of her daughter to the intent that thou shouldst continue her husband s stipend to her and that of her father to her daughter So an thou wilt spare her life I will fetch her to thee Cried the Caliph By the life of my ancestors if she restore the people s goods I will pardon her on thine intercession And said the Pestilence Give me a pledge O Prince of True Believers Whereupon Al Rashid gave him the kerchief of pardon So Hasan repaired to Dalilah s house and called to her Her daughter Zaynab answered him and he asked her Where is thy mother Upstairs she answered and he said Bid her take the people s goods and come with me to the presence of the Caliph for I have brought her the kerchief of pardon and if she will not come with a good grace let her blame only herself So Dalilah came down and tying the kerchief about her neck gave him the people s goods on the donkey boy s ass and the Badawi s horse Quoth he There remain the clothes of my Chief and his men and quoth she By the Most Great Name twas not I who stripped them Rejoined Hasan Thou sayst sooth it was thy daughter Zaynab s doing and this was a good turn she did thee Then he carried her to the Divan and laying the people s goods and stuff before the Caliph set the old trot in his presence As soon as he saw her he bade throw her down on the carpet of blood whereat she cried I cast myself on thy protection O Shuman So he rose and kissing the Caliph s hands said Pardon O Commander of the Faithful Indeed thou gavest me the kerchief of pardon Said the Prince of True Believers I pardon her for thy sake come hither O old woman what is thy name My name is Wily Dalilah answered she and the Caliph said Thou art indeed crafty and full of guile Whence she was dubbed Dalilah the Wily One Then quoth he Why hast thou played all these tricks on the folk and wearied our hearts and quoth she I did it not of lust for their goods but because I had heard of the tricks which Ahmad al Danaf and Hasan Shuman played in Baghdad and said to myself I too will do the like And now I have returned the folk their goods But the ass driver rose and said I invoke Allah s law FN two hundred twelve between me and her for it sufficed her not to take my ass but she must needs egg on the Moorish barber to tear out my eye teeth and fire me on both temples And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Seven Hundred and Eighth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the donkey boy rose and cried out I invoke Allah s law between me and her for it sufficed her not to take my ass but she must needs egg on the barber to tear out my eye teeth and fire me on both temples thereupon the Caliph bade give him an hundred dinars and ordered the dyer the like saying Go set up thy dyery again So they called down blessings on his head and went away The Badawi also took his clothes and horse and departed saying Tis henceforth unlawful and forbidden me to enter Baghdad and eat honey fritters And the others took their goods and went away Then said the Caliph Ask a boon of me O Dalilah and she said Verily my father was governor of the carrier pigeons to thee and I know how to rear the birds and my husband was town captain of Baghdad Now I wish to have the reversion of my husband and my daughter wisheth to have that of her father The Caliph granted both their requests and she said I ask of thee that I may be portress of thy Khan Now he had built a Khan of three stories for the merchants to lodge in and had assigned to its service forty slaves and also forty dogs he had brought from the King of the Sulaymaniyah FN two hundred thirteen when he deposed him and there was in the Khan a cook slave who cooked for the chattels and fed the hounds for which he let make collars Said the Caliph O Dalilah I will write thee a patent of guardianship of the Khan and if aught be lost therefrom thou shalt be answerable for it Tis well replied she but do thou lodge my daughter in the pavilion over the door of the Khan for it hath terraced roofs and carrier pigeons may not be reared to advantage save in an open space The Caliph granted her this also and she and her daughter removed to the pavilion in question where Zaynab hung up the one and forty dresses of Calamity Ahmad and his company Moreover they delivered to Dalilah the forty pigeons which carried the royal messages and the Caliph appointed the Wily One mistress over the forty slaves and charged them to obey her She made the place of her sitting behind the door of the Khan and every day she used to go up to the Caliph s Divan lest he should need to send a message by pigeon post and stay there till eventide whilst the forty slaves stood on guard at the Khan and when darkness came on they loosed the forty dogs that they might keep watch over the place by night Such were the doings of Dalilah the Wily One in Baghdad and much like them were The Adventures of Mercury Ali of Cairo FN two hundred fourteen Now as regards the works of Mercury Ali there lived once at Cairo FN two hundred fifteen in the days of Salah the Egyptian who was Chief of the Cairo Police and had forty men under him a sharper named Ali for whom the Master of Police used to set snares and think that he had fallen therein but when they sought for him they found that he had fled like zaybak or quicksilver wherefore they dubbed him Ali Zaybak or Mercury Ali of Cairo Now one day as he sat with his men in his hall his heart became heavy within him and his breast was straitened The hall keeper saw him sitting with frowning face and said to him What aileth thee O my Chief If thy breast be straitened take a turn in the streets of Cairo for assuredly walking in her markets will do away with thy irk So he rose up and went out and threaded the streets awhile but only increased in cark and care Presently he came to a wine shop and said to himself I will go in and drink myself drunken So he entered and seeing seven rows of people in the shop said Harkye taverner I will not sit except by myself Accordingly the vintner placed him in a chamber alone and set strong pure wine before him whereof he drank till he lost his senses Then he sallied forth again and walked till he came to the road called Red whilst the people left the street clear before him out of fear of him Presently he turned and saw a water carrier trudging along with his skin and gugglet crying out and saying O exchange There is no drink but what raisins make there is no love delight but what of the lover we take and none sitteth in the place of honour save the sensible freke FN two hundred sixteen So he said to him Here give me to drink The water carrier looked at him and gave him the gugglet which he took and gazing into it shook it up and lastly poured it out on the ground Asked the water carrier Why dost thou not drink and he answered saying Give me to drink So the man filled the cup a second time and he took it and shook it and emptied it on the ground and thus he did a third time Quoth the water carrier An thou wilt not drink I will be off And Ali said Give me to drink So he filled the cup a fourth time and gave it to him and he drank and gave the man a dinar The water carrier looked at him with disdain and said belittling him Good luck to thee Good luck to thee my lad Little folk are one thing and great folk another And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Seven Hundred and Ninth Night She continued It hath reached me O auspicious King that the water carrier receiving the dinar looked at the giver with disdain and said Good luck to thee Good luck to thee Little folk are one thing and great folk another Now when Mercury Ali heard this he caught hold of the man s gaberdine and drawing on him a poignard of price such an one as that whereof the poet speaketh in these two couplets Watered steel blade the world perfection calls Drunk with the viper poison foes appals Cuts lively burns the blood whene er it falls And picks up gems from pave of marble halls FN two hundred seventeen cried to him O Shaykh speak reasonably to me Thy water skin is worth if dear three dirhams and the gugglets I emptied on the ground held a pint or so of water Replied the water carrier Tis well and Ali rejoined I gave thee a golden ducat why then dost thou belittle me Say me hast thou ever seen any more valiant than I or more generous than I Answered the water carrier I have indeed seen one more valiant than thou and eke more generous than thou for never since women bare children was there on earth s face a brave man who was not generous Quoth Ali And who is he thou deemest braver and more generous than I Quoth the other Thou must know that I have had a strange adventure My father was a Shaykh of the Water carriers who give drink in Cairo and when he died he left me five male camels a he mule a shop and a house but the poor man is never satisfied or if he be satisfied he dieth So I said to myself I will go up to Al Hijaz and taking a string of camels bought goods on tick till I had run in debt for five hundred ducats all of which I lost in the pilgrimage Then I said in my mind If I return to Cairo the folk will clap me in jail for their goods So I fared with the pilgrims caravan of Damascus to Aleppo and thence I went on to Baghdad where I sought out the Shaykh of the Water carriers of the city and finding his house I went in and repeated the opening chapter of the Koran to him He questioned me of my case and I told him all that had betided me whereupon he assigned me a shop and gave me a water skin and gear So I sallied forth a morn trusting in Allah to provide and went round about the city I offered the gugglet to one that he might drink but he cried I have eaten naught whereon to drink for a niggard invited me this day and set two gugglets before me so I said to him O son of the sordid hast thou given me aught to eat that thou offerest me drink after it Wherefore wend thy ways O water carrier till I have eaten somewhat then come and give me to drink Thereupon I accosted another and he said Allah provide thee And so I went on till noon without taking hansel and I said to myself Would Heaven I had never come to Baghdad Presently I saw the folk running as fast as they could so I followed them and behold a long file of men riding two and two and clad in steel with double neck rings and felt bonnets and burnouses and swords and bucklers I asked one of the folk whose suite this was and he answered That of Captain Ahmad al Danaf Quoth I And what is he and quoth the other He is town captain of Baghdad and her Divan and to him is committed the care of the suburbs He getteth a thousand dinars a month from the Caliph and Hasan Shuman hath the like More over each of his men draweth an hundred dinars a month and they are now returning to their barrack from the Divan And lo Calamity Ahmad saw me and cried out Come give me drink So I filled the cup and gave it him and he shook it and emptied it out like unto thee and thus he did a second time Then I filled the cup a third time and he took a draught as thou diddest after which he asked me O water carrier whence comest thou And I answered From Cairo and he Allah keep Cairo and her citizens What may bring thee thither So I told him my story and gave him to understand that I was a debtor fleeing from debt and distress He cried Thou art welcome to Baghdad then he gave me five dinars and said to his men For the love of Allah be generous to him So each of them gave me a dinar and Ahmad said to me O Shaykh what while thou abidest in Baghdad thou shalt have of us the like every time thou givest us to drink Accordingly I paid them frequent visits and good ceased not to come to me from the folk till one day reckoning up the profit I had made of them I found it a thousand dinars and said to myself The best thing thou canst do is to return to Egypt So I went to Ahmad s house and kissed his hand and he said What seekest thou Quoth I I have a mind to depart and I repeated these two couplets Sojourn of stranger in whatever land Is like castle based upon the wind The breaths of breezes level all he raised And so on homeward way s the stranger s mind I added The caravan is about to start for Cairo and I wish to return to my people So he gave me a she mule and an hundred dinars and said to me I desire to send somewhat by thee O Shaykh Dost thou know the people of Cairo Yes answered I And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Seven Hundred and Tenth Night She pursued It bath reached me O auspicious King that when Ahmad al Danaf had given the water carrier a she mule and an hundred dinars and said to him I desire to send a trust by thee Dost thou know the people of Cairo I answered quoth the water carrier Yes and he said Take this letter and carry it to Ali Zaybak of Cairo and say to him Thy Captain saluteth thee and he is now with the Caliph So I took the letter and journeyed back to Cairo where I paid my debts and plied my water carrying trade but I have not delivered the letter because I know not the abode of Mercury Ali Quoth Ali O elder be of good cheer and keep thine eyes cool and clear I am that Ali the first of the lads of Captain Ahmad here with the letter So he gave him the missive and he opened it and read these two couplets O adornment of beauties to thee write I On a paper that flies as the winds go by Could I fly I had flown to their arms in desire But a bird with cut wings how shall ever he fly But after salutation from Captain Ahmad al Danaf to the eldest of his sons Mercury Ali of Cairo Thou knowest that I tormented Salah al Din the Cairene and befooled him till I buried him alive and reduced his lads to obey me and amongst them Ali Kitf al Jamal and I am now become town captain of Baghdad in the Divan of the Caliph who hath made me over seer of the suburbs An thou be still mindful of our covenant come to me haply thou shalt play some trick in Baghdad which may promote thee to the Caliph s service so he may appoint thee stipends and allowances and assign thee a lodging which is what thou wouldst see and so peace be on thee When Ali read this letter he kissed it and laying it on his head gave the water carrier ten dinars after which he returned to his barracks and told his comrades and said to them I commend you one to other Then he changed all his clothes and donning a travelling cloak and a tarboosh took a case containing a spear of bamboo cane four and twenty cubits long made in several pieces to fit into one another Quoth his lieutenant Wilt thou go a journey when the treasury is empty and quoth Ali When I reach Damascus I will send you what shall suffice you Then he set out and fared on till he overtook a caravan about to start whereof were the Shah bandar or Provost of the Merchants and forty other traders They had all loaded their beasts except the Provost whose loads lay upon the ground and Ali heard his caravan leader who was a Syrian say to the muleteers Bear a hand one of you But they reviled him and abused him Quoth Ali in himself None will suit me so well to travel withal as this leader Now Ali was beardless and well favoured so he went up to and saluted the leader who welcomed him and said What seekest thou Replied Ali O my uncle I see thee alone with forty mule loads of goods but why hast thou not brought hands to help thee Rejoined the other O my son I hired two lads and clothed them and put in each one s pocket two hundred dinars and they helped me till we came to the Dervishes Convent FN two hundred eighteen when they ran away Quoth Ali Whither are you bound and quoth the Syrian to Aleppo when Ali said I will lend thee a hand Accordingly they loaded the beasts and the Provost mounted his she mule and they set out he rejoicing in Ali and presently he loved him and made much of him and on this wise they fared on till nightfall when they dismounted and ate and drank Then came the time of sleep and Ali lay down on his side and made as if he slept whereupon the Syrian stretched himself near him and Ali rose from his stead and sat down at the door of the merchant s pavilion Presently the Syrian turned over and would have taken Ali in his arms but found him not and said to himself Haply he hath promised another and he hath taken him but I have the first right and another night I will keep him Now Ali continued sitting at the door of the tent till nigh upon daybreak when he returned and lay down near the Syrian who found him by his side when he awoke and said to himself If I ask him where he hath been he will leave me and go away So he dissembled with him and they went on till they came to a forest in which was a cave where dwelt a rending lion Now whenever a caravan passed they would draw lots among themselves and him on whom the lot fell they would throw to the beast So they drew lots and the lot fell not save upon the Provost of the Merchants And lo the lion cut off their way awaiting his prey wherefore the Provost was sore distressed and said to the leader Allah disappoint the fortunes FN two hundred nineteen of the far one and bring his journey to naught I charge thee after my death give my loads to my children Quoth Ali the Clever One What meaneth all this So they told him the case and he said Why do ye run from the tom cat of the desert I warrant you I will kill him So the Syrian went to the Provost and told him of this and he said If he slay him I will give him a thousand dinars and said the other merchants We will reward him likewise one and all With this Ali put off his mantle and there appeared upon him a suit of steel then he took a chopper of steel FN two hundred twenty and opening it turned the screw after which he went forth alone and standing in the road before the lion cried out to him The lion ran at him but Ali of Cairo smote him between the eyes with his chopper and cut him in sunder whilst the caravan leader and the merchants looked on Then said he to the leader Have no fear O nuncle and the Syrian answered saying O my son I am thy servant for all future time Then the Provost embraced him and kissed him between the eyes and gave him the thousand dinars and each of the other merchants gave him twenty dinars He deposited all the coin with the Provost and they slept that night till the morning when they set out again intending for Baghdad and fared on till they came to the Lion s Clump and the Wady of Dogs where lay a villain Badawi a brigand and his tribe who sallied forth on them The folk fled from the highwaymen and the Provost said My monies are lost when lo up came Ali in a buff coat hung with bells and bringing out his long lance fitted the pieces together Then he seized one of the Arab s horses and mounting it cried out to the Badawi Chief saying Come out to fight me with spears Moreover he shook his bells and the Arab s mare took fright at the noise and Ali struck the Chief s spear and broke it Then he smote him on the neck and cut off his head FN two hundred twenty one When the Badawin saw their chief fall they ran at Ali but he cried out saying Allaho Akbar God is Most Great and falling on them broke them and put them to flight Then he raised the Chief s head on his spear point and returned to the merchants who rewarded him liberally and continued their journey till they reached Baghdad Thereupon Ali took his money from the Provost and committed it to the Syrian caravan leader saying When thou returnest to Cairo ask for my barracks and give these monies to my deputy Then he slept that night and on the morrow he entered the city and threading the streets enquired for Calamity Ahmad s quarters but none would direct him thereto FN two hundred twenty two So he walked on till he came to the square Al Nafz where he saw children at play and amongst them a lad called Ahmad al Lakit FN two hundred twenty three and said to himself O my Ali thou shalt not get news of them but from their little ones Then he turned and seeing a sweet meat seller bought Halwa of him and called to the children but Ahmad al Lakit drove the rest away and coming up to him said What seekest thou Quoth Ali I had a son and he died and I saw him in a dream asking for sweetmeats wherefore I have bought them and wish to give each child a bit So saying he gave Ahmad a slice and he looked at it and seeing a dinar sticking to it said Begone I am no catamite seek another than I Quoth Ali O my son none but a sharp fellow taketh the hire even as he is a sharp one who giveth it I have sought all day for Ahmad al Danaf s barrack but none would direct me thereto so this dinar is thine an thou wilt guide me thither Quoth the lad I will run before thee and do thou keep up with me till I come to the place when I will catch up a pebble with my foot FN two hundred twenty four and kick it against the door and so shalt thou know it Accordingly he ran on and Ali after him till they came to the place when the boy caught up a pebble between his toes and kicked it against the door so as to make the place known And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Seven Hundred and Eleventh Night She resumed It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Ahmad the Abortion had made known the place Ali laid hold of him and would have taken the dinar from him but could not so he said to him Go thou deservest largesse for thou art a sharp fellow whole of wit and stout of heart Inshallah if I become a captain to the Caliph I will make thee one of my lads Then the boy made off and Ali Zaybak went up to the door and knocked whereupon quoth Ahmad al Danaf O doorkeeper open the door that is the knock of Quicksilver Ali the Cairene So he opened the door and Ali entered and saluted with the salam Ahmad who embraced him and the Forty greeted him Then Calamity Ahmad gave him a suit of clothes saying When the Caliph made me captain he clothed my lads and I kept this suit FN two hundred twenty five for thee Then they seated him in the place of honour and setting on meat they ate well and drink they drank hard and made merry till the morning when Ahmad said to Ali Beware thou walk not about the streets of Baghdad but sit thee still in this barrack Asked Ali Why so Have I come hither to be shut up No I came to look about me and divert myself Replied Ahmad O my son think not that Baghdad be like Cairo Baghdad is the seat of the Caliphate sharpers abound therein and rogueries spring therefrom as worts spring out of earth So Ali abode in the barrack three days when Ahmad said to him I wish to present thee to the Caliph that he may assign thee an allowance But he replied When the time cometh So he let him go his own way One day as Ali sat in the barrack his breast became straitened and his soul troubled and he said in himself Come let us up and thread the ways of Baghdad and broaden my bosom So he went out and walked from street to street till he came to the middle bazar where he entered a cook shop and dined FN two hundred twenty six after which he went out to wash his hands Presently he saw forty slaves with felt bonnets and steel cutlasses come walking two by two and last of all came Dalilah the Wily mounted on a she mule with a gilded helmet which bore a ball of polished steel and clad in a coat of mail and such like Now she was returning from the Divan to the Khan of which she was portress and when she espied Ali she looked at him fixedly and saw that he resembled Calamity Ahmad in height and breadth Moreover he was clad in a striped Aba cloak and a burnous with a steel cutlass by his side and similar gear while valour shone from his eyes testifying in favour of him and not in disfavour of him So she returned to the Khan and going in to her daughter fetched a table of sand and struck a geomantic figure whereby she discovered that the stranger s name was Ali of Cairo and that his fortune overcame her fortune and that of her daughter Asked Zaynab O my mother what hath befallen thee that thou hast recourse to the sand table Answered Dalilah O my daughter I have seen this day a young man who resembleth Calamity Ahmad and I fear lest he come to hear how thou didst strip Ahmad and his men and enter the Khan and play us a trick in revenge for what we did with his chief and the forty for methinks he has taken up his lodging in Al Danaf s barrack Zaynab rejoined What is this Methinks thou hast taken his measure Then she donned her fine clothes and went out into the streets When the people saw her they all made love to her and she promised and sware and listened and coquetted and passed from market to market till she saw Ali the Cairene coming when she went up to him and rubbed her shoulder against him Then she turned and said Allah give long life to folk of discrimination Quoth he How goodly is thy form To whom dost thou belong and quoth she To the gallant FN two hundred twenty seven like thee and he said Art thou wife or spinster Married said she Asked Ali Shall it be in my lodging or thine FN two hundred twenty eight and she answered I am a merchant s daughter and a merchant s wife and in all my life I have never been out of doors till to day and my only reason was that when I made ready food and thought to eat I had no mind thereto without company When I saw thee love of thee entered my heart so wilt thou deign solace my soul and eat a mouthful with me Quoth he Whoso is invited let him accept Thereupon she went on and he followed her from street to street but presently he bethought himself and said What wilt thou do and thou a stranger Verily tis said Whoso doth whoredom in his strangerhood Allah will send him back disappointed But I will put her off from thee with fair words So he said to her Take this dinar and appoint me a day other than this and she said By the Mighty Name it may not be but thou shalt go home with me as my guest this very day and I will take thee to fast friend So he followed her till she came to a house with a lofty porch and a wooden bolt on the door and said to him Open this lock FN two hundred twenty nine Asked he Where is the key and she answered Tis lost Quoth he Whoso openeth a lock without a key is a knave whom it behoveth the ruler to punish and I know not how to open doors without keys FN two hundred thirty With this she raised her veil and showed him her face whereat he took one glance of eyes that cost him a thousand sighs Then she let fall her veil on the lock and repeating over it the names of the mother of Moses opened it without a key and entered He followed her and saw swords and steel weapons hanging up and she put off her veil and sat down with him Quoth he to himself Accomplish what Allah bath decreed to thee and bent over her to take a kiss of her cheek but she caught the kiss upon her palm saying This beseemeth not but by night Then she brought a tray of food and wine and they ate and drank after which she rose and drawing water from the well poured it from the ewer over his hands whilst he washed them Now whilst they were on this wise she cried out and beat upon her breast saying My husband had a signet ring of ruby which was pledged to him for five hundred dinars and I put it on but twas too large for me so I straitened it with wax and when I let down the bucket FN two hundred thirty one that ring must have dropped into the well So turn thy face to the door the while I doff my dress and go down into the well and fetch it Quoth Ali Twere shame on me that thou shouldst go down there I being present none shall do it save I So he put off his clothes and tied the rope about himself and she let him down into the well Now there was much water therein and she said to him The rope is too short loose thyself and drop down So he did himself loose from the rope and dropped into the water in which he sank fathoms deep without touching bottom whilst she donned her mantilla and taking his clothes returned to her mother And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When is was the Seven Hundred and Twelfth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Ali of Cairo was in the well Zaynab donned her mantilla and taking his clothes returned to her mother and said I have stripped Ali the Egyptian and cast him into the Emir Hasan s well whence alas for his chance of escaping FN two hundred thirty two Presently the Emir Hasan the master of the house who had been absent at the Divan came home and finding the door open said to his Syce Why didst thou not draw the bolt O my lord replied the groom indeed I locked it with my own hand The Emir cried As my head liveth some robber hath entered my house Then he went in and searched but found none and said to the groom Fill the ewer that I may make the Wuzu ablution So the man lowered the bucket into the well but when he drew it up he found it heavy and looking down saw something therein sitting whereupon he let it fall into the water and cried out saying O my lord an Ifrit came up to me out of the well Replied the Emir Go and fetch four doctors of the law that they may read the Koran over him till he go away So he fetched the doctors and the Emir said to them Sit round this well and exorcise me this Ifrit They did as he bade them after which the groom and another servant lowered the bucket again and Ali clung to it and hid himself under it patiently till he came near the top when he sprang out and landed among the doctors who fell a cuffing one another and crying out Ifrit Ifrit The Emir looked at Ali and seeing him a young man said to him Art thou a thief No replied Ali Then what dost thou in the well asked the Emir and Ali answered I was asleep and dreamt a wet dream FN two hundred thirty three so I went down to the Tigris to wash myself and dived whereupon the current carried me under the earth and I came up in this well Quoth the other Tell the truth FN two hundred thirty four So Ali told him all that had befallen him and the Emir gave him an old gown and let him go He returned to Calamity Ahmad s lodging and related to him all that had passed Quoth Ahmad Did I not warn thee that Baghdad is full of women who play tricks upon men And quoth Ali Kitf al Jamal I conjure thee by the Mighty Name tell me how it is that thou art the chief of the lads of Cairo and yet hast been stripped by a girl This was grievous to Ali and he repented him of not having followed Ahmad s advice Then the Calamity gave him another suit of clothes and Hasan Shuman said to him Dost thou know the young person No replied Ali and Hasan rejoined Twas Zaynab the daughter of Dalilah the Wily the portress of the Caliph s Khan and hast thou fallen into her toils O Ali Quoth he Yes and quoth Hasan O Ali twas she who took thy Chief s clothes and those of all his men This is a disgrace to you all And what thinkest thou to do I purpose to marry her Put away that thought far from thee and console thy heart of her O Hasan do thou counsel me how I shall do to marry her With all my heart if thou wilt drink from my hand and march under my banner I will bring thee to thy will of her I will well So Hasan made Ali put off his clothes and taking a cauldron heated therein somewhat as it were pitch wherewith he anointed him and he became like unto a blackamoor slave Moreover he smeared his lips and cheeks and pencilled his eyes with red Kohl FN two hundred thirty five Then he clad him in a slave s habit and giving him a tray of kabobs and wine said to him There is a black cook in the Khan who requires from the bazar only meat and thou art now become his like so go thou to him civilly and accost him in friendly fashion and speak to him in the blacks lingo and salute him saying Tis long since we met in the beer ken He will answer thee I have been too busy on my hands be forty slaves for whom I cook dinner and supper besides making ready a tray for Dalilah and the like for her daughter Zaynab and the dogs food And do thou say to him Come let us eat kabobs and lush swipes FN two hundred thirty six Then go with him into the saloon and make him drunken and question him of his service how many dishes and what dishes he hath to cook and ask him of the dogs food and the keys of the kitchen and the larder and he will tell thee for a man when he is drunken telleth all he would conceal were he sober When thou hast done this drug him and don his clothes and sticking the two knives in thy girdle take the vegetable basket and go to the market and buy meat and greens with which do thou return to the Khan and enter the kitchen and the larder and cook the food Dish it up and put Bhang in it so as to drug the dogs and the slaves and Dalilah and Zaynab and lastly serve up When all are asleep hie thee to the upper chamber and bring away every suit of clothes thou wilt find hanging there And if thou have a mind to marry Zaynab bring with thee also the forty carrier pigeons So Ali went to the Khan and going in to the cook saluted him and said Tis long since I have met thee in the beer ken The slave replied I have been busy cooking for the slaves and the dogs Then he took him and making him drunken questioned him of his work Quoth the kitchener Every day I cook five dishes for dinner and the like for supper and yesterday they sought of me a sixth dish FN two hundred thirty seven yellow rice FN two hundred thirty eight and a seventh a mess of cooked pomegranate seed Ali asked And what is the order of thy service and the slave answered First I serve up Zaynab s tray next Dalilah s then I feed the slaves and give the dogs their sufficiency of meat and the least that satisfies them is a pound each But as fate would have it he forgot to ask him of the keys Then he drugged him and donned his clothes after which he took the basket and went to the market There he bought meat and greens And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Seven Hundred and Thirteenth Night She continued It hath reached me O auspicious King that Ali of Cairo after drugging the cook slave with Bhang took the two knives which he stuck in his belt and carrying the vegetable basket went to the market where he bought meat and greens and presently returning to the Khan he saw Dalilah seated at the gate watching those who went in and came out and the forty slaves with her armed So he heartened his heart and entered but Dalilah knew him and said to him Back O captain of thieves Wilt thou play a trick on me in the Khan Thereupon he dressed as a slave turned and said to her What sayest thou O portress She asked What hast thou done with the slave our cook say me if thou hast killed or drugged him He answered What cook Is there here another slave cook than I She rejoined Thou liest thou art Mercury Ali the Cairene And he said to her in slaves patois O portress are the Cairenes black or white I will slave for you no longer Then said the slaves to him What is the matter with thee O our cousin Cried Dalilah This is none of your uncle s children but Ali Zaybak the Egyptian and meseems he hath either drugged your cousin or killed him But they said Indeed this is our cousin Sa adu llah the cook and she Not so tis Mercury Ali and he hath dyed his skin Quoth the sharper And who is Ali I am Sa adu llah Then she fetched unguent of proof with which she anointed Ali s forearm and rubbed it but the black did not come off whereupon quoth the slaves Let him go and dress us our dinner Quoth Dalilah If he be indeed your cousin he knoweth what you sought of him yesternight FN two hundred thirty nine and how many dishes he cooketh every day So they asked him of this and he said Every day I cook you five dishes for the morning and the like for the evening meal lentils and rice and broth and stew FN two hundred forty and sherbet of roses and yesternight ye sought of me a sixth dish and a seventh to wit yellow rice and cooked pomegranate seed And the slaves said Right Then quoth Dalilah In with him and if he know the kitchen and the larder he is indeed your cousin but if not kill him Now the cook had a cat which he had brought up and whenever he entered the kitchen it would stand at the door and spring to his back as soon as he went in So when Ali entered the cat saw him and jumped on his shoulders but he threw it off and it ran before him to the door of the kitchen and stopped there He guessed that this was the kitchen door so he took the keys and seeing one with traces of feathers thereon knew it for the kitchen key and therewith opened the door Then he entered and setting down the greens went out again led by the cat which ran before him and stopped at another door He guessed that this was the larder and seeing one of the keys marked with grease knew it for the key and opened the door therewith where upon quoth the slaves O Dalilah were he a stranger he had not known the kitchen and the larder nor had he been able to distinguish the keys thereof from the rest verily he is our cousin Sa adu llah Quoth she He learned the places from the cat and distinguished the keys one from the other by the appearance but this cleverness imposeth not upon me Then he returned to the kitchen where he cooked the dinner and carrying Zaynab s tray up to her room saw all the stolen clothes hanging up after which he went down and took Dalilah her tray and gave the slaves and the dogs their rations The like he did at sundown and drugged Dalilah s food and that of Zaynab and the slaves Now the doors of the Khan were opened and shut with the sun So Ali went forth and cried out saying O dwellers in the Khan the watch is set and we have loosed the dogs whoso stirreth out after this can blame none save himself But he had delayed the dogs supper and put poison therein consequently when he set it before them they ate of it and died while the slaves and Dalilah and Zaynab still slept under Bhang Then he went up and took all the clothes and the carrier pigeons and opening the gate made off to the barrack of the Forty where he found Hasan Shuman the Pestilence who said to him How hast thou fared Thereupon he told him what had passed and he praised him Then he caused him to put off his clothes and boiled a decoction of herbs wherewith he washed him and his skin became white as it was after which he donned his own dress and going back to the Khan clad the cook in the habit he had taken from him and made him smell to the counter drug upon which the slave awoke and going forth to the greengrocer s bought vegetables and returned to the Khan Such was the case with Al Zaybak of Cairo but as regards Dalilah the Wily when the day broke one of the lodgers in the Khan came out of his chamber and seeing the gate open and the slaves drugged and the dogs dead he went in to her and found her lying drugged with a scroll on her neck and at her head a sponge steeped in the counter drug He set the sponge to her nostrils and she awoke and asked Where am I The merchant answered When I came down from my chamber I saw the gate of the Khan open and the dogs dead and found the slaves and thee drugged So she took up the paper and read therein these words None did this deed save Ali the Egyptian Then she awoke the slaves and Zaynab by making them smell the counter Bhang and said to them Did I not tell you that this was Ali of Cairo presently adding to the slaves But do ye conceal the matter Then she said to her daughter How often have I warned thee that Ali would not forego his revenge He hath done this deed in requital of that which thou diddest with him and he had it in his power to do with thee other than this thing but he refrained therefrom out of courtesy and a desire that there should be love and friendship between us So saying she doffed her man s gear and donned woman s attire FN two hundred forty one and tying the kerchief of peace about her neck repaired to Ahmad al Danaf s barrack Now when Ali entered with the clothes and the carrier pigeons Hasan Shuman gave the hall keeper the price of forty pigeons and he bought them and cooked them amongst the men Presently there came a knock at the door and Ahmad said That is Dalilah s knock rise and open to her O hall keeper So he admitted her and And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Seven Hundred and Fourteenth Night She pursued It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Dalilah was admitted Hasan asked her What bringeth thee hither O ill omened old woman Verily thou and thy brother Zurayk the fishmonger are of a piece and she answered O captain I am in the wrong and this my neck is at thy mercy but tell me which of you it was that played me this trick Quoth Calamity Ahmad Twas the first of my lads Rejoined Dalilah For the sake of Allah intercede with him to give me back the carrier pigeons and what not and thou wilt lay me under great obligation When Hasan heard this he said Allah requite thee O Ali Why didst thou cook the pigeons and Ali answered I knew not that they were carrier pigeons Then said Ahmad O hall keeper bring us the cooked pigeons So he brought them and Dalilah took a piece and tasting it said This is none of the carrier pigeons flesh for I fed them on grains of musk and their meat is become even as musk Quoth Shuman An thou desire to have the carrier pigeons comply with Ali s will Asked she What is that And Hasan answered He would have thee marry him to thy daughter Zaynab She said I have not command over her except of affection and Hasan said to Ali the Cairene Give her the pigeons So he gave them to her and she took them and rejoiced in them Then quoth Hasan to her There is no help but thou return us a sufficient reply and Dalilah rejoined If it be indeed his wish to marry her it availed nothing to play this clever trick upon us it behoveth him rather to demand her in marriage of her mother s brother and her guardian Captain Zurayk him who crieth out saying Ho a pound of fish for two farthings and who hangeth up in his shop a purse containing two thousand dinars When the Forty heard this they all rose and cried out saying What manner of blather is this O harlot Dost thou wish to bereave us of our brother Ali of Cairo Then she returned to the Khan and said to her daughter Ali the Egyptian seeketh thee in marriage Whereat Zaynab rejoiced for she loved him because of his chaste forbearance towards her FN two hundred forty two and asked her mother what had passed So she told her adding I made it a condition that he should demand thy hand of thine uncle so I might make him fall into destruction Meanwhile Ali turned to his fellows and asked them What manner of man is this Zurayk and they answered He was chief of the sharpers of Al Irak land and could all but pierce mountains and lay hold upon the stars He would steal the Kohl from the eye and in brief he had not his match for roguery but he hath repented his sins and foresworn his old way of life and opened him a fishmonger s shop And now he hath amassed two thousand dinars by the sale of fish and laid them in a purse with strings of silk to which he hath tied bells and rings and rattles of brass hung on a peg within the doorway Every time he openeth his shop he suspendeth the said purse and crieth out saying Where are ye O sharpers of Egypt O prigs of Al Irak O tricksters of Ajam land Behold Zurayk the fishmonger hath hung up a purse in front of his shop and whoso pretendeth to craft and cunning and can take it by sleight it is his So the long fingered and greedy minded come and try to take the purse but cannot for whilst he frieth his fish and tendeth the fire he layeth at his feet scone like circles of lead and whenever a thief thinketh to take him unawares and maketh a snatch at the purse he casteth at him a load of lead and slayeth him or doeth him a damage So O Ali wert thou to tackle him thou wouldst be as one who jostleth a funeral cortege unknowing who is dead FN two hundred forty three for thou art no match for him and we fear his mischief for thee Indeed thou hast no call to marry Zaynab and he who leaveth a thing alone liveth without it Cried Ali This were shame O comrades needs must I take the purse but bring me a young lady s habit So they brought him women s clothes and he clad himself therein and stained his hands with Henna and modestly hung down his veil Then he took a lamb and killing it cut out the long intestine FN two hundred forty four which he cleaned and tied up below moreover he filled it with the blood and bound it between his thighs after which he donned petticoat trousers and walking boots He also made himself a pair of false breasts with birds crops and filled them with thickened milk and tied round his hips and over his belly a piece of linen which he stuffed with cotton girding himself over all with a kerchief of silk well starched Then he went out whilst all who saw him exclaimed What a fine pair of hind cheeks Presently he saw an ass driver coming so he gave him a dinar and mounting rode till he came to Zurayk s shop where he saw the purse hung up and the gold glittering through it Now Zurayk was frying fish and Ali said O ass man what is that smell Replied he It s the smell of Zurayk s fish Quoth Ali I am a woman with child and the smell harmeth me go fetch me a slice of the fish So the donkey boy said to Zurayk What aileth thee to fry fish so early and annoy pregnant women with the smell I have here the wife of the Emir Hasan Sharr al Tarik and she is with child so give her a bit of fish for the babe stirreth in her womb O Protector O my God avert from us the mischief of this day Thereupon Zurayk took a piece of fish and would have fried it but the fire had gone out and he went in to rekindle it Meanwhile Ali dismounted and sitting down pressed upon the lamb s intestine till it burst and the blood ran out from between his legs Then he cried aloud saying O my back O my side Whereupon the driver turned and seeing the blood running said What aileth thee O my lady Replied Ali I have miscarried where upon Zurayk looked out and seeing the blood fled affrighted into the inner shop Quoth the donkey driver Allah torment thee O Zurayk The lady hath miscarried and thou art no match for her husband Why must thou make a stench so early in the morning I said to thee Bring her a slice but thou wouldst not Thereupon he took his ass and went his way and as Zurayk still did not appear Ali put out his hand to the purse but no sooner had he touched it than the bells and rattles and rings began to jingle and the gold to chink Quoth Zurayk who returned at the sound Thy perfidy hath come to light O gallows bird Wilt thou put a cheat on me and thou in a woman s habit Now take what cometh to thee And he threw a cake of lead at him but it went agley and lighted on another whereupon the people rose against Zurayk and said to him Art thou a trades man or a swashbuckler An thou be a tradesman take down thy purse and spare the folk thy mischief He replied Bismillah in the name of Allah On my head be it As for Ali he made off to the barrack and told Hasan Shuman what had happened after which he put off his woman s gear and donning a groom s habit which was brought to him by his chief took a dish and five dirhams Then he returned to Zurayk s shop and the fishmonger said to him What dost thou want O my master FN two hundred forty five He showed him the dirhams and Zurayk would have given him of the fish in the tray but he said I will have none save hot fish So he set fish in the earthen pan and finding the fire dead went in to relight it whereupon Ali put out his hand to the purse and caught hold of the end of it The rattles and rings and bells jingled and Zurayk said Thy trick hath not deceived me I knew thee for all thou art disguised as a groom by the grip of thy hand on the dish and the dirhams And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Seven Hundred and Fifteenth Night She resumed It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Ali of Egypt put out his hand to the purse the bells and rings jingled and Zurayk said Thy trick hath not deceived me for all thou comest disguised as a groom I knew thee by the grip of thy hand on the dish and the dirhams So saying he threw the lead at him but he avoided it and it fell into the pan full of hot fish and broke it and overturned it fat and all upon the breast and shoulders of the Kazi who was passing The oil ran down inside his clothes to his privy parts and he cried out O my privities What a sad pickle you are in Alas unhappy I Who hath played me this trick Answered the people O our lord it was some small boy that threw a stone into the pan but for Allah s word it had been worse Then they turned and seeing the loaf of lead and that it was Zurayk who had thrown it rose against him and said to him O Zurayk this is not allowed of Allah Take down the purse or it shall go ill for thee Answered he I will take it down Inshallah Meanwhile Ali returned to the barrack and told his comrades who cried Where is the purse all that had passed and they said Thou hast exhausted two thirds of his cunning Then he changed his groom s dress for the garb of a merchant and going out met a snake charmer with a bag of serpents and a wallet containing his kit to whom said he O charmer come and amuse my lads and thou shalt have largesse So he accompanied him to the barrack where he fed him and drugging him with Bhang doffed his clothes and put them on Then he took the bags and repairing to Zurayk s shop began to play the reed pipe Quoth Zurayk Allah provide thee But Ali pulled out the serpents and cast them down before him whereat the fishseller who was afraid of snakes fled from them into the inner shop Thereupon Ali picked up the reptiles and thrusting them back into the bag stretched out his hand and caught hold of the end of the purse The rings again rang and the bells and rattles jangled and Zurayk cried Wilt thou never cease to play me tricks Now thou feignest thyself a serpent charmer So saying he took up a piece of lead and hurled it at Ali but it missed him and fell on the head of a groom who was passing by following his master a trooper and knocked him down Quoth the soldier Who felled him and the folk said Twas a stone fell from the roof So the soldier passed on and the people seeing the piece of lead went up to Zurayk and cried to him Take down the purse and he said Inshallah I will take it down this very night Ali ceased not to practice upon Zurayk till he had made seven different attempts but without taking the purse Then he returned the snake charmer his clothes and kit and gave him due benevolence after which he went back to Zurayk s shop and heard him say If I leave the purse here to night he will dig through the shop wall and take it I will carry it home with me So he arose and shut the shop then he took down the purse and putting it in his bosom set out home till he came near his house when he saw a wedding in a neighbour s lodging and said to himself I will hie me home and give my wife the purse and don my fine clothes and return to the marriage And Ali followed him Now Zurayk had married a black girl one of the freed women of the Wazir Ja afar and she had borne him a son whom he named Abdallah and he had promised her to spend the money in the purse on the occasion of the boy s circumcision and of his marriage procession So he went into his house and as he entered his wife saw that his face was overcast and asked him What hath caused thy sadness Quoth he Allah hath afflicted me this day with a rascal who made seven attempts to get the purse but without avail and quoth she Give it to me that I may lay it up against the boy s festival day Now Ali who had followed him lay hidden in a closet whence he could see and hear all So he gave her the purse and changed his clothes saying Keep the purse safely O Umm Abdallah for I am going to the wedding But she said Take thy sleep awhile So he lay down and fell asleep Presently Ali rose and going on tiptoe to the purse took it and went to the house of the wedding and stood there looking on at the fun Now meanwhile Zurayk dreamt that he saw a bird fly away with the purse and awaking in affright said to his wife Rise look for the purse So she looked and finding it gone buffeted her face and said Alas the blackness of thy fortune O Umm Abdallah A sharker hath taken the purse Quoth Zurayk By Allah it can be none other than rascal Ali who hath plagued me all day He hath followed me home and seized the purse and there is no help but that I go and get it back Quoth she Except thou bring it I will lock on thee the door and leave thee to pass the night in the street So he went up to the house of the wedding and seeing Ali looking on said to himself This is he who took the purse but he lodgeth with Ahmad al Danaf So he forewent him to the barrack and climbing up at the back dropped down into the saloon where he found every one asleep Presently there came a rap at the door and Zurayk asked Who is there Ali of Cairo answered the knocker and Zurayk said Hast thou brought the purse So Ali thought it was Hasan Shuman and replied I have brought it FN two hundred forty six open the door Quoth Zurayk Impossible that I open to thee till I see the purse for thy chief and I have laid a wager about it Said Ali Put out thy hand So he put out his hand through the hole in the side door and Ali laid the purse in it whereupon Zurayk took it and going forth as he had come in returned to the wedding Ali stood for a long while at the door but none opened to him and at last he gave a thundering knock that awoke all the men and they said That is Ali of Cairo s peculiar rap So the hall keeper opened to him and Hasan Shuman said to him Hast thou brought the purse Replied Ali Enough of jesting O Shuman didst thou not swear that thou wouldest not open to me till I showed thee the purse and did I not give it thee through the hole in the side door And didst thou not say to me I am sworn never to open the door till thou show me the purse Quoth Hasan By Allah twas not I who took it but Zurayk Quoth Ali Needs must I get it again and repaired to the house of the wedding where he heard the buffoon FN two hundred forty seven say Bravo FN two hundred forty eight O Abu Abdallah Good luck to thee with thy son Said Ali My luck is in the ascendant and going to the fishmonger s lodging climbed over the back wall of the house and found his wife asleep So he drugged her with Bhang and clad himself in her clothes Then he took the child in his arms and went round searching till he found a palm leaf basket containing buns FN two hundred forty nine which Zurayk of his niggardliness had kept from the Greater Feast Presently the fishmonger returned and knocked at the door whereupon Ali imitated his wife s voice and asked Who is at the door Abu Abdallah answered Zurayk and Ali said I swore that I would not open the door to thee except thou broughtest back the purse Quoth the fish monger I have brought it Cried All Here with it into my hand before I open the door and Zurayk answered saying Let down the basket and take it therein So Sharper Ali let down the basket and the other put the purse therein whereupon Ali took it and drugged the child Then he aroused the woman and making off by the back way as he had entered returned with the child and the purse and the basket of cakes to the barrack and showed them all to the Forty who praised his dexterity There upon he gave them cakes which they ate and made over the boy to Hasan Shuman saying This is Zurayk s child hide it by thee So he hid it and fetching a lamb gave it to the hall keeper who cooked it whole wrapped in a cloth and laid it out shrouded as it were a dead body Meanwhile Zurayk stood awhile waiting at the door then gave a knock like thunder and his wife said to him Hast thou brought the purse He replied Didst thou not take it up in the basket thou diddest let down but now and she rejoined I let no basket down to thee nor have I set eyes on the purse Quoth he By Allah the sharper hath been beforehand with me and hath taken the purse again Then he searched the house and found the basket of cakes gone and the child missing and cried out saying Alas my child Where upon the woman beat her breast and said I and thee to the Wazir for none hath killed my son save this sharper and all because of thee Cried Zurayk I will answer for him So he tied the kerchief of truce about his neck and going to Ahmad al Danaf s lodging knocked at the door The hall keeper admitted him and as he entered Hasan Shuman asked him What bringeth thee here He answered Do ye intercede with Ali the Cairene to restore me my child and I will yield to him the purse of gold Quoth Hasan Allah requite thee O Ali Why didst thou not tell me it was his child What hath befallen him cried Zurayk and Hasan replied We gave him raisins to eat and he choked and died and this is he Quoth Zurayk Alas my son What shall I say to his mother Then he rose and opening the shroud saw it was a lamb barbecued and said Thou makest sport of me O Ali Then they gave him the child and Calamity Ahmad said to him Thou didst hang up the purse proclaiming that it should be the property of any sharper who should be able to take it and Ali hath taken it so tis the very property of our Cairene Zurayk answered I make him a present of it but Ali said to him Do thou accept it on account of thy niece Zaynab And Zurayk replied I accept it Then quoth the Forty We demand of thee Zaynab in marriage for Ali of Cairo but quoth he I have no control over her save of kindness Hasan asked Dost thou grant our suit and he answered Yes I will grant her in marriage to him who can avail to her mahr or marriage settlement And what is her dowry enquired Hasan and Zurayk replied She hath sworn that none shall mount her breast save the man who bringeth her the robe of Kamar daughter of Azariah the Jew and the rest of her gear And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Seven Hundred and Sixteenth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Zurayk replied to Shuman She hath sworn that none shall ride astraddle upon her breast save the man who bringeth her the clothes of Kamar daughter of Azariah the Jew and her crown and girdle and pantoufle FN two hundred fifty of gold Ali cried If I do not bring her the clothes this very night I renounce my claim to her Rejoined Zurayk O Ali thou art a dead man if thou play any of thy pranks on Kamar Why so asked Ali and the other answered Her father Jew Azariah is a skilful wily perfidious magician who hath the Jinn at his service He owneth without the city a castle whose walls are one brick of gold and one of silver and which is visible to the folk only whilst he is therein when he goeth forth it disappeareth He brought his daughter this dress I speak of from an enchanted treasure and every day he layeth it in a charger of gold and opening the windows of the palace crieth out Where are the sharpers of Cairo the prigs of Al Irak the master thieves of Ajam land Whoso prevaileth to take this dress tis his So all the long fingered ones essayed the adventure but failed to take it and he turned them by his magic into apes and asses But Ali said I will assuredly take it and Zaynab shall be displayed therein FN two hundred fifty one So he went to the shop of the Jew and found him a man of stern and forbidding aspect seated with scales and stone weights and gold and silver and nests of drawers and so forth before him and a she mule tethered hard by Presently he rose and shutting his shop laid the gold and silver in two purses which he placed in a pair of saddle bags and set on the she mule s back Then he mounted and rode till he reached the city outskirts followed with out his knowledge by Ali when he took out some dust from a pocket purse and muttering over it sprinkled it upon the air No sooner had he done this than sharper Ali saw a castle which had not its like and the Jew mounted the steps upon his beast which was a subject Jinni after which he dismounted and taking the saddle bags off her back dismissed the she mule and she vanished Then he entered the castle and sat down Presently he arose and opening the lattices took a wand of gold which he set up in the open window and hanging thereto a golden charger by chains of the same metal laid in it the dress whilst Ali watched him from behind the door and presently he cried out saying Where are the sharpers of Cairo Where are the prigs of Al Irak the master thieves of the Ajam land Whoso can take this dress by his sleight tis his Then he pronounced certain magical words and a tray of food spread itself before him He ate and conjured a second time whereupon the tray disappeared and yet a third time when a table of wine was placed between his hands and he drank Quoth Ali I know not how I am to take the dress except if he be drunken Then he stole up behind the Jew whinger in grip but the other turned and conjured saying to his hand Hold with the sword whereupon Ali s right arm was held and abode half way in the air hending the hanger He put out his left hand to the weapon but it also stood fixed in the air and so with his right foot leaving him standing on one foot Then the Jew dispelled the charm from him and Ali became as before Presently Azariah struck a table of sand and found that the thief s name was Mercury Ali of Cairo so he turned to him and said Come nearer Who art thou and what dost thou here He replied I am Ali of Cairo of the band of Ahmad al Danaf I sought the hand of Zaynab daughter of Dalilah the Wily and she demanded thy daughter s dress to her dowry so do thou give it to me and become a Moslem an thou wouldst save thy life Rejoined the Jew After thy death Many have gone about to steal the dress but failed to take it from me wherefore an thou deign be advised thou wilt begone and save thyself for they only seek the dress of thee that thou mayst fall into destruction and indeed had I not seen by geomancy that thy fortune overrideth my fortunes I had smitten thy neck Ali rejoiced to hear that his luck overcame that of the Jew and said to him There is no help for it but I must have the dress and thou must become a True Believer Asked the Jew Is this thy will and last word and Ali answered Yes So the Jew took a cup and filling it with water conjured over it and said to Ali Come forth from this shape of a man into the form of an ass Then he sprinkled him with the water and straightway he became a donkey with hoofs and long ears and fell to braying after the manner of asinines The Jew drew round him a circle which became a wall over against him and drank on till the morning when he said to Ali I will ride thee to day and give the she mule a rest So he locked up the dress the charger the rod and the charms in a cupboard FN two hundred fifty two and conjured over Ali who followed him Then he set the saddle bags on his back and mounting fared forth of the Castle whereupon it disappeared from sight and he rode into Baghdad till he came to his shop where he alighted and emptied the bags of gold and silver into the trays before him As for Ali he was tied up by the shop door where he stood in his asinine form hearing and understanding all that passed without being able to speak And behold up came a young merchant with whom fortune had played the tyrant and who could find no easier Way of earning his livelihood than water carrying So he brought his wife s bracelets to the Jew and said to him Give me the price of these bracelets that I may buy me an ass Asked the Jew What wilt thou do with him and the other answered O master I mean to fetch water from the river on his back and earn my living thereby Quoth the Jew Take this ass of mine So he sold him the bracelets and received the ass shaped Ali of Cairo in part payment and carried him home Quoth Ali to himself If the Ass man clap the pannel on thee and load thee with water skins and go with thee half a score journeys a day he will ruin thy health and thou wilt die So when the water carrier s wife came to bring him his fodder he butted her with his head and she fell on her back whereupon he sprang on her and smiting her brow with his mouth put out and displayed that which his begetter left him She cried aloud and the neighbours came to her assistance and beat him and raised him off her breast When her husband the intended water carrier came home she said to him Now either divorce me or return the ass to his owner He asked What hath happened and she answered This is a devil in the guise of a donkey He sprang upon me and had not the neighbours beaten him off my bosom he had done with me a foul thing So he carried the ass back to the Jew who said to him Wherefore hast thou brought him back and he replied He did a foul thing with my wife So the Jew gave him his money again and he went away and Azariah said to Ali Hast thou recourse to knavery unlucky wretch that thou art in order that And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Seven Hundred and Seventeenth Night She continued It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the water carrier brought back the ass its Jew owner returned to him the monies and turning to Ali of Cairo said Hast thou recourse to knavery unlucky wretch that thou art in order that he may return thee to me But since it pleaseth thee to be an ass I will make thee a spectacle and a laughing stock to great and small Then he mounted him and rode till he came without the city when he brought out the ashes in powder and conjuring over it sprinkled it upon the air and immediately the Castle appeared He entered and taking the saddle bags off the ass s back set up the rod and hung to it the charger wherein were the clothes proclaiming aloud Where be the clever ones of all quarters who may avail to take this dress Then he conjured as before and meat was set before him and he ate and then wine when he drank after which he took a cup of water and muttering certain words thereover sprinkled it on the ass Ali saying Quit this form and return to thy former shape Ali straightway became a man once more and Azariah said to him O Ali take good advice and be content with my mischief Thou hast no call to marry Zaynab nor to take my daughter s dress for tis no easy matter for thee so leave greed and twill be better for thee else will I turn thee into a bear or an ape or set on thee an Ifrit who will cast thee behind the Mountain Kaf He replied I have engaged to take the dress and needs must I have it and thou must Islamise or I will slay thee Rejoined the Jew O Ali thou art like a walnut unless it be broken it cannot be eaten Then he took a cup of water and conjuring over it sprinkled Ali with somewhat thereof saying Take thou shape of bear whereupon he instantly became a bear and the Jew put a collar about his neck muzzled him and chained him to a picket of iron Then he sat down and ate and drank now and then throwing him a morsel of his orts and emptying the dregs of the cup over him till the morning when he rose and laid by the tray and the dress and conjured over the bear which followed him to the shop There the Jew sat down and emptied the gold and silver into the trays before Ali after binding him by the chain and the bear there abode seeing and comprehending but not able to speak Presently up came a man and a merchant who accosted the Jew and said to him O Master wilt thou sell me yonder bear I have a wife who is my cousin and is sick and they have prescribed for her to eat bears flesh and anoint herself with bears grease At this the Jew rejoiced and said to himself I will sell him to this merchant so he may slaughter him and we be at peace from him And Ali also said in his mind By Allah this fellow meaneth to slaughter me but deliverance is with the Almighty Then said the Jew He is a present from me to thee So the merchant took him and carried him into the butcher to whom he said Bring thy tools and company me The butcher took his knives and followed the merchant to his house where he bound the beast and fell to sharpening his blade but when he went up to him to slaughter him the bear escaped from his hands and rising into the air disappeared from sight between heaven and earth nor did he cease flying till he alighted at the Jew s castle Now the reason thereof was on this wise When the Jew returned home his daughter questioned him of Ali and he told her what had happened whereupon she said Summon a Jinni and ask him of the youth whether he be indeed Mercury Ali or another who seeketh to put a cheat on thee So Azariah called a Jinni by conjurations and questioned him of Ali and he replied Tis Ali of Cairo himself The butcher hath pinioned him and whetted his knife to slaughter him Quoth the Jew Go snatch him up and bring him hither ere the butcher cut his throat So the Jinni flew off and snatching Ali out of the butcher s hands bore him to the palace and set him down before the Jew who took a cup of water and conjuring over it sprinkled him therewith saying Return to thine own shape And he straightway became a man again as before The Jew s daughter Kamar FN two hundred fifty three seeing him to be a handsome young man fell in love with him and he fell in love with her and she said to him O unlucky one why dost thou go about to take my dress enforcing my father to deal thus with thee Quoth he I have engaged to get it for Zaynab the Coney catcher that I may wed her therewith And she said Others than thou have played pranks with my father to get my dress but could not win to it presently adding So put away this thought from thee But he answered Needs must I have it and thy father must become a Moslem else I will slay him Then said the Jew See O my daughter how this unlucky fellow seeketh his own destruction adding Now I will turn thee into a dog So he took a cup graven with characters and full of water and conjuring over it sprinkled some of it upon Ali saying Take thou form of dog Whereupon he straight way became a dog and the Jew and his daughter drank together till the morning when the father laid up the dress and charger and mounted his mule Then he conjured over the dog which followed him as he rode towards the town and all dogs barked at Ali FN two hundred fifty four as he passed till he came to the shop of a broker a seller of second hand goods who rose and drove away the dogs and Ali lay down before him The Jew turned and looked for him but finding him not passed onwards Presently the broker shut up his shop and went home followed by the dog which when his daughter saw enter the house she veiled her face and said O my papa dost thou bring a strange man in to me He replied O my daughter this is a dog Quoth she Not so tis Ali the Cairene whom the Jew Azariah hath enchanted and she turned to the dog and said to him Art not Ali of Cairo And he signed to her with his head Yes Then her father asked her Why did the Jew enchant him and she answered Because of his daughter Kamar s dress but I can release him Said the broker An thou canst indeed do him this good office now is the time and she If he will marry me I will release him And he signed to her with his head Yes So she took a cup of water graven with certain signs and conjuring over it was about to sprinkle Ali therewith when lo and behold she heard a great cry and the cup fell from her hand She turned and found that it was her father s handmaid who had cried out and she said to her O my mistress is t thus thou keepest the covenant between me and thee None taught thee this art save I and thou didst agree with me that thou wouldst do naught without consulting me and that whoso married thee should marry me also and that one night should be mine and one night thine And the broker s daughter said Tis well When the broker heard the maid s words he asked his daughter Who taught the maid and she answered O my papa enquire of herself So he put the question and she replied Know O my lord that when I was with Azariah the Jew I used to spy upon him and listen to him when he performed his gramarye and when he went forth to his shop in Baghdad I opened his books and read in them till I became skilled in the Cabbala science One day he was warm with wine and would have me lie with him but I objected saying I may not grant thee this except thou become a Moslem He refused and I said to him Now for the Sultan s market FN two hundred fifty five So he sold me to thee and I taught my young mistress making it a condition with her that she should do naught without my counsel and that whoso might wed her should wed me also one night for me and one night for her Then she took a cup of water and conjuring over it sprinkled the dog therewith saying Return thou to form of man And he straightway was restored to his former shape whereupon the broker saluted him with the salam and asked him the reason of his enchantment So Ali told him all that had passed And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Seven Hundred and Eighteenth Night She resumed It hath reached me O auspicious King that the broker having saluted Ali of Cairo with the salam asked him the reason of his enchantment and what had befallen him and he answered by telling him all that had passed when the broker said to him Will not my daughter and the handmaid suffice thee but he answered Needs must I have Zaynab also Now suddenly there came a rap at the door and the maid said Who is at the door The knocker replied Kamar daughter of Azariah the Jew say me is Ali of Cairo with you Replied the broker s daughter O thou daughter of a dog If he be with us what wilt thou with him Go down O maid and open to her So the maid let her in and when she looked upon Ali and he upon her he said What bringeth thee hither O dog s daughter Quoth she I testify that there is no god but the God and I testify that Mohammed is the Apostle of God And having thus Islamised she asked him Do men in the Faith of Al Islam give marriage portions to women or do women dower men Quoth he Men endow women Then said she I come and dower myself for thee bringing thee as my marriage portion my dress together with the rod and charger and chains and the head of my father the enemy of thee and the foeman of Allah And she threw down the Jew s head before him Now the cause of her slaying her sire was as follows On the night of his turning Ali into a dog she saw in a dream a speaker who said to her Become a Moslemah She did so and as soon as she awoke next morning she expounded Al Islam to her father who refused to embrace the Faith so she drugged him with Bhang and killed him As for Ali he took the gear and said to the broker Meet we to morrow at the Caliph s Divan that I may take thy daughter and the handmaid to wife Then he set out rejoicing to return to the barrack of the Forty On his way he met a sweetmeat seller who was beating hand upon hand and saying There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah the Glorious the Great Folk s labour hath waxed sinful and man is active only in fraud Then said he to Ali I conjure thee by Allah taste of this confection So Ali took a piece and ate it and fell down senseless for there was Bhang therein whereupon the sweetmeat seller seized the dress and the charger and the rest of the gear and thrusting them into the box where he kept his sweetmeats hoisted it up and made off Presently he met a Kazi who called to him saying Come hither O sweet meat seller So he went up to him and setting down his sack laid the tray of sweetmeats upon it and asked What dost thou want Halwa and dragees FN two hundred fifty six answered the Kazi and taking some in his hand said Both of these are adulterated Then he brought out sweetmeats from his breast pocket FN two hundred fifty seven and gave them to the sweetmeat seller saying Look at this fashion how excellent it is Eat of it and make the like of it So he ate and fell down senseless for the sweetmeats were drugged with Bhang whereupon the Kazi bundled him into the sack and made off with him charger and chest and all to the barrack of the Forty Now the Judge in question was Hasan Shuman and the reason of this was as follows When Ali had been gone some days in quest of the dress and they heard no news of him Calamity Ahmad said to his men O lads go and seek for your brother Ali of Cairo So they sallied forth in quest of him and among the rest Hasan Shuman the Pestilence disguised in a Kazi s gear He came upon the sweetmeat seller and knowing him for Ahmad al Lakit FN two hundred fifty eight suspected him of having played some trick upon Ali so he drugged him and did as we have seen Mean while the other Forty fared about the streets and highways making search in different directions and amongst them Ali Kitf al Jamal who espying a crowd made towards the people and found the Cairene Ali lying drugged and senseless in their midst So he revived him and he came to himself and seeing the folk flocking around him asked Where am I Answered Ali Camel shoulder and his comrades We found thee lying here drugged but know not who drugged thee Quoth Ali Twas a certain sweetmeat seller who drugged me and took the gear from me but where is he gone Quoth his comrades We have seen nothing of him but come rise and go home with us So they returned to the barrack where they found Ahmad al Danaf who greeted Ali and enquired if he had brought the dress He replied I was coming hither with it and other matters including the Jew s head when a sweetmeat seller met me and drugged me with Bhang and took them from me Then he told him the whole tale ending with If I come across that man of goodies again I will requite him Presently Hasan Shuman came out of a closet and said to him Hast thou gotten the gear O Ali So he told him what had befallen him and added If I know whither the rascal is gone and where to find the knave I would pay him out Knowest thou whither he went Answered Hasan I know where he is and opening the door of the closet showed him the sweetmeat seller within drugged and senseless Then he aroused him and he opened his eyes and finding himself in presence of Mercury Ali and Calamity Ahmad and the Forty started up and said Where am I and who hath laid hands on me Replied Shuman Twas I laid hands on thee and Ali cried O perfidious wretch wilt thou play thy pranks on me And he would have slain him but Hasan said to him Hold thy hand for this fellow is become thy kinsman How my kinsman quoth Ali and quoth Hasan This is Ahmad al Lakit son of Zaynab s sister Then said Ali to the prisoner Why didst thou thus O Lakit and he replied My grandmother Dalilah the Wily bade me do it only because Zurayk the fishmonger fore gathered with the old woman and said Mercury Ali of Cairo is a sharper and a past master in knavery and he will certainly slay the Jew and bring hither the dress So she sent for me and said to me O Ahmad dost thou know Ali of Cairo Answered I Indeed I do and twas I directed him to Ahmad al Danaf s lodging when he first came to Baghdad Quoth she Go and set thy nets for him and if he have brought back the gear put a cheat on him and take it from him So I went round about the highways of the city till I met a sweetmeat seller and buying his clothes and stock in trade and gear for ten dinars did what was done Thereupon quoth Ali Go back to thy grandmother and Zurayk and tell them that I have brought the gear and the Jew s head and tell them to meet me to morrow at the Caliph s Divan there to receive Zaynab s dowry And Calamity Ahmad rejoiced in this and said We have not wasted our pains in rearing thee O Ali Next morning Ali took the dress the charger the rod and the chains of gold together with the head of Azariah the Jew mounted on a pike and went up accompanied by Ahmad al Danaf and the Forty to the Divan where they kissed ground before the Caliph And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Seven Hundred and Nineteenth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Ali the Cairene went up to the Caliph s Divan accompanied by his uncle Ahmad al Danaf and his lads they kissed ground before the Caliph who turned and seeing a youth of the most valiant aspect enquired of Calamity Ahmad concerning him and he replied O Commander of the Faithful this is Mercury Ali the Egyptian captain of the brave boys of Cairo and he is the first of my lads And the Caliph loved him for the valour that shone from between his eyes testifying for him and not against him Then Ali rose and casting the Jew s head down before him said May thine every enemy be like this one O Prince of True Believers Quoth Al Rashid Whose head is this and quoth Ali Tis the head of Azariah the Jew Who slew him asked the Caliph So Ali related to him all that had passed from first to last and the Caliph said I had not thought thou wouldst kill him for that he was a sorcerer Ali replied O Commander of the Faithful my Lord made me prevail to his slaughter Then the Caliph sent the Chief of Police to the Jew s palace where he found him lying headless so he laid the body on a bier FN two hundred fifty nine and carried it to Al Rashid who commanded to burn it Whereat behold up came Kamar and kissing the ground before the Caliph informed him that she was the daughter of Jew Azariah and that she had become a Moslemah Then she renewed her profession of Faith before the Commander of the Faithful and said to him Be thou my intercessor with Sharper Ali that he take me to wife She also appointed him her guardian to consent to her marriage with the Cairene to whom he gave the Jew s palace and all its contents saying Ask a boon of me Quoth Ali I beg of thee to let me stand on thy carpet and eat of thy table and quoth the Caliph O Ali hast thou any lads He replied I have forty lads but they are in Cairo Rejoined the Caliph Send to Cairo and fetch them hither presently adding But O Ali hast thou a barrack for them No answered Ali and Hasan Shuman said I make him a present of my barrack with all that is therein O Commander of the Faithful However the Caliph retorted saying Thy lodging is thine own O Hasan and he bade his treasurer give the court architect ten thousand dinars that he might build Ali a hall with four daises and forty sleeping closets for his lads Then said he O Ali hast thou any further wish that we may command its fulfilment and said Ali O King of the age be thou my intercessor with Dalilah the Wily that she give me her daughter Zaynab to wife and take the dress and gear of Azariah s girl in lieu of dower Dalilah accepted the Caliph s intercession and accepted the charger and dress and what not and they drew up the marriage contracts between Ali and Zaynab and Kamar the Jew s daughter and the broker s daughter and the handmaid Moreover the Caliph assigned him a solde with a table morning and evening and stipends and allowances for fodder all of the most liberal Then Ali the Cairene fell to making ready for the wedding festivities and after thirty days he sent a letter to his comrades in Cairo wherein he gave them to know of the favours and honours which the Caliph had bestowed upon him and said I have married four maidens and needs must ye come to the wedding So after a reasonable time the forty lads arrived and they held high festival he homed them in his barrack and entreated them with the utmost regard and presented them to the Caliph who bestowed on them robes of honour and largesse Then the tiring women displayed Zaynab before Ali in the dress of the Jew s daughter and he went in unto her and found her a pearl unthridden and a filly by all save himself unridden Then he went in unto the three other maidens and found them accomplished in beauty and loveliness After this it befel that Ali of Cairo was one night on guard by the Caliph who said to him I wish thee O Ali to tell me all that hath befallen thee from first to last with Dalilah the Wily and Zaynab the Coney catcher and Zurayk the Fishmonger So Ali related to him all his adventures and the Commander of the Faithful bade record them and lay them up in the royal muniment rooms So they wrote down all that had befallen him and kept it in store with other histories for the people of Mohammed the Best of Men And Ali and his wives and comrades abode in all solace of life and its joyance till there came to them the Destroyer of Delights and Sunderer of Societies and Allah be He extolled and exalted is All knowing FN two hundred sixty And also men relate the tale of ARDASHIR AND HAYAT AL NUFUS FN two hundred sixty one There was once in the city of Shiraz a mighty King called Sayf al A azam Shah who had grown old without being blessed with a son So he summoned the physicists and physicians and said to them I am now in years and ye know my case and the state of the kingdom and its ordinance and I fear for my subjects after me for that up to this present I have not been vouchsafed a son Thereupon they replied We will compound thee a somewhat of drugs wherein shall be efficacy if it please Almighty Allah So they mixed him drugs which he used and knew his wife carnally and she conceived by leave of the Most High Lord who saith to a thing Be and it becometh When her months were accomplished she gave birth to a male child like the moon whom his father named Ardashir FN two hundred sixty two and he grew up and throve and applied himself to the study of learning and letters till he attained the age of fifteen Now there was in Al Irak a King called Abd al Kadir who had a daughter by name Hayat al Nufus and she was like the rising full moon but she had an hatred for men and the folk very hardly dared name mankind in her presence The Kings of the Chosroes had sought her in marriage of her sire but when he spoke with her thereof she said Never will I do this and if thou force me thereto I will slay myself Now Prince Ardashir heard of her fame and fell in love with her and told his father who seeing his case took pity on him and promised him day by day that he should marry her So he despatched his Wazir to demand her in wedlock but King Abd al Kadir refused and when the Minister returned to King Sayf al A azam and acquainted him with what had befallen his mission and the failure thereof he was wroth with exceeding wrath and cried Shall the like of me send to one of the Kings on a requisition and he accomplish it not Then he bade a herald make proclamation to his troops bidding them bring out the tents and equip them for war with all diligence though they should borrow money for the necessary expenses and he said I will on no wise turn back till I have laid waste King Abd al Kadir s dominions and slain his men and plundered his treasures and blotted out his traces When the report of this reached Ardashir he rose from his carpet bed and going in to his father kissed ground FN two hundred sixty three between his hands and said O mighty King trouble not thyself with aught of this thing And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Seven Hundred and Twentieth Night She continued It hath reached me O auspicious King that when report of this reached the Prince he went in to his sire the King and kissing ground between his hands said O mighty King trouble not thy soul with aught of this thing and levy not thy champions and armies neither spend thy monies Thou art stronger than he and if thou loose upon him this thy host thou wilt lay waste his cities and dominions and spoil his good and slay his strong men and himself but when his daughter shall come to know what hath befallen her father and his people by reason of her she will slay herself and I shall die on her account for I can never live after her no never Asked the King And what then thinkest thou to do O my son and the Prince answered I will don a merchant s habit and cast about how I may win to the Princess and compass my desire of her Quoth Sayf al A azam Art thou determined upon this and quoth the Prince Yes O my sire whereupon the King called to his Wazir and said to him Do thou journey with my son the core of my heart and help him to win his will and watch over him and guide him with thy sound judgment for thou standest to him even in my stead I hear and obey answered the Minister and the King gave his son three hundred thousand dinars in gold and great store of jewels and precious stones and goldsmiths ware and stuffs and other things of price Then Prince Ardashir went in to his mother and kissed her hands and asked her blessing She blessed him and forthright opening her treasures brought out to him necklaces and trinkets and apparel and all manner of other costly objects hoarded up from the time of the bygone Kings whose price might not be evened with coin Moreover he took with him of his Mamelukes and negro slaves and cattle all that he needed for the road and clad himself and the Wazir and their company in traders gear Then he farewelled his parents and kinsfolk and friends and setting out fared on over wolds and wastes all hours of the day and watches of the night and whenas the way was longsome upon him he improvised these couplets My longing bred of love with mine unease for ever grows Nor against all the wrongs of time one succourer arose When Pleiads and the Fishes show in sky the rise I watch As worshipper within whose breast a pious burning glows For Star o Morn I speer until at last when it is seen I m madded with my passion and my fancy s woes and throes I swear by you that never from your love have I been loosed Naught am I save a watcher who of slumber nothing knows Though hard appear my hope to win though languor aye increase And after thee my patience fails and ne er a helper shows Yet will I wait till Allah shall be pleased to join our loves I ll mortify the jealous and I ll mock me of my foes When he ended his verse he swooned away and the Wazir sprinkled rose water on him till the Prince came to himself when the Minister said to him O King s son possess thy soul in patience for the consequence of patience is consolation and behold thou art on the way to whatso thou wishest And he ceased not to bespeak him fair and comfort him till his trouble subsided and they continued their journey with all diligence Presently the Prince again became impatient of the length of the way and bethought him of his beloved and recited these couplets Longsome is absence restlessness increaseth and despite And burn my vitals in the blaze my love and longings light Grows my hair gray from pains and pangs which I am doomed bear For pine while tear floods stream from eyes and sore offend my sight I swear O Hope of me O End of every wish and will By Him who made mankind and every branch with leafage dight A passion load for thee O my Desire I must endure And boast I that to bear such load no lover hath the might Question the Night of me and Night thy soul shall satisfy Mine eyelids never close in sleep throughout the livelong night Then he wept with sore weeping and plained of that he suffered for stress of love longing but the Wazir comforted him and spoke him fair promising him the winning of his wish after which they fared on again for a few days when they drew near to the White City the capital of King Abd al Kadir soon after sunrise Then said the Minister to the Prince Rejoice O King s son in all good for see yonder is the White City that which thou seekest Whereat the Prince rejoiced with exceeding joy and recited these couplets My friends I yearn in heart distraught for him Longing abides and with sore pains I brim I mourn like childless mother nor can find One to console me when the light grows dim Yet when the breezes blow from off thy land I feel their freshness shed on heart and limb And rail mine eyes like water laden clouds While in a tear sea shed by heart I swim Now when they entered the White City they asked for the Merchants Khan a place of moneyed men and when shown the hostelry they hired three magazines and on receiving the keys FN two hundred sixty four they laid up therein all their goods and gear They abode in the Khan till they were rested when the Wazir applied himself to devise a device for the Prince And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Seven Hundred and Twenty first Night She pursued It hath reached me O auspicious King that the Prince and the Minister alighted at the Khan and lodged their goods in the ground floor magazines and there settled their servants Then they tarried awhile till they had rested when the Wazir arose and applied himself to devise a device for the Prince and said to him I have bethought me of somewhat wherein methinks will be success for thee so it please Almighty Allah Quoth Ardashir O thou Wazir of good counsel do what cometh to thy mind and may the Lord direct thy rede aright Quoth the Minister I purpose to hire thee a shop in the market street of the stuff sellers and set thee therein for that all great and small have recourse to the bazar and meseems when the folk see thee with their own eyes sitting in the shop their hearts will incline to thee and thou wilt thus be enabled to attain thy desire for thou art fair of favour and souls incline to thee and sight rejoiceth in thee The other replied Do what seemeth good to thee So the Wazir forthright began to robe the Prince and himself in their richest raiment and putting a purse of a thousand dinars in his breast pocket went forth and walked about the city whilst all who looked upon them marvelled at the beauty of the King s son saying Glory be to Him who created this youth of vile water FN two hundred sixty five Blessed be Allah excellentest of Creators Great was the talk anent him and some said This is no mortal this is naught save a noble angel FN two hundred sixty six and others Hath Rizwan the door keeper of the Eden garden left the gate of Paradise unguarded that this youth hath come forth The people followed them to the stuff market where they entered and stood till there came up to them an old man of dignified presence and venerable appearance who saluted them and they returned his salam Then the Shaykh said to them O my lords have ye any need that we may have the honour of accomplishing and the Wazir asked him Who art thou O elder He answered I am the Overseer of the market Quoth the Wazir Know then O Shaykh that this youth is my son and I wish to hire him a shop in the bazar that he may sit therein and learn to sell and buy and take and give and come to ken merchants ways and habits I hear and I obey replied the Overseer and brought them without stay or delay the key of a shop which he caused the brokers sweep and clean And they did his bidding Then the Wazir sent for a high mattress stuffed with ostrich down and set it up in the shop spreading upon it a small prayer carpet and a cushion fringed with broidery of red gold Moreover he brought pillows and transported thither so much of the goods and stuffs that he had brought with him as filled the shop Next morning the young Prince came and opening the shop seated himself on the divan and stationed two Mamelukes clad in the richest of raiment before him and two black slaves of the goodliest of the Abyssinians in the lower part of the shop The Wazir enjoined him to keep his secret from the folk so thereby he might find aid in the winning of his wishes then he left him and charging him to acquaint him with what befel him in the shop day by day returned to the Khan The Prince sat in the shop till night as he were the moon at its fullest whilst the folk hearing tell of his comeliness flocked to the place without errand to gaze on his beauty and loveliness and symmetry and perfect grace and glorify the Almighty who created and shaped him till none could pass through that bazar for the excessive crowding of the folk about him The King s son turned right and left abashed at the throng of people that stared at him hoping to make acquaintance with some one about the court of whom he might get news of the Princess but he found no way to this wherefore his breast was straitened Meanwhile the Wazir daily promised him the attainment of his desire and the case so continued for a time till one morning as the youth sat in the shop there came up an old woman of respectable semblance and dignified presence clad in raiment of devotees FN two hundred sixty seven and followed by two slave girls like moons She stopped before the shop and having considered the Prince awhile cried Glory be to God who fashioned that face and perfected that figure Then she saluted him and he returned her salam and seated her by his side Quoth she Whence cometh thou O fair of favour and quoth he From the parts of Hind O my mother and I have come to this city to see the world and look about me Honour to thee for a visitor What goods and stuffs hast thou Show me something handsome fit for Kings If thou wish for handsome stuffs I will show them to thee for I have wares that beseem persons of every condition O my son I want somewhat costly of price and seemly to sight brief the best thou hast Thou must needs tell me for whom thou seekest it that I may show thee goods according to the rank of the requiter Thou speakest sooth O my son said she I want somewhat for my mistress Hayat al Nufus daughter of Abd al Kadir lord of this land and King of this country Now when Ardashir heard his mistress s name his reason flew for joy and his heart fluttered and he gave no order to slave or servant but putting his hand behind him pulled out a purse of an hundred dinars and offered it to the old woman saying This is for the washing of thy clothes Then he again put forth his hand and brought out of a wrapper a dress worth ten thousand dinars or more and said to her This is of that which I have brought to your country When the old woman saw it it pleased her and she asked What is the price of this dress O perfect in qualities Answered he I will take no price for it whereupon she thanked him and repeated her question but he said By Allah I will take no price for it I make thee a present of it an the Princess will not accept it and tis a guest gift from me to thee Alham dolillah Glory be to God who hath brought us together so that if one day I have a want I shall find in thee a helper to me in winning it She marvelled at the goodliness of his speech and the excess of his generosity and the perfection of his courtesy and said to him What is thy name O my lord He replied My name is Ardashir and she cried By Allah this is a rare name Therewith are Kings sons named and thou art in a guise of the sons of the merchants Quoth he Of the love my father bore me he gave me this name but a name signifieth naught and quoth she in wonder O my son take the price of thy goods But he swore that he would not take aught Then the old lady said to him O my dear one Truth I would have thee know is the greatest of all things and thou hadst not dealt thus generously by me but for a special reason so tell me thy case and thy secret thought belike thou hast some wish to whose winning I may help thee Thereupon he laid his hand in hers and after exacting an oath of secrecy told her the whole story of his passion for the Princess and his condition by reason thereof The old woman shook her head and said True but O my son the wise say in the current adage An thou wouldest be obeyed abstain from ordering what may not be made and thou my son thy name is Merchant and though thou hadst the keys of the Hidden Hoards yet wouldst thou be called naught but Merchant An thou wouldst rise to high rank according to thy station then seek the hand of a Kazi s daughter or even an Emir s but why O my son aspirest thou to none but the daughter of the King of the age and the time and she a clean maid who knoweth nothing of the things of the world and hath never in her life seen anything but her palace wherein she dwelleth Yet for all her tender age she is intelligent shrewd vivacious penetrating quick of wit sharp of act and rare of rede her father hath no other child and she is dearer to him than his life and soul Every morning he cometh to her and giveth her good morrow and all who dwell in the palace stand in dread of her Think not O my son that any dare bespeak her with aught of these words nor is there any way for me thereto By Allah O my son my heart and vitals love thee and were it in my power to give thee access to her I would assuredly do it but I will tell thee somewhat wherein Allah may haply appoint the healing of thy heart and will risk life and goods for thee till I win thy will for thee He asked And what is that O my mother and she answered Seek of me the daughter of a Wazir or an Emir and I will grant thy request but it may not be that one should mount from earth to heaven at one bound When the Prince heard this he replied to her with courtesy and sense O my mother thou art a woman of wit and knowest how things go Say me doth a man when his head irketh him bind up his hand Quoth she No by Allah O my son and quoth he Even so my heart seeketh none but her and naught slayeth me but love of her By Allah I am a dead man and I find not one to counsel me aright and succour me Allah upon thee O my mother take pity on my strangerhood and the streaming of my tears And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Seven Hundred and Twenty second Night She resumed It hath reached me O auspicious King that Ardashir the King s son said to the old woman Allah upon thee O my mother take pity on my strangerhood and the streaming of my tears Replied she By Allah O my son thy words rend my heart but my hand hath no cunning wherewith to help thee Quoth he I beseech thee of thy favour carry her a letter and kiss her hands for me So she had compassion on him and said Write what thou wilt and I will bear it to her When he heard this he was ready to fly for joy and calling for ink case and paper wrote these couplets O Hayat al Nufus be general rous and incline To one who loving thee for parting s doomed to pine I was in all delight in gladsomest of life But now I am distraught with sufferings condign To wakefulness I cling through longsomeness of night And with me sorrow chats FN two hundred sixty eight through each sad eye of mine Pity a lover sad a sore afflicted wretch Whose eyelids ever ulcered are with tearful brine And when the morning comes at last the real morn He finds him drunken and distraught with passion s wine Then he folded the scroll and kissing it gave it to the old woman after which he put his hand to a chest and took out a second purse containing an hundred dinars which he presented to her saying Divide this among the slave girls She refused it and cried By Allah O my son I am not with thee for aught of this however he thanked her and answered There is no help but that thou accept of it So she took it and kissing his hands returned home and going in to the Princess cried O my lady I have brought thee somewhat the like whereof is not with the people of our city and it cometh from a handsome young man than whom there is not a goodlier on earth s face She asked O my nurse and whence cometh the youth and the old woman answered From the parts of Hind and he hath given me this dress of gold brocade embroidered with pearls and gems and worth the Kingdom of Chosroes and Caesar Thereupon she opened the dress and the whole palace was illuminated by its brightness because of the beauty of its fashion and the wealth of unions and jewels wherewith it was broidered and all who were present marvelled at it The Princess examined it and judging it to be worth no less than a whole year s revenue of her father s kingdom said to the old woman O my nurse cometh this dress from him or from another FN two hundred sixty nine Replied she From him and Hayat al Nufus asked Is this trader of our town or a stranger The old woman answered He is a foreigner O my lady newly come hither and by Allah he hath servants and slaves and he is fair of face symmetrical of form well mannered open handed and open hearted never saw I a goodlier than he save thyself The King s daughter rejoined Indeed this is an extraordinary thing that a dress like this which money cannot buy should be in the hands of a merchant What price did he set on it O my nurse Quoth she By Allah he would set no price on it but gave me back the money thou sentest by me and swore that he would take naught thereof saying Tis a gift from me to the King s daughter for it beseemeth none but her and if she will not accept it I make thee a present of it Cried the Princess By Allah this is indeed marvellous generosity and wondrous munificence But I fear the issue of his affair lest haply FN two hundred seventy he be brought to necessity Why didst thou not ask him O my nurse if he had any desire that we might fulfil it for him The nurse replied O my lady I did ask him and he said to me I have indeed a desire but he would not tell me what it was However he gave me this letter and said Carry it to the Princess So Hayat al Nufus took the letter and opened and read it to the end whereupon she was sore chafed and lost temper and changing colour for anger she cried out to the old woman saying Woe to thee O nurse What is the name of this dog who durst write this language to a King s daughter What affinity is there between me and this hound that he should address me thus By Almighty Allah Lord of the well Zemzem and of the Hatim Wall FN two hundred seventy one but that I fear the Omnipotent the Most High I would send and bind the cur s hands behind him and slit his nostrils and shear off his nose and ears and after by way of example crucify him on the gate of the bazar wherein is his booth When the old woman heard these words she waxed yellow her side muscles FN two hundred seventy two quivered and her tongue clave to her mouth but she heartened her heart and said Softly O my lady What is there in his letter to trouble thee thus Is it aught but a memorial containing his complaint to thee of poverty or oppression from which he hopeth to be relieved by thy favour Replied she No by Allah O my nurse tis naught of this but verses and shameful words However O my nurse this dog must be in one of three cases either he is Jinn mad and hath no wit or he seeketh his own slaughter or else he is assisted to his wish of me by some one of exceeding puissance and a mighty Sultan Or hath he heard that I am one of the baggages of the city who lie a night or two with whosoever seeketh them that he writeth me immodest verses to debauch my reason by talking of such matters Rejoined the old woman By Allah O my lady thou sayst sooth But reck not thou of yonder ignorant hound for thou art seated in thy lofty firm builded and unapproachable palace to which the very birds cannot soar neither the wind pass over it and as for him he is clean distraught Wherefore do thou write him a letter and chide him angrily and spare him no manner of reproof but threaten him with dreadful threats and menace him with death and say to him Whence hast thou knowledge of me that thou durst write me O dog of a merchant O thou who trudgest far and wide all thy days in wilds and wolds for the sake of gaining a dirham or a dinar By Allah except thou awake from thy sleep and put off thine intoxication I will assuredly crucify thee on the gate of the market street wherein is thy shop Quoth the Princess I fear lest he presume if I write to him and quoth the nurse And pray what is he and what is his rank that he should presume to us Indeed we write him but to the intent that his presumption may be cut off and his fear magnified And she ceased not craftily to persuade her till she called for ink case and paper and wrote him these couplets O thou who claimest to be prey of love and ecstasy Thou who for passion spendest nights in grief and saddest gree Say dost thou haughty one desire enjoyment of the moon Did man e er sue the moon for grace whate er his lunacy I verily will counsel thee with rede the best to hear Cut short this course ere come thou nigh sore risk nay death to dree If thou to this request return surely on thee shall fall Sore punishment for vile offence a grievous penalty Be reasonable then be wise hark back unto thy wits Behold in very truth I speak with best advice to thee By Him who did all things that be create from nothingness Who dressed the face of heaven with stars in brightest radiancy If in the like of this thy speech thou dare to sin again I ll surely have thee crucified upon a trunk of tree Then she rolled up the letter and gave it to the old woman who took it and repairing to Ardashir s shop delivered it to him And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Seven Hundred and Twenty third Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the old woman took that letter from Hayat al Nufus she fared forth till she found the youth who was sitting in his shop and gave it to him saying Read thine answer and know that when she perused thy paper she was wroth with exceeding wrath but I soothed her and spake her fair till she consented to write thee a reply He took the letter joyfully but when he had read it and understood its drift he wept sore whereat the old woman s heart ached and she cried O my son Allah never cause thine eyes to weep nor thy heart to mourn What can be more gracious than that she should answer thy letter when thou hast done what thou diddest He replied O my mother what shall I do for a subtle device Behold she writeth to me threatening me with death and crucifixion and forbidding me from writing to her and I by Allah see my death to be better than my life but I beg thee of thy grace FN two hundred seventy three to carry her another letter from me She said Write and I warrant I ll bring thee an answer By Allah I will assuredly venture my life to win for thee thy wish though I die to pleasure thee He thanked her and kissing her hands wrote these verses Do you threaten me wi death for my loving you so well When Death to me were rest and all dying is by Fate And man s death is but a boon when so longsome to him grows His life and rejected he lives in lonest state Then visit ye a lover who hath ne er a soul to aid For on pious works of men Heaven s blessing shall await But an ye be resolved on this deed then up and on I m in bonds to you a bondsman confined within your gate What path have I whose patience without you is no more How is this when a lover s heart in stress of love is strait O my lady show me ruth who by passion am misused For all who love the noble stand for evermore excused He then folded the scroll and gave it to the old woman together with two purses of two hundred dinars which she would have refused but he conjured her by oath to accept of them So she took them both and said Needs must I bring thee to thy desire despite the noses of thy foes Then she repaired to the palace and gave the letter to Hayat al Nufus who said What is this O my nurse Here are we in a correspondence and thou coming and going Indeed I fear lest the matter get wind and we be disgraced Rejoined the old woman How so O my lady Who dare speak such word So she took the letter and after reading and understanding it she smote hand on hand saying Verily this is a calamity which is fallen upon us and I know not whence this young man came to us Quoth the old woman O my lady Allah upon thee write him another letter but be rough with him this time and say to him An thou write me another word after this I will have thy head struck off Quoth the Princess O my nurse I am assured that the matter will not end on such wise twere better to break off this exchange of letters and except the puppy take warning by my previous threats I will strike off his head The old woman said Then write him a letter and give him to know this condition So Hayat al Nufus called for pen case and paper and wrote these couplets Ho thou heedless of Time and his sore despight Ho thou heart whom hopes of my favours excite Think O pride full would saint win for thyself the skies Would saint attain to the moon shining clear and bright I will burn thee with fire that shall ne er be quenched Or will slay thee with scymitar s sharpest bite Leave it friend and scape the tormenting pains Such as turn hair partings FN two hundred seventy four from black to white Take my warning and fly from the road of love Draw thee back from a course nor seemly nor right Then she folded the scroll and gave it to the old woman who was puzzled and perplexed by the matter She carried it to Ardashir and the Prince read the letter and bowed his head to the earth making as if he wrote with his finger and speaking not a word Quoth the old woman How is it I see thee silent stay and not say thy say and quoth he O my mother what shall I say seeing that she doth but threaten me and redoubleth in hard heartedness and aversion Rejoined the nurse Write her a letter of what thou wilt I will protect thee nor let thy heart be cast down for needs must I bring you twain together He thanked her for her kindness and kissing her hand wrote these couplets A heart by Allah never soft to lover wight Who sighs for union only with his friends his sprite Who with tear ulcered eyelids evermore must bide When falleth upon earth first darkness of the night Be just be general rous lend thy ruth and deign give alms To love molested lover parted forced to flight He spends the length of longsome night without a doze Fire brent and drent in tear flood flowing infinite Ah cut not off the longing of my fondest heart Now disappointed wasted flutt ring for its blight Then he folded the scroll and gave it to the old woman together with three hundred dinars saying This is for the washing of thy hands She thanked him and kissed his hands after which she returned to the palace and gave the letter to the Princess who took it and read it and throwing it from her fingers sprang to her feet Then she walked shod as she was with pattens of gold set with pearls and jewels till she came to her sire s palace whilst the vein of anger started out between her eyes and none dared ask her of her case When she reached the palace she enquired for the King and the slave girls and concubines replied to her O my lady he is gone forth a hunting and sporting So she returned as she were a rending lioness and bespake none for the space of three hours when her brow cleared and her wrath cooled As soon as the old woman saw that her irk and anger were past she went up to her and kissing ground between her hands asked her O my lady whither went those noble steps The Princess answered To the palace of the King my sire And could no one do thine errand enquired the nurse Replied the Princess No for I went to acquaint him of that which hath befallen me with yonder cur of a merchant so he might lay hands on him and on all the merchants of his bazar and crucify them over their shops nor suffer a single foreign merchant to tarry in our town Quoth the old woman And was this thine only reason O my lady for going to thy sire and quoth Hayat al Nufus Yes but I found him absent a hunting and sporting and now I await his return Cried the old nurse I take refuge with Allah the All hearing the All knowing Praised be He O my lady thou art the most sensible of women and how couldst thou think of telling the King these fond words which it behoveth none to publish Asked the Princess And why so and the nurse answered Suppose thou had found the King in his palace and told him all this tale and he had sent after the merchants and commanded to hang them over their shops the folk would have seen them hanging and asked the reason and it would have been answered them They sought to seduce the King s daughter And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Seven Hundred and Twenty fourth Night She continued It hath reached me O auspicious King that the old woman said to the Princess Suppose thou had told this to the King and he had ordered the merchants to be hanged would not folk have seen them and have asked the cause of the execution when the answer would have been They sought to seduce the King s daughter Then would they have dispread divers reports concerning thee some saying She abode with them ten days away from her palace till they had taken their fill of her and other some in otherguise for woman s honour O my lady is like ourded milk the least dust fouleth it and like glass which if it be cracked may not be mended So beware of telling thy sire or any other of this matter lest thy fair fame be smirched O mistress mine for twill never profit thee to tell folk aught no never Weigh what I say with thy keen wit and if thou find it not just do whatso thou wilt The Princess pondered her words and seeing them to be altogether profitable and right said Thou speaketh sooth O my nurse but anger had blinded my judgment Quoth the old woman Thy resolve to tell no one is pleasing to the Almighty but something remaineth to be done we must not let the shamelessness of yonder vile dog of a merchant pass without notice Write him a letter and say to him O vilest of traders but that I found the King my father absent I had straightway commanded to hang thee and all thy neighbours But thou shalt gain nothing by this for I swear to thee by Allah the Most High that an thou return to the like of this talk I will blot out the trace of thee from the face of earth And deal thou roughly with him in words so shalt thou discourage him in this attempt and arouse him from his heedlessness And will these words cause him to abstain from his offending asked the Princess and the old woman answered How should he not abstain Besides I will talk with him and tell him what hath passed So the Princess called for ink case and paper and wrote these couplets To win our favours still thy hopes are bent And still to win thy will art confident Naught save his pride full aim shall slay a man And he by us shall die of his intent Thou art no lord of might no chief of men Nabob or Prince or Soldan Heaven sent And were this deed of one who is our peer He had returned with hair for fear white sprent Yet will I deign once more excuse thy sin So from this time thou prove thee penitent Then she gave the missive to the old woman saying O my nurse do thou admonish this puppy lest I be forced to cut off his head and sin on his account Replied the old woman By Allah O my lady I will not leave him a side to turn on Then she returned to the youth and when salams had been exchanged she gave him the letter He read it and shook his head saying Verily we are Allah s and unto him shall we return adding O my mother what shall I do My fortitude faileth me and my patience palleth upon me She replied O my son be long suffering peradventure after this Allah shall bring somewhat to pass Write that which is in thy mind and I will fetch thee an answer and be of good cheer and keep thine eyes cool and clear for needs must I bring about union between thee and her Inshallah He blessed her and wrote to the Princess a note containing these couplets Since none will lend my love a helping hand And I by passion s bale in death low lain I bear a flaming fire within my heart By day and night nor place of rest attain How cease to hope in thee my wishes term Or with my longings to be glad and fain The Lord of highmost Heaven to grant my prayer Pray I whom love of lady fair hath slain And as I m clean o erthrown by love and fear To grant me speedy union deign oh deign Then he folded the scroll and gave it to the old woman bringing out at the same time a purse of four hundred dinars She took the whole and returning to the palace sought the Princess to whom she gave the letter but the King s daughter refused to take it and cried What is this Replied the old woman O my lady this is only the answer to the letter thou sentest to that merchant dog Quoth Hayat al Nufus Didst thou forbid him as I told thee and quoth she Yes and this is his reply So the Princess took the letter and read it to the end then she turned to the old woman and exclaimed Where is the result of thy promise O my lady saith he not in his letter that he repenteth and will not again offend excusing himself for the past Not so by Allah on the contrary he increaseth O my lady write him a letter and thou shalt presently see what I will do with him There needeth nor letter nor answer I must have a letter that I may rebuke him roughly and cut off his hopes Thou canst do that without a letter I cannot do it without the letter So Hayat al Nufus called for pen case and paper and wrote these verses Long have I chid thee but my chiding hindereth thee not How often would my verse with writ o hand ensnare thee ah Then keep thy passion hidden deep and ever unrevealed And if thou dare gainsay me Earth shall no more bear thee ah And if despite my warning thou dost to such words return Death s Messenger FN two hundred seventy five shall go his rounds and dead declare thee ah Soon shall the wold s fierce chilling blast o erblow that corse o thine And birds o the wild with ravening bills and beaks shall tear thee ah Return to righteous course perchance that same will profit thee If bent on wilful aims and lewd I fain forswear thee ah When she had made an end of her writing this she cast the writ from her hand in wrath and the old woman picked it up and went with it to Ardashir When he read it to the last he knew that she had not softened to him but only redoubled in rage against him and that he would never win to meet her so he bethought himself to write her an answer invoking Allah s help against her Thereupon he indited these couplets O Lord by the Five Shaykhs I pray deliver me From love which gars me bear such grief and misery Thou knowest what I bear for passion s fiery flame What stress of sickness for that merciless maid I dree She hath no pity on the pangs to me decreed How long on weakly wight shall last her tyranny I am distraught for her with passing agonies And find no friend O folk to hear my plaint and plea How long when Night hath drooped her pinions o er the world Shall I lament in public as in privacy For love of you I cannot find forgetfulness And how forget when Patience taketh wings to flee O thou wild parting bird FN two hundred seventy six say is she safe and sure From shift and change of time and the world s cruelty Then he folded the scroll and gave it to the old woman adding a purse of five hundred dinars and she took it and carried it to the Princess who read it to the end and learned its purport Then casting it from her hand she cried Tell me O wicked old woman the cause of all that hath befallen me from thee and from thy cunning and thine advocacy of him so that thou hast made me write letter after letter and thou ceasest not to carry messages going and coming between us twain till thou hast brought about a correspondence and a connection Thou leavest not to say I will ensure thee against his mischief and cut off from thee his speech but thou speakest not thus save only to the intent that I may continue to write thee letters and thou to fetch and carry between us evening and morning till thou ruin my repute Woe to thee Ho eunuchs seize her Then Hayat al Nufus commanded them to beat her and they lashed her till her whole body flowed with blood and she fainted away whereupon the King s daughter caused her slave women to drag her forth by the feet and cast her without the palace and bade one of them stand by her head till she recovered and say to her The Princess hath sworn an oath that thou shalt never return to and re enter this palace and she hath commanded to slay thee without mercy an thou dare return hither So when she came to herself the damsel told her what the King s daughter said and she answered Hearkening and obedience Presently the slave girls fetched a basket and a porter whom they caused carry her to her own house and they sent after her a physician bidding him tend her assiduously till she recovered He did what he was told to do and as soon as she was whole she mounted and rode to the shop of Ardashir who was concerned with sore concern for her absence and was longing for news of her As soon as he saw her he sprang up and coming to meet her saluted her then he noticed that she was weak and ailing so he questioned her of her case and she told him all that had befallen her from her nursling When he heard this he found it grievous and smote hand upon hand saying By Allah O my mother this that hath betided thee straiteneth my heart But what O my mother is the reason of the Princess s hatred to men Replied the old woman Thou must know O my son that she hath a beautiful garden than which there is naught goodlier on earth s face and it chanced that she lay there one night In the joyance of sleep she dreamt a dream and twas this that she went down into the garden where she saw a fowler set up his net and strew corn thereabout after which he withdrew and sat down afar off to await what game should fall into it Ere an hour had passed the birds flocked to pick up the corn and a male pigeon FN two hundred seventy seven fell into the net and struggled in it whereat all the others took fright and fled from him His mate was amongst them but she returned to him after the shortest delay and coming up to the net sought out the mesh wherein his foot was entangled and ceased not to peck at it with her bill till she severed it and released her husband with whom she flew away All this while the fowler sat dozing and when he awoke he looked at the net and found it spoilt So he mended it and strewed fresh grain then withdrew to a distance and sat down to watch it again The birds soon returned and began to pick up the corn and among the rest the pair of pigeons Presently the she pigeon fell into the net and struggled to get free whereupon all the other birds flew away and her mate whom she had saved fled with the rest and did not return to her Meantime sleep had again overcome the fowler and when he awoke after long slumbering he saw the she pigeon caught in the net so he went up to her and freeing her feet from the meshes cut her throat The Princess startled by the dream awoke troubled and said Thus do men with women for women have pity on men and throw away their lives for them when they are in difficulties but if the Lord decree against a woman and she fall into calamity her mate deserteth her and rescueth her not and wasted is that which she did with him of kindness Allah curse her who putteth her trust in men for they ill requite the fair offices which women do them And from that day she conceived an hatred to men Said the King s son O my mother doth she never go out into the highways and the old woman replied Nay O my son but I will tell thee somewhat wherein Allah willing there shall be profit for thee She hath a garden which is of the goodliest pleasaunces of the age and every year at the time of the ripening of the fruits she goeth thither and taketh her pleasure therein only one day nor layeth the night but in her pavilion She entereth the garden by the private wicket of the palace which leadeth thereto and thou must know that it wanteth now but a month to the time of her going forth So take my advice and hie thee this very day to the keeper of that garden and make acquaintance with him and gain his good graces for he admitteth not one of Allah s creatures into the garth because of its communication with the Princess s palace I will let thee know two days beforehand of the day fixed for her coming forth when do thou repair to the garden as of thy wont and make shift to night there When the King s daughter cometh be thou hidden in some place or other And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Seven Hundred and Twenty fifth Night She pursued It hath reached me O auspicious King that the old woman charged the King s son saying I will let thee know two days beforehand of the King s daughter going down to the garden do thou hide thee in some place or other and when thou espiest her come forth and show thyself to her When she seeth thee she will fall in love with thee for thou art fair to look upon and love covereth all things So keep thine eyes cool and clear FN two hundred seventy eight and be of good cheer O my son for needs must I bring about union between thee and her The young Prince kissed her hand and thanked her and gave her three pieces of Alexandrian silk and three of satin of various colours and with each piece linen for shifts and stuff for trousers and a kerchief for the turband and fine white cotton cloth of Ba albak for the linings so as to make her six complete suits each handsomer than its sister Moreover he gave her a purse containing six hundred gold pieces and said to her This is for the tailoring She took the whole and said to him O my son art thou not pleased to acquaint me with thine abiding place and I also will show thee the way to my lodging Yes answered he and sent a Mameluke with her to note her home and show her his own house Then he rose and bidding his slaves shut the shop went back to the Wazir to whom he related all that had passed between him and the old woman from first to last Quoth the Minister O my son should the Princess Hayat al Nufus come out and look upon thee and thou find no favour with her what wilt thou do Quoth Ardashir There will be nothing left but to pass from words to deeds and risk my life with her for I will snatch her up from amongst her attendants and set her behind me on a swift horse and make for the wildest of the wold If I escape I shall have won my wish and if I perish I shall be at rest from this hateful life Rejoined the Minister O my son dost thou think to do this thing and live How shall we make our escape seeing that our country is far distant and how wilt thou deal thus with a King of the Kings of the Age who hath under his hand an hundred thousand horse nor can we be sure but that he will despatch some of his troops to cut off our way Verily there is no good in this project which no wise man would attempt Asked Ardashir And how then shall we do O Wazir of good counsel For unless I win her I am a dead man without a chance The Minister answered Wait till to morrow when we will visit this garden and note its condition and see what betideth us with the care taker So when the morning morrowed they took a thousand dinars in a poke and repairing to the garden found it compassed about with high walls and strong rich in trees and rill full leas and goodly fruiteries And indeed its flowers breathed perfume and its birds warbled amid the bloom as it were a garden of the gardens of Paradise Within the door sat a Shaykh an old man on a stone bench and they saluted him When he saw them and noted the fairness of their favour he rose to his feet after returning their salute and said O my lords perchance ye have a wish which we may have the honour of satisfying Replied the Wazir Know O elder that we are strangers and the heat hath overcome us our lodging is afar off at the other end of the city so we desire of thy courtesy that thou take these two dinars and buy us somewhat of provaunt and open us meanwhile the door of this flower garden and seat us in some shaded place where there is cold water that we may cool ourselves there against thy return with the provision when we will eat and thou with us and then rested and refreshed we shall wend our ways So saying he pulled out of his pouch a couple of dinars and put them into the keeper s hand Now this care taker was a man aged three score and ten who had never in all his life possessed so much money so when he saw the two dinars in his hand he was like to fly for joy and rising forthwith opened the garden gate to the Prince and the Wazir and made them enter and sit down under a wide spreading fruit laden shade affording tree saying Sit ye here and go no further into the garden for it hath a privy door communicating with the palace of the Princess Hayat al Nufus They replied We will not stir hence Whereupon he went out to buy what they had ordered and returned after awhile with a porter bearing on his head a roasted lamb and bread They ate and drank together and talked awhile till presently the Wazir looking about him in all corners right and left caught sight of a lofty pavilion at the farther end of the garden but it was old and the plaster was peeled from its walls and its buttresses were broken down So he said to the Gardener O Shaykh is this garden thine own or dost thou hire it and he replied I am neither owner nor tenant of the garden only its care taker Asked the Minister And what is thy wage whereto the old man answered A dinar a month and quoth the Wazir Verily they wrong thee especially an thou have a family Quoth the elder By Allah O my lord I have eight children and I The Wazir broke in There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah the Glorious the Great Thou makest me bear thy grief my poor fellow What wouldst thou say of him who should do thee a good turn on account of this family of thine Replied the old man O my lord whatsoever good thou dost shall be garnered up for thee with God the Most High Thereupon said the Wazir O Shaykh thou knowest this garden of thine to be a goodly place but the pavilion yonder is old and ruinous Now I mean to repair it and stucco it anew and paint it handsomely so that it will be the finest thing in the garth and when the owner comes and finds the pavilion restored and beautified he will not fail to question thee concerning it Then do thou say O my lord at great expense I set it in repair for that I saw it in ruins and none could make use of it nor could anyone sit therein If he says Whence hadst thou the money for this reply I spent of my own money upon the stucco thereby thinking to whiten my face with thee and hoping for thy bounties And needs must he recompense thee fairly over the extent of thine expenses To morrow I will bring builders and plasterers and painters to repair this pavilion and will give thee what I promised thee Then he pulled out of his poke a purse of five hundred dinars and gave it to the Gardener saying Take these gold pieces and expend them upon thy family and let them pray for me and for this my son Thereupon the Prince asked the Wazir What is the meaning of all this and he answered Thou shalt presently see the issue thereof And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Seven Hundred and Twenty sixth Night She resumed It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the Wazir gave five hundred ducats to the old Gardener saying Take these gold pieces and expend them upon thy family and let them pray for this my son the old man looked at the gold and his wits fled so he fell down at the Wazir s feet kissing them and invoking blessings on him and his son and when they went away he said to them I shall expect you to morrow for by Allah Almighty there must be no parting between us night or day Next morning the Wazir went to the Prince s shop and sent for the syndic of the builders then he carried him and his men to the garth where the Gardener rejoiced in their sight He gave them the price of rations FN two hundred seventy nine and what was needful to the work men for the restoration of the pavilion and they repaired it and stucco d it and decorated it Then said the Minister to the painters Harkye my masters listen to my words and apprehend my wish and my aim Know that I have a garden like this where I was sleeping one night among the nights and saw in a dream a fowler set up nets and sprinkle corn thereabout The birds flocked to pick up the grain and a cock bird fell into the net whereupon the others took fright and flew away and amongst the rest his mate but after awhile she returned alone and picked at the mesh that held his feet till she set him free and they flew away together Now the fowler had fallen asleep and when he awoke he found the net empty so he mended it and strewing fresh grain sat down afar off waiting for game to fall into that snare Presently the birds assembled again to pick up the grains and amongst the rest the two pigeons By and by the hen bird fell into the net when all the other birds took fright at her and flew away and her husband flew with them and did not return whereupon the fowler came up and taking the quarry cut her throat Now when her mate flew away with the others a bird of raven seized him and slew him and ate his flesh and drank his blood and I would have you pourtray me the presentment of this my dream even as I have related it to you in the liveliest colours laying the fair scene in this rare garden with its walls and trees and rills and dwell especially on the fowler and the falcon If ye do this I have set forth to you and the work please me I will give you what shall gladden your hearts over and above your wage The painters hearing these words applied themselves with all diligence to do what he required of them and wrought it out in masterly style and when they had made an end of the work they showed it to the Wazir who seeing his so called dream set forth as it was FN two hundred eighty was pleased and thanked them and rewarded them munificently Presently the Prince came in according to his custom and entered the pavilion unweeting what the Wazir had done So when he saw the portraiture of the fowler and the birds and the net and beheld the male pigeon in the clutches of the hawk which had slain him and was drinking his blood and eating his flesh his understanding was confounded and he returned to the Minister and said O Wazir of good counsel I have seen this day a marvel which were it graven with needle gravers on the eye corners would be a warner to whoso will be warned Asked the Minister And what is that O my lord and the Prince answered Did I not tell thee of the dream the Princess had and how it was the cause of her hatred for men Yes replied the Wazir and Ardashir rejoined By Allah O Minister I have seen the whole dream pourtrayed in painting as I had eyed it with mine own eyes but I found therein a circumstance which was hidden from the Princess so that she saw it not and tis upon this that I rely for the winning of my wish Quoth the Wazir And what is that O my son and quoth the Prince I saw that when the male bird flew away and leaving his mate entangled in the net failed to return and save her a falcon pounced on him and slaying him ate his flesh and drank his blood Would to Heaven the Princess had seen the whole of the dream and had beheld the cause of his failure to return and rescue her Replied the Wazir By Allah O auspicious King this is indeed a rare thing and a wonderful And the King s son ceased not to marvel at the picture and lament that the King s daughter had not beheld the dream to its end saying in himself Would she had seen it to the last or might see the whole over again though but in the imbroglio of sleep Then quoth the Wazir to him Thou saidst to me Why wilt thou repair the pavilion and I replied Thou shalt presently see the issue thereof And behold now its issue thou seest for it was I did this deed and bade the painters pourtray the Princess s dream thus and paint the male bird in the pounces of the falcon which eateth his flesh and drinketh his blood so that when she cometh to the pavilion she will behold her dream depicted and see how the cock pigeon was slain and excuse him and turn from her hate for men When the Prince heard the Wazir s words he kissed his hands and thanked him saying Verily the like of thee is fit to be Minister to the most mighty King and by Allah an I win my wish and return to my sire rejoicing I will assuredly acquaint him with this that he may redouble in honouring thee and advance thee in dignity and hearken to thine every word So the Wazir kissed his hand and they both went to the old Gardener and said Look at yonder pavilion and see how fine it is And he replied This is all of your happy thought Then said they O elder when the owners of the place question thee concerning the restoration of the pavilion say thou Twas I did it of my own monies to the intent that there may betide thee fair favour and good fortune He said I hear and I obey and the Prince continued to pay him frequent visits Such was the case with the Prince and the Wazir but as regards Hayat al Nufus when she ceased to receive the Prince s letters and messages and when the old woman was absent from her she rejoiced with joy exceeding and concluded that the young man had returned to his own country One day there came to her a covered tray from her father so she uncovered it and finding therein fine fruits asked her waiting women Is the season of these fruits come Answered they Yes Thereupon she cried Would we might make ready to take our pleasure in the flower garden And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Seven Hundred and Twenty seventh Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the Princess after receiving the fruit from her sire asked Is the season of these fruits set in and they answered Yes Thereupon she cried Would we might make ready to take our pleasure in the flower garden O my lady they replied thou sayest well and by Allah we also long for the garden So she enquired How shall we do seeing that every year it is none save my nurse who taketh us to walk in the garden and who pointeth out to us the various trees and plants and I have beaten her and forbidden her from me Indeed I repent me of what was done by me to her for that in any case she is my nurse and hath over me the right of fosterage But there is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah the Glorious the Great When her handmaids heard this they all sprang up and kissing the ground between her hands exclaimed Allah upon thee O my lady do thou pardon her and bid her to the presence and quoth she By Allah I am resolved upon this but which of you will go to her for I have prepared her a splendid robe of honour Hereupon two damsels came forward by name Bulbul and Siwad al Ayn who were comely and graceful and the principals among the Princess s women and her favourites And they said We will go to her O King s daughter and she said Do what seemeth good to you So they went to the house of the nurse and knocked at the door and entered and she recognising the twain received them with open arms and welcomed them When they had sat awhile with her they said to her O nurse the Princess pardoneth thee and desireth to take thee back into favour She replied This may never be though I drink the cup of ruin Hast thou forgotten how she put me to shame before those who love me and those who hate me when my clothes were dyed with my blood and I well nigh died for stress of beating and after this they dragged me forth by the feet like a dead dog and cast me without the door So by Allah I will never return to her nor fill my eyes with her sight Quoth the two girls Disappoint not our pains in coming to thee nor send us away unsuccessful Where is thy courtesy uswards Think but who it is that cometh in to visit thee canst thou wish for any higher of standing than we with the King s daughter She replied I take refuge with Allah well I wot that my station is less than yours were it not that the Princess s favour exalted me above all her women so that were I wroth with the greatest of them she had died in her skin of fright They rejoined All is as it was and naught is in anywise changed Indeed tis better than before for the Princess humbleth herself to thee and seeketh a reconciliation without intermediary Said the old woman By Allah were it not for your presence and intercession with me I had never returned to her no not though she had commanded to slay me They thanked her for this and she rose and dressing herself accompanied them to the palace Now when the King s daughter saw her she sprang to her feet in honour and the old woman said Allah Allah O King s daughter say me whose was the fault mine or thine Hayat al Nufus replied The fault was mine and tis thine to pardon and forgive By Allah O my nurse thy rank is high with me and thou hast over me the right of fosterage but thou knowest that Allah extolled and exalted be He hath allotted to His creatures four things disposition life daily bread and death nor is it in man s power to avert that which is decreed Verily I was beside myself and could not recover my senses but O my nurse I repent of what deed I did With this the crone s anger ceased from her and she rose and kissed the ground before the Princess who called for a costly robe of honour and threw it over her whereat she rejoiced with exceeding joy in the presence of the Princess s slaves and women When all ended thus happily Hayat al Nufus said to the old woman O my nurse how go the fruits and growths of our garth and she replied O my lady I see excellent fruits in the town but I will enquire of this matter and return thee an answer this very day Then she withdrew honoured with all honour and betook herself to Ardashir who received her with open arms and embraced her and rejoiced in her coming for that he had expected her long and longingly She told him all that had passed between herself and the Princess and how her mistress was minded to go down into the garden on such a day And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Seven Hundred and Twenty eighth Night She continued It hath reached me O auspicious King that the old woman betook herself to the Prince and told him all that had passed between herself and the Princess Hayat al Nufus and how her mistress was minded to go down into the garden on such a day and said to him Hast thou done as I bade thee with the Warder of the garden and hast thou made him taste of thy bounties He replied Yes and the oldster is become my good friend my way is his way and he would well I had need of him Then he told her all that had happened and of the dream paintings which the Wazir had caused to be limned in the pavilion especially of the fowler the net and the falcon whereat she joyed with great joy and said Allah upon thee do thou set thy Minister mid most thy heart for this that he hath done pointeth to the keenness of his wit and he hath helped thee to the winning thy wish So rise forthright O my son and go to the Hammam bath and don thy daintiest dress wherein may be our success Then fare thou to the Gardener and make shift to pass the night in the garden for though he should give the earth full of gold none may win to pass into it whilst the King s daughter is therein When thou hast entered hide thee where no eye may espy thee and keep concealed till thou hear me cry O Thou whose boons are hidden save us from that we fear Then come forth from thine ambush and walk among the trees and show thy beauty and loveliness which put the moons to shame to the intent that Princess Hayat al Nufus may see thee and that her heart and soul may be filled with love of thee so shalt thou attain to thy wish and thy grief be gone To hear is to obey replied the young Prince and gave her a purse of a thousand dinars which she took and went away Thereupon Ardashir fared straight for the bath and washed after which he arrayed himself in the richest of robes of the apparel of the Kings of the Chosroes and girt his middle with a girdle wherein were conjoined all manner precious stones and donned a turband inwoven with red gold and purfled with pearls and gems His cheeks shone rosy red and his lips were scarlet his eyelids like the gazelle s wantoned like a wine struck wight in his gait he swayed beauty and loveliness garbed him and his shape shamed the bowing of the bough Then he put in his pocket a purse containing a thousand dinars and repairing to the flower garden knocked at the door The Gardener opened to him and rejoicing with great joy salamed to him in most worshipful fashion then observing that his face was overcast he asked him how he did The King s son answered Know O elder that I am dear to my father and he never laid his hand on me till this day when words arose between us and he abused me and smote me on the face and struck me with his staff and drave me away Now I have no friend to turn to and I fear the perfidy of Fortune for thou knowest that the wrath of parents is no light thing Wherefore I come to thee O uncle seeing that to my father thou art known and I desire of thy favour that thou suffer me abide in the garden till the end of the day or pass the night there till Allah grant good understanding between myself and my sire When the old man heard these words he was concerned anent what had occurred and said O my lord dost thou give me leave to go to thy sire and be the means of reconciliation between thee and him Replied Ardashir O uncle thou must know that my father is of impatient nature and irascible so an thou proffer him reconciliation in his heat of temper he will make thee no answer but when a day or two shall have passed his heat will soften Then go thou in to him and thereupon he will relent Hearkening and obedience quoth the Gardener But O my lord do thou come with me to my house where thou shalt night with my children and my family and none shall reproach this to us Quoth Ardashir O uncle I must be alone when I am angry FN two hundred eighty one The old man said It irketh me that thou shouldst lie solitary in the garden when I have a house But Ardashir said O uncle I have an aim in this that the trouble of my mind may be dispelled from me and I know that in this lies the means of regaining his favour and softening his heart to me Rejoined the Gardener I will fetch thee a carpet to sleep on and a coverlet wherewith to cover thee and the Prince said There is no harm in that O uncle So the keeper rose and opened the garden to him and brought him the carpet and coverlet knowing not that the King s daughter was minded to visit the garth On this wise fared it with the Prince but as regards the nurse she returned to the Princess and told her that the fruits were kindly ripe on the garden trees whereupon she said O my nurse go down with me to morrow into the garden that we may walk about in it and take our pleasure Inshallah and send meanwhile to the Gardener to let him know what we purpose So she sent to the Gardener to say The Princess will visit the parterre to morrow so leave neither water carriers nor tree tenders therein nor let one of Allah s creatures enter the garth When word came to him he set his water ways and channels in order and going to Ardashir said to him O my lord the King s daughter is mistress of this garden and I have only to crave thy pardon for the place is thy place and I live only in thy favours except that my tongue is under thy feet FN two hundred eighty two I must tell thee that the Princess Hayat al Nufus hath a mind to visit it to morrow at the first of the day and hath bidden me leave none therein who might look upon her So I would have thee of thy favour go forth of the garden this day for the Queen will abide only in it till the time of mid afternoon prayer and after it shall be at thy service for se nnights and fortnights months and years Ardashir asked O elder haply we have caused thee some mishap and the other answered By Allah O my lord naught hath betided me from thee but honour Rejoined the Prince An it be so nothing but all good shall befal thee through us for I will hide in the garden and none shall espy me till the King s daughter hath gone back to her palace Said the Gardener O my lord an she espy the shadow of a man in the garden or any of Allah s male creatures she will strike off my head And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Seven Hundred and Twenty ninth Night She continued It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the Gardener said to the Prince An the King s daughter espy the shadow of a man in her garden she will strike off my head the youth replied Have no fear I will on no wise let any see me But doubtless to day thou lackest of spending money for thy family Then he put his hand to his purse and pulled out five hundred ducats which he gave to him saying Take this gold and lay it out on thy family that thy heart may be at ease concerning them When the Shaykh looked upon the gold his life seemed a light thing to him FN two hundred eighty three and he suffered the Prince to tarry where he was charging him straitly not to show himself in the garden Then he left him loitering about Meanwhile when the eunuchs went in to the Princess at break of day she bade open the private wicket leading from the palace to the parterres and donned a royal robe embroidered with pearls and jewels and gems over a shift of fine silk purfled with rubies Under the whole was that which tongue refuseth to explain whereat was confounded the brain and whose love would embrave the craven s strain On her head she set a crown of red gold inlaid with pearls and gems and she tripped in pattens of cloth of gold embroidered with fresh pearls FN two hundred eighty four and adorned with all manner precious stones Then she put her hand upon the old woman s shoulder and commanded to go forth by the privy door but the nurse looked at the garden and seeing it full of eunuchs and handmaids walking about eating the fruits and troubling the streams and taking their ease of sport and pleasure in the water said to the Princess O my lady is this a garden or a madhouse Quoth the Princess What meaneth thy speech O nurse and quoth the old woman Verily the garden is full of slave girls and eunuchs eating of the fruits and troubling the streams and scaring the birds and hindering us from taking our ease and sporting and laughing and what not else and thou hast no need of them Wert thou going forth of thy palace into the highway this would be fitting as an honour and a ward to thee but now O my lady thou goest forth of the wicket into the garden where none of Almighty Allah s creatures may look on thee Rejoined the Princess By Allah O nurse mine thou sayst sooth But how shall we do and the old woman said Bid the eunuchs send them all away and keep only two of the slave girls that we may make merry with them So she dismissed them all with the exception of two of her handmaids who were most in favour with her But when the old woman saw that her heart was light and that the season was pleasant to her she said to her Now we can enjoy ourselves aright so up and let us take our pleasance in the garden The Princess put her hand upon her shoulder and went out by the private door The two waiting women walked in front and she followed them laughing at them and swaying gracefully to and fro in her ample robes whilst the nurse forewent her showing her the trees and feeding her with fruits and so they fared on from place to place till they came to the pavilion which when the King s daughter beheld and saw that it had been restored she asked the old woman O my nurse seest thou yonder pavilion It hath been repaired and its walls whitened She answered By Allah O my lady I heard say that the keeper of the garden had taken stuffs of a company of merchants and sold them and bought bricks and lime and plaster and stones and so forth with the price so I asked him what he had done with all this and he said I have repaired the pavilion which lay in ruins presently adding And when the merchants sought their due of me I said to them Wait till the Princess visit the garden and see the repairs and they satisfy her then will I take of her what she is pleased to bestow on me and pay you what is your due Quoth I What moved thee to do this thing and quoth he I saw the pavilion in ruins the coigns thrown down and the stucco peeled from the walls and none had the grace to repair it so I borrowed the coin on my own account and restored the place and I trust in the King s daughter to deal with me as befitteth her dignity I said The Princess is all goodness and generosity and will no doubt requite thee And he did all this but in hopes of thy bounty Replied the Princess By Allah he hath dealt nobly in rebuilding it and hath done the deed of generous men Call me my purse keeperess The old woman accordingly fetched the purse keeperess whom the Princess bade give the Gardener two thousand dinars whereupon the nurse sent to him bidding him to the presence of the King s daughter But when the messenger said to him Obey the Queen s order the Gardener felt feeble and trembling in every joint said in himself Doubtless the Princess hath seen the young man and this day will be the most unlucky of days for me So he went home and told his wife and children what had happened and gave them his last charges and farewelled them while they wept for and with him Then he presented himself before the Princess with a face the colour of turmeric and ready to fall flat at full length The old woman remarked his plight and hastened to forestall him saying O Shaykh kiss the earth in thanksgiving to Almighty Allah and be constant in prayer to Him for the Princess I told her what thou didst in the matter of repairing the ruined pavilion and she rejoiceth in this and bestoweth on thee two thousand dinars in requital of thy pains so take them from the purse keeperess and kiss the earth before the King s daughter and bless her and wend thy way Hearing these words he took the gold and kissed the ground before Hayat al Nufus calling down blessings on her Then he returned to his house and his family rejoiced in him and blessed him FN two hundred eighty five who had been the prime cause of this business And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Seven Hundred and Thirtieth Night She pursued It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the Care taker took the two thousand ducats from the Princess and returned to his house all his family rejoiced in him and blessed him who had been the prime cause of this business Thus it fared with these but as regards the old woman she said to the Princess O my lady this is indeed become a fine place Never saw I a purer white than its plastering nor properer than its painting I wonder if he have also repaired it within else hath he made the outside white and left the inside black Come let us enter and inspect So they went in the nurse preceding and found the interior painted and gilded in the goodliest way The Princess looked right and left till she came to the upper end of the estrade when she fixed her eyes upon the wall and gazed long and earnestly thereat whereupon the old woman knew that her glance had lighted on the presentment of her dream and took the two waiting women away with her that they might not divert her mind When the King s daughter had made an end of examining the painting she turned to the old woman wondering and beating hand on hand and said to her O my nurse come see a wondrous thing which were it graven with needle gravers on the eye corners would be a warner to whoso will be warned She replied And what is that O my lady when the Princess rejoined Go look at the upper end of the estrade and tell me what thou seest there So she went up and considered the dream drawing then she came down wondering and said By Allah O my lady here is depicted the garden and the fowler and his net and the birds and all thou sawest in thy dream and verily nothing but urgent need withheld the male pigeon from returning to free his mate after he had fled her for I see him in the talons of a bird of raven which hath slaughtered him and is drinking his blood and rending his flesh and eating it and this O my lady caused his tarrying to return and rescue her from the net But O my mistress the wonder is how thy dream came to be thus depicted for wert thou minded to set it forth in painture thou hadst not availed to portray it By Allah this is a marvel which should be recorded in histories Surely O my lady the angels appointed to attend upon the sons of Adam knew that the cock pigeon was wronged of us because we blamed him for deserting his mate so they embraced his cause and made manifest his excuse and now for the first time we see him in the hawk s pounces a dead bird Quoth the Princess O my nurse verily Fate and Fortune had course against this bird and we did him wrong Quoth the nurse O my mistress foes shall meet before Allah the Most High but O my lady verily the truth hath been made manifest and the male pigeon s excuse certified to us for had the hawk not seized him and drunk his blood and rent his flesh he had not held aloof from his mate but had returned to her and set her free from the net but against death there is no recourse nor O my lady is there aught in the world more tenderly solicitous than the male for the female among all creatures which Almighty Allah hath created And especially tis thus with man for he starveth himself to feed his wife strippeth himself to clothe her angereth his family to please her and disobeyeth and denieth his parents to endow her She knoweth his secrets and concealeth them and she cannot endure from him a single hour FN two hundred eighty six An he be absent from her one night her eyes sleep not nor is there a dearer to her than he she loveth him more than her parents and they lie down to sleep in each other s arms with his hand under her neck and her hand under his neck even as saith the poet I made my wrist her pillow and I lay with her in litter And I said to Night Be long while the full moon showed glitter Ah me it was a night Allah never made its like Whose first was sweetest sweet and whose last bitt rest bitter FN two hundred eighty seven Then he kisseth her and she kisseth him and I have heard of a certain King that when his wife fell sick and died he buried himself alive with her submitting himself to death for the love of her and the strait companionship which was between them Moreover a certain King sickened and died and when they were about to bury him his wife said to her people Let me bury myself alive with him else will I slay myself and my blood shall be on your heads So when they saw she would not be turned from this thing they left her and she cast herself into the grave with her dead husband of the greatness of her love and tenderness for him And the old woman ceased not to ply the Princess with anecdotes of conjugal love between men and women till there ceased that which was in her heart of hatred for the sex masculine and when she felt that she had succeeded in renewing in her the natural inclination of woman to man she said to her Tis time to go and walk in the garden So they fared forth from the pavilion and paced among the trees Presently the Prince chanced to turn and his eyes fell on Hayat al Nufus and when he saw the symmetry of her shape and the rosiclearness of her cheeks and the blackness of her eyes and her exceeding grace and her passing loveliness and her excelling beauty and her prevailing elegance and her abounding perfection his reason was confounded and he could not take his eyes off her Passion annihilated his right judgment and love overpassed all limits in him his vitals were occupied with her service and his heart was aflame with the fire of repine so that he swooned away and fell to the ground When he came to himself she had passed from his sight and was hidden from him among the trees And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Seven Hundred and Thirty first Night She resumed It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Prince Ardashir who lay hid in the garden saw the Princess and her nurse walking amongst the trees he swooned away for very love longing When he came to himself Hayat al Nufus had passed from his sight and was hidden from him among the trees so he sighed from his heart core and improvised these couplets Whenas mine eyes behold her loveliness My heart is torn with love s own ecstasy I wake o erthrown castdown on face of earth Nor can the Princess FN two hundred eighty eight my sore torment see She turned and ravished this sad Love thrall d sprite Mercy by Allah ruth nay sympathy O Lord afford me union deign Thou soothe My soul ere grave niche house this corse of me I ll kiss her ten times ten times and times ten For lover s wasted cheek the kisses be The old woman ceased not to lead the Princess a pleasuring about the garden till they reached the place where the Prince lay ambushed when behold she said O Thou whose bounties are hidden vouchsafe us assurance from that we fear The King s son hearing the signal left his lurking place and surprised by the summons walked among the trees swaying to and fro with a proud and graceful gait and a shape that shamed the branches His brow was crowned with pearly drops and his cheeks red as the afterglow extolled be Allah the Almighty in that He hath created When the King s daughter caught sight of him she gazed a long while on him and noticed his beauty and grace and loveliness and his eyes that wantoned like the gazelle s and his shape that outvied the branches of the myrobalan wherefore her wits were confounded and her soul captivated and her heart transfixed with the arrows of his glances Then she said to the old woman O my nurse whence came yonder handsome youth and the nurse asked Where is he O my lady There he is answered Hayat al Nufus near hand among the trees The old woman turned right and left as if she knew not of his presence and cried And pray who can have taught this youth the way into this garden Quoth Hayat al Nufus Who shall give us news of the young man Glory be to Him who created men But say me dost thou know him O my nurse Quoth the old woman O my lady he is the young merchant who wrote to thee by me The Princess and indeed she was drowned in the sea of her desire and the fire of her passion and love longing broke out O my nurse how goodly is this youth Indeed he is fair of favour Methinks there is not on the face of earth a goodlier than he Now when the old woman was assured that the love of him had gotten possession of the Princess she said to her Did I not tell thee O my lady that he was a comely youth with a beaming favour Replied Hayat al Nufus O my nurse King s daughters know not the ways of the world nor the manners of those that be therein for that they company with none neither give they nor take they O my nurse how shall I do to bring about a meeting and present myself to him and what shall I say to him and what will he say to me Said the old woman What device is left me Indeed we were confounded in this matter by thy behaviour and the Princess said O my nurse know thou that if any ever died of passion I shall do so and behold I look for nothing but death on the spot by reason of the fire of my love longing When the old woman heard her words and saw the transport of her desire for him she answered O my lady now as for his coming to thee there is no way thereto and indeed thou art excused from going to him because of thy tender age but rise with me and follow me I will accost him so shalt thou not be put to shame and in the twinkling of an eye affection shall ensue between you The King s daughter cried Go thou before me for the decree of Allah may not be rejected Accordingly they went up to the place where Ardashir sat as he were the full moon at its fullest and the old woman said to him See O youth who is present before thee Tis the daughter of our King of the age Hayat al Nufus bethink thee of her rank and appreciate the honour she doth thee in coming to thee and rise out of respect for her and stand before her The Prince sprang to his feet in an instant and his eyes met her eyes whereupon they both became as they were drunken without wine Then the love of him and desire redoubled upon the Princess and she opened her arms and he his and they embraced but love longing and passion overcame them and they swooned away and fell to the ground and lay a long while without sense The old woman fearing scandalous exposure carried them both into the pavilion and sitting down at the door said to the two waiting women Seize the occasion to take your pleasure in the garden for the Princess sleepeth So they returned to their diversion Presently the lovers revived from their swoon and found themselves in the pavilion whereat quoth the Prince Allah upon thee O Princess of fair ones is this vision or sleep illusion Then the twain embraced and intoxicated themselves without wine complaining each to other of the anguish of passion and the Prince improvised these couplets Sun riseth sheen from her brilliant brow And her cheek shows the rosiest afterglow And when both appear to the looker on The skyline star ne er for shame will show An the leven flash from those smiling lips Morn breaks and the rays dusk and gloom o erthrow And when with her graceful shape she sways Droops leafiest Ban tree FN two hundred eighty nine for envy low Me her sight suffices naught crave I more Lord of Men and Morn be her guard from foe The full moon borrows a part of her charms The sun would rival but fails his lowe Whence could Sol aspire to that bending grace Whence should Luna see such wit and such mind gifts know Who shall blame me for being all love to her Twixt accord and discord aye doomed to woe Tis she won my heart with those forms that bend What shall lover s heart from such charms defend And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Seven Hundred and Thirty second Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the Prince had made an end of his verses the Princess strained him to her bosom and kissed him on the mouth and between the eyes whereupon his soul returned to him and he fell to complaining to her of that he had endured for stress of love and tyranny of longing and excess of transport and distraction and all he had suffered for the hardness of her heart Hearing those words she kissed his hands and feet and bared her head FN two hundred ninety whereupon the gloom gathered and the full moons dawned therein Then said she to him O my beloved and term of all my wishes would the day of estrangement had never been and Allah grant it may never return between us And they embraced and wept together whilst she recited these couplets O who shamest the Moon and the sunny glow Thou whose slaught ring tyranny lays me low With the sword of a look thou hast shorn my heart How escape thy sword glance fatal of blow Thus eke are thine eyebrows a bow that shot My bosom with shafts of fiercest lowe From thy cheeks rich crop cometh Paradise How then shall my heart the rich crop forego Thy graceful shape is a blooming branch And shall pluck the fruits who shall bear that bough Perforce thou drawest me robst my sleep In thy love I strip me and shameless show FN two hundred ninety one Allah lend thee the rays of most righteous light Draw the farthest near and a tryst bestow Then have ruth on the vitals thy love hath seared And the heart that flies to thy side the mo e And when she ended her recitation passion overcame her and she was distraught for love and wept copious tears rain like streaming down This burnt the Prince s heart and he in turn became troubled and distracted for love of her So he drew nearer to her and kissed her hands and wept with sore weeping and they ceased not from lover reproaches and converse and versifying until the call to mid afternoon prayer nor was there aught between them other than this when they bethought them of parting and she said to him O light of mine eyes and core of my heart the time of severance has come between us twain when shall we meet again By Allah replied he and indeed her words shot him as with shafts to mention of parting I am never fain Then she went forth of the pavilion and he turned and saw her sighing sighs would melt the rock and weeping shower like tears whereupon he for love was sunken in the sea of desolation and improvised these couplets O my heart s desire grows my misery From the stress of love and what cure for me By thy face like dawn when it lights the dark And thy hair whose hue beareth night tide s blee And thy form like the branch which in grace inclines To Zephyr s FN two hundred ninety two breath blowing fain and free By the glance of thine eyes like the fawn s soft gaze When she views pursuer of high degree And thy waist down borne by the weight of hips These so heavy and that lacking gravity By the wine of thy lip dew the sweetest of drink Fresh water and musk in its purity O gazelle of the tribe ease my soul of grief And grant me thy phantom in sleep to see Now when she heard his verses in praise of her she turned back to him and embracing him with a heart on fire for the anguish of severance fire which naught save kisses and embraces might quench cried Sooth the byword saith Patience is for a lover and not the lack thereof There is no help for it but I contrive a means for our reunion Then she farewelled him and fared forth knowing not where she set her feet for stress of her love nor did she stay her steps till she found herself in her own chamber When she was gone passion and love longing redoubled upon the young Prince and the delight of sleep was forbidden him and the Princess in her turn tasted not food and her patience failed and she sickened for desire As soon as dawned the day she sent for the nurse who came and found her condition changed and she cried Question me not of my case for all I suffer is due to thy handiwork Where is the beloved of my heart O my lady when did he leave thee Hath he been absent from thee more than this night Can I endure absence from him an hour Come find some means to bring us together speedily for my soul is like to flee my body O my lady have patience till I contrive thee some subtle device whereof none shall be ware By the Great God except thou bring him to me this very day I will tell the King that thou hast corrupted me and he will cut off thy head I conjure thee by Allah have patience with me for this is a dangerous matter And the nurse humbled herself to her till she granted her three days delay saying O my nurse the three days will be three years to me and if the fourth day pass and thou bring him not I will go about to slay thee So the old woman left her and returned to her lodging where she abode till the morning of the fourth day when she summoned the tirewomen of the town and sought of them fine dyes and rouge for the painting of a virgin girl and adorning and they brought her cosmetics of the best Then she sent for the Prince and opening her chest brought out a bundle containing a suit of woman s apparel worth five thousand dinars and a head kerchief fringed with all manner gems Then said she to him O my son hast thou a mind to foregather with Hayat al Nufus and he replied Yes So she took a pair of tweezers and pulled out the hairs of his face and pencilled his eyes with Kohl FN two hundred ninety three Then she stripped him and painted him with Henna FN two hundred ninety four from his nails to his shoulders and from his insteps to his thighs and tattooed FN two hundred ninety five him about the body till he was like red roses upon alabaster slabs After a little she washed him and dried him and bringing out a shift and a pair of petticoat trousers made him put them on Then she clad him in the royal suit aforesaid and binding the kerchief about his head veiled him and taught him how to walk saying Advance thy left and draw back thy right He did her bidding and forewent her as he were a Houri faring abroad from Paradise Then said she to him Fortify thy heart for thou art going to the King s palace where there will without fail be guards and eunuchs at the gate and if thou be startled at them and show doubt or dread they will suspect thee and examine thee and we shall both get into grievous trouble and haply lose our lives wherefore an thou feel thyself unable to this tell me He answered In very sooth this thing hath no terrors for me so be of good cheer and keep thine eyes cool and clear Then she went out preceding him till the twain came to the palace gate which was full of eunuchs She turned and looked at him as much as to say Art thou troubled or no and finding him all unchanged went on The chief eunuch glanced at the nurse and knew her but seeing a damsel following her whose charms confounded the reason he said in his mind As for the old woman she is the nurse but as for the girl who is with her there is none in our land resembleth her in favour or approacheth her in fairness save the Princess Hayat al Nufus who is secluded and never goeth out Would I knew how she came into the streets and would Heaven I wot whether or no twas by leave of the King Then he rose to learn somewhat concerning her and well nigh thirty castratos followed him which when the old woman saw her reason fled for fear and she said Verily we are Allah s and to Him we shall return Without recourse we are dead folk this time And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Seven Hundred and Thirty third Night She continued It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the old nurse saw the head of the eunuchry and his assistants making for her she was in exceeding fear and cried There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah the Glorious the Great Verily we are God s and unto him we shall return without recourse we be dead folk this time When the head eunuch heard her speak thus fear gat hold upon him by reason of that which he knew of the Princess s violence and that her father was ruled by her and he said to himself Belike the King hath commanded the nurse to carry his daughter forth upon some occasion of hers whereof she would have none know and if I oppose her she will be wroth with me and will say This eunuch fellow stopped me that he might pry into my affairs So she will do her best to kill me and I have no call to meddle in this matter So saying he turned back and with him the thirty assistants who drove the people from the door of the palace whereupon the nurse entered and saluted the eunuchs with her head whilst all the thirty stood to do her honour and returned her salam She led in the Prince and he ceased not following her from door to door and the Protector protected them so that they passed all the guards till they came to the seventh door it was that of the great pavilion wherein was the King s throne and it communicated with the chambers of his women and the saloons of the Harim as well as with his daughter s pavilion So the old woman halted and said Here we are O my son and glory be to Him who hath brought us thus far in safety But O my son we cannot foregather with the Princess except by night for night enveileth the fearful He replied True but what is to be done Quoth she Hide thee in this black hole showing him behind the door a dark and deep cistern with a cover thereto So he entered the cistern and she went away and left him there till ended day when she returned and carried him into the palace till they came to the door of Hayat al Nufus s apartment The old woman knocked and a little maid came out and said Who is at the door Said the nurse Tis I whereupon the maid returned and craved permission of her lady who said Open to her and let her come in with any who may accompany her So they entered and the nurse casting a glance around perceived that the Princess had made

trays of food and fruits and confections and she had perfumed the place with musk and aloes wood and ambergris She was seated among the lamps and the tapers and the light of her face outshone the lustre of them all When she saw the old woman she said to her O nurse where is the beloved of my heart and the other replied O my lady I cannot find him nor have mine eyes espied him but I have brought thee his own sister and here she is Cried the Princess Art thou Jinn mad What need have I of his sister Say me an a man s head irk him doth he bind up his hand The old woman answered No by Allah O my lady But look on her and if she pleases thee let her be with thee Then she uncovered the Prince s face whereupon Hayat al Nufus knew him and running to him pressed him to her bosom and he pressed her to his breast Then they both fell down in a swoon and lay without sense a long while The old woman sprinkled rose water upon them till they came to themselves when she kissed him on the mouth more than a thousand times and improvised these couplets Sought me this heart s dear love at gloom of night I rose in honour till he sat forthright And said O aim of mine O sole desire In such night visit hast of guards no fright Replied he Yes I feared much but Love Robbed me of all my wits and reft my sprite We clipt with kisses and awhile clung we For here twas safe nor feared we watchman wight Then rose we parting without doubtful deed And shook out skirts where none a stain could sight And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Seven Hundred and Thirty fourth Night She pursued It hath reached me O auspicious King that when her lover visited Hayat al Nufus in her palace the twain embraced and she improvised some happy couplets beseeming the occasion And when she had ended her extempore lines she said Is it indeed true that I see thee in my abode and that thou art my cup mate and my familiar Then passion grew on her and love was grievous to her so that her reason well nigh fled for joy and she improvised these couplets With all my soul I ll ransom him who came to me in gloom Of night whilst I had waited long to see his figure loom And naught aroused me save his weeping voice of tender tone And whispered I Fair fall thy foot and welcome and well come His cheek I kissed a thousand times and yet a thousand more Then clipt and clung about his breast enveiled in darkling room And cried Now verily I ve won the aim of every wish So praise and prayers to Allah for this grace now best become Then slept we even as we would the goodliest of nights Till morning came to end our night and light up earth with bloom As soon as it was day she made him enter a place in her apartment unknown to any and he abode there till nightfall when she brought him out and they sat in converse and carouse Presently he said to her I wish to return to my own country and tell my father what hath passed between us that he may equip his Wazir to demand thee in marriage of thy sire She replied O my love I fear an thou return to thy country and kingdom thou wilt be distracted from me and forget the love of me or that thy father will not further thy wishes in this matter and I shall die Meseems the better rede were that thou abide with me and in my hand grasp I looking on thy face and thou on mine till I devise some plan whereby we may escape together some night and flee to thy country for I have cut off my hopes from my own people and I despair of them He rejoined I hear and obey and they fell again to their carousal and conversing He tarried with her thus for some time till one night the wine was pleasant to them and they lay not down nor did they sleep till break of day Now it chanced that one of the Kings sent her father a present and amongst other things a necklace of union jewels nine and twenty grains to whose price a King s treasures might not suffice Quoth Abd al Kadir This riviere beseemeth none but my daughter Hayat al Nufus and turning to an eunuch whose jaw teeth the Princess had knocked out for reasons best known to herself FN two hundred ninety six he called to him and said Carry the necklace to thy lady and say to her One of the Kings hath sent thy father this as a present and its price may not be paid with money put it on thy neck The slave took the necklace saying in himself Allah Almighty make it the last thing she shall put on in this world for that she deprived me of the benefit of my grinder teeth and repairing to the Princess s apartment found the door locked and the old woman asleep before the threshold He shook her and she awoke in affright and asked What dost thou want to which he answered The King hath sent me on an errand to his daughter Quoth the nurse The key is not here go away whilst I fetch it but quoth he I cannot go back to the King without having done his commandment So she went away as if to fetch the key but fear overtook her and she sought safety in flight Then the eunuch awaited her awhile then finding she did not return he feared that the King would be angry at his delay so he rattled at the door and shook it whereupon the bolt gave way and the leaf opened He entered and passed on till he came to the seventh door and walking in to the Princess s chamber found the place splendidly furnished and saw candles and flagons there At this spectacle he marvelled and going close up to the bed which was curtained by a hanging of silk embroidered with a net work of jewels drew back the curtain from before the Princess and saw her sleeping with her arms about the neck of a young man handsomer than herself whereat he magnified Allah Almighty who had created such a youth of vile water and said How goodly be this fashion for one who hateth men How came she by this fellow Methinks twas on his account that she knocked out my back teeth Then he drew the curtain and made for the door but the King s daughter awoke in affright and seeing the eunuch whose name was Kafur called to him He made her no answer so she came down from the bed on the estrade and catching hold of his skirt laid it on her head and kissed his feet saying Veil what Allah veileth Quoth he May Allah not veil thee nor him who would veil thee Thou didst knock out my grinders and saidst to me Let none make mention to me aught of men and their ways So saying he disengaged himself from her grasp and running out locked the door on them and set another eunuch to guard it Then he went in to the King who said to him Hast thou given the necklace to Hayat al Nufus The eunuch replied By Allah thou deservest altogether a better fate and the King asked What hath happened Tell me quickly whereto he answered I will not tell thee save in private and between our eyes but the King retorted saying Tell me at once and in public Cried the eunuch Then grant me immunity So the King threw him the kerchief of immunity and he said O King I went into the Princess Hayat al Nufus and found her asleep in a carpeted chamber and on her bosom was a young man So I locked the door upon the two and came back to thee When the King heard these words he started up and taking a sword in his hand cried out to the Rais of the eunuchs saying Take thy lads and go to the Princess s chamber and bring me her and him who is with her as they twain lie on the bed but cover them both up And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Seven Hundred and Thirty fifth Night She resumed It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the King commanded the head eunuch to take his lads and to fetch and set before him Hayat al Nufus and him who was with her the chief and his men entered the Princess s apartment where he found her standing up dissolved in railing tears and the Prince by her side so he said to them Lie down on the bed as thou wast and let him do likewise The King s daughter feared for her lover FN two hundred ninety seven and said to him This is no time for resistance So they both lay down and the eunuchs covered them up and carried the twain into the King s presence Thereupon Abd al Kadir pulled off the coverings and the Princess sprang to her feet He looked at her and would have smitten her neck but the Prince threw himself on the father s breast saying The fault was not hers but mine only kill me before thou killest her The King made at him to cut him down but Hayat al Nufus cast herself on her father and said Kill me not him for he is the son of a great King lord of all the land in its length and breadth When the King heard this he turned to the Chief Wazir who was a gathering place of all that is evil and said to him What sayst thou of this matter O Minister Quoth his Wazir What I say is that all who find themselves in such case as this have need of lying and there is nothing for it but to cut off both their heads after torturing them with all manner of tortures Hereupon the King called his sworder of vengeance who came with his lads and said to him Take this gallows bird and strike off his head and after do the like with this harlot and burn their bodies and consult me not about them a second time So the headsmen put his hand to her back to take her but the King cried out at him and cast at him somewhat he hent in hand which had well nigh killed him saying O dog how durst thou show ruth to those with whom I am wroth Put thy hand to her hair and drag her along by it so that she may fall on her face Accordingly he haled her by her hair and the Prince in like manner to the place of blood where he tore off a piece of his skirt and therewith bound the Prince s eyes putting the Princess last in the hope that some one would intercede for her Then having made ready the Prince he swung his sharp sword three times whilst all the troops wept and prayed Allah to send them deliverance by some intercessor and raised his hand to cut off Ardashir s head when behold there arose a cloud of dust that spread and flew till it veiled the view Now the cause thereof was that when the young Prince had delayed beyond measure the King his sire had levied a mighty host and had marched with it in person to get tidings of his son Such was his case but as regards King Abd al Kadir when he saw this he said O wights what is the meaning of yonder dust that dimmeth sights The Grand Wazir sprang up and went out to reconnoitre and found behind the cloud men like locusts of whom no count could be made nor aught avail of aid filling the hills and plains and valleys So he returned with the report to the King who said to him Go down and learn for us what may be this host and the cause of its marching upon our country Ask also of their commander and salute him for me and enquire the reason of his coming An he came in quest of aught we will aid him and if he have a blood feud with one of the Kings we will ride with him or if he desire a gift we will handsel him for this is indeed a numerous host and a power uttermost and we fear for our land from its mischief So the Minister went forth and walked among the tents and troopers and body guards and ceased not faring on from the first of the day till near sundown when he came to the warders with gilded swords in tents star studded Passing these he made his way through Emirs and Wazirs and Nabobs and Chamberlains to the pavilion of the Sultan and found him a mighty King When the King s officers saw him they cried out to him saying Kiss ground Kiss ground FN two hundred ninety eight He did so and would have risen but they cried out at him a second and a third time So he kissed the earth again and again and raised his head and would have stood up but fell down at full length for excess of awe When at last he was set between the hands of the King he said to him Allah prolong thy days and increase thy sovranty and exalt thy rank O thou auspicious King And furthermore of a truth King Abd al Kadir saluteth thee and kisseth the earth before thee and asketh on what weighty business thou art come An thou seek to avenge thee for blood on any King he will take horse in thy service or an thou come in quest of aught wherein it is in his power to help thee he standeth up at thy service on account thereof So Ardashir s father replied to the Wazir saying O messenger return to thy lord and tell him that the most mighty King Sayf al A azam Shah Lord of Shiraz had a son who hath been long absent from him and news of him have not come and all traces of him have been cut off An he be in this city he will take him and depart from you but if aught have befallen him or any mischief have ensued to him from you his father will lay waste your land and make spoil of your goods and slay your men and seize your women Return therefore to thy lord in haste and tell him this ere evil befal him Answered the Minister To hear is to obey and turned to go away when the Chamberlains cried out to him saying Kiss ground Kiss ground So he kissed the ground a score of times and rose not till his life breath was in his nostrils FN two hundred ninety nine Then he left the King s high court and returned to the city full of anxious thought concerning the affair of this King and the multitude of his troops and going in to King Abd al Kadir pale with fear and trembling in his side muscles acquainted him with that had befallen him And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Seven Hundred and Thirty sixth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the Wazir returned from the court of the Great King pale with fear and with side muscles quivering for dread exceeding and acquainted his lord with that had befallen him Hereat disquietude and terror for himself and for his people laid hold upon him and he said to the Minister O Wazir and who is this King s son Replied the other Tis even he whom thou badest put to death but praised be Allah who hastened not his slaughter Else had his father wasted our lands and spoiled our good Quoth the King See now thy corrupt judgment in that thou didst counsel us to slay him

altogether to her heeding none other and forsaking all his concubines and favourites and tarried with her a whole year as it were a single day Still she spoke not till one morning he said to her and indeed the love of her and longing waxed upon him O desire of souls verily passion for thee is great with me and I have forsaken for thy sake all my slave girls and concubines and women and favourites and I have made thee my portion of the world and had patience with thee a whole year and now I beseech Almighty Allah of His favour to soften thy heart to me so thou mayst speak to me Or an thou be dumb tell me by a sign that I may give up hope of thy speech I pray the Lord extolled be He to vouchsafe me by thee a son child who shall inherit the kingdom after me for I am old and lone and have none to be my heir Wherefore Allah upon thee an thou love me return me a reply The damsel bowed her head awhile in thought and presently raising it smiled in his face whereat it seemed to him as if lightning filled the chamber Then she said O magnanimous liege lord and valorous lion Allah hath answered thy prayer for I am with child by thee and the time of my delivery is near at hand though I know not if the unborn babe be male or female FN three hundred seven But had I not conceived by thee I had not spoken to thee one word When the King heard her speech his face shone with joy and gladness and he kissed her head and hands for excess of delight saying Alhamdolillah laud to Lord who hath vouchsafed me the things I desired first thy speech and secondly thy tidings that thou art with child by me Then he rose up and went forth from her and seating himself on the throne of his kingship in an ecstasy of happiness bade his Wazir distribute to the poor and needy and widows and others an hundred thousand dinars by way of thank offering to Allah Most High and alms on his own account The Minister did as bidden by the King who returning to the damsel sat with her and embraced and pressed her to his breast saying O my lady my queen whose slave I am prithee what was the cause of this thy silence Thou hast been with me a whole year night and day waking and sleeping yet hast not spoken to me till this day She replied Hearken O King of the Age and know that I am a wretched exile broken hearted and far parted from my mother and my family and my brother When the King heard her words he knew her desire and said As for thy saying that thou art wretched there is for such speech no ground inasmuch as my kingdom and good and all I possess are at thy service and I also am become thy bondman but as for thy saying I am parted from my mother and brother and family tell me where they are and I will send and fetch them to thee There upon she answered Know then O auspicious King that I am called Julnar FN three hundred eight the Sea born and that my father was of the Kings of the Main He died and left us his reign but while we were yet unsettled behold one of the other Kings arose against us and took the realm from our hands I have a brother called Salih and my mother also is a woman of the sea but I fell out with my brother The Pious and swore that I would throw myself into the hands of a man of the folk of the land So I came forth of the sea and sat down on the edge of an island in the moonshine FN three hundred nine where a passer by found me and carrying me to his house besought me of love liesse but I smote him on the head so that he all but died whereupon he carried me forth and sold me to the merchant from whom thou hadst me and this was a good man and a virtuous pious loyal and generous Were it not that thy heart loved me and that thou promotedest me over all thy concubines I had not remained with thee a single hour but had cast myself from this window into the sea and gone to my mother and family but I was ashamed to fare themwards being with child by thee for they would have deemed evilly of me and would not have credited me even although I swore to them an I told them that a King had bought me with his gold and made me his portion of the world and preferred me over all his wives and every thing that his right hand possessed This then is my story and the Peace And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Seven Hundred and Fortieth Night She resumed It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Julnar FN three hundred ten the Sea born answering the question of King Shahriman told him her past from first to last the King thanked her and kissed her between the eyes saying By Allah O my lady and light of mine eyes I cannot bear to be parted from thee one hour and given thou leave me I shall die forthright What then is to be done Replied she O my lord the time of my delivery is at hand and my family needs must be present that they may tend me for the women of the land know not the manner of child bearing of the women of the sea nor do the daughters of the ocean know the manner of the daughters of the earth and when my people come I shall be reconciled to them and they will be reconciled to me Quoth the King How do the people of the sea walk therein without being wetted and quoth she O King of the Age we walk in the waters with our eyes open as do ye on the ground by the blessing of the names graven upon the seal ring of Solomon Davidson on whom be peace But O King when my kith and kin come I will tell them how thou boughtest me with thy gold and hast entreated me with kindness and benevolence It behoveth that thou confirm my words to them and that they witness thine estate with their own eyes and they learn that thou art a King son of a King He rejoined O my lady do what seemeth good to thee and what pleaseth thee and I will consent to thee in all thou wouldst do The damsel continued yes we walk in the sea and see what is therein and behold the sun moon stars and sky as it were on the surface of earth and this irketh us naught Know also that there be many peoples in the main and various forms and creatures of all kinds that are on the land and that all that is on the land compared with that which is in the main is but a very small matter And the King marvelled at her words Then she pulled out from her bosom two bits of Comorin lign aloes and kindling fire in a chafing dish chose somewhat of them and threw it in then she whistled a loud whistle and spake words none understood Thereupon arose a great smoke and she said to the King who was looking on O my lord arise and hide thyself in a closet that I may show thee my brother and mother and family whilst they see thee not for I design to bung them hither and thou shalt presently espy a wondrous thing and shalt marvel at the several creatures and strange shapes which Almighty Allah hath created So he arose without stay or delay and entering a closet fell a watching what she should do She continued her fumigations and conjurations till the sea foamed and frothed turbid and there rose from it a handsome young man of a bright favour as he were the moon at its full with brow flower white cheeks of ruddy light and teeth like the marguerite He was the likest of all creatures to his sister and the tongue of the case spoke in his praise these two couplets The full moon groweth perfect once a month But thy face each day we see perfected And the full moon dwelleth in single sign But to thee all hearts be a dwelling stead After him there came forth of the sea an ancient dame with hair speckled gray and five maidens as they were moons bearing a likeness to the damsel hight Julnar The King looked upon them as they all walked upon the face of the water till they drew near the window and saw Julnar whereupon they knew her and went in to her She rose to them and met them with joy and gladness and they embraced her and wept with sore weeping Then said they to her O Julnar how couldst thou leave us four years and we unknowing of thine abiding place By Allah the world hath been straitened upon us for stress of severance from thee and we have had no delight of food or drink no not for one day but have wept with sore weeping night and day for the excess of our longing after thee Then she fell to kissing the hands of the youth her brother and her mother and cousins and they sat with her awhile questioning her of her case and of what had betided her as well as of her present estate Know replied she that when I left you I issued from the sea and sat down on the shore of an island where a man found me and sold me to a merchant who brought me to this city and sold me for ten thousand diners to the King of the country who entreated me with honour and forsook all his concubines and women and favourites for my sake and was distracted by me from all he had and all that was in his city Quoth her brother Praised be Allah who hath reunited us with thee But now O my sister tis my purpose that thou arise and go with us to our country and people When the King heard these words his wits fled him for fear lest the damsel accept her brother s words and he himself avail not to stay her albeit he loved her passionately and he became distracted with fear of losing her But Julnar answered By Allah O my brother the mortal who bought me is lord of this city and he is a mighty King and a wise man good and generous with extreme generosity Moreover he is a personage of great worth and wealth and hath neither son nor daughter He hath entreated me with honour and done me all manner of favour and kindness nor from the day of his buying me to this time have I heard from him an ill word to hurt my heart but he hath never ceased to use me courteously doing nothing save with my counsel and I am in the best of case with him and in the perfection of fair fortune Furthermore were I to leave him he would perish for he cannot endure to be parted from me an hour and if I left him I also should die for the excess of the love I bear him by reason of his great goodness to me during the time of my sojourn with him for were my father alive my estate with him would not be like my estate with this great and glorious and puissant potentate And verily ye see me with child by him and praise be to Allah who hath made me a daughter of the Kings of the sea and my husband the mightiest of the Kings of the land and Allah in very sooth he hath compensated me for whatso I lost And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Seven Hundred and Forty first Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that Julnar the Sea born told her brother all her tale adding Allah hath not cut me off but hath compensated me for whatso I lost Now this King hath no issue male or female so I pray the Almighty to vouchsafe me a son who shall inherit of this mighty sovran that which the Lord hath bestowed upon him of lands and palaces and possessions Now when her brother and the daughters of her uncle heard this her speech their eyes were cooled thereby and they said O Julnar thou knowest thy value with us and thou wottest the affection we bear thee and thou art certified that thou art to us the dearest of all creatures and thou art assured that we seek but ease for thee without travail or trouble Wherefore an thou be in unease arise and go with us to our land and our folk but an thou be at thine ease here in honour and happiness this is our wish and our will for we desire naught save thy welfare in any case FN three hundred eleven Quoth she By Allah I am here in the utmost ease and solace and honour and grace When the King heard what she said he joyed with a heart set at rest and thanked her silently for this the love of her redoubled on him and entered his heart core and he knew that she loved him as he loved her and that she desired to abide with him that she might see his child by her Then Julnar bade her women lay the tables and set on all sorts of viands which had been cooked in kitchen under her own eyes and fruits and sweetmeats whereof she ate she and her kinsfolk But presently they said to her O Julnar thy lord is a stranger to us and we have entered his house without his leave or weeting Thou hast extolled to us his excellence and eke thou hast set before us of his victual whereof we have eaten yet have we not companied with him nor seen him neither hath he seen us nor come to our presence and eaten with us so there might be between us bread and salt And they all left eating and were wroth with her and fire issued from their mouths as from cressets which when the King saw his wits fled for excess of fear of them But Julnar arose and soothed them and going to the closet where was the King her lord said to him O my lord hast thou seen and heard how I praised thee and extolled thee to my people and hast thou noted what they said to me of their desire to carry me away with them Quoth he I both heard and saw May the Almighty abundantly requite thee for me By Allah I knew not the full measure of thy fondness until this blessed hour and now I doubt not of thy love to me Quoth she O my lord is the reward of kindness aught but kindness Verily thou hast dealt generously with me and hast entreated me with worship and I have seen that thou lovest me with the utmost love and thou hast done me all manner of honour and kindness and preferred me above all thou lovest and desirest So how should my heart be content to leave thee and depart from thee and how should I do thus after all thy goodness to me But now I desire of thy courtesy that thou come and salute my family so thou mayst see them and they thee and pure love and friendship may be between you for know O King of the Age that my brother and mother and cousins love thee with exceeding love by reason of my praises of thee to them and they say We will not depart from thee nor go to our homes till we have foregathered with the King and saluted him For indeed they desire to see thee and make acquaintance with thee The King replied To hear is to obey for this is my very own wish So saying he rose and went in to them and saluted them with the goodliest salutation and they sprang up to him and received him with the utmost worship after which he sat down in the palace and ate with them and he entertained them thus for the space of thirty days Then being desirous of returning home they took leave of the King and Queen and departed with due permission to their own land after he had done them all possible honour Awhile after this Julnar completed the days of her pregnancy and the time of her delivery being come she bore a boy as he were the moon at its full whereat the utmost joy betided the King for that he had never in his life been vouchsafed son or daughter So they held high festival and decorated the city seven days in the extreme of joy and jollity and on the seventh day came Queen Julnar s mother Farashah hight FN three hundred twelve and brother and cousins whenas they knew of her delivery And Shahrazad perceived the light of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Seven Hundred and Forty second Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Julnar was brought to bed and was visited by her people the King received them with joy at their coming and said to them I said that I would not give my son a name till you should come and name him of your knowledge So they named him Badr Basim FN three hundred thirteen and all agreed upon this name Then they showed the child to his uncle Salih who took him in his arms and arising began to walk about the chamber with him in all directions right and left Presently he carried him forth of the palace and going down to the salt sea fared on with him till he was hidden from the King s sight Now when Shahriman saw him take his son and disappear with him in the depth of the sea 
8500-258285-0000	train-other-500	he gave the child up for lost and fell to weeping and wailing but Julnar said to him O King of the Age fear not neither grieve for thy son
8500-258285-0001	train-other-500	for I love my child more than thou and he is with my brother so reck thou not of the sea neither fear for him drowning Had my brother known that aught of harm would betide the little one
none	none	 he had not done this deed and he will presently bring thee thy son safe Inshallah an it please the Almighty Nor was an hour past before the sea became turbid and troubled 
8500-258285-0002	train-other-500	and King Salih came forth and flew from the sea till he came up to them with the child lying quiet and showing a face like the moon on the night of fulness Then looking at the King he said
none	none	 Haply thou fearedst harm for thy son whenas I plunged into the sea with him Replied the father Yes O my lord I did indeed fear for him and thought he would never be saved therefrom Rejoined Salih O King of the land we pencilled his eyes with an eye powder we know of and recited over him the names graven upon the seal ring of Solomon David son on whom be the Peace 
8500-258285-0003	train-other-500	for this is what we use to do with children newly born among us and now thou needst not fear for him drowning or suffocation
none	none	 in all the oceans of the world 
8500-258285-0004	train-other-500	if he should go down into them for even as ye walk on the land so
none	none	 walk we in the sea Then he pulled out of his pocket a casket graven and sealed and breaking open the seals emptied it whereupon there fell from it strings of all manner jacinths and other jewels 
8500-258285-0005	train-other-500	besides three hundred bugles of emerald and other three hundred hollow gems as big as ostrich eggs whose light dimmed that of sun and moon Quoth Salih O King of the Age
8500-258285-0006	train-other-500	these jewels and jacinths are a present from me to thee We never yet brought thee a gift for that we knew not Julnar s abiding place neither had we of her any tidings or trace
8500-258285-0007	train-other-500	but now that we see thee to be united with her
none	none	 and we are all become one thing 
8500-258285-0008	train-other-500	we have brought thee this present and every little while we will bring thee the like thereof Inshallah for that these jewels and jacinths are more plentiful with us than pebbles on the beach
8500-258285-0009	train-other-500	and we know the good and the bad of them and their whereabouts and the way to them and they are easy to us When the King saw the jewels his wits were bewildered and his sense was astounded and he said
8500-258285-0010	train-other-500	By Allah one single gem of these jewels is worth my realm Then he thanked for his bounty Salih the Sea born and looking towards Queen Julnar said I am abashed before thy brother
none	none	 for that he hath dealt munificently by me and bestowed on me this splendid gift which the folk of the land were unable to present So she thanked her brother for his deed and he said O King of the Age thou hast the prior claim on us and it behoves us to thank thee for thou hast entreated our sister with kindness and we have entered thy dwelling and eaten of thy victual and the poet saith FN three hundred fourteen Had I wept before she did in my passion for Saada 
8500-258285-0011	train-other-500	I had healed my soul before repentance came But she wept before I did her tears drew mine and I said The merit belongs to the precedent
8500-258285-0012	train-other-500	And resumed Salih the Pious if we stood on our faces in thy service O King of the Age a thousand years yet
none	none	 had we not the might to requite thee and this were but a scantling of thy due The King thanked him with heartiest thanks and the Merman and Merwomen abode with him forty days space 
8500-258285-0013	train-other-500	at the end of which Salih arose and kissed the ground before his brother in law who asked What wantest thou O Salih He answered O King of the Age indeed
8500-258285-0014	train-other-500	thou hast done us overabundant favours and we crave of thy bounties that thou deal charitably with us and grant us permission to depart for we yearn after our people and country
none	none	 and kinsfolk and our homes so will we never forsake thy service 
8500-258285-0015	train-other-500	nor that of my sister and my nephew and by Allah O King of the Age tis not pleasant to my heart to part from thee but how shall we do seeing that we have been reared in the sea
8500-258285-0016	train-other-500	and that the sojourn of the shore liketh us not When the King heard these words he rose to his feet and farewelled Salih the Sea born and his mother and his cousins and all wept together because of parting
8500-258285-0017	train-other-500	and presently they said to him Anon we will be with thee again nor will we forsake thee but will visit thee every few days Then they flew off
none	none	 and descending into the sea 
8500-258285-0018	train-other-500	disappeared from sight And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Seven Hundred and Forty third Night
8500-258285-0019	train-other-500	She continued It hath reached me O auspicious King that the relations of Julnar the Sea born farewelled the King and her weeping together because of parting then they flew off
8500-258285-0020	train-other-500	and descending into the depths disappeared from sight After this King Shahriman showed the more kindness to Julnar and honoured her with increase of honour and the little one grew up
8500-258285-0021	train-other-500	and flourished whilst his maternal uncle and grandam and cousins visited the King every few days and abode with him a month or two months at a time
8500-258285-0022	train-other-500	The boy ceased not to increase in beauty and loveliness with increase of years till he attained the age of fifteen and was unique in his perfection and symmetry He learnt writing
8500-258285-0023	train-other-500	and Koran reading history syntax and lexicography archery spearplay and horsemanship and what not else behoveth the sons of Kings nor was there
8500-258285-0024	train-other-500	one of the children of the folk of the city men or women but would talk of the youth s charms for he was of surpassing beauty and perfection even such an one
none	none	 as is praised in the saying of the poet FN three hundred fifteen The whiskers write upon his cheek 
8500-258285-0025	train-other-500	with ambergris on pearl Two lines as twere with jet upon an apple line for line Death harbours in his languid eye and slays with every glance
8500-258285-0026	train-other-500	And in his cheek is drunkenness and not in any wine And in that of another Upsprings from table
none	none	 of his lovely cheeks FN three hundred sixteen A growth like broidery my wonder is As twere a lamp that burns through night hung up Beneath the gloom FN three hundred seventeen in chains of ambergris And indeed the King loved him with exceeding love and summoning his Wazir and Emirs and the Chief Officers of state 
8500-258285-0027	train-other-500	and Grandees of his realm required of them a binding oath
none	none	 that they would make Badr Basim 
8500-258285-0028	train-other-500	King over them after his sire and they sware the oath gladly for the sovran was liberal to the lieges pleasant in parley and a very compend of goodness saying naught but that wherein was advantage for the people
8500-258285-0029	train-other-500	On the morrow Shahriman mounted with all his troops and Emirs and Lords and went forth into the city and returned When they drew near the palace the King dismounted
none	none	 to wait upon his son who abode on horseback and he and all the Emirs and Grandees bore the saddlecloth of honour before him each and every of them 
8500-258285-0030	train-other-500	bearing it in his turn till they came to the vestibule of the palace where the Prince alighted and his father and the Emirs embraced him and seated him on the throne of Kingship whilst they
none	none	 including his sire stood before him Then Badr Basim judged the people deposing the unjust and promoting the just and continued so doing till near upon noon 
8500-258285-0031	train-other-500	when he descended from the throne and went in to his mother Julnar the Sea born with the crown upon his head as he were the moon
none	none	 When she saw him 
8500-258285-0032	train-other-500	with the King standing before him she rose and kissing him gave him joy of the Sultanate and wished him and his sire length of life and victory over their foes He sat with her and rested
8500-258285-0033	train-other-500	till the hour of mid afternoon prayer when he took horse and repaired with the Emirs before him to the Maydan plain where he played at arms with his father and his lords till night fall when he returned to the palace preceded by all the folk
8500-258285-0034	train-other-500	He rode forth thus every day to the tilting ground returning to sit and judge the people and do justice between earl and churl and thus he continued doing a whole year
none	none	 at the end of which 
8500-258285-0035	train-other-500	he began to ride out a hunting and a chasing and to go round about in the cities and countries under his rule proclaiming security and satisfaction and doing after the fashion of Kings and he was unique
none	none	 among the people of his day for glory and valour and just dealing among the subjects And it chanced that one day 
8500-258285-0036	train-other-500	the old King fell sick and his fluttering heart forebode him of translation to the Mansion of Eternity His sickness grew upon him till he was nigh upon death when he called his son
8500-258285-0037	train-other-500	and commended his mother and subjects to his care and caused all the Emirs and Grandees once more swear allegiance to the Prince and assured himself of them by strongest oaths after which he lingered a few days
none	none	 and departed to the mercy of Almighty Allah His son and widow and all the Emirs and Wazirs and Lords mourned over him and they built him a tomb and buried him therein They ceased not ceremonially to mourn for him a whole month 
8500-258285-0038	train-other-500	till Salih and his mother and cousins arrived and condoled with their grieving for the King and said O Julnar though the King be dead yet hath he left this noble and peerless youth and not dead
8500-258285-0039	train-other-500	is whoso leaveth the like of him the rending lion and the shining moon And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say
8500-258285-0040	train-other-500	When it was the Seven Hundred and Forty fourth Night She pursued It hath reached me O auspicious King that Salih brother of Julnar and her mother and cousins said to her
8500-258285-0041	train-other-500	Albeit the King be dead yet hath he left behind him as successor this noble and peerless youth the rending lion and the shining moon Thereupon the Grandees and notables of the Empire
none	none	 went in to King Badr Basim and said to him 
8500-258285-0042	train-other-500	O King there is no harm in mourning for the late sovran but over mourning beseemeth none save women wherefore occupy thou not thy heart and our hearts with mourning for thy sire
none	none	 inasmuch as 
8500-258285-0043	train-other-500	he hath left thee behind him and whoso leaveth the like of thee is not dead Then they comforted him and diverted him
none	none	 and lastly carried him to the bath When he came out of the Hammam he donned a rich robe purfled with gold and embroidered with jewels and jacinths and setting the royal crown on his head sat down on his throne of kingship and ordered the affairs of the folk 
8500-258285-0044	train-other-500	doing equal justice between strong and weak and exacting from the prince the dues of the pauper wherefore the people loved him with exceeding love Thus he continued doing for a full year
none	none	 whilst every now and then his kinsfolk of the sea visited him and his life was pleasant and his eye was cooled Now it came to pass that his uncle Salih went in one night of the nights to Julnar and saluted her whereupon she rose and embracing him seated him by her side and asked him O my brother how art thou and my mother and my cousins He answered O my sister they are well and glad and in good case lacking naught save a sight of thy face Then she set somewhat of food before him and he ate after which talk ensued between the twain and they spake of King Badr Basim and his beauty and loveliness his symmetry and skill in cavalarice and cleverness and good breeding Now Badr was propped upon his elbow hard by them and hearing his mother and uncle speak of him he feigned sleep and listened to their talk FN three hundred eighteen Presently Salih said to his sister Thy son is now seventeen years old and is unmarried and I fear lest mishap befal him and he have no son wherefore it is my desire to marry him to a Princess of the princesses of the sea who shall be a match for him in beauty and loveliness Quoth Julnar Name them to me for I know them all So Salih proceeded to enumerate them to her one by one but to each she said I like not this one for my son I will not marry him but to one who is his equal in beauty and loveliness and wit and piety and good breeding and magnanimity and dominion and rank and lineage FN three hundred nineteen Quoth Salih I know none other of the daughters of the Kings of the sea for I have numbered to thee more than an hundred girls and not one of them pleaseth thee but see O my sister whether thy son be asleep or no So she felt Badr and finding on him the signs of slumber said to Salih He is asleep what hast thou to say and what is thine object in making sure his sleeping Replied he O my sister know that I have bethought me of a Mermaid of the mermaids who befitteth thy son but I fear to name her lest he be awake and his heart be taken with her love and maybe we shall be unable to win to her so should he and we and the Grandees of the realm be wearied in vain and trouble betide us through this for as saith the poet Love at first sight is a spurt of spray FN three hundred twenty But a spreading sea when it gaineth sway When she heard these words she cried Tell me the condition of this girl and her name 
8500-258285-0045	train-other-500	for I know all the damsels of the sea Kings daughters and others and if I judge her worthy of him I will demand her in marriage for him of her father though I spend on her whatso my hand possesseth
8500-258285-0046	train-other-500	So recount to me all anent her and fear naught for my son sleepeth Quoth Salih I fear lest he be awake and the poet saith I loved him soon as his praise I heard
8500-258285-0047	train-other-500	For ear oft loveth ere eye survey But Julnar said Speak out and be brief and fear not O my brother So he said
none	none	 By Allah O my sister none is worthy of thy son save the Princess Jauharah daughter of King Al Samandal FN three hundred twenty one for that she is like unto him in beauty and loveliness and brilliancy and perfection nor is there found in sea or on land a sweeter or pleasanter of gifts than she for she is prime in comeliness and seemlihead of face and symmetrical shape of perfect grace her cheek is ruddy dight her brow flower white her teeth gem bright her eyes blackest black and whitest white her hips of heavy weight her waist slight and her favour exquisite When she turneth she shameth the wild cattle FN three hundred twenty two and the gazelles and when she walketh she breedeth envy in the willow branch when she unveileth her face outshineth sun and moon and all who look upon her 
8500-258285-0048	train-other-500	she enslaveth soon sweet lipped and soft sided indeed is she Now when Julnar heard what Salih said she replied
none	none	 Thou sayest sooth O my brother 
8500-258285-0049	train-other-500	By Allah I have seen her many and many a time and she was my companion when we were little ones but now we have no knowledge of each other for constraint of distance nor have I set eyes on her for eighteen years
8500-258285-0050	train-other-500	By Allah none is worthy of my son but she
none	none	 Now Badr heard all they said 
8500-258285-0051	train-other-500	and mastered what had passed first and last of these praises bestowed
none	none	 on Jauharah daughter of King Al Samandal so he fell in love with her on hearsay pretending sleep the while wherefore fire was kindled in his heart on her account full sore and he was drowned in a sea without bottom or shore And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Seven Hundred and Forty fifth Night She resumed It hath reached me O auspicious King that when King Badr Basim 
8500-258286-0000	train-other-500	heard the words of his uncle Salih and his mother Julnar praising the daughter of King Al Samandal a flame of fire burnt in his heart full sore and he was drowned in a sea which hath nor bottom nor shore
8500-258286-0001	train-other-500	Then Salih looking at his sister exclaimed By Allah O my sister there is no greater fool among the Kings of the sea than her father nor one more violent of temper than he
none	none	 So name thou not the girl to thy son till we demand her in marriage of her father If he favour us with his assent we will praise Allah Almighty and if he refuse us and will not give her to thy son to wife we will say no more about it and seek another match Answered Julnar 
8500-258286-0002	train-other-500	Right is thy rede and they parleyed no more but
none	none	 Badr passed the night with a heart on fire with passion for Princess Jauharah However he concealed his case and spake not of her to his mother or his uncle albeit he was on coals of fire for love of her Now 
8500-258286-0003	train-other-500	when it was morning the King and his uncle went to the Hammam bath and washed after which they came forth and drank wine and the servants set food before them whereof they and Julnar ate their sufficiency
8500-258286-0004	train-other-500	and washed their hands Then Salih rose and said to his nephew and sister With your leave I would fain go to my mother and my folk for I have been with you some days and their hearts are troubled with awaiting me
none	none	 But Badr Basim said to him Tarry with us this day and he consented Then quoth the King Come O my uncle let us go forth to the garden So they sallied forth and promenaded about the pastures and took their solace awhile after which King Badr 
8500-258286-0005	train-other-500	lay down under a shady tree thinking to rest and sleep but he remembered his uncle s description of the maiden and her beauty and loveliness and shed railing tears
none	none	 reciting these two couplets FN three hundred twenty three Were it said to me while the flame is burning within me And the fire blazing in my heart and bowels Wouldst thou rather that thou shouldest behold them Or a draught of pure water I would answer Them Then he sighed and wept and lamented reciting these verses also 
8500-258286-0006	train-other-500	Who shall save me from love of a lovely gazelle Brighter browed than the sunshine my bonnibel My heart erst free from her love now burns With fire

none	none	 Mohammed is the Apostle of God and there is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah the Glorious the Great adding O my son heardest thou what passed between me and thy mother respecting Princess Jauharah Replied Badr Basim 
8500-258286-0008	train-other-500	Yes O my uncle and I fell in love with her by hearsay through what I heard you say Indeed my heart cleaveth to her and I cannot live without her Rejoined his uncle O King
8500-258286-0009	train-other-500	let us return to thy mother and tell her how the case standeth and crave her leave that I may take thee with me and seek the Princess in marriage of her sire after which we will farewell her and I and thou will return
8500-258286-0010	train-other-500	Indeed I fear to take thee and go without her leave lest she be wroth with me and verily the right would be on her side for I should be the cause of her separation from us Moreover
none	none	 the city would be left without king and there would be none to govern the citizens and look to their affairs so should the realm be disordered against thee and the kingship depart from thy hands But Badr Basim hearing these words cried 
8500-258286-0011	train-other-500	O my uncle if I return to my mother
none	none	 and consult her on such matter she will not suffer me to do this 
8500-258286-0012	train-other-500	wherefore I will not return to my mother nor consult her And he wept before him and presently added I will go with thee and tell her not and after will return
none	none	 When Salih heard what his nephew said he was confused anent his case and said I crave help of the Almighty in any event Then seeing that Badr Basim 
8500-258286-0013	train-other-500	was resolved to go with him whether his mother would let him or no he drew from his finger a seal ring whereon were graven certain of the names of Allah the Most High and gave it to him saying
8500-258286-0014	train-other-500	Put this on thy finger and thou shalt be safe from drowning and other perils and from the mischief of sea beasts and great fishes So

none	none	 A blessed coming O my son 
8500-258286-0018	train-other-500	How didst thou leave thy mother Julnar He replied She is well in health and fortune and saluteth thee and her uncle s daughters Then Salih related to his mother what had occurred between him and his sister
none	none	 and how King Badr Basim 
8500-258286-0019	train-other-500	had fallen in love with the Princess Jauharah daughter of Al Samandal by report and told her the whole tale from beginning to end adding He hath not come save to demand her in wedlock of her sire
8500-258286-0020	train-other-500	which when the old Queen heard she was wroth against her son with exceeding wrath and sore troubled and concerned and said
none	none	 O Salih O my son in very sooth thou diddest wrong to name the Princess before thy nephew knowing as thou dost that her father is stupid 
8500-258286-0021	train-other-500	and violent little of wit and tyrannical of temper grudging his daughter to every suitor for all the Monarchs of the Main have sought her hand but he rejected them all nay
none	none	 he would none of them saying Ye are no match for her in beauty or in loveliness or in aught else Wherefore we fear to demand her in wedlock of him lest he reject us even as be hath rejected others 
8500-258286-0022	train-other-500	and we are a folk of high spirit and should return broken hearted Hearing these words Salih answered O my mother what is to do For

8500-258286-0023	train-other-500	There is no help but that I seek her in marriage of her sire though I expend my whole kingdom
none	none	 and he avoucheth 
8500-258286-0024	train-other-500	that an he take her not to wife he will die of love for her and longing And Salih continued He is handsomer and goodlier than she his father was King of all the Persians whose King he now is
none	none	 and none is worthy of Jauharah save Badr Basim 
8500-258286-0025	train-other-500	Wherefore I purpose to carry her father a gift of jacinths and jewels befitting his dignity and demand her of him in marriage An he object to us that he is a King behold

none	none	 and may Almighty Allah help me thereto Rejoined his mother Do as thou wilt but beware of giving her father rough words whenas thou speakest with him for thou knowest his stupidity and violence and I fear lest he do thee a mischief for he knoweth not respect for any And Salih answered Hearkening and obedience Then he sprang up 
8500-258286-0029	train-other-500	and taking two bags full of gems such as rubies and bugles of emerald noble ores and all manner jewels gave them to his servants to carry and set out with his nephew for the palace of Al Samandal
8500-258286-0030	train-other-500	When they came thither he sought audience of the King and being admitted to his presence kissed ground before him and saluted him with the goodliest Salam The King rose to him
8500-258286-0031	train-other-500	and honouring him with the utmost honour bade him be seated So he sat down and presently the King said to him
none	none	 A blessed coming indeed thou hast desolated us O Salih 
8500-258286-0032	train-other-500	But what bringeth thee to us Tell me thine errand that we may fulfil it to thee Whereupon Salih arose and kissing the ground a second time said O King of the Age my errand is to Allah
none	none	 and the magnanimous liege lord and the valiant lion the report of whose good qualities the caravans far and near have dispread and whose renown for benefits and beneficence and clemency and graciousness and liberality 
8500-258286-0033	train-other-500	to all climes and countries hath sped Thereupon he opened the two bags and displaying their contents before Al Samandal said to him O King of the Age
8500-258286-0034	train-other-500	haply wilt thou accept my gift and by showing favour to me heal my heart
none	none	 And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Seven Hundred and Forty seventh Night She continued It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Salih offered his gift to the King saying My aim and end 
8500-258286-0035	train-other-500	is that the Sovran show favour to me and heal my heart by accepting my present
none	none	 King Al Samandal asked 
8500-258286-0036	train-other-500	With what object dost thou gift me with this gift Tell me thy tale and acquaint me with thy requirement An its accomplishment be in my power I will straightway accomplish it to thee
none	none	 and spare thee toil and trouble and if I be unable thereunto Allah compelleth not any soul aught beyond its power FN three hundred twenty four So Salih rose and kissing ground three times said O King of the Age that which I desire thou art indeed able to do it is in thy power 
8500-258286-0037	train-other-500	and thou art master thereof and I impose not on the King a difficulty nor am I Jinn demented that I should crave of the King
none	none	 a thing whereto he availeth not 
8500-258286-0038	train-other-500	for one of the sages saith An thou wouldst be complied with ask that which can be readily supplied
none	none	 Wherefore 
8500-258286-0039	train-other-500	that of which I am come in quest the King whom Allah preserve is able to grant The King replied
none	none	 Ask what thou wouldst have and state thy case and seek thy need Then said Salih FN three hundred twenty five O King of the Age know that I come as a suitor seeking the unique pearl and the hoarded jewel the Princess Jauharah daughter of our lord the King 
8500-258286-0040	train-other-500	wherefore O King disappoint thou not thy suitor Now when the King heard this he laughed till he fell backwards in mockery of him and said O Salih
none	none	 I had thought thee a man of worth and a youth of sense seeking naught save what was reasonable and speaking not save advisedly What then 
8500-258286-0041	train-other-500	hath befallen thy reason and urged thee to this monstrous matter and mighty hazard that thou seekest in marriage daughters of Kings lords of cities and climates Say me
none	none	 art thou of a rank to aspire 
8500-258286-0042	train-other-500	to this great eminence and hath thy wit failed thee to this extreme pass that thou affrontest me with this demand Replied Salih Allah amend the King
none	none	 I seek her not for myself albeit an I did I am her match and more than her match for thou knowest that my father was King of the Kings of the sea for all thou art this day our King but I seek her for King Badr Basim 
8500-258286-0043	train-other-500	lord of the lands of the Persians and son of King Shahriman whose puissance thou knowest An thou object that thou art a mighty great King
none	none	 King Badr is a greater and if thou object thy daughter s beauty King Badr is more beautiful than she and fairer of form and more excellent of rank and lineage and he is the champion of the people of his day Wherefore 
8500-258286-0044	train-other-500	if thou grant my request O King of the Age
none	none	 thou wilt have set the thing in its stead but if thou deal arrogantly with us thou wilt not use us justly nor travel with us the road which is straght FN three hundred twenty six Moreover O King thou knowest that the Princess Jauharah the daughter of our lord the King must needs be wedded and bedded for the sage saith a girl s lot is either grace of marriage or the grave FN three hundred twenty seven Wherefore an thou mean to marry her my sister s son is worthier of her than any other man Now 
8500-258286-0045	train-other-500	when King Al Samandal heard Salih s words he was wroth with exceeding wrath his reason well nigh fled and his soul was like to depart his body for rage and he cried O
none	none	 dog shall the like of thee dare to bespeak me thus and name my daughter in the assemblies FN three hundred twenty eight saying that the son of thy sister Julnar is a match for her Who art thou and who is this sister of thine and who is her son and who was his father FN three hundred twenty nine that thou durst say to me such say and address me with such address What are ye all in comparison with my daughter but dogs And he cried out to his pages saying 
8500-258286-0046	train-other-500	Take yonder gallows bird s head So they drew their swords and made for Salih but he fled and for the palace gate sped and reaching the entrance he found
none	none	 of his cousins and kinsfolk and servants more than a thousand horse armed cap a pie in iron and close knitted mail coats hending in hand spears and naked swords glittering white 
8500-258286-0047	train-other-500	And these when they saw Salih come running out of the palace they having been sent by his mother to his succour questioned him and he told them what was to do whereupon they knew that the King was a fool
8500-258286-0048	train-other-500	and violent tempered to boot So they dismounted and baring their blades went in to the King Al Samandal whom they found seated upon the throne of his Kingship unaware of their coming and enraged against Salih
8500-258286-0049	train-other-500	with furious rage and they beheld his eunuchs and pages and officers unprepared When the King saw them enter drawn brand in hand he cried out to his people saying
none	none	 Woe to you 
8500-258286-0050	train-other-500	Take me the heads of these hounds But ere an hour had sped Al Samandal s party were put to the route and relied upon flight and Salih and his kinsfolk seized upon the King and pinioned him
none	none	 And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Seven Hundred and Forty eighth Night She pursued It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Salih and his kinsfolk pinioned the King Princess Jauharah awoke and knew that her father was a captive and his guards slain So she fled forth the palace to a certain island and climbing up into a high tree hid herself in its summit Now 
8500-258287-0000	train-other-500	when the two parties came to blows some of King Al Samandal s pages fled
none	none	 and Badr Basim meeting them questioned them of their case 
8500-258287-0001	train-other-500	and they told him what had happened But when he heard that the King was a prisoner
none	none	 Badr feared for himself 
8500-258287-0002	train-other-500	and fled saying in his heart Verily all this turmoil is on my account and none is wanted but I So he sought safety in flight security to sight knowing not whither he went
8500-258287-0003	train-other-500	but destiny from Eternity fore ordained crave him to the very island where the Princess had taken refuge and he came to the very tree whereon she sat and threw himself down like a dead man thinking to lie and repose himself
none	none	 and knowing not there is no rest for the pursued for none knoweth what Fate hideth for him in the future As he lay down he raised his eyes to the tree and they met the eyes of the Princess So he looked at her and seeing her to be like the moon rising in the East cried Glory to Him who fashioned yonder perfect form Him who is the Creator of all things and who over all things is Almighty Glory to the Great God the Maker the Shaper and Fashioner By Allah if my presentiments be true this is Jauharah daughter of King Al Samandal Methinks that when she heard of our coming to blows with her father she fled to this island and happening upon this tree hid herself on its head but if this be not the Princess herself tis one yet goodlier than she Then he bethought himself of her case and said in himself I will arise and lay hands on her and question her of her condition and 
8500-258287-0004	train-other-500	if she be indeed the she I will demand her in wedlock of herself and so win my wish So he stood up and said to her O end of all desire who art thou
none	none	 and who brought thee hither She looked at Badr Basim and seeing him to be as the full moon FN three hundred thirty when it shineth from under the black cloud slender of shape and sweet of smile answered O fair of fashion I am Princess Jauharah daughter of King Al Samandal and I took refuge in this place because Salih and his host 
8500-258287-0005	train-other-500	came to blows with my sire and slew his troops and took him prisoner with some of his men wherefore I fled fearing for my very life presently adding And I weet not what fortune hath done with my father
none	none	 When King Badr Basim heard these words 
8500-258287-0006	train-other-500	he marvelled with exceeding marvel at this strange chance and thought Doubtless I have won my wish by the capture of her sire Then he looked at Jauharah and said to her Come down O my lady
8500-258287-0007	train-other-500	for I am slain for love of thee and thine eyes have captivated me On my account and thine are all these broils and battles
none	none	 for thou must know that I am King Badr Basim Lord of the Persians and Salih is my mother s brother and he it is who came to thy sire to demand thee of him in marriage 
8500-258287-0008	train-other-500	As for me I have quitted my kingdom for thy sake and our meeting here is the rarest coincidence So come down to me and let us twain fare for thy father s palace that I may beseech uncle Salih to release him and I may make thee my lawful wife
none	none	 When Jauharah heard his words 
8500-258287-0009	train-other-500	she said in herself Twas on this miserable gallows bird s account then that all this hath befallen and that my father hath fallen prisoner and his chamberlains and suite have been slain and I have been departed from my palace
8500-258287-0010	train-other-500	a miserable exile and have fled for refuge to this island But an I devise not against him some device to defend myself from him he will possess himself of me and take his will of me
none	none	 for he is in love and for aught that he doeth a lover is not blamed Then she beguiled him with winning words and soft speeches whilst he knew not the perfidy against him she purposed and asked him 
8500-258287-0011	train-other-500	O my lord and light of my eyes say me
none	none	 art thou indeed King Badr Basim son of Queen Julnar And he answered 
8500-258287-0012	train-other-500	Yes O my lady And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Seven Hundred and Forty ninth Night She resumed
none	none	 It hath reached me O auspicious King that Jauharah daughter of King Al Samandal asked the youth 
8500-258287-0013	train-other-500	Art thou in very sooth
none	none	 King Badr Basim 
8500-258287-0014	train-other-500	son of Queen Julnar And he answered Yes O my lady Then she May Allah cut off my father and gar his kingdom cease from him
none	none	 and heal not his heart neither avert from him strangerhood 
8500-258287-0015	train-other-500	if he could desire a comelier than thou or aught goodlier than these fair qualities of thine By Allah he is of little wit and judgment presently adding But O King of the Age punish him not for that he hath done
8500-258287-0016	train-other-500	more by token that an thou love me a span verily I love thee a cubit Indeed
none	none	 I have fallen into the net of thy love and am become of the number of thy slain The love that was with thee hath transferred itself to me and there is left thereof with thee but a tithe of that which is with me So saying she came down from the tree and drawing near him strained him to her bosom and fell to kissing him whereat passion and desire for her redoubled on him and doubting not but she loved him he trusted in her and returned her kisses and caresses Presently he said to her By Allah O Princess my uncle Salih set forth to me not a fortieth part of thy charms no nor a quarter carat FN three hundred thirty one of the four and twenty Then Jauharah pressed him to her bosom and pronounced some unintelligible words then spat on his face saying Quit this form of man and take shape of bird the handsomest of birds white of robe with red bill and legs Hardly had she spoken when King Badr Basim 
8500-258287-0017	train-other-500	found himself transformed into a bird the handsomest of birds who shook himself and stood looking at her Now Jauharah had with her one of her slave girls
none	none	 by name Marsinah FN three hundred thirty two so she called her and said to her By Allah but that I fear for the life of my father who is his uncle s prisoner 
8500-258287-0018	train-other-500	I would kill him Allah never requite him with good How unlucky was his coming to us for all this trouble is due to his hard headedness But do thou O slave girl bear him to the Thirsty Island
none	none	 and leave him there to die of thirst So Marsinah carried him to the island in question and would have returned and left him there but she said in herself By Allah the lord of such beauty and loveliness deserveth not to die of thirst 
8500-258287-0019	train-other-500	So she went forth from that island and brought him to another abounding in trees and fruits and rills and setting him down there returned to her mistress and told her I have left him on the Thirsty Island
8500-258287-0020	train-other-500	Such was the case with Badr Basim but as regards King Salih
none	none	 he sought for Jauharah 
8500-258287-0021	train-other-500	after capturing the King and killing his folk but finding her not returned to his palace and said to his mother
none	none	 Where is my sister s son King Badr Basim By Allah O my son replied she I know nothing of him For when it reached him that you and King Al Samandal had come to blows and that strife and slaughter had betided between you he was affrighted and fled 
8500-258287-0022	train-other-500	When Salih heard this he grieved for his nephew and said O my mother by Allah we have dealt negligently by King Badr and I fear lest he perish or lest one of King Al Samandal s soldiers
none	none	 or his daughter Jauharah fall in with him 
8500-258287-0023	train-other-500	So should we come to shame with his mother and no good betide us from her for that I took him without her leave Then he despatched guards and scouts throughout the sea
none	none	 and elsewhere to seek for Badr but they could learn no tidings of him 
8500-258287-0024	train-other-500	so they returned and told King Salih wherefore cark and care redoubled on him and his breast was straitened for King Badr Basim So far concerning nephew and uncle but as for Julnar the Sea born
none	none	 after their departure she abode in expectation of them but her son returned not and she heard no report of him So when many days of fruitless waiting had gone by she arose and going down into the sea repaired to her mother 
8500-258287-0025	train-other-500	who sighting her rose to her and kissed her and embraced her as did the Mermaids her cousins
none	none	 Then she questioned her mother of King Badr Basim 
8500-258287-0026	train-other-500	and she answered saying O my daughter of a truth he came hither with his uncle who took jacinths and jewels and carrying them to King Al Samandal demanded his daughter in marriage for thy son but he consented not
8500-258287-0027	train-other-500	and was violent against thy brother in words Now I had sent Salih nigh upon a thousand horse and a battle befel between him and King Al Samandal but Allah aided thy brother against him and he slew his guards and troops
8500-258287-0028	train-other-500	and took himself prisoner Meanwhile tidings of this reached thy son and it would seem as if he feared for himself wherefore he fled forth from us without our will and returned not to us nor have we heard any news of him
8500-258287-0029	train-other-500	Then Julnar enquired for King Salih and his mother said He is seated on the throne of his kingship in the stead of King Al Samandal and hath sent in all directions to seek thy son and Princess Jauharah
8500-258287-0030	train-other-500	When Julnar heard the maternal words she mourned for her son with sad mourning and was highly incensed against her brother Salih for that he had taken him and gone down with him into the sea without her leave and she said
none	none	 O my mother I fear for our realm as I came to thee without letting any know and I dread tarrying with thee lest the state fall into disorder and the kingdom pass from our hands Wherefore I deem best to return and govern the reign till it please Allah to order our son s affair for us But look ye forget him not neither neglect his case for should he come to any harm it would infallibly kill me since I see not the world save in him and delight but in his life 
8500-258287-0031	train-other-500	She replied With love and gladness O my daughter Ask not what we suffer by reason of his loss and absence Then she sent to seek for her grandson whilst Julnar returned to her kingdom
none	none	 weeping eyed and heavy hearted and indeed the gladness of the world was straitened upon her And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Seven Hundred and Fiftieth Night 
8500-258287-0032	train-other-500	She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Queen Juluar returned from her mother to her own realm her breast was straitened and she was in ill case
none	none	 So fared it with her but as regards King Badr Basim after Princess Jauharah had ensorcelled him and had sent him with her handmaid to the Thirsty Island saying Leave him there to die of thirst and Marsinah had set him down in a green islet he abode days and nights in the semblance of a bird eating of its fruits and drinking of its waters

none	none	 He espied King Badr Basim in his form of a white robed bird 
8500-258287-0034	train-other-500	with red bill and legs captivating the sight and bewildering the thought and looking thereat said in himself Verily yonder is a beautiful bird never saw I its like in fairness or form
none	none	 So he cast his net over Badr and taking him carried him to the town mentally resolved to sell him for a high price On his way one of the townsfolk accosted him and said 
8500-258287-0035	train-other-500	For how much this fowl O fowler Quoth the fowler What wilt thou do with him an thou buy him
none	none	 Answered the other I will cut his throat and eat him whereupon said the birder Who could have the heart to kill this bird and eat him Verily I mean to present him to our King who will give me more than thou wouldest give me and will not kill him but will divert himself by gazing upon his beauty and grace for in all my life since I have been a fowler I never saw his like among land game or water fowl The utmost thou wouldst give me for him however much thou covet him would be a dirham and by Allah Almighty I will not sell him Then he carried the bird up to the King s palace and when the King saw it its beauty and grace pleased him and the red colour of its beak and legs So he sent an eunuch to buy it who accosted the fowler and said to him Wilt thou sell this bird Answered he Nay tis a gift from me to the King FN three hundred thirty three So the eunuch carried the bird to the King and told him what the man had said and he took it and gave the fowler ten dinars whereupon he kissed ground and fared forth Then the eunuch carried the bird to the palace 
8500-258287-0036	train-other-500	and placing him in a fine cage hung him up after setting meat and drink by him When the King came down from the Divan he said to the eunuch Where is the bird Bring it to me that I may look upon it for by Allah tis beautiful
8500-258287-0037	train-other-500	So the eunuch brought the cage and set it between the hands of the King who looked and seeing the food untouched said By Allah I wis not what it will eat that I may nourish it Then he called for food
none	none	 and they laid the tables and the King ate Now when the bird saw the flesh and meats and fruits and sweet meats he ate of all that was upon the trays before the King whereat the Sovran 
8500-258287-0038	train-other-500	and all the bystanders marvelled and the King said to his attendants eunuchs and Mamelukes In all my life I never saw a bird eat as doth this bird Then he sent an eunuch to fetch his wife that she might enjoy looking upon the bird
8500-258287-0039	train-other-500	and he went in to summon her and said O my lady the King desireth thy presence that thou mayst divert thyself with the sight of a bird he hath bought When we set on the food
8500-258287-0040	train-other-500	it flew down from its cage and perching on the table
none	none	 ate of all that was thereon 
8500-258287-0041	train-other-500	So arise O my lady and solace thee with the sight for it is goodly of aspect and is a wonder of the wonders of the age Hearing these words she came in haste but when she noted the bird
none	none	 she veiled her face and turned to fare away The King rose up and looking at her asked Why dost thou veil thy face when there is none in presence save the women and eunuchs who wait on thee and thy husband 
8500-258287-0042	train-other-500	Answered she O King
none	none	 this bird is no bird but a man like thyself He rejoined Thou liest 
8500-258287-0043	train-other-500	this is too much of a jest How should he be other than a bird and she O King by Allah I do not jest with thee
none	none	 nor do I tell thee aught but the truth for verily this bird is King Badr Basim son of King Shahriman Lord of the land of the Persians and his mother is Julnar the Sea born And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Seven Hundred and Fifty first Night She continued It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the King s wife said to the King Verily this is no bird but a man like thyself he is King Badr Basim son of King Shariman and his mother is Julnar the Sea born quoth the King And how came he in this shape and quoth she Princess Jauharah daughter of King Al Samandal hath enchanted him and told him all that had passed with King Badr Basim from first to last FN three hundred thirty four The King marvelled exceedingly at his wife s words and conjured her on his life to free Badr from his enchantment for she was the notablest enchantress of her age and not leave him in torment saying May Almighty Allah cut off Jauharah s hand for a foul witch as she is How little is her faith and how great her craft and perfidy Said the Queen Do thou say to him O Badr Basim enter yonder closet So the King bade him enter the closet and he went in obediently Then the Queen veiled her face and taking in her hand a cup of water FN three hundred thirty five entered the closet where she pronounced over the water certain incomprehensible words ending with By the virtue of these mighty names and holy verses and by the majesty of Allah Almighty Creator of heaven and earth the Quickener of the dead and Appointer of the means of daily bread and the terms determined quit this thy form wherein thou art and return to the shape in which the Lord created thee Hardly had she made an end of her words when the bird trembled once and became a man and the King saw before him a handsome youth than whom on earth s face was none goodlier But when King Badr Basim found himself thus restored to his own form he cried There is no god but the God and Mohammed is the Apostle of God Glory be to the Creator of all creatures and Provider of their provision and Ordainer of their life terms preordained Then he kissed the King s hand and wished him long life and the King kissed his head and said to him O Badr Basim tell me thy history from commencement to conclusion So he told him his whole tale concealing naught and the King marvelled thereat and said to him O Badr Basim Allah hath saved thee from the spell but what hath thy judgment decided and what thinkest thou to do Replied he O King of the Age I desire thy bounty that thou equip me a ship with a company of thy servants and all that is needful for tis long since I have been absent and I dread lest the kingdom depart from me And I misdoubt me my mother is dead of grief for my loss and this doubt is the stronger for that she knoweth not what is come of me nor whether I am alive or dead Wherefore I beseech thee O King to crown thy favours to me by granting me what I seek The King after beholding the beauty and grace of Badr Basim and listening to his sweet speech said I hear and obey So he fitted him out a ship to which he transported all that was needful and which he manned with a company of his servants and Badr Basim set sail in it after having taken leave of the King They sailed over the sea ten successive days with a favouring wind but on the eleventh day the ocean became troubled with exceeding trouble the ship rose and fell and the sailors were powerless to govern her So they drifted at the mercy of the waves till the craft neared a rock in mid sea which fell upon her FN three hundred thirty six and broke her up and all on board were drowned save King Badr Basim who got astride one of the planks of the vessel after having been nigh upon destruction The plank ceased not to be borne by the set of the sea whilst he knew not whither he went and had no means of directing its motion as the wind and waves wrought for three whole days But on the fourth the plank grounded with him on the sea shore where he sighted a white city as it were a dove passing white builded upon a tongue of land that jutted out into the deep and it was goodly of ordinance with high towers and lofty walls against which the waves beat When Badr Basim saw this he rejoiced with exceeding joy for he was well nigh dead of hunger and thirst and dismounting from the plank would have gone up the beach to the city but there came down to him mules and asses and horses in number as the see sends and fell to striking at him and staying him from landing So he swam round to the back of the city where he waded to shore and entering the place found none therein and marvelled at this saying Would I knew to whom cloth this city belong wherein is no lord nor any liege and whence came these mules and asses and horses that hindered me from landing And he mused over his case Then he walked on at hazard till he espied an old man a grocer FN three hundred thirty seven So he saluted him and the other returned his salam and seeing him to be a handsome young man said to him O youth whence comest thou and what brought thee to this city Badr told him his story at which the old man marvelled and said O my son didst thou see any on thy way He replied Indeed O my father I wondered in good sooth to sight a city void of folk Quoth the Shaykh my son come up into the shop lest thou perish So Badr Basim went up into the shop and sat down whereupon the old man set before him somewhat of food saying O my son enter the inner shop glory be to Him who hath preserved thee from yonder she Sathanas King Badr Basim was sore affrighted at the grocer s words but he ate his fill and washed his hands then glanced at his host and said to him O my lord what is the meaning of these words Verily thou hast made me fearful of this city and its folk Replied the old man Know O my son that this is the City of the Magicians and its Queen is as she were She Satan a sorceress and a mighty enchantress passing crafty and perfidious exceedingly All thou sawest of horses and mules and asses were once sons of Adam like thee and me they were also strangers for whoever entereth this city being a young man like thyself this miscreant witch taketh him and hometh him for forty days after which she enchanteth him and he becometh a mule or a horse or an ass of those animals thou sawest on the sea shore And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Seven Hundred and Fifty second Night She pursued It hath reached me O auspicious King that the old grocer related to King Badr Basim the history of the enchantress ending with All these people hath she spelled and when it was thy intent to land they feared lest thou be transmewed like themselves so they counselled thee by signs that said Land not of their solicitude for thee fearing that haply she should do with thee like as she had done with them She possessed herself of this city and seized it from its citizens by sorcery and her name is Queen Lab which being interpreted meaneth in Arabic Almanac of the Sun FN three hundred thirty eight When Badr Basim heard what the old man said he was affrighted with sore affright and trembled like reed in wind saying in himself Hardly do I feel me free from the affliction wherein I was by reason of sorcery when Destiny casteth me into yet sorrier case And he fell a musing over his condition and that which had betided him When the Shaykh looked at him and saw the violence of his terror he said to him O my son come sit at the threshold of the shop and look upon yonder creatures and upon their dress and complexion and that wherein they are by reason of gramarye and dread not for the Queen and all in the city love and tender me and will not vex my heart or trouble my mind So King Badr Basim came out and sat at the shop door looking out upon the folk and there passed by him a world of creatures without number But when the people saw him they accosted the grocer and said to him O elder is this thy captive and thy prey gotten in these days The old man replied He is my brother s son I heard that his father was dead so I sent for him and brought him here that I might quench with him the fire of my home sickness Quoth they Verily he is a comely youth but we fear for him from Queen Lab lest she turn on thee with treachery and take him from thee for she loveth handsome young men Quoth the Shaykh The Queen will not gainsay my commandment for she loveth and tendereth me and when she shall know that he is my brother s son she will not molest him or afflict me in him neither trouble my heart on his account Then King Badr Basim abode some months with the grocer eating and drinking and the old man loved him with exceeding love One day as he sat in the shop according to his custom behold there came up a thousand eunuchs with drawn swords and clad in various kinds of raiment and girt with jewelled girdles all rode Arabian steeds and bore in baldrick Indian blades They saluted the grocer as they passed his shop and were followed by a thousand damsels like moons clad in various raiments of silks and satins fringed with gold and embroidered with jewels of sorts and spears were slung to their shoulders In their midst rode a damsel mounted on a Rabite mare saddled with a saddle of gold set with various kinds of jewels and jacinths and they reached in a body the Shaykh s shop The damsels saluted him and passed on till lo and behold up came Queen Lab in great state and seeing King Badr Basim sitting in the shop as he were the moon at its full was amazed at his beauty and loveliness and became passionately enamoured of him and distraught with desire of him So she alighted and sitting down by King Badr Basim said to the old man Whence hadst thou this handsome one and the Shaykh replied He is my brother s son and is lately come to me Quoth Lab Let him be with me this night that I may talk with him and quoth the old man Wilt thou take him from me and not enchant him Said she Yes and said he Swear to me So she sware to him that she would not do him any hurt or ensorcell him and bidding bring him a fine horse saddled and bridled with a golden bridle and decked with trappings all of gold set with jewels gave the old man a thousand dinars saying Use this FN three hundred thirty nine Then she took Badr Basim and carried him off as he were the full moon on its fourteenth night whilst all the folk seeing his beauty were grieved for him and said By Allah verily this youth deserveth not to be bewitched by yonder sorceress the accursed Now King Badr Basim heard all they said but was silent committing his case to Allah Almighty till they came to And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Seven Hundred and Fifty third Night She resumed It hath reached me O auspicious King that King Badr Basim ceased not faring with Queen Lab and her suite till they came to her palace gate where the Emirs and eunuchs and Lords of the realm took foot and she bade the Chamberlains dismiss her Officers and Grandees who kissed ground and went away whilst she entered the palace with Badr Basim and her eunuchs and women Here he found a place whose like he had never seen at all for it was builded of gold and in its midst was a great basin brimfull of water midmost a vast flower garden He looked at the garden and saw it abounding in birds of various kinds and colours warbling in all manner tongues and voices pleasurable and plaintive And everywhere he beheld great state and dominion and said Glory be to God who of His bounty and long suffering provideth those who serve other than Himself The Queen sat down at a latticed window overlooking the garden on a couch of ivory whereon was a high bed and King Badr Basim seated himself by her side She kissed him and pressing him to her breast bade her women bring a tray of food So they brought a tray of red gold inlaid with pearls and jewels and spread with all manner of viands and he and she ate till they were satisfied and washed their hands after which the waiting women set on flagons of gold and silver and glass together with all kinds of flowers and dishes of dried fruits Then the Queen summoned the singing women and there came ten maidens as they were moons bending all manner of musical instruments Queen Lab crowned a cup and drinking it off filled another and passed it to King Badr Basim who took and drank and they ceased not to drink till they had their sufficiency Then she bade the damsels sing and they sang all manner modes till it seemed to Badr Basim as if the palace danced with him for joy His sense was ecstasied and his breast broadened and he forgot his strangerhood and said in himself Verily this Queen is young and beautiful FN three hundred forty and I will never leave her for her kingdom is vaster than my kingdom and she is fairer than Princess Jauharah So he ceased not to drink with her till even tide came when they lighted the lamps and waxen candles and diffused censer perfumes nor did they leave drinking till they were both drunken and the singing women sang the while Then Queen Lab being in liquor rose from her seat and lay down on a bed and dismissing her women called to Badr Basim to come and sleep by her side So he lay with her in all delight of life till the morning And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Seven Hundred and Fifty fourth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the Queen awoke she repaired to the Hammam bath in the palace King Badr Basim being with her and they bathed and were purified after which she clad him in the finest of raiment and called for the service of wine So the waiting women brought the drinking gear and they drank Presently the Queen arose and taking Badr Basim by the hand sat down with him on chairs and bade bring food whereof they ate and washed their hands Then the damsels fetched the drinking gear and fruits and flowers and confections and they ceased not to eat and drink FN three hundred forty one whilst the singing girls sang various airs till the evening They gave not over eating and drinking and merry making for a space of forty days when the Queen said to him O Badr Basim say me whether is the more pleasant this place or the shop of thine uncle the grocer He replied By Allah O Queen this is the pleasenter for my uncle is but a beggarly man who vendeth pot herbs She laughed at his words and the twain lay together in the pleasantest of case till the morning when King Badr Basim awoke from sleep and found not Queen Lab by his side so he said Would Heaven I knew where can she have gone And indeed he was troubled at her absence and perplexed about the case for she stayed away from him a great while and did not return so he donned his dress and went seeking her but not finding her and he said to himself Haply she is gone to the flower garden Thereupon he went out into the garden and came to a running rill beside which he saw a white she bird and on the stream bank a tree full of birds of various colours and he stood and watched the birds without their seeing him And behold a black bird flew down upon that white she bird and fell to billing her pigeon fashion then he leapt on her and trod her three consecutive times after which the bird changed and became a woman Badr looked at her and lo it was Queen Lab So he knew that the black bird was a man transmewed and that she was enamoured of him and had transformed herself into a bird that he might enjoy her wherefore jealousy got hold upon him and he was wroth with the Queen because of the black bird Then he returned to his place and lay down on the carpet bed and after an hour or so she came back to him and fell to kissing him and jesting with him but being sore incensed against her he answered her not a word She saw what was to do with him and was assured that he had witnessed what befel her when she was a white bird and was trodden by the black bird yet she discovered naught to him but concealed what ailed her When he had done her need he said to her O Queen I would have thee give me leave to go to my uncle s shop for I long after him and have not seen him these forty days She replied Go to him but tarry not from me for I cannot brook to be parted from thee nor can I endure without thee an hour He said I hear and I obey and mounting rode to the shop of the Shaykh the grocer who welcomed him and rose to him and embracing him said to him How hast thou fared with yonder idolatress He replied I was well in health and happiness till this last night and told him what had passed in the garden with the black bird FN three hundred forty two Now when the old man heard his words he said Beware of her for know that the birds upon the tree were all young men and strangers whom she loved and enchanted and turned into birds That black bird thou sawest was one of her Mamelukes whom she loved with exceeding love till he cast his eyes upon one of her women wherefore she changed him into a black bird And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Seven Hundred and Fifty fifth Night She continued It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Badr Basim acquainted the old grocer with all the doings of Queen Lab and what he had seen of her proceedings the Shaykh gave him to know that all the birds upon the tree were young men and strangers whom she had enchanted and that the black bird was one of her Mamelukes whom she had transmewed And continued the Shaykh whenas she lusteth after him she transformeth herself into a she bird that he may enjoy her for she still loveth him with passionate love When she found that thou knewest of her case she plotted evil against thee for she loveth thee not wholly But no harm shall betide thee from her so long as I protect thee therefore fear nothing for I am a Moslem by name Abdallah and there is none in my day more magical than I yet do I not make use of gramarye save upon constraint Many a time have I put to naught the sorceries of yonder accursed and delivered folk from her and I care not for her because she can do me no hurt nay she feareth me with exceeding fear as do all in the city who like her are magicians and serve the fire not the Omnipotent Sire So to morrow come thou to me and tell me what she doth with thee for this very night she will cast about to destroy thee and I will tell thee how thou shalt do with her that thou mayst save thyself from her malice Then King Badr Basim farewelled the Shaykh and returned to the Queen whom he found awaiting him When she saw him she rose and seating him and welcoming him brought him meat and drink and the two ate till they had enough and washed their hands after which she called for wine and they drank till the night was well nigh half spent when she plied him with cup after cup till he was drunken and lost sense FN three hundred forty three and wit When she saw him thus she said to him I conjure thee by Allah and by whatso thou worshippest if I ask thee a question wilt thou inform me rightly and answer me truly And he being drunken answered Yes O my lady Quoth she O my lord and light of mine eyes when thou awokest last night and foundest me not thou soughtest me till thou sawest me in the garden under the guise of a white she bird and also thou sawest the black bird leap on me and tread me Now I will tell the truth of this matter That black bird was one of my Mamelukes whom I loved with exceeding love but one day he cast his eyes upon a certain of my slave girls wherefore jealousy gat hold upon me and I transformed him by my spells into a black bird and her I slew But now I cannot endure without him a single hour so whenever I lust after him I change myself into a she bird and go to him that he may leap me and enjoy me even as thou hast seen Art thou not therefore incensed against me because of this albeit by the virtue of Fire and Light Shade and Heat I love thee more than ever and have made thee my portion of the world He answered being drunken Thy conjecture of the cause of my rage is correct and it had no reason other than this With this she embraced him and kissed him and made great show of love to him then she lay down to sleep and he by her side Presently about midnight she rose from the carpet bed and King Badr Basim was awake but he feigned sleep and watched stealthily to see what she would do She took out of a red bag a something red which she planted a middlemost the chamber and it became a stream running like the sea after which she took a handful of barley and strewing it on the ground watered it with water from the river whereupon it became wheat in the ear and she gathered it and ground it into flour Then she set it aside and returning to bed lay down by Badr Basim till morning when he arose and washed his face and asked her leave to visit the Shaykh his uncle She gave him permission and he repaired to Abdallah and told him what had passed The old man laughed and said By Allah this miscreant witch plotteth mischief against thee but reck thou not of her ever Then he gave him a pound of parched corn FN three hundred forty four and said to him Take this with thee and know that when she seeth it she will ask thee What is this and what wilt thou do with it Do thou answer Abundance of good things is good and eat of it Then will she bring forth to thee parched grain of her own and say to thee Eat of this Sawik and do thou feign to her that thou eatest thereof but eat of this instead and beware and have a care lest thou eat of hers even a grain for an thou eat so much as a grain thereof her spells will have power over thee and she will enchant thee and say to thee Leave this form of a man Whereupon thou wilt quit thine own shape for what shape she will But an thou eat not thereof her enchantments will be null and void and no harm will betide thee therefrom whereat she will be shamed with shame exceeding and say to thee I did but jest with thee Then will she make a show of love and fondness to thee but this will all be but hypocrisy in her and craft And do thou also make a show of love to her and say to her O my lady and light of mine eyes eat of this parched barley and see how delicious it is And if she eat thereof though it be but a grain take water in thy hand and throw it in her face saying Quit this human form for what form soever thou wilt have her take Then leave her and come to me and I will counsel thee what to do So Badr Basim took leave of him and returning to the palace went in to the Queen who said to him Welcome and well come and good cheer to thee And she rose and kissed him saying Thou hast tarried long from me O my lord He replied I have been with my uncle and he gave me to eat of this Sawik Quoth she We have better than that Then she laid his parched Sawik in one plate and hers in another and said to him Eat of this for tis better than thine So he feigned to eat of it and when she thought he had done so she took water in her hand and sprinkled him therewith saying Quit this form O thou gallows bird thou miserable and take that of a mule one eyed and foul of favour But he changed not which when she saw she arose and went up to him and kissed him between the eyes saying O my beloved I did but jest with thee bear me no malice because of this Quoth he O my lady I bear thee no whit of malice nay I am assured that thou lovest me but eat of this my parched barley So she ate a mouthful of Abdallah s Sawik but no sooner had it settled in her stomach than she was convulsed and King Badr Basim took water in his palm and threw it in her face saying Quit this human form and take that of a dapple mule No sooner had he spoken than she found herself changed into a she mule whereupon the tears rolled down her cheeks and she fell to rubbing her muzzle against his feet Then he would have bridled her but she would not take the bit so he left her and going to the grocer told him what had passed Abdallah brought out for him a bridle and bade him rein her forthwith So he took it to the palace and when she saw him she came up to him and he set the bit in her mouth and mounting her rode forth to find the Shaykh But when the old man saw her he rose and said to her Almighty Allah confound thee O accursed woman Then quoth he to Badr O my son there is no more tarrying for thee in this city so ride her and fare with her whither thou wilt and beware lest thou commit the bridle FN three hundred forty five to any King Badr thanked him and farewelling him fared on three days without ceasing till he drew near another city and there met him an old man gray headed and comely who said to him Whence comest thou O my son Badr replied From the city of this witch and the old man said Thou art my guest to night He consented and went with him but by the way behold they met an old woman who wept when she saw the mule and said There is no god but the God Verily this mule resembleth my son s she mule which is dead and my heart acheth for her so Allah upon thee O my lord do thou sell her to me He replied By Allah O my mother I cannot sell her But she cried Allah upon thee do not refuse my request for my son will surely be a dead man except I buy him this mule And she importuned him till he exclaimed I will not sell her save for a thousand dinars saying in himself Whence should this old woman get a thousand gold pieces Thereupon she brought out from her girdle a purse containing a thousand ducats which when King Badr Basim saw he said O my mother I did but jest with thee I cannot sell her But the old man looked at him and said O my son in this city none may lie for whoso lieth they put to death So King Badr Basim lighted down from the mule And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Seven Hundred and Fifty sixth Night She pursued It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Badr Basim dismounted from and delivered the mule to the old woman she drew the bit from her mouth and taking water in her hand sprinkled the mule therewith saying O my daughter quit this shape for that form wherein thou wast aforetime Upon this she was straightway restored to her original semblance and the two women embraced and kissed each other So King Badr Basim knew that the old woman was Queen Lab s mother and that he had been tricked and would have fled when lo the old woman whistled a loud whistle and her call was obeyed by an Ifrit as he were a great mountain whereat Badr was affrighted and stood still Then the old woman mounted on the Ifrit s back taking her daughter behind her and King Badr Basim before her and the Ifrit flew off with them nor was it a full hour ere they were in the palace of Queen Lab who sat down on the throne of kingship and said to Badr Gallows bird that thou art now am I come hither and have attained to that I desired and soon will I show thee how I will do with thee and with yonder old man the grocer How many favours have I shown him Yet he cloth me frowardness for thou hast not attained thine end but by means of him Then she took water and sprinkled him therewith saying Quit the shape wherein thou art for the form of a foul favoured fowl the foulest of all fowls and she set him in a cage and cut off from him meat and drink but one of her women seeing this cruelty took compassion on him and gave him food and water without her knowledge One day the damsel took her mistress at unawares and going forth the palace repaired to the old grocer to whom she told the whole case saying Queen Lab is minded to make an end of thy brother s son The Shaykh thanked her and said There is no help but that I take the city from her and make thee Queen thereof in her stead Then he whistled a loud whistle and there came forth to him an Ifrit with four wings to whom he said Take up this damsel and carry her to the city of Julnar the Sea born and her mother Farashah FN three hundred forty six for they twain are the most powerful magicians on face of earth And he said to the damsel When thou comest thither tell them that King Badr Basim is Queen Lab s captive Then the Ifrit took up his load and flying off with her in a little while set her down upon the terrace roof of Queen Julnar s palace So she descended and going in to the Queen kissed the earth and told her what had passed to her son first and last whereupon Julnar rose to her and entreated her with honour and thanked her Then she let beat the drums in the city and acquainted her lieges and the lords of her realm with the good news that King Badr Basim was found after which she and her mother Farashah and her brother Salih assembled all the tribes of the Jinn and the troops of the main for the Kings of the Jinn obeyed them since the taking of King Al Samandal Presently they all flew up into the air and lighting down on the city of the sorceress sacked the town and the palace and slew all the Unbelievers therein in the twinkling of an eye Then said Julnar to the damsel Where is my son And the slave girl brought her the cage and signing to the bird within cried This is thy son So Julnar took him forth of the cage and sprinkled him with water saying Quit this shape for the form wherein thou wast aforetime nor had she made an end of her speech ere he shook and became a man as before whereupon his mother seeing him restored to human shape embraced him and he wept with sore weeping On like wise did his uncle Salih and his grandmother and the daughters of his uncle and fell to kissing his hands and feet Then Julnar sent for Shaykh Abdallah and thanking him for his kind dealing with her son married him to the damsel whom he had despatched to her with news of him and made him King of the city Moreover she summoned those who survived of the citizens and they were Moslems and made them swear fealty to him and take the oath of loyalty whereto they replied Hearkening and obedience Then she and her company farewelled him and returned to their own capital The townsfolk came out to meet them with drums beating and decorated the place three days and held high festival of the greatness of their joy for the return of their King Badr Basim After this Badr said to his mother O my mother naught remains but that I marry and we be all united She replied Right is thy rede O my son but wait till we ask who befitteth thee among the daughters of the Kings And his grandmother Farashah and the daughters of both his uncles said O Badr Basim we will help thee to win thy wish forthright Then each of them arose and fared forth questing in the lands whilst Julnar sent out her waiting women on the necks of Ifrits bidding them leave not a city nor a King s palace without noting all the handsome girls that were therein But when King Badr Basim saw the trouble they were taking in this matter he said to Julnar O my mother leave this thing for none will content me save Jauharah daughter of King Al Samandal for that she is indeed a jewel FN three hundred forty seven according to her name Replied Julnar I know that which thou seekest and bade forthright bring Al Samandal the King As soon as he was present she sent for Badr Basim and acquainted him with the King s coming whereupon he went in to him Now when Al Samandal was aware of his presence he rose to him and saluted him and bade him welcome and King Badr Basim demanded of him his daughter Jauharah in marriage Quoth he She is thine handmaid and at thy service and disposition and despatched some of his suite bidding them seek her abode and after telling her that her sire was in the hands of King Badr Basim to bring her forthright So they flew up into the air and disappeared and they returned after a while with the Princess who as soon as she saw her father went up to him and threw her arms round his neck Then looking at her he said O my daughter know that I have given thee in wedlock to this magnanimous Sovran and valiant lion King Badr Basim son of Queen Julnar the Sea born for that he is the goodliest of the folk of his day and most powerful and the most exalted of them in degree and the noblest in rank he befitteth none but thee and thou none but him Answered she I may not gainsay thee O my sire do as thou wilt for indeed chagrin and despite are at an end and I am one of his handmaids So they summoned the Kazi and the witnesses who drew up the marriage contract between King Badr Basim and the Princess Jauharah and the citizens decorated the city and beat the drums of rejoicing and they released all who were in the jails whilst the King clothed the widows and the orphans and bestowed robes of honour upon the Lords of the Realm and Emirs and Grandees and they made bride feasts and held high festival night and morn ten days at the end of which time they displayed the bride in nine different dresses before King Badr Basim who bestowed an honourable robe upon King Al Samandal and sent him back to his country and people and kinsfolk And they ceased not from living the most delectable of life and the most solaceful of days eating and drinking and enjoying every luxury till there came to them the Destroyer of delights and the Sunderer of Societies and this is the end of their story FN three hundred forty eight may Allah have mercy on them all Moreover O auspicious King a tale is also told anent KING MOHAMMED BIN SABAIK AND THE MERCHANT HASAN There was once in days of yore and in ages and times long gone before a King of the Kings of the Persians by name Mohammed bin Sabaik who ruled over Khorasan land and used every year to go on razzia into the countries of the Miscreants in Hind and Sind and China and the lands of Mawarannahr beyond the Oxus and other regions of the barbarians and what not else He was a just King a valiant and a generous and loved table talk FN three hundred forty nine and tales and verses and anecdotes and histories and entertaining stories and legends of the ancients Whoso knew a rare recital and related it to him in such fashion as to please him he would bestow on him a sumptuous robe of honour and clothe him from head to foot and give him a thousand dinars and mount him on a horse saddled and bridled besides other great gifts and the man would take all this and wend his way Now it chanced that one day there came an old man before him and related to him a rare story which pleased the King and made him marvel so he ordered him a magnificent present amongst other things a thousand dinars of Khorasan and a horse with its housings and trappings After this the bruit of the King s munificence was blazed abroad in all countries and there heard of him a man Hasan the Merchant hight who was a generous open handed and learned a scholar and an accomplished poet Now the King had an envious Wazir a multum in parvo of ill loving no man rich nor poor and whoso came before the King and he gave him aught he envied him and said Verily this fashion annihilateth wealth and ruineth the land and such is the custom of the King But this was naught save envy and despite in that Minister Presently the King heard talk of Hasan the Merchant and sending for him said to him as soon as he came into the presence O Merchant Hasan this Wazir of mine vexeth and thwarteth me concerning the money I give to poets and boon companions and story tellers and glee men and I would have thee tell me a goodly history and a rare story such as I have never before heard An it please me I will give thee lands galore with their forts in free tenure in addition to thy fiefs and untaxed lands besides which I will put my whole kingdom in thy hands and make thee my Chief Wazir so shalt thy sit on my right hand and rule my subjects But an thou bring me not that which I bid thee I will take all that is thy hand and banish thee my realm Replied Hasan Hearkening and obedience to our lord the King But thy slave beseecheth thee to have patience with him a year then will he tell thee a tale such as thou hast never in thy life heard neither hath other than thou heard its like not to say a better than it Quoth the King I grant thee a whole year s delay And he called for a costly robe of honour wherein he robed Hasan saying Keep thy house and mount not horse neither go nor come for a year s time till thou bring me that I seek of thee An thou bring it especial favour awaiteth thee and thou mayst count upon that which I have promised thee but an thou bring it not thou art not of us nor are we of thee And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Seven Hundred and Fifty seventh Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King 
8590-258290-0000	train-other-500	that when King Mohammed son of Sabaik said to Hasan the Merchant An thou bring me that I seek of thee especial favour awaiteth thee and thou mayest now rejoice in that which I have promised thee but an thou bring it not
8590-258290-0001	train-other-500	thou art not of us nor are we of thee Hasan kissed ground before the King and went out from the presence Then he chose five of the best of his Mamelukes who could all write and read and were learned intelligent accomplished
8590-258290-0002	train-other-500	and he gave each of them five thousand dinars saying I reared you not save for the like of this day so do ye help me to further the King s desire and deliver me from his hand Quoth they What wilt thou have us do
8590-258290-0003	train-other-500	Our lives be thy ransom Quoth he I wish you to go each to a different country and seek out diligently the learned and erudite and literate and the tellers of wondrous stories and marvellous histories
8590-258290-0004	train-other-500	and do your endeavour to procure me the story of Sayf al Muluk If ye find it with any one pay him what price soever he asketh for it although he demand a thousand dinars give him what ye may and promise him the rest
8590-258290-0005	train-other-500	and bring me the story for whoso happeneth on it and bringeth it to me I will bestow on him a costly robe of honour and largesse galore and there shall be to me none more worshipped than he

8590-258290-0006	train-other-500	Hie thou to Al Hind and Al Sind and all their provinces and dependencies To another Hie thou to the home of the Persians and to China and her climates To the third Hie thou to the land of Khorasan with its districts
8590-258290-0007	train-other-500	To the fourth Hie thou to Mauritania and all its regions districts provinces and quarters And to the fifth Hie thou to Syria and Egypt and their outliers Moreover he chose them out an auspicious day and said to them
8590-258290-0008	train-other-500	Fare ye forth this day and be diligent in the accomplishment of my need and be not slothful though the case cost you your lives So they farewelled him and departed each taking the direction perscribed to him
8590-258290-0009	train-other-500	Now four of them were absent four months and searched but found nothing so they returned and told their master whose breast was straitened that they had ransacked towns and cities and countries for the thing he sought but had happened upon naught thereof
8590-258290-0010	train-other-500	Meanwhile the fifth servant journeyed till he came to the land of Syria and entered Damascus which he found a pleasant city and a secure abounding in trees and rills leas and fruiteries
8590-258290-0011	train-other-500	and birds chanting the praises of Allah the One the All powerful of sway Creator of Night and Day Here he tarried some time asking for his master s desire but non answered him
8590-258290-0012	train-other-500	wherefore he was on the point of departing thence to another place when he met a young man running and stumbling over his skirts So he asked of him Wherefore runnest thou in such eagerness
none	none	 and whither dost thou press And he answered There is an elder here a man of learning who every day at this time taketh his seat on a stool FN three hundred fifty and relateth tales and stories and delectable anecdotes whereof never heard any the like and I am running to get me a place near him and fear I shall find no room because of the much folk Quoth the Mameluke Take me with thee and quoth the youth Make haste in thy walking So he shut his door and hastened with him to the place of recitation 
8590-258290-0013	train-other-500	where he saw an old man of bright favour seated on a stool holding forth to the folk He sat down near him and addressed himself to hear his story till the going down of the sun when the old man made an end of his tale and the people having heard it all
8590-258290-0014	train-other-500	dispersed from about him whereupon the Mameluke accosted him and saluted him and he returned his salam and greeted him with the utmost worship and courtesy Then said the messenger to him O my lord Shaykh thou art a comely and reverend man
none	none	 and thy discourse is goodly but I would fain ask thee of somewhat 
8590-258290-0015	train-other-500	Replied the old man Ask of what thou wilt
none	none	 Then said the Mameluke Hast thou the story of Sayf al Muluk and Badi a al Jamal 
8590-258290-0016	train-other-500	Rejoined the elder And who told thee of this story and informed thee thereof Answered the messenger None told me of it but I am come from a far country in quest of this tale and I will pay thee whatever thou askest for its price if thou have it
8590-258290-0017	train-other-500	and wilt of thy bounty and charity impart it to me and make it an alms to me of the generosity of thy nature for had I my life in my hand and lavished it upon thee for this thing yet were it pleasing to my heart
8590-258290-0018	train-other-500	Replied the old man Be of good cheer and keep thine eye cool and clear thou shalt have it but this is no story that one telleth in the beaten highway nor do I give it to every one Cried the other
8590-258290-0019	train-other-500	By Allah O my lord do not grudge it me but ask of me what price thou wilt And the old man If thou wish for the history give me an hundred dinars and thou shalt have it but upon five conditions
none	none	 Now when the Mameluke knew that the old man had the story and was willing to sell it to him he joyed with exceeding joy and said I will give thee the hundred dinars by way of price and ten to boot as a gratuity and take it on the conditions of which thou speakest Said the old man Then go and fetch the gold pieces and take that thou seekest So the messenger kissed his hands and joyful and happy returned to his lodging where he laid an hundred and ten dinars FN three hundred fifty one in a purse he had by him As soon as morning morrowed 
8590-258290-0020	train-other-500	he donned his clothes and taking the dinars repaired to the story teller whom he found seated at the door of his house So he saluted him and the other returned his salam Then he gave him the gold and the old man took it and carrying the messenger into his house
none	none	 made him sit down in a convenient place when he set before him ink case and reed pen and paper and giving him a book said to him Write out what thou seekest of the night story FN three hundred fifty two of Sayf al Muluk from this book Accordingly the Mameluke fell to work and wrote till he had made an end of his copy when he read it to the old man and he corrected it and presently said to him Know O my son that my five conditions are as follows firstly that thou tell not this story in the beaten high road 
8590-258290-0021	train-other-500	nor before women and slave girls nor to black slaves nor feather heads nor again to boys but read it only before Kings and Emirs and Wazirs and men of learning such as expounders of the Koran and others
8590-258290-0022	train-other-500	Thereupon the messenger accepted the conditions and kissing the old man shand took leave of him and fared forth And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say
8590-258290-0023	train-other-500	When it was the Seven Hundred and Fifty eighth Night She continued It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the Mameluke of Hasan the Merchant
8590-258290-0024	train-other-500	had copied the tale out of the book belonging to the old man of Damascus and had accepted his conditions and farewelled him he fared forth on the same day glad and joyful and journeyed on diligently of the excess of his contentment
8590-258290-0025	train-other-500	for that he had gotten the story of Sayf al Muluk till he came to his own country when he despatched his servant to bear the good news to his master and say to him Thy Mameluke is come back in safety and hath won his will and his aim
8590-258290-0026	train-other-500	Now of the term appointed between Hasan and the King there wanted but ten days Then after taking rest in his own quarters he himself went in to the Merchant and told him all that had befallen him
8590-258290-0027	train-other-500	and gave him the book containing the story of Sayf al Muluk and Badi a al Jamal
none	none	 when Hasan joyed with exceeding joy at the sight 
8590-258290-0028	train-other-500	and bestowed on him all the clothes he had on and gave him ten thoroughbred horses and the like number of camels and mules and three negro chattels and two white slaves Then Hasan took the book and copied out the story plainly in his own hand
8590-258290-0029	train-other-500	after which he presented himself before the King and said to him O thou auspicious King I have brought thee a night story and a rarely pleasant relation whose like none ever heard at all When these words reached the King s ear
none	none	 he sent forthright for all the Emirs 
8590-258290-0030	train-other-500	who were men of understanding and all the learned doctors and folk of erudition and culture and poets and wits and Hasan sat down and read the history before the King who marvelled thereat and approved it as did all who were present
8590-258290-0031	train-other-500	and they showered gold and silver and jewels upon the Merchant Moreover the King bestowed on him a costly robe of honour of the richest of his raiment
none	none	 and gave him a great city with its castles and outliers and he appointed him one of his Chief Wazirs and seated him on his right hand Then he caused the scribes write the story in letters of gold and lay it up in his privy treasures and whenever his breast was straitened he would summon Hasan and he would read him the story FN three hundred fifty three which was as follows Story of Prince Sayf al Muluk and the Princess Badi a al Jamal There was once in days of old and in ages and times long told a King in Egypt called Asim bin Safwan FN three hundred fifty four who was a liberal and beneficent sovran venerable and majestic He owned many cities and sconces and fortresses and troops and warriors and had a Wazir named Faris bin Salih FN three hundred fifty five and he and all his subjects worshipped the sun and the fire instead of the All powerful Sire the Glorious the Victorious Now this King was become a very old man weakened and wasted with age and sickness and decrepitude for he had lived an hundred and fourscore years 
8590-258290-0032	train-other-500	and had no child male or female by reason whereof he was ever in cark and care from morning to night and from night to morn
8590-258290-0033	train-other-500	It so happened that one day of the days he was sitting on the throne of his Kingship with his Emirs and Wazirs and Captains and Grandees in attendance on him according to their custom in their several stations
8590-258290-0034	train-other-500	and whenever there came in an Emir who had with him a son or two sons or haply three
none	none	 who stood at the sides of their sires 
8590-258290-0035	train-other-500	the King envied him and said in himself
none	none	 Every one of these is happy and rejoiceth in his children whilst I I have no child and to morrow I die and leave my reign and throne and lands and hoards and strangers will take them and none will bear me in memory nor will there remain any mention of me in the world Then he became drowned in the sea of thought and for the much thronging of griefs and anxieties upon his hear like travellers faring for the well he shed tears and descending from his throne sat down upon the floor FN three hundred fifty six weeping and humbling himself before the Lord 
8590-258290-0036	train-other-500	Now when the Wazir and notables of the realm and others who were present in the assembly saw him do thus with his royal person they feared for their lives and let the poursuivants cry aloud to the lieges saying
none	none	 Hie ye to your homes and rest till the King recover 
8590-258290-0037	train-other-500	from what aileth him So they went away leaving none in the presence save the Minister who as soon as the King came to himself kissed ground between his hands and said O King of the Age and the Time wherefore this weeping and wailing
8590-258290-0038	train-other-500	Tell me who hath transgressed against thee of the Kings or Castellans or Emirs or Grandees and inform me who hath thwarted thee O my liege lord that we may all fall on him and tear his soul from his two sides
none	none	 But he spake not neither raised his head whereupon the Minister kissed ground before him a second time and said to him O Master FN three hundred fifty seven I am even as thy son and thy slave nay I have reared thee yet know I not the cause of thy cark and chagrin and of this thy case and who should know but I who should stand in my stead between thy hands 
8590-258290-0039	train-other-500	Tell me therefore why this weeping and wherefore thine affliction Nevertheless the King neither opened his mouth nor raised his head but ceased not to weep and cry with a loud crying and lament with exceeding lamentation and ejaculate
8590-258290-0040	train-other-500	Alas The Wazir took patience with him awhile after which he said to him Except thou tell me the cause of this thine affliction I will set this sword to my heart and will slay myself before thine eyes rather than see thee
8590-258290-0041	train-other-500	thus distressed Then King Asim raised his head and wiping away his tears said O Minister of good counself and experience leave me to my care and my chagrin
8590-258290-0042	train-other-500	for that which is in my heart of sorrow sufficeth me But Faris said Tell me O King the cause of this thy weeping haply Allah will appoint thee relief at my hands
none	none	 And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say 
8590-258290-0043	train-other-500	When it was the Seven Hundred and Fifty ninth Night She pursued It hath reached me O auspicious King that the Wazir said to King Asim Tell me the cause of this thy weeping
8590-258290-0044	train-other-500	haply Allah shall appoint thee relief at my hands Replied the King O Wazir I weep not for monies nor horses nor kingdoms nor aught else but that I am become an old man yea very old
8590-258290-0045	train-other-500	nigh upon an hundred and fourscore years of age and I have not been blessed with a child male or female so when I die they will bury me and my trace will be effaced and my name cut off
8590-258290-0046	train-other-500	the stranger will take my throne and reign and none will ever make mention of my being Rejoined the Minister Faris O King of the Age I am older than thou by an hundred years
none	none	 yet have I never been blest with boon of child and cease not day and night 
8590-258290-0047	train-other-500	from cark and care and concern so how shall we do I and thou Quoth Asim
none	none	 O Wazir hast thou no device or shift in this matter and quoth the Minister Know O King that I have heard of a Sovran in the land of Saba FN three hundred fifty eight by name Solomon David son upon the twain be the Peace FN three hundred fifty nine who pretendeth to prophetship and avoucheth that he hath a mighty Lord who can do all things and whose kingdom is in the Heavens and who hath dominion over all mankind and birds and beasts and over the wind and the Jinn Moreover he kenneth the speech of birds and the language of every other created thing and withal he calleth all creatures to the worship of his Lord and discourseth to them of their service So let us send him a messenger in the King s name and seek of him our need beseeching him to put up prayer to his Lord that He vouchsafe each of us boon of issue If his Faith be soothfast and his Lord Omnipotent He will assuredly bless each of us with a child male or female and if the thing thus fall out we will enter his faith and worship his Lord else will we take patience and devise us another device 
8590-258290-0048	train-other-500	The King cried This is well seen and my breast is braodened by this thy speech but where shall we find a messenger befitting this grave matter for that this Solomon is no Kinglet and the approaching him is no light affair
8590-258290-0049	train-other-500	Indeed I will send him none on the like of this matter save thyself for thou art ancient and versed in all manner affairs and the like of thee is the like of myself wherefore I desire that thou weary thyself and journey to him
8590-258290-0050	train-other-500	and occupy thyself sedulously with accomplishing this matter so haply solace may be at thy hand The Minister said I hear and I obey but rise thou forthwith and seat thee upon the throne
8590-258290-0051	train-other-500	so the Emirs and Lords of the realm and officers and the lieges may enter applying themselves to thy service according to their custom for they all went away from thee troubled at heart on thine account
8590-258290-0052	train-other-500	Then will I go out and set forth on the Sovran s errand So the King arose forthright and sat down on the throne of his kingship whilst the Wazir went out and said to the Chamberlain
8590-258290-0053	train-other-500	Bid the folk proceed to their service as of their wont Accordingly the troops and Captains and Lords of the land entered after they had spread the tables and ate and drank and withdrew as was their wont
none	none	 after which the Wazir Faris went forth from King Asim 
8590-258290-0054	train-other-500	and repairing to his own house equipped himself for travel and returned to the King who opened to him the treasuries and provided him with rarities and things of price and rich stuffs and gear without compare
8590-258290-0055	train-other-500	such as nor Emir nor Wazir hath power to possess Moreover King Asim charged him to accost Solomon with reverence foregoing him with the salam but not exceeding in speech and continued he
8590-258290-0056	train-other-500	then do thou ask of him thy need and if he say tis granted return to us in haste for I shall be awaiting thee Accordingly the Minister kissed hands and took the presents and setting out fared on night and day
8590-258290-0057	train-other-500	till he came within fifteen days journey of Saba Meanwhile Allah extolled and exalted be He inspired Solomon the son of David the Peace be upon both and said to him O Solomon
8590-258290-0058	train-other-500	the King of Egypt sendeth unto thee his Chief Wazir
none	none	 with a present of rarities and such and such things of price so do thou also despatch thy Counsellor Asaf bin Barkhiya to meet him with honour and with victual at the halting places and when he cometh to thy presence say unto him Verily thy King hath sent thee in quest of this and that and thy business is thus and thus Then do thou propound to him The Saving Faith FN three hundred sixty Whereupon Solomon bade his Wazir make ready a company of his retainers and go forth to meet the Minister of Egypt with honour and sumptuous provision at the halting places So Asaf made ready all that was needed for their entertainment 
8590-258290-0059	train-other-500	and setting out fared on till he fell in with Faris and accosted him with the salam
none	none	 honouring him and his company with exceeding honour Moreover he brought them provaunt and provender at the halting places and said to them Well come and welcome and fair welcome to the coming guests Rejoice in the certain winning of your wish Be your souls of good cheer and your eyes cool and clear and your breasts be broadened Quoth Faris in himself Who acquainted him with this and he said to Asaf FN three hundred sixty one O my lord and who gave thee to know of us and our need It was Solomon son of David on whom be the Peace told us of this And who told our lord Solomon The Lord of the heaven and the earth told him 
8590-258290-0060	train-other-500	the God of all creatures This is none other than a mighty God And do ye not worship him
none	none	 We worship the Sun and prostrate ourselves thereto 
8590-258290-0061	train-other-500	O Wazir Faris the sun is but a star of the stars created by Allah extolled and exalted be He and Allah forbid that it should be a Lord
none	none	 Because whiles it riseth and whiles it setteth 
8590-258290-0062	train-other-500	but our Lord is ever present and never absent
none	none	 and He over all things is Omnipotent Then they journeyed on a little while till they came to the land Saba and drew near the throne of Solomon David son upon the twain be peace who commanded his hosts of men and Jinn and others FN three hundred sixty two to form line on their road So the beasts of the sea and the elephants and leopards and lynxes and all beasts of the land ranged themselves in espalier on either side of the way after their several kinds and similarly the Jinn drew out in two ranks 
8590-258290-0063	train-other-500	appearing all to mortal eyes without concealment in divers forms grisly and gruesome So they lined the road on either hand and the birds bespread their wings over the host of creatures to shade them
8590-258290-0064	train-other-500	warbling one to other in all manner of voices and tongues Now when the people of Egypt came to this terrible array they dreaded it and durst not proceed but Asaf said to them Pass on amidst them and walk forward and fear them not
8590-258290-0065	train-other-500	for they are slaves of Solomon son of David and none of them will harm you So saying he entered between the ranks followed by all the folk and amongst them the Wazir of Egypt and his company fearful
8590-258290-0066	train-other-500	and they ceased not faring forwards till they reached the city where they lodged the embassy in the guest house and for the space of three days entertained them sumptuously entreating them with the utmost honour Then they carried them before Solomon
8590-258290-0067	train-other-500	prophet of Allah on whom be the Peace and when entering they would have kissed the earth before him but he forbade them saying
none	none	 It befitteth not a man prostrate himself to earth save before Allah to whom belong Might and Majesty 
8590-258290-0068	train-other-500	Creator of Earth and Heaven and all other things wherefore whosoever of you hath a mint to sit let him be seated in my service or to stand let him stand but let none stand to do me worship
8590-258290-0069	train-other-500	So they obeyed him and the Wazir Faris and some of his intimates sat down
none	none	 whilst certain of the lesser sort remained afoot to wait on him When they had sat awhile the servants spread the tables and they all men and beasts ate their sufficiency FN three hundred sixty three Then Solomon bade Faris expound his errand that it might be accomplished saying Speak and hide naught of that wherefor thou art come for I know why ye come and what is your errand which is thus and thus The King of Egypt who despatched thee Asim hight hath become a very old man infirm decrepit and Allah whose name be exalted hath not blessed him with offspring male or female So he abode in cark and care and chagrin from morn to night and from night to morn It so happened that one day of the days as he sat upon the throne of his kingship with his Emirs 
8590-258290-0070	train-other-500	and Wazirs and Captains and Grandees in attendance on him he saw some of them with two sons others with one and others even three who came with their sires to do him service
8590-258290-0071	train-other-500	So he said in himself of the excess of his sorrow Who shall get my kingdom after my death Will any save a stranger take it And thus shall I pass out of being as though I had never been On this account he became drowned in the sea of thought
8590-258290-0072	train-other-500	until his eyes were flooded with tears and he covered his face with his kerchief and wept with sore weeping Then he rose from off his throne and sat down upon the floor wailing and lamenting
none	none	 and none knew what was in heart as he grovelled in the ground save Allah Almighty And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Seven Hundred and Sixtieth Night She resumed It hath reached me O auspicious King that Solomon David son upon both of whom be peace after disclosing to the Wazir Faris that which had passed between himself and his master King Asim said to him Is this that I have told thee the truth O Wazir Replied Faris O prophet of Allah this thou hast said is indeed sooth and verity but when we discoursed of this matter none was with the King and myself nor was any ware of our case who then told thee of all these things Answered Solomon They were told to me by my Lord who knoweth whatso is concealed FN three hundred sixty four from the eye and what is hidden in the breasts Quoth Faris O Prophet of Allah verily this is none other than a mighty Lord and an omnipotent God And he Islamized with all his many Then said Solomon to him Thou hast with thee such and such presents and rarities and Faris replied Yes The prophet continued I accept them all and give them in free gift unto thee So do ye rest thou and thy company in the place where you have been lodging till the fatigue of the journey shall cease from you and to morrow Inshallah thine errand shall be accomplished to the uttermost if it be the will of Allah the Most High Lord of heaven and earth and the light which followeth the gloom Creator of all creatures So Faris returned to his quarters and passed the night in deep thought But when morning morrowed he presented himself before the Lord Solomon who said to him When thou returnest to King Asim bin Safwan and you twain are re united do ye both go forth some day armed with bow bolts and brand and fare to such a place where ye shall find a certain tree Mount upon it and sit silent until the midhour between noon prayer and that of mid afternoon when the noontide heat hath cooled then descend and look at the foot of the tree whence ye will see two serpents come forth one with a head like an ape s and the other with a head like an Ifrit s Shoot them ye twain with bolts and kill them both then cut off a span s length from their heads and the like from their tails and throw it away The rest of the flesh cook and cook well and give it to your wives to eat then lie with them that night and by Allah s leave they shall conceive and bear male children Moreover he gave him a seal ring a sword and a wrapper containing two tunics FN three hundred sixty five embroidered with gold and jewels saying O Wazir Faris when your sons grow up to man s estate give to each of them one of these tunics Then said he In the name of Allah May the Almighty accomplish your desire And now nothing remaineth for thee but to depart relying on the blessing of the Lord the Most High for the King looketh for thy return night and day and his eye is ever gazing on the road So the Wazir advanced to the prophet Solomon son of David upon both of whom be the Peace and farewelled him and fared forth from him after kissing his hands Rejoicing in the accomplishment of his errand he travelled on with all diligence night and day and ceased not wayfaring till he drew near to Cairo when he despatched one of his servants to acquaint King Asim with his approach and the successful issue of his journey which when the King heard he joyed with exceeding joy he and his Grandees and Officers and troops especially in the Wazir s safe return When they met the Minister dismounted and kissing ground before the King gave him the glad news anent the winning of his wish in fullest fashion after which he expounded the True Faith to him and the King and all his people embraced Al Islam with much joy and gladness Then said Asim to his Wazir Go home and rest this night and a week to boot then go to the Hammambath and come to me that I may inform thee of what we shall have to consider So Faris kissed ground and withdrew with his suite pages and eunuchs to his house where he rested eight days after which he repaired to the King and related to him all that had passed between Solomon and himself adding Do thou rise and go forth with me alone Then the King and the Minister took two bows and two bolts and repairing to the tree indicated by Solomon clomb up into it and there sat in silence till the mid day heat had passed away and it was near upon the hour of mid afternoon prayer when they descended and looking about them saw a serpent couple FN three hundred sixty six issue from the roots of the tree The King gazed at them marvelling to see them ringed with collars of gold about their necks and said to Faris O Wazir verily these snakes have golden torques By Allah this is forsooth a rare thing Let us catch them and set them in a cage and keep them to look upon But the Minister said These hath Allah created for profitable use FN three hundred sixty seven so do thou shoot one and I will shoot the other with these our shafts Accordingly they shot at them with arrows and slew them after which they cut off a span s length of their heads and tails and threw it away Then they carried the rest to the King s palace where they called the kitchener and giving him the flesh said Dress this meat daintily with onion sauce FN three hundred sixty eight and spices and ladle it out into two saucers and bring them hither at such an hour without delay And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Seven Hundred and Sixty first Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the King and the Wazir gave the serpents flesh to the kitchener saying Cook it and ladle it out into two saucers and bring them hither without delay the cook took the meat and went with it to the kitchen where he cooked it and dressed it in skilful fashion with a mighty fine onion sauce and hot spices after which he ladled it out into two saucers and set them before the King and the Wazir who took each a dish and gave their wives to eat of the meat Then they went in that night unto them and knew them carnally and by the good pleasure of Allah extolled and exalted be He and His all might and furtherance they both conceived on one and the same night The King abode three months troubled in mind and saying in himself I wonder whether this thing will prove true or untrue till one day as the lady his Queen was sitting the child stirred in her womb and she felt a pain and her colour changed So she knew that she was with child and calling the chief of her eunuchs gave him this command Go to the King wherever he may be and congratulate him saying O King of the Age I bring thee the glad tidings that our lady s pregnancy is become manifest for the child stirreth in her womb So the eunuch went out in haste rejoicing and finding the King alone with cheek on palm pondering this thing kissed ground between his hands and acquainted him with his wife s pregnancy When the King heard his words he sprang to his feet and in the excess of his joy he kissed FN three hundred sixty nine the eunuch s hands and head and doffing the clothes he had on gave them to him Moreover he said to those who were present in his assembly Whoso loveth me let him bestow largesse upon this man FN three hundred seventy And they gave him of coin and jewels and jacinths and horses and mules and estates and gardens what was beyond count or calculation At that moment in came the Wazir Faris and said to Asim O my master but now I was sitting alone at home and absorbed in thought pondering the matter of the pregnancy and saying to myself Would I wot an this thing be true and whether my wife Khatun FN three hundred seventy one have conceived or not when behold an eunuch came in to me and brought me the glad tidings that his lady was indeed pregnant for that her colour was changed and the child stirred in her womb whereupon in my joy I doffed all the clothes I had on and gave them to him together with a thousand dinars and made him Chief of the Eunuchs Rejoined the King O Minister Allah extolled and exalted be He hath of His grace and bounty and goodness and beneficence made gift to us of the True Faith and brought us out of night into light and hath been bountiful to us of His favour and benevolence wherefore I am minded to solace the folk and cause them to rejoice Quoth Faris Do what thou wilt FN three hundred seventy two and quoth the King O Wazir go down without stay or delay and set free all who are in the prisons both criminals and debtors and whoso transgresseth after this we will requite as he deserveth even to the striking off of his head Moreover we forgive the people three years taxes and do thou set up kitchens all around about the city walls FN three hundred seventy three and bid the kitcheners hang over the fire all kinds of cooking pots and cook all manner of meats continuing their cooking night and day and let all comers both of our citizens and of the neighbouring countries far and near eat and drink and carry to their houses And do thou command the people to make holiday and decorate the city seven days and shut not the taverns night nor day FN three hundred seventy four and if thou delay I will behead thee FN three hundred seventy five So he did as the King bade him and the folk decorated the city and citadel and bulwarks after the goodliest fashion and donning their richest attire passed their time in feasting and sporting and making merry till the days of the Queen s pregnancy were accomplished and she was taken one night with labour pains hard before dawn Then the King bade summon all the Olema and astronomers mathematicians and men of learning astrologers scientists and scribes in the city and they assembled and sat awaiting the throwing of a bead into the cup FN three hundred seventy six which was to be the signal to the Astrophils as well as to the nurses and attendants that the child was born Presently as they sat in expectation the Queen gave birth to a boy like a slice of the moon when fullest and the astrologers fell to calculating and noted his star and nativity and drew his horoscope Then on being summoned they rose and kissing the earth before the King gave him the glad tidings saying In very sooth the new born child is of happy augury and born under an auspicious aspect but they added in the first of his life there will befall him a thing which we fear to name before the King Quoth Asim Speak and fear not so quoth they O King this boy will fare forth from this land and journey in strangerhood and suffer shipwreck and hardship and prisonment and distress and indeed he hath before him the sorest of sufferings but he shall free him of them in the end and win to his wish and live the happiest of lives the rest of his days ruling over subjects with a strong hand and having dominion in the land despite enemies and enviers Now when the King heard the astrologers words he said The matter is a mystery but all that Allah Almighty hath written for the creature of good and bad cometh to pass and needs must betide him from this day to that a thousand solaces So he paid no heed to their words or attention to their speeches but bestowed on them robes of honour as well upon all who were present and dismissed them when behold in came Faris the Wazir and kissed the earth before the King in huge joy saying Good tidings O King My wife hath but now given birth to a son as he were a slice of the moon Replied Asim O Wazir go bring thy wife and child hither that she may abide with my wife in my palace and they shall bring up the two boys together So Faris fetched his wife and son and they committed the two children to the nurses wet and dry And after seven days had passed over them they brought them before the King and said to him What wilt thou name the twain Quoth he Do ye name them but quoth they None nameth the son save his sire So he said Name my son Sayf al Muluk after my grandfather and the Minister s son Sa id FN three hundred seventy seven Then he bestowed robes of honour on the nurses wet and dry and said to them Be ye ruthful over them and rear them after the goodliest fashion So they brought up the two boys diligently till they reached the age of five when the King committed them to a doctor of Sciences FN three hundred seventy eight who taught them to read the Koran and write When they were ten years old King Asim gave them in charge to masters who instructed them in cavalarice and shooting with shafts and lunging with lance and play of Polo and the like till by the time they were fifteen years old they were clever in all manner of martial exercises nor was there one to view with them in horsemanship for each of them would do battle with a thousand men and make head against them single handed So when they came to years of discretion whenever King Asim looked on them he joyed in them with exceeding joy and when they attained their twenty fifth year he took Faris his Minister apart one day and said to him O Wazir I am minded to consult with thee concerning a thing I desire to do Replied he Whatever thou hast a mind to do do it for thy judgment is blessed Quoth the King O Wazir I am become a very old and decrepit man sore stricken in years and I desire to take up my abode in an oratory that I may worship Allah Almighty and give my kingdom and Sultanate to my son Sayf al Muluk for that he is grown a goodly youth perfect in knightly exercises and intellectual attainments polite letters and gravity dignity and the art of government What sayst thou O Minister of this project And quoth the counsellor Right indeed is thy rede the idea is a blessed and a fortunate and if thou do this I will do the like and my son Sa id shall be the Prince s Wazir for he is a comely young man and complete in knowledge and judgment Thus will the two youths be together and we will order their affair and neglect not their case but guide them to goodness and in the way that is straight Quoth the King Write letters and send them by couriers to all the countries and cities and sconces and fortresses that be under our hands bidding their chiefs be present on such a day at the Horse course of the Elephant FN three hundred seventy nine So the Wazir went out without stay or delay and despatched letters of this purport to all the deputies and governors of fortresses and others under King Asim and he commanded also that all in the city should be present far and near high and low When the appointed time drew nigh King Asim bade the tent pitchers plant pavilions in the midst of the Champ de Mars and decorate them after the most sumptuous fashion and set up the great throne whereon he sat not but on festivals And they at once did his bidding Then he and all his Nabobs and Chamberlains and Emirs sallied forth and he commanded proclamation be made to the people saying In the name of Allah come forth to the Maydan So all the Emirs and Wazirs and Governors of provinces and Feudatories FN three hundred eighty came forth to the place of assembly and entering the royal pavilion addressed themselves to the service of the King as was their wont and abode in their several stations some sitting and others standing till all the people were gathered together when the King bade spread the tables and they ate and drank and prayed for him Then he commanded the Chamberlains FN three hundred eighty one to proclaim to the people that they should not depart so they made proclamation to them saying Let none of you fare hence till he have heard the King s words So they withdrew the curtains of the royal pavilion and the King said Whoso loveth me let him remain till he have heard my speech Whereupon all the folk sat down in mind tranquil after they had been fearful saying Wherefore have we been summoned by the King Then the Sovran rose to his feet and making them swear that none would stir from his stead said to them O ye Emirs and Wazirs and Lords of the land the great and the small of you and all ye who are present of the people say me wot ye not that this kingdom was an inheritance to me from my fathers and forefathers Answered they Yes O King we all know that And he continued I and you we all worshipped the sun and moon till Allah extolled and exalted be He vouchsafed us the knowledge of the True Faith and brought us out of darkness unto light and directed us to the religion of Al Islam Know that I am become a very old man feeble and decrepit and I desire to take up my abode in a hermitage FN three hundred eighty two there to worship Allah Almighty and crave His pardon for past offenses and make this my son Sayf al Muluk ruler Ye know full well that he is a comely youth eloquent liberal learned versed in affairs intelligent equitable wherefore I am minded presently to resign to him my realm and to make him ruler over you and seat him as Sultan in my stead whilst I give myself to solitude and to the worship of Allah in an oratory and my son and heir shall judge between you What say ye then all of you Thereupon they all rose and kissing ground before him made answer with Hearing and obedience saying O our King and our defender an thou should set over us one of thy blackamoor slaves we would obey him and hearken to thy word and accept thy command how much more then with thy son Sayf al Muluk Indeed we accept of him and approve him on our eyes and heads So King Asim bin Safwan arose and came down from his seat and seating his son on the great throne FN three hundred eighty three took the crown from his own head and set it on the head of Sayf al Muluk and girt his middle with the royal girdle FN three hundred eighty four Then he sat down beside his son on the throne of his kingship whilst the Emirs and Wazirs and Lords of the land and all the rest of the folk rose and kissed ground before him saying Indeed he is worthy of the kingship and hath better right to it than any other Then the Chamberlains made proclamation crying Aman Aman Safety Safety and offered up prayers for his victory and prosperity And Sayf al Muluk scattered gold and silver on the heads of the lieges one and all And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Seven Hundred and Sixty second Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when King Asim seated his son Sayf al Muluk upon the throne and all the people prayed for his victory and prosperity the youth scattered gold and silver on the heads of the lieges one and all and conferred robes of honour and gave gifts and largesse Then after a moment the Wazir Faris arose and kissing ground said O Emirs O Grandees ye ken that I am Wazir and that my Wazirate dateth from old before the accession of King Asim bin Safwan who hath now divested himself of the Kingship and made his son King in his stead Answered they Yes we know that thy Wazirate is from sire after grandsire He continued And now in my turn I divest myself of office and invest this my son Sa id for he is intelligent quick witted sagacious What say ye all And they replied None is worthy to be Wazir to King Sayf al Muluk but thy son Sa id and they befit each other With this Faris arose and taking off his Wazirial turband set it on his son s head and eke laid his ink case of office before him whilst the Chamberlains and the Emirs said Indeed he is deserving of the Wazirship and the Heralds cried aloud Mubarak Mubarak Felix sit et faustus After this King Asim and Faris the Minister arose and opening the royal treasuries conferred magnificent robes of honour on all the Viceroys and Emirs and Wazirs and Lords of the land and other folk and gave salaries and benefactions and wrote them new mandates and diplomas with the signatures of King Sayf al Muluk and his Wazir Sa id Moreover he made distribution of money to the men at arms and gave guerdons and the provincials abode in the city a full week ere they departed each to his own country and place Then King Asim carried his son and his Wazir Sa id back to the palace which was in the city and bade the treasurer bring the seal ring and signet FN three hundred eighty five sword and wrapper which being done he said to the two young men O my sons come hither and let each of you choose two of these things and take them The first to make choice was Sayf al Muluk who put out his hand and took the ring and the wrapper whilst Sa id took the sword and the signet after which they both kissed the King s hands and went away to their lodging Now Sayf al Muluk opened not the wrapper to see what was therein but threw it on the couch where he and Sa id slept by night for it was their habit to lie together Presently they spread them the bed and the two lay down with a pair of wax candles burning over them and slept till midnight when Sayf al Muluk awoke and seeing the bundle at his head said in his mind I wonder what thing of price is in this wrapper my father gave me So he took it together with a candle and descended from the couch leaving Sa id sleeping and carried the bundle into a closet where he opened it and found within a tunic of the fabric of the Jann He spread it out and saw on the lining FN three hundred eighty six of the back the portraiture wroughten in gold of a girl and marvellous was her loveliness and no sooner had he set eyes on the figure than his reason fled his head and he became Jinn mad for love thereof so that he fell down in a swoon and presently recovering began to weep and lament beating his face and breast and kissing her And he recited these verses Love at the first is a spurt of spray FN three hundred eighty seven Which Doom disposes and Fates display Till when deep diveth youth in passion sea Unbearable sorrows his soul waylay And also these two couplets Had I known of Love in what fashion he Robbeth heart and soul I had guarded me But of malice prepense I threw self away Unwitting of Love what his nature be And Sayf al Muluk ceased not to weep and wail and beat face and breast till Sa id awoke and missing him from the bed and seeing but a single candle said to himself Whither is Sayf al Muluk gone Then he took the other candle and went round about the palace till he came upon the closet where he saw the Prince lying at full length weeping with sore weeping and lamenting aloud So he said to him O my brother for what cause are these tears and what hath befallen thee Speak to me and tell me the reason thereof But Sayf al Muluk spoke not neither raised his head and continued to weep and wail and beat hand on breast Seeing him in this case quoth Sa id I am thy Wazir and thy brother and we were reared together I and thou so an thou do not unburden thy breast and discover thy secret to me to whom shalt thou reveal it and disclose its cause And he went on to humble himself and kiss the ground before him a full hour whilst Sayf al Muluk paid no heed to him nor answered him a word but gave not over to weeping At last being affrighted at his case and weary of striving with him he went out and fetched a sword with which he returned to the closet and setting the point to his own breast said to the Prince Rouse thee O my brother An thou tell me not what aileth thee I will slay myself and see thee no longer in this case Whereupon Sayf al Muluk raised his head towards the Wazir and answered him O my brother I am ashamed to tell thee what hath betided me but Sa id said I conjure thee by Allah Lord of Lords Liberator of Necks FN three hundred eighty eight Causer of causes the One the Ruthful the Gift full the Bountiful that thou tell me what aileth thee and be not abashed at me for I am thy slave and thy Minister and counsellor in all thine affairs Quoth Sayf al Muluk Come and look at this likeness So Sa id looked at it awhile and considering it straitly behold he saw written as a crown over its head in letters of pearl these words This is the counterfeit presentment of Badi a al Jamal daughter of Shahyal bin Sharukh a King of the Kings of the true believing Jann who have taken up their abode in the city of Babel and sojourn in the garden of Iram Son of Ad the Greater FN three hundred eighty nine And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say 
8590-258292-0000	train-other-500	When it was the Seven Hundred and Sixty third Night She continued It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Sa id son of the Wazir Faris had read to Sayf al Muluk son of King Asim the writ on the tunic

8590-258292-0003	train-other-500	and Sa id rejoined Come read this writing on the crown So Sayf al Muluk read it and cried out from his heart s core and very vitals saying Alas Alas Alas
8590-258292-0004	train-other-500	Quoth Sa id O my brother an the original of the portrait exist and her name be Badi a al Jamal and she abide in the world I will hasten to seek her that thou mayst win thy will without delay
8590-258292-0005	train-other-500	But Allah upon thee O my brother leave this weeping and ascend thy throne that the Officers of the State may come in to do their service to thee and in the undurn do thou summon the merchants and fakirs

8590-258292-0007	train-other-500	So when it was day Sayf al Muluk went forth and mounted the throne clasping the tunic in his arms for he could neither stand nor sit without it nor would sleep visit him save it were with him

8590-258292-0009	train-other-500	and he by Allah hath passed the night in ill case So Sa id fared forth and told the folk what he said which when old King Asim heard he was concerned for his son

8590-258292-0012	train-other-500	Are all of you impotent to cure my son Except ye heal him forthright I will put the whole of you to death The Archiater replied O King of the Age in very sooth we know that this is thy son

8590-258292-0016	train-other-500	Enquire of his Wazir and brother Sa id for he knoweth his case The King rose and repaired to his private closet and summoning Sa id said to him Tell me the truth of thy brother s malady
8590-258292-0017	train-other-500	But Sa id replied I know it not So King Asim said to the Sworder Take Sa id and bind his eyes and strike his neck Whereupon Sa id feared for himself and cried O King of the Age grant me immunity

8590-258292-0021	train-other-500	How then shall we do O my son and Sayf al Muluk answered Bring us all the merchants and travellers and wanderers in the city
none	none	 that we may question them thereof Peradventure Allah will lead us to the city of Babel and the garden of Iram So King Asim bade summon all the merchants in the city and strangers and seacaptains and as each came enquired of him anent the city of Babel and its peninsula FN three hundred ninety one and the garden of Iram but none of them knew these places nor could any give him tidings thereof However when the seance broke up one of them said O King of the Age an thou be minded to ken this thing up and hie thee to the land of China for it hath a vast city FN three hundred ninety two and a safe wherein are store of rarities and things of price and folk of all kinds and thou shalt not come to the knowledge of this city and garden but from its folk it may be one of them will direct thee to that thou seekest Whereupon quoth Sayf al Muluk

8590-258292-0038	train-other-500	whereupon Sayf al Muluk opened his eyes and seeing no sign of the ships nor aught but sky and sea said to the Mamelukes who were with him Where are the carracks and cock boats and where is my brother Sa id
8590-258292-0039	train-other-500	They replied O King of the Age there remain nor ships nor boats nor those who were therein for they are all drowned and become food for fishes Now when he heard this he cried aloud

8590-258292-0050	train-other-500	So they set meat before him and he ate his sufficiency till they removed the food from before him whilst the boat drove on with them they knew not whither it was wandering It drifted with them at the will of the winds and the waves

8590-258292-0052	train-other-500	and the breezes wafted them on till they came thither Then making the cock boat fast to the coast and leaving one therein to guard it they fared on into the island where they found abundance of fruits of all colours
8590-258292-0053	train-other-500	and ate of them till they were satisfied Presently they saw a person sitting among those trees and he was long faced of strange favour and white of beard and body He called to one of the Mamelukes by his name saying
8590-258292-0054	train-other-500	Eat not of these fruits for they are unripe but come hither to me that I may give thee to eat of the best and the ripest The slave looked at him and thought that he was one of the shipwrecked who had made his way to that island
8590-258292-0055	train-other-500	so he joyed with exceeding joy at sight of him and went close up to him knowing not what was decreed to him in the Secret Purpose nor what was writ upon his brow But when he drew near the stranger in human shape leapt upon him
none	none	 for he was a Marid FN four hundred one and riding upon his shoulderblades and twisting one of his legs about his neck let the other hang down upon his back saying Walk on fellow for there is no escape for thee from me and thou art become mine ass Thereupon the Mameluke fell a weeping and cried out to his comrades Alas my lord Flee ye forth of this wood and save yourselves for one of the dwellers therein hath mounted on my shoulders and the rest seek you desiring to ride you like me When they heard these words all fled down to the boat and pushed off to sea whilst the islanders followed them into the water saying Whither wend ye Come tarry with us and we will mount on your backs and give you meat and drink and you shall be our donkeys Hearing this they hastened the more seawards till they left them in the distance and fared on trusting in Allah Almighty nor did they leave faring for a month till another island rose before them and thereon they landed Here they found fruits of various kinds and busied themselves with eating of them when behold they saw from afar somewhat lying in the road a hideous creature as it were a column of silver So they went up to it and one of the men gave it a kick when lo it was a thing of human semblance long of eyes and cloven of head and hidden under one of his ears for he was wont whenas he lay down to sleep to spread on ear under his head and cover his face with the other ear FN four hundred two He snatched up the Mameluke who had kicked him and carried him off into the middle of the island and behold it was all full of Ghuls who eat the sons of Adam The man cried out to his fellows Save yourselves for this is the island of the man eating Ghuls and they mean to tear me to bits and devour me When they heard these words they fled back to the boat without gathering any store of the fruits and putting out to sea fared on some days till it so happened that they came to another island where they found a high mountain So they climbed to the top and there saw a thick copse Now they were sore anhungered so they took to eating of the fruits but before they were aware there came upon them from among the trees black men of terrible aspect each fifty cubits high with eye teeth FN four hundred three protruding from their mouths like elephants tusks and laying hands on Sayf al Muluk and his company carried them to their King whom they found seated on a piece of black felt laid on a rock and about him a great company of Zanzibar blacks standing in his service 
8590-258292-0056	train-other-500	The blackamoors who had captured the Prince and his Mamelukes set them before the King and said to him We found these birds amoung the trees and the King was sharp set so he took two of the servants and cut their throats and ate them
none	none	 And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Seven Hundred and Sixty sixth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the Zanzibar blacks took Sayf al Muluk and his Mamelukes and set them before the King saying O King we came upon these birds among the trees Thereupon the King seized two of the Mamelukes and cut their throats and ate them which when Sayf al Muluk saw he feared for himself and wept and repeated these verses Familiar with my heart are woes and with them I Who shunned them for familiar are great hearts and high The woes I suffer are not all of single kind I have thank Allah varied thousands to aby Then he signed and repeated these also The World hath shot me with its sorrows till My heart is covered with shafts galore And now when strike me other shafts must break Against th old points the points that latest pour When the King heard his weeping and wailing he said Verily these birds have sweet voices and their song pleaseth me put them in cages So they set them each in his own cage and hung them up at the King s head that he might listen to their warbling On this wise Sayf al Muluk and his Mamelukes abode and the blackamoors gave them to eat and drink and now they wept and now laughed now spake and now were hushed whilst the King of the blacks delighted in the sound of their voices And so they continued for a long time Now this King had a daughter married in another island who hearing that her father had birds with sweet voices sent a messenger to him seeking of him some of them So he sent her by her Cossid FN four hundred four Sayf al Muluk and three of his men in four cages and when she saw them they pleased her and she bade hang them up in a place over her head The Prince fell to marvelling at that which had befallen him and calling to mind his former high and honourable estate and weeping for himself and the three servants wept for themselves and the King s daughter deemed that they sang Now it was her wont whenever any one from the land of Egypt or elsewhere fell into her hands and he pleased her to advance him to great favour with her and by the decree of Allah Almighty it befel that when she saw Sayf al Muluk she was charmed by his beauty and loveliness and symmetry and perfect grace and she commanded to entreat him and his companions with honour and to loose them from their cages Now one day she took the Prince apart and would have him enjoy her but he refused saying O my lady I am a banisht wight and with passion for a beloved one in piteous plight nor with other will I consent to love delight Then she coaxed him and importuned him but he held aloof from her and she could not approach him nor get her desire of him by any ways and means At last when she was weary of courting him in vain she waxed wroth with him and his Mamelukes and commanded that they should serve her and fetch her wood and water In such condition they abode four years till Sayf al Muluk became weary of his life and sent to intercede with the Princess so haply she might release them and let them wend their ways and be at rest from that their hard labour So she sent for him and said to him If thou wilt do my desire I will free thee from this thy durance vile and thou shalt go to thy country safe and sound And she wept and ceased not to humble herself to him and wheedle him but he would not hearken to her words whereupon she turned from him in anger and he and his companions abode on the island in the same plight The islanders knew them for The Princess s birds and durst not work them any wrong and her heart was at ease concerning them being assured that they could not escape from the island So they used to absent themselves from her two and three days at a time and go round about the desert parts in al directions gathering firewood which they brought to the Princess s kitchen and thus they abode five FN four hundred five years Now one day it so chanced that the Prince and his men were sitting on the sea shore devising of what had befallen and Sayf al Muluk seeing himself and his men in such case bethought him of his mother and father and his brother Sa id and calling to mind what high degree he had been in fell a weeping and lamenting passing sore whilst his slaves wept likewise Then said they to him O King of the Age how long shall we weep Weeping availeth not for this thing was written on our brows by the ordinance of Allah to whom belong Might and Majesty Indeed the Pen runneth with that He decreeth and nought will serve us but patience haply Allah extolled and exalted be He who hath saddened us shall gladden us Quoth he O my brothers how shall we win free from this accursed woman I see no way of escape for us save Allah of his grace deliver us from her but methinks we may flee and be at rest from this hard labour And quoth they O King of the Age whither shall we flee For the whole island is full of Ghuls which devour the Sons of Adam and whithersoever we go they will find us there and either eat us or capture and carry us back to that accursed the King s daughter who will be wroth with us Sayf al Muluk rejoined I will contrive you somewhat whereby peradventure Allah Almighty shall deliver us and help us to escape from this island They asked And how wilt thou do and he answered Let us cut some of these long pieces of wood and twist ropes of their bark and bind them one with another and make of them a raft FN four hundred six which we will launch and load with these fruits then we will fashion us paddles and embark on the raft after breaking our bonds with the axe It may be that Almighty Allah will make it the means of our deliverance from this accursed woman and vouchsafe us a fair wind to bring us to the land of Hind for He over all things is Almighty Said they Right is thy rede and rejoiced thereat with exceeding joy So they arose without stay or delay and cut with their axes wood for the raft and twisted ropes to bind the logs and at this they worked a whole month Every day about evening they gathered somewhat of fuel and bore it to the Princess s kitchen and employed the rest of the twenty four hours working at the raft And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Seven Hundred and Sixty seventh Night She continued It hath reached me O auspicious King that Sayf al Muluk and his Mamelukes having cut the wood and twisted the ropes for their raft made an end of it and launched it upon the sea then after breaking their bonds with the axe and loading the craft with fruits plucked from the island trees they embarked at close of day nor did any wot of their intent They put out to sea in their raft and paddled on four months knowing not whither the craft carried them till their provaunt failed them and they were suffering the severest extreme of hunger and thirst when behold the sea waxed troubled and foamed and rose in high waves and there came forth upon them a frightful crocodile FN four hundred seven which put out its claw and catching up one of the Mamelukes swallowed him At the sight of this horror Sayf al Muluk wept bitterly and he and the two men FN four hundred eight that remained to him pushed off from the place where they had seen the crocodile sore affrighted After this they continued drifting on till one day they espied a mountain terrible tall and spiring high in air whereat they rejoiced when presently an island appeared They made towards it with all their might congratulating one another on the prospect of making land but hardly had they sighted the island on which was the mountain when the sea changed face and boiled and rose in big waves and a second crocodile raised its head and putting out its claw caught up the two remaining Mamelukes and swallowed them So Sayf al Muluk abode alone and making his way to the island toiled till he reached the mountain top where he looked about and found a copse and walking among the trees feel to eating of the fruits Presently he saw among the branches more than twenty great apes each bigger than a he mule whereat he was seized with exceeding fear The apes came down and surrounded him FN four hundred nine then forewent him signing to him to follow them and walked on and he too till he came to a castle tall of base and strong of build whose ordinance was one brick of gold and one of silver The apes entered and he after them and he saw in the castle all manner of rarities jewels and precious metals such as tongue faileth to describe Here also he found a young man passing tall of stature with no hair on his cheeks and Sayf al Muluk was cheered by the sight for there was no human being but he in the castle The stranger marvelled exceedingly at sight of the Prince and asked him What is thy name and of what land art thou and how camest thou hither Tell me thy tale and hide from me naught thereof Answered the Prince By Allah I came not hither of my own consent nor is this place of my intent yet I cannot but go from place to place till I win my wish Quoth the youth And what is thy object and quoth the other I am of the land of Egypt and my name is Sayf al Muluk son of King Asim bin Safwan and told him all that had passed with him from first to last Whereupon the youth arose and stood in his service saying O King of the Age I was erst in Egypt and heard that thou hadst gone to the land of China but where is this land and where lies China land FN four hundred ten Verily this is a wondrous thing and marvellous matter Answered the Prince Sooth thou speakest but when I left China land I set out intending for the land of Hind and a stormy wind arose and the sea boiled and broke all my ships brief he told him all that had befallen him till he came thither whereupon quoth the other O King s son thou hast had enough of strangerhood and its sufferings Alhamdolillah praised be Allah who hath brought thee hither So now do thou abide with me that I may enjoy thy company till I die when thou shalt become King over this island to which no bound is known and these apes thou seest are indeed skilled in all manner of crafts and whatso thou seekest here shalt thou find Replied Sayf al Muluk O my brother I may not tarry in any place till my wish be won albeit I compass the whole world in pursuit thereof and make quest of every one so peradventure Allah may bring me to my desire or my course lead me to the place wherein is the appointed term of my days and I shall die my death Then the youth turned with a sign to one of the apes and he went out and was absent awhile after which he returned with other apes girt with silken zones FN four hundred eleven They brought the trays and set on near FN four hundred twelve an hundred chargers of gold and saucers of silver containing all manner of meats Then they stood after the manner of servants between the hands of Kings till the youth signalled to the Chamberlains who sat down and he whose wont it was to serve stood whilst the two Princes ate their sufficiency Then the apes cleared the table and brought basins and ewers of gold and they washed their hands in rose water after which they set on fine sugar and nigh forty flagons in each a different kind of wine and they drank and took their pleasure and made merry and had a fine time And all the apes danced and gambolled before them what while the eaters sat at meat which when Sayf al Muluk saw he marvelled at them and forgot that which had befallen him of sufferings And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Seven Hundred and Sixty eighth Night She pursued It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Sayf al Muluk saw the gestures and gambols of the apes he marvelled thereat and forgot that which had betided him of strangerhood and its sufferings At nightfall they lighted waxen candles in candlesticks of gold studded with gems and set on dishes of confections and fruits of sugar candy So they ate and when the hour of rest was come the apes spread them bedding and they slept And when morning morrowed the young man arose as was his wont before sunrise and waking Sayf al Muluk said to him Put thy head forth of this lattice and see what standeth beneath it So he put out his head and saw the wide waste and all the wold filled with apes whose number none knew save Allah Almighty Quoth he Here be great plenty of apes for they cover the whole country but why are they assembled at this hour Quoth the youth This is their custom Every Sabbath FN four hundred thirteen all the apes in the island come hither some from two and three days distance and stand here till I awake from sleep and put forth my head from this lattice when they kiss ground before me and go about their business So saying he put his head out of the window and when the apes saw him they kissed the earth before him and went their way Sayf al Muluk abode with the young man a whole month when he farewelled him and departed escorted by a party of nigh a hundred apes which the young man bade escort him They journeyed with him seven days till they came to the limits of their islands FN four hundred fourteen when they took leave of him and returned to their places while Sayf al Muluk fared on alone over mount and hill desert and plain four months journey one day anhungered and the next satiated now eating of the herbs of the earth and then of the fruits of the trees till he repented him of the harm he had done himself by leaving the young man and he was about to retrace his steps to him when he saw something black afar off and said to himself Is this a city or trees But I will not turn back till I see what it is So he made towards it and when he drew near he saw that it was a palace tall of base Now he who built it was Japhet son of Noah on whom be peace and it is of this palace that God the Most High speaketh in His precious Book whenas He saith And an abandoned well and a high builded palace FN four hundred fifteen Sayf al Muluk sat down at the gate and said in his mind Would I knew what is within yonder palace and what King dwelleth there and who shall acquaint me whether its folk are men or Jinn Who will tell me the truth of the case He sat considering awhile but seeing none go in or come out he rose and committing himself to Allah Almighty entered the palace and walked on till he had counted seven vestibules yet saw no one Presently looking to his right he beheld three doors while before him was a fourth over which hung a curtain So he went up to this and raising the curtain found himself in a great hall FN four hundred sixteen spread with silken carpets At the upper end rose a throne of gold whereon sat a damsel whose face was like the moon arrayed in royal raiment and beautified as she were a bride on the night of her displaying and at the foot of the throne was a table of forty trays spread with golden and silvern dishes full of dainty viands The Prince went up and saluted her and she returned his salam saying Art thou of mankind or of the Jinn Replied he I am a man of the best of mankind FN four hundred seventeen for I am a King son of a King She rejoined What seekest thou Up with thee and eat of yonder food and after tell me thy past from first to last and how thou camest hither So he sat down at the table and removing the cover from a tray of meats he being hungry ate till he was full then washed his right hand and going up to the throne sat down by the damsel who asked him Who art thou and what is thy name and whence comest thou and who brought thee hither He answered Indeed my story is a long but do thou first tell me who and what and whence thou art and why thou dwellest in this place alone She rejoined My name is Daulat Khatun FN four hundred eighteen and I am the daughter of the King of Hind My father dwelleth in the Capital city of Sarandib and hath a great and goodly garden there is no goodlier in all the land of Hind or its dependencies and in this garden is a great tank One day I went out into the garden with my slave women and I stripped me naked and they likewise and entering the tank fell to sporting and solacing ourselves therein Presently before I could be ware a something as it were a cloud swooped down on me and snatching me up from amongst my handmaids soared aloft with me betwixt heaven and earth saying Fear not O Daulat Khatun but be of good heart Then he flew on with me a little while after which he set me down in this palace and straightway without stay or delay became a handsome young man daintily apparelled who said to me Now dost thou know me Replied I No O my lord and he said I am the Blue King Sovran of the Jann my father dwelleth in the Castle Al Kulzum FN four hundred nineteen hight and hath under his hand six hundred thousand Jinn flyers and divers It chanced that while passing on my way I saw thee and fell in love with thee for thy lovely form so I swooped down on thee and snatched thee up from among the slave girls and brought thee to this the High builded Castle which is my dwelling place None may fare hither be he man or be he Jinni and from Hind hither is a journey of an hundred and twenty years wherefore do thou hold that thou wilt never again behold the land of thy father and thy mother so abide with me here in contentment of heart and peace and I will bring to thy hands whatso thou seekest Then he embraced me and kissed me And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Seven Hundred and Sixty ninth Night She resumed It hath reached me O auspicious King that the damsel said to Sayf al Muluk Then the King of the Jann after he had acquainted me with his case embraced me and kissed me saying Abide here and fear nothing whereupon he went away from me for an hour and presently returned with these tables and carpets and furniture He comes to me every Third FN four hundred twenty and abideth with me three days and on Friday at the time of mid afternoon prayer he departeth and is absent till the following Third When he is here he eateth and drinketh and kisseth and huggeth me but doth naught else with me and I am a pure virgin even as Allah Almighty created me My father s name is Taj al Muluk and he wotteth not what is come of me nor hath he hit upon any trace of me This is my story now tell me thy tale Answered the Prince My story is a long and I fear lest while I am telling it to thee the Ifrit come Quoth she He went out from me but an hour before thy entering and will not return till Third so sit thee down and take thine ease and hearten thy heart and tell me what hath betided thee from beginning to end And quoth he I hear and I obey So he fell to telling her all that had befallen him from commencement to conclusion but when she heard speak of Badi a al Jamal her eyes ran over with railing tears and she cried O Badi a al Jamal I had not thought this of thee Alack for our luck O Badi a al Jamal dost thou not remember me nor say My sister Daulat Khatun whither is she gone And her weeping redoubled lamenting for that Badi a al Jamal had forgotten her FN four hundred twenty one Then said Sayf al Muluk O Daulat Khatun thou art a mortal and she is a Jinniyah how then can she be thy sister Replied the Princess She is my sister by fosterage and this is how it came about My mother went out to solace herself in the garden when labour pangs seized her and she bare me Now the mother of Badi a al Jamal chanced to be passing with her guards when she also was taken with travail pains so she alighted in a side of the garden and there brought forth Badi a al Jamal She despatched one of her women to seek food and childbirth gear of my mother who sent her what she sought and invited her to visit her So she came to her with Badi a al Jamal and my mother suckled the child who with her mother tarried with us in the garden two months And before wending her ways the mother of Badi a al Jamal gave my mother somewhat FN four hundred twenty two saying When thou hast need of me I will come to thee a middlemost the garden and departed to her own land but she and her daughter used to visit us every year and abide with us awhile before returning home Wherefore an I were with my mother O Sayf al Muluk and if thou wert with me in my own country and Badi a al Jamal and I were together as of wont I would devise some device with her to bring thee to thy desire of her but I am here and they know naught of me for that an they kenned what is become of me they have power to deliver me from this place however the matter is in Allah s hands extolled and exalteth be He and what can I do Quoth Sayf al Muluk Rise and let us flee and go whither the Almighty willeth but quoth she We cannot do that for by Allah though we fled hence a year s journey that accursed would overtake us in an hour and slaughter us Then said the Prince I will hide myself in his way and when he passeth by I will smite him with the sword and slay him Daulat Khatun replied Thou canst not succeed in slaying him save thou his soul Asked he And where is his soul and she answered Many a time have I questioned him thereof but he would not tell me till one day I pressed him and he waxed wroth with me and said to me How often wilt thou ask me of my soul What hast thou to do with my soul I rejoined O Hatim FN four hundred twenty three there remaineth none to me but thou except Allah and my life dependeth on thy life and whilst thou livest all is well for me so except I care for thy soul and set it in the apple of this mine eye how shall I live in thine absence An I knew where thy soul abideth I would never cease whilst I live to hold it in mine embrace and would keep it as my right eye Whereupon said he to me What time I was born the astrologers predicted that I should lose my soul at the hands of the son of a king of mankind So I took it and set it in the crop of a sparrow and shut up the bird in a box The box I set in a casket and enclosing this in seven other caskets and seven chests laid the whole in a alabastrine coffer FN four hundred twenty four which I buried within the marge of yon earth circling sea for that these parts are far from the world of men and none of them can win hither So now see I have told thee what thou wouldst know and do thou tell none thereof for it is a secret between me and thee And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Seven Hundred and Seventieth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Daulat Khatun acquainted Sayf al Muluk with the whereabouts of the soul of the Jinni who had carried her off and repeated to him his speech ending with And this is a secret between me and thee I rejoined quoth she To whom should I tell it seeing that none but thou cometh hither with whom I may talk thereof adding By Allah thou hast indeed set thy soul in the strongest of strongholds to which none may gain access How should a man win to it unless the impossible be fore ordained and Allah decree like as the astrologers predicted Thereupon the Jinni Peradventure one may come having on his finger the seal ring of Solomon son of David on the twain be peace and lay his hand with the ring on the face of the water saying By the virtue of the names engraven upon this ring let the soul of such an one come forth Whereupon the coffer will rise to the surface and he will break it open and do the like with the chests and caskets till he come to the little box when he will take out the sparrow and strangle it and I shall die Then said Sayf al Muluk I am the King s son of whom he spake and this is the ring of Solomon David son on my finger so rise let us go down to the sea shore and see if his words be leal or leasing Thereupon the two walked down to the sea shore and the Princess stood on the beach whilst the Prince waded into the water to his waist and laying his hand with the ring on the surface of the sea said By the virtue of the names and talismans engraven on this ring and by the might of Sulayman bid Daud on whom be the Peace let the soul of Hatim the Jinni son of the Blue King come forth Whereat the sea boiled in billows and the coffer of alabaster rose to the surface Sayf al Muluk took it and shattered it against the rock and broke open the chests and caskets till he came to the little box and drew thereout the sparrow Then the twain returned to the castle and sat down on the throne but hardly had they done this when lo and behold there arose a dust cloud terrifying and some huge thing came flying and crying Spare me O King s son and slay me not but make me thy freedman and I will bring thee to thy desire Quoth Daulat Khatun The Jinni cometh slay the sparrow lest this accursed enter the palace and take it from thee and slaughter me and slaughter thee after me So the Prince wrung the sparrow s neck and it died whereupon the Jinni fell down at the palace door and became a heap of black ashes Then said Daulat Khatun We are delivered from the hand of yonder accursed what shall we do now and Sayf al Muluk replied It behoveth us to ask aid of Allah Almighty who hath afflicted us belike He will direct us and help us to escape from this our strait So saying he arose and pulling up FN four hundred twenty five half a score of the doors of the palace which were of sandal wood and lign aloes with nails of gold and silver bound them together with ropes of silk and floss FN four hundred twenty six silk and fine linen and wrought of them a raft which he and the Princess aided each other to hale down to the sea shore They launched it upon the water till it floated and making it fast to the beach returned to the palace whence they removed all the chargers of gold and saucers of silver and jewels and precious stones and metals and what else was light of load and weighty of worth and freighted the raft therewith Then they embarked after fashioning two pieces of wood into the likeness of paddles and casting off the rope moorings let the raft drift out to sea with them committing themselves to Allah the Most High who contenteth those that put their trust in Him and disappointeth not them who rely upon Him They ceased not faring on thus four months until their victual was exhausted and their sufferings waxed severe and their souls were straitened so they prayed Allah to vouchsafe them deliverance from that danger But all this time when they lay down to sleep Sayf al Muluk set Daulat Khatun behind him and laid a naked brand at his back so that when he turned in sleep the sword was between them FN four hundred twenty seven At last it chanced one night when Sayf al Muluk was asleep and Daulat Khatun awake that behold the raft drifted landwards and entered a port wherein were ships The Princess saw the ships and heard a man he being the chief and head of the captains talking with the sailors whereby she knew that this was the port of some city and that they were come to an inhabited country So she joyed with exceeding joy and waking the Prince said to him Ask the captain the name of the city and harbour Thereupon Sayf al Muluk arose and said to the captain O my brother how is this harbour hight and what be the names of yonder city and its King Replied the Captain O false face FN four hundred twenty eight O frosty beard an thou knew not the name of this port and city how camest thou hither Quoth Sayf al Muluk I am a stranger and had taken passage in a merchant ship which was wrecked and sank with all on board but I saved myself on a plank and made my way hither wherefore I asked thee the name of the place and in asking is no offence Then said the captain This is the city of Amariyah and this harbour is called Kamin al Bahrayn FN four hundred twenty nine When the Princess heard this she rejoiced with exceeding joy and said Praised be Allah He asked What is to do and she answered O Sayf al Muluk rejoice in succour near hand for the King of this city is my uncle my father s brother And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Seven Hundred and Seventy first Night She continued It hath reached me O auspicious King that Daulat Khatun said to Sayf al Muluk Rejoice in safety near hand for the King of this city is my uncle my father s brother and his name is Ali al Muluk FN four hundred thirty adding Say thou then to the captain Is the Sultan of the city Ali al Muluk well He asked but the captain was wroth with him and cried Thou sayest I am a stranger and never in my life came hither Who then told thee the name of the lord of the city When Daulat Khatun heard this she rejoiced and knew him for Mu in al Din FN four hundred thirty one one of her father s captains Now he had fared forth in search of her after she was lost and finding her not he never ceased cruising till he came to her uncle s city Then she bade Sayf al Muluk say to him O Captain Mu in al Din come and speak with thy mistress So he called out to him as she bade whereat he was wroth with exceeding wrath and answered O dog O thief O spy who art thou and how knowest thou me Then he said to one of the sailors Give me an ash FN four hundred thirty two stave that I may go to yonder plaguing Arab and break his head So he tookt he stick and made for Sayf al Muluk but when he came to the raft he saw a something wondrous beauteous which confounded his wits and considering it straitly he made sure that it was Daulat Khatun sitting there as she were a slice of the moon whereat he said to the Prince Who is that with thee Replied he A damsel by name Daulat Khatun When the captain heard the Princess s name and knew that she was his mistress and the daughter of his King he fell down in a fainting fit and when he came to himself he left the raft and whatso was thereon and riding up to the palace craved an audience of the King whereupon the chamberlain went in to the presence and said Captain Mu in al Din is come to bring thee good news so bid he be brought in The King bade admit him accordingly he entered and kissing ground FN four hundred thirty three said to him O King thou owest me a gift for glad tidings for thy brother s daughter Daulat Khatun hath reached our city safe and sound and is now on a raft in the harbour in company with a young man like the moon on the night of its full When the King heard this he rejoiced and conferred a costly robe of honour on the captain Then he straightway bade decorate the city in honour of the safe return of his brother s daughter and sending for her and Sayf al Muluk saluted the twain and gave them joy of their safety after which he despatched a messenger to his brother to let him know that his daughter was found and was with him As soon as the news reached Taj al Muluk he gat him ready and assembling his troops set out for his brother s capital where he found his daughter and they rejoiced with exceeding joy He sojourned with his brother a week after which he took his daughter and Sayf al Muluk and returned to Sarandib where the Princess foregathered with her mother and they rejoiced at her safe return and held high festival and that day was a great day never was seen its like As for Sayf al Muluk the King entreated him with honour and said to him O Sayf al Muluk thou hast done me and my daughter all this good for which I cannot requite thee nor can any requite thee save the Lord of the three Worlds but I wish thee to sit upon the throne in my stead and rule the land of Hind for I offer thee of my throne and kingdom and treasures and servants all this in free gift to thee Whereupon Sayf al Muluk rose and kissing the ground before the King thanked him and answered O King of the Age I accept all thou givest me and return it to thee in freest gift for I O King of the Age covet not sovranty nor sultanate nor desire aught but that Allah the Most High bring me to my desire Rejoined the King O Sayf al Muluk these my treasures are at thy disposal take of them what thou wilt without consulting me and Allah requite thee for me with all weal Quoth the Prince Allah advance the King There is no delight for me in money or in dominion till I win my wish but now I have a mind to solace myself in the city and view its thoroughfares and market streets So the King bade bring him a mare of the thoroughbreds saddled and bridled and Sayf al Muluk mounted her and rode through the streets and markets of the city As he looked about him right and left lo his eyes fell on a young man who was carrying a tunic and crying it for sale at fifteen dinars so he considered him and saw him to be like his brother Sa id and indeed it was his very self but he was wan of blee and changed for long strangerhood and the travails of travel so that he knew him not However he said to his attendants Take yonder youth and carry him to the palace where I lodge and keep him with you till my return from the ride when I will question him But they understood him to say Carry him to the prison and said in themselves Haply this is some runaway Mameluke of his So they took him and bore him to the bridewell where they laid him in irons and left him seated in solitude unremembered by any Presently Sayf al Muluk returned to the palace but he forgot his brother Sa id and none made mention of him So he abode in prison and when they brought out the prisoners to cut ashlar from the quarries they took Sa id with them and he wrought with the rest He abode a month s space in this squalor and sore sorrow pondering his case and saying in himself What is the cause of my imprisonment while Sayf al Muluk s mind was diverted from him by rejoicing and other things but one day as he sat he bethought him of Sa id and said to his Mamelukes Where is the white slave I gave into your charge on such a day Quoth they Didst thou not bid us bear him to the bridewell and quoth he Nay I said not so I bade you carry him to my palace after the ride Then he sent his Chamberlains and Emirs for Sa id and they fetched him in fetters and loosing him from his irons set him before the Prince who asked him O young man what countryman art thou and he answered I am from Egypt and my name is Sa id son of Faris the Wazir Now hearing these words Sayf al Muluk sprang to his feet and throwing himself off the throne and upon his friend hung on his neck weeping aloud for very joy and saying O my brother O Sa id praise be Allah for King Asim Then they embraced and shed tears together and all who were present marvelled at them After this Sayf al Muluk bade his people bear Sa id to the Hammam bath and they did so When he came out they clad him in costly clothing and carried him back to Sayf al Muluk who seated him on the throne beside himself When King Taj al Muluk heard of the reunion of Sayf al Muluk and his brother Sa id he joyed with you exceeding and came to them and the three sat devising of all that had befallen them in the past from first to last Then said Sa id O my brother O Sayf al Muluk when the ship sank with all on board I saved myself on a plank with a company of Mamelukes and it drifted with us a whole month when the wind cast us by the ordinance of Allah Almighty upon an island So we landed and entering among the trees took to eating of the fruits for we were anhungred Whilst we were busy eating there fell on us unawares folk like Ifrits FN four hundred thirty four and springing on our shoulders rode us FN four hundred thirty five and said to us Go on with us for ye are become our asses So I said to him who had mounted me What art thou and why mountest thou me At this he twisted one of his legs about my neck till I was all but dead and beat upon my back the while with the other leg till I thought he had broken my backbone So I fell to the ground on my face having no strength left in me for famine and thirst From my fall he knew that I was hungry and taking me by the hand led me to a tree laden with fruit which was a pear tree FN four hundred thirty six and said to me Eat thy fill of this tree So I ate till I had enough and rose to walk against my will but ere I had fared afar the creature turned and leaping on my shoulders again drove me on now walking now running and now trotting and he the while mounted on me laughing and saying Never in my life saw I a donkey like unto thee We abode thus for years till one day of the days it chanced that we saw there great plenty of vines covered with ripe fruit so we gathered a quantity of grape bunches and throwing them into a pit trod them with our feet till the pit became a great water pool Then we waited awhile and presently returning thither found that the sun had wroughten on the grape juice and it was become wine So we used to drink it till we were drunken and our faces flushed and we fell to singing and dancing and running about in the merriment of drunkenness FN four hundred thirty seven whereupon our masters said to us What is it that reddeneth your faces and maketh you dance and sing We replied Ask us not what is your quest in questioning us hereof But they insisted saying You must tell us so that we may know the truth of the case till we told them how we had pressed grapes and made wine Quoth they Give us to drink thereof but quoth we The grapes are spent So they brought us to a Wady whose length we knew not from its breadth nor its beginning from its end wherein were vines each bunch of grapes on them weighing twenty pounds FN four hundred thirty eight by the scale and all within easy reach and they said Gather of these So we gathered a mighty great store of grapes and finding there a big trench bigger than the great tank in the King s garden we filled it full of fruit This we trod with our feet and did with the juice as before till it became strong wine which it did after a month whereupon we said to them Tis come to perfection but in what will ye drink it And they replied We had asses like unto you but we ate them and kept their heads so give us to drink in their skulls We went to their caves which we found full of heads and bones of the Sons of Adam and we gave them to drink when they became drunken and lay down nigh two hundred of them Then we said to one another Is it not enough that they should ride us but they must eat us also There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah the Glorious the Great But we will ply them with wine till they are overcome by drunkenness when we will slay them and be at rest from them Accordingly we awoke them and fell to filling the skulls and gave them to drink but they said This is bitter We replied Why say ye tis bitter Whoso saith thus except he drink of it ten times he dieth the same day When they heard this they feared death and cried to us Give us to drink the whole ten times So we gave them to drink and when they swallowed the rest of the ten draughts they waxed drunken exceedingly and their strength failed them and they availed not to mount us Thereupon we dragged them together by their hands and laying them one upon another collected great plenty of dry vine stalks and branches and heaped it about and upon them then we set fire to the pile and stood afar off to see what became of them And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Seven Hundred and Seventy second Night She pursued It hath reached me O auspicious King that Sa id continued When we set fire to the pile wherein were the Ghuls I with the Mamelukes stood afar off to see what became of them and as soon the fire was burnt out we came back and found them a heap of ashes wherefore we praised Allah Almighty who had delivered us from them Then we went forth about the island and sought the sea shore where we parted and I and two of the Mamelukes fared on till we came to a thick copse full of fruit and there busied ourselves with eating and behold presently up came a man tall of stature long of beard and lengthy of ear with eyes like cressets driving before him and feeding a great flock of sheep FN four hundred thirty nine When he saw us he rejoiced and said to us Well come and fair welcome to you Draw near me that I may slaughter you an ewe of these sheep and roast it and give you to eat Quoth we Where is thine abode And quoth he Hard by yonder mountain go on towards it till ye come to a cave and enter therein for you will see many guests like yourselves and do ye sit with them whilst we make ready for you the guest meal We believed him so fared on as he bade us till we came to the cavern where we found many guests Sons of Adam like ourselves but they were all blinded FN four hundred forty and when we entered one said I m sick and another I m weak So we cried to them What is this you say and what is the cauase of your sickness and weakness They asked Who are ye and we answered We are guests Then said they What hath made you fall into the hands of yonder accursed But there is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah the Glorious the Great This is a Ghul who devoureth the Sons of Adam and he hath blinded us and meaneth to eat us Said we And how did he blind you and they replied Even as he will blind yourselves anon Quoth we And how so And quoth they He will bring you bowls of soured milk FN four hundred forty one and will say to you Ye are weary with wayfare take this milk and drink it And when ye have drunken thereof ye will become blind like us Said I to myself There is no escape for us but by contrivance So I dug a hole in the ground and sat over it After an hour or so in came the accursed Ghul with bowls of milk whereof he gave to each of us saying Ye come from the desert and are athirst so take this milk and drink it whilst I roast you the flesh I took the cup and carried it to my mouth but emptied it into the hole then I cried out Alas my sight is gone and I am blind and clapping my hand to my eyes fell a weeping and a wailing whilst the accursed laughed and said Fear not thou art now become like mine other guests But as for my two comrades they drank the milk and became blind Thereupon the Ghul arose and stopping up the mouth of the cavern came to me and felt my ribs but found me lean and with no flesh on my bones so he tried another and finding him fat rejoiced Then he slaughtered three sheep and skinned them and fetching iron spits spitted the flesh thereon and set them over the fire to roast When the meat was done he placed it before my comrades who ate and he with them after which he brought a leather bag full of wine and drank thereof and lay down prone and snored Said I to myself He s drowned in sleep how shall I slay him Then I bethought me of the spits and thrusting two of them into the fire waited till they were as red hot coals whereupon I arose and girded myself and taking a spit in each hand went up to the accursed Ghul and thrust them into his eyes pressing upon them with all my might He sprang to his feet for sweet life and would have laid hold of me but he was blind So I fled from him into the inner cavern whilst he ran after me but I found no place of refuge from him nor whence I might escape into the open country for the cave was stopped up with stones wherefore I was bewildered and said to the blind men How shall I do with this accursed Replied one of them O Sa id with a run and a spring mount up to yonder niche FN four hundred forty two and thou wilt find there a sharpened scymitar of copper bring it to me and I will tell thee what to do So I clombed to the niche and taking the blade returned to the blind man who said to me Smite him with the sword in his middle and he will die forthright So I rushed after the Ghul who was weary with running after me and felt for the blind men that he might kill them and coming up to him smote him with the sword a single stroke across his waist and he fell in twain then he screamed and cried out to me O man an thou desire to slay me strike me a second stroke Accordingly I was about to smite him another cut but he who had directed me to the niche and the scymitar said Smite him not a second time for then he will not die but will live and destroy us And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Seven Hundred and Seventy third Night She resumed It hath reached me O auspicious King that Sa id continued Now when I struck the Ghul with the sword he cried out to me O man an thou desire to slay me strike me a second stroke I was about so to do when he who had directed me to the scymitar said Smite him not a second time for then he will not die but will live and destroy us So I held my hand as he bade me and the Ghul died Then said the blind man to me Open the mouth of the cave and let us fare forth so haply Allah may help us and bring us to rest from this place And I said No harm can come to us now let us rather abide here and repose and eat of these sheep and drink of this wine for long is the land Accordingly we tarried there two months eating of the sheep and of the fruits of the island and drinking the generous grape juice till it so chanced one day as we sat upon the beach we caught sight of a ship looming large in the distance so we made signs for the crew and holla d to them They feared to draw near knowing that the island was inhabited by a Ghul FN four hundred forty three who ate Adamites and would have sheered off but we ran down to the marge of the sea and made signs to them with our turband ends and shouted to them whereupon one of the sailors who was sharp of sight said to the rest Harkye comrades I see these men formed lke ourselves for they have not the fashion of Ghuls So they made for us little by little till they drew near us in the dinghy FN four hundred forty four and were certified that we were indeed human beings when they saluted us and we returned their salam and gave them the glad tidings of the slaying of the accursed wherefore they thanked us Then we carried to the ship all that was in the cave of stuffs and sheep and treasure together with a viaticum of the island fruits such as should serve us days and months and embarking sailed on with a fair breeze three days at the end of which the wind veered round against us and the air became exceeding dark nor had an hour passed before the wind drave the craft on to a rock where it broke up and its planks were torn asunder FN four hundred forty five However the Great God decreed that I should lay hold of one of the planks which I bestrode and it bore me along two days for the wind had fallen fair again and I paddled with my feet awhile till Allah the Most High brought me safe ashore and I landed and came to this city where I found myself a stranger solitary friendless not knowing what to do for hunger was sore upon me and I was in great tribulation Thereupon I O my brother hid myself and pulling off this my tunic carried it to the market saying in my mind I will sell it and live on its price till Allah accomplish to me whatso he will accomplish Then I took the tunic in my hand and cried it for sale and the folk were looking at it and bidding for it when O my brother thou camest by and seeing me commandedst me to the palace but thy pages arrested and thrust me into the prison and there I abode till thou bethoughtest thee of me and badst bring me before thee So now I have told thee what befel me and Alhamdolillah Glorified be God for reunion Much marvelled the two Kings at Sa id s tale and Taj al Muluk having made ready a goodly dwelling for Sayf al Muluk and his Wazir Daulat Khatun used to visit the Prince there and thank him for his favours and talk with him One day he met her and said to her O my lady where is the promise thou madest me in the palace of Japhet son of Noah saying Were I with my people I would make shift to bring thee to thy desire And Sa id said to her O Princess I crave thine aid to enable him to win his will Answered she Yea verily I will do my endeavour for him that he may attain his aim if it please Allah Almighty And she turned to Sayf al Muluk and said to him Be of good cheer and keep thine eyes cool and clear Then she rose and going in to her mother said to her Come with me forthright and let us purify ourselves and make fumigations FN four hundred forty six that Badi a al Jamal and her mother may come and see me and rejoice in me Answered the Queen With love and goodly gree and rising betook herself to the garden and burnt off these perfumes which she always had by her nor was it long before Badi a al Jamal and her mother made their appearance The Queen of Hind foregathered with the other Queen and acquainted her with her daughter s safe return whereat she rejoiced and rejoiced in each other Then they pitched the pavilions FN four hundred forty seven and dressed dainty viands and made ready the place of entertainment whilst the two Princesses withdrew to a tent apart and ate together and drank and made merry after which they sat down to converse and Badi a al Jamal said What hath befallen thee in thy strangerhood Replied Daulat Khatun O my sister how sad is severance and how gladsome is reunion ask me not what hath befallen me Oh what hardships mortals suffer cried she How so and the other said to her O my sister I was inmured in the High builded Castle of Japhet son of Noah whither the son of the Blue King carried me off till Sayf al Muluk slew the Jinni and brought me back to my sire and she told her to boot all that the Prince had undergone of hardships and horrors before he came to the Castle FN four hundred forty eight Badi a al Jamal marvelled at her tale and said By Allah O my sister this is the most wondrous of wonders This Sayf al Muluk is indeed a man But why did he leave his father and mother and betake himself to travel and expose himself to these perils Quoth Daulat Khatun I have a mind to tell thee the first part of his history but shame of thee hindereth me therefrom Quoth Badi a al Jamal Why shouldst thou have shame of me seeing that thou art my sister and my bosom friend and there is muchel a matter between thee and me and I know thou willest me naught but well Tell me then what thou hast to say and be not abashed at me and hide nothing from me and have no fear of consequences Answered Daulat Khatun By Allah all the calamities that have betided this unfortunate have been on thine account and because of thee Asked Badi a al Jamal How so O my sister and the other answered Know that he saw thy portrait wrought on a tunic which thy father sent to Solomon son of David on the twain be peace and he opened it not neither looked at it but despatched it with other presents and rarities to Asim bin Safwan King of Egypt who gave it still unopened to his son Sayf al Muluk The Prince unfolded the tunic thinking to put it on and seeing thy portrait became enamoured of it wherefore he came forth in quest of thee and left his folk and reign and suffered all these terrors and hardships on thine account And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Seven Hundred and Seventy fourth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that Daulat Khatun related to Badi a al Jamal the first part of Sayf al Muluk s history how his love for her was caused by the tunic whereon her presentment was wrought how he went forth passion distraught in quest of her how he forsook his people and his kingdom for her sake and how he had suffered all these terrors and hardships on her account When Badi a al Jamal hear this she blushed rosy red and was confounded at Daulat Khatun and said Verily this may never never be for man accordeth not with the Jann Then Daulat Khatun went on to praise Sayf al Muluk and extol his comeliness and courage and cavalarice and ceased not repeating her memories of his prowess and his excellent qualities till she ended with saying For the sake of Almighty Allah and of me O sister mine come and speak with him though but one word But Badi a al Jamal cried By Allah O sister mine this that thou sayest I will not hear neither will I assent to thee therein and it was as if she heard naught of what the other said and as if no love of Sayf al Muluk and his beauty and bearing and bravery had gotten hold upon her heart Then Daulat Khatun humbled herself and said O Badi a al Jamal by the milk we have sucked I and thou and by that which is graven on the seal ring of Solomon on whom be peace hearken to these my words for I pledged myself in the High builded Castle of Japhet to show him thy face So Allah upon thee show it to him once for the love of me and look thyself on him And she ceased not to weep and implore her and kiss her hands and feet till she consented and said For thy sake I will show him my face once and he shall have a single glance With that Daulat Khatun s heart was gladdened and she kissed her hands and feet Then she went forth and fared to the great pavilion in the garden and bade her slave women spread it with carpets and set up a couch of gold and place the wine vessels in order after which she went into Sayf al Muluk and to his Wazir Sa id whom she found seated in their lodging and gave the Prince the glad tidings of the winning of his wish saying Go to the pavilion in the garden thou and thy brother and hide yourselves there from the eyes of men so none in the palace may espy you till I come to you with Badi a al Jamal So they rose and repaired to the appointed pavilion where they found the couch of gold set and furnished with cushions and meat and wine ready served So they sat awhile whilst Sayf al Muluk bethought him of his beloved and his breast was straitened and love and longing assailed him wherefore he rose and walked forth from the vestibule of the pavilion Sa id would have followed him but he said to him O my brother follow me not but sit in thy stead till I return to thee So Sa id abode seated whilst Sayf al Muluk went down into the garden drunken with the wine of desire and distracted for excess of love longing and passion fire yearning agitated him and transport overcame him and he recited these couplets O passing Fair FN four hundred forty nine I have none else but thee Pity this slave in thy love s slavery Thou art my search my joy and my desire None save thyself shall love this heart of me Would Heaven I knew thou knewest of my wails Night long and eyelids oped by memory Bid sleep to soourn on these eyen lids Haply in vision I thy sight shall see Show favour then to one thus love distraught Save him from ruin by thy cruelty Allah increase thy beauty and thy weal And be thy ransom every enemy So shall on Doomsday lovers range beneath Thy flag and beauties neath thy banner be Then he wept and recited these also That rarest beauty ever bides my foe Who holds my heart and lurks in secresy Speaking I speak of nothing save her charms And when I m dumb in heart core woneth she Then he wept sore and recited the following And in my liver higher flames the fire You are my wish and longsome still I yearn To you none other bend I and I hope Lovers long suffering are your grace to earn And that you pity me whose frame by Love Is waste and weak his heart with sore concern Relent be general rous tender hearted kind From you I ll ne er remove from you ne er turn Then he wept and recited these also Came to me care when came the love of thee Cruel sleep fled me like thy cruelty Tells me the messenger that thou are wroth Allah forfend what evils told me he Presently Sa id waxed weary of awaiting him and going forth in quest of him found him walking in the garden distraught and reciting these two couplets By Allah by th Almighty by his right FN four hundred fifty Who read the Koran Chapter Fatir FN four hundred fifty one hight Ne er roam my glances o er the charms I see Thy grace rare beauty is my talk by night So he joined him and the twain walked about the garden together solacing themselves and ate of its fruits Such was their case FN four hundred fifty two but as regards the two Princesses they came to the pavilion and entering therein after the eunuchs had richly furnished it according to command sat down on the couch of gold beside which was a window that gave upon the garden The castratos then set before them all manner rich meats and they ate Daulat Khatun feeding her foster sister by mouthfuls FN four hundred fifty three till she was satisfied when she called for divers kinds of sweetmeats and when the neutrals brought them they ate what they would of them and washed their hands After this Daulat Khatun made ready wine and its service setting on the ewers and bowls and she proceeded to crown the cups and give Badi a al amal to drink filling for herself after and drinking in turn The Badi a al Jamal looked from the window into the garden and gazed upon the fruits and branches that were therein till her glance fell on Sayf al Muluk and she saw him wandering about the parterres followed by Sa id and she heard him recite verses raining the while railing tears And that glance of eyes cost her a thousand signs And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Seven Hundred and Seventy fifth Night She continued It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Badi a al Jamal caught sight of Sayf al Muluk as he wandered about the garden that glance of eyes cost her a thousand sighs and she turned to Daulat Khatun and said to her and indeed the wine sported with her senses O my sister who is that young man I see in the garden distraught love abying disappointed sighing Quoth the other Dost thou give me leave to bring him hither that we may look on him and quoth the other An thou can avail to bring him bring him So Daulat Khatun called to him saying O King s son come up to us and bring us thy beauty and thy loveliness Sayf al Muluk recognised her voice and came up to into the pavilion but no sooner had he set eyes on Badi a al Jamal than he fell down in a swoon whereupon Daulat Khatun sprinkled on him a little rose water and he revived Then he rose and kissed ground before Badi a al Jamal who was amazed at his beauty and loveliness and Daulat Khatun said to her Know O Princess that this is Sayf al Muluk whose hand saved me by the ordinance of Allah Almighty and he it is who hath borne all manner burthens on thine account wherefore I would have thee look upon him with favour Hearing this Badi a al Jamal laughed and said And who keepeth faith that this youth should do so For there is no true love in men Cried Sayf al Muluk O Princess never shall lack of faith be in me and all men are not created alike And he wept before her and recited these verses O thou Badi a l Jamal show thou some clemency To one those lovely eyes opprest with witchery By rights of beauteous hues and tints thy cheeks combine Of snowy white and glowing red anemone Punish not with disdain one who is sorely sick By long long parting waste hath waxed this frame of me This is my wish my will the end of my desire And Union is my hope an haply this may be Then he wept with violent weeping and love and longing got the mastery over him and he greeted her with these couplets Peace be to you from lover s wasted love All noble hearts to noble favour show Peace be to you Ne er fail your form my dreams
