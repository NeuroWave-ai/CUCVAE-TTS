CONTENTS THE LADY WITH THE DOG A DOCTOR S VISIT AN UPHEAVAL IONITCH THE HEAD OF THE FAMILY THE BLACK MONK VOLODYA AN ANONYMOUS STORY THE HUSBAND THE LADY WITH THE DOG I IT was said that a new person had appeared on the sea front a lady with a little dog Dmitri Dmitritch Gurov who had by then been a fortnight at Yalta and so was fairly at home there had begun to take an interest in new arrivals Sitting in Verney s pavilion he saw walking on the sea front a fair haired young lady of medium height wearing a beret a white Pomeranian dog was running behind her And afterwards he met her in the public gardens and in the square several times a day She was walking alone always wearing the same beret and always with the same white dog no one knew who she was and every one called her simply the lady with the dog If she is here alone without a husband or friends it wouldn t be amiss to make her acquaintance Gurov reflected He was under forty but he had a daughter already twelve years old and two sons at school He had been married young when he was a student in his second year and by now his wife seemed half as old again as he She was a tall erect woman with dark eyebrows staid and dignified and as she said of herself intellectual She read a great deal used phonetic spelling called her husband not Dmitri but Dimitri and he secretly considered her unintelligent narrow inelegant was afraid of her and did not like to be at home He had begun being unfaithful to her long ago had been unfaithful to her often and probably on that account almost always spoke ill of women and when they were talked about in his presence used to call them the lower race It seemed to him that he had been so schooled by bitter experience that he might call them what he liked and yet he could not get on for two days together without the lower race In the society of men he was bored and not himself with them he was cold and uncommunicative but when he was in the company of women he felt free and knew what to say to them and how to behave and he was at ease with them even when he was silent In his appearance in his character in his whole nature there was something attractive and elusive which allured women and disposed them in his favour he knew that and some force seemed to draw him too to them Experience often repeated truly bitter experience had taught him long ago that with decent people especially Moscow people always slow to move and irresolute every intimacy which at first so agreeably diversifies life and appears a light and charming adventure inevitably grows into a regular problem of extreme intricacy and in the long run the situation becomes unbearable But at every fresh meeting with an interesting woman this experience seemed to slip out of his memory and he was eager for life and everything seemed simple and amusing One evening he was dining in the gardens and the lady in the beret came up slowly to take the next table Her expression her gait her dress and the way she did her hair told him that she was a lady that she was married that she was in Yalta for the first time and alone and that she was dull there The stories told of the immorality in such places as Yalta are to a great extent untrue he despised them and knew that such stories were for the most part made up by persons who would themselves have been glad to sin if they had been able but when the lady sat down at the next table three paces from him he remembered these tales of easy conquests of trips to the mountains and the tempting thought of a swift fleeting love affair a romance with an unknown woman whose name he did not know suddenly took possession of him He beckoned coaxingly to the Pomeranian and when the dog came up to him he shook his finger at it The Pomeranian growled Gurov shook his finger at it again The lady looked at him and at once dropped her eyes He doesn t bite she said and blushed May I give him a bone he asked and when she nodded he asked courteously Have you been long in Yalta Five days And I have already dragged out a fortnight here There was a brief silence Time goes fast and yet it is so dull here she said not looking at him That s only the fashion to say it is dull here A provincial will live in Belyov or Zhidra and not be dull and when he comes here it s Oh the dulness Oh the dust One would think he came from Grenada She laughed Then both continued eating in silence like strangers but after dinner they walked side by side and there sprang up between them the light jesting conversation of people who are free and satisfied to whom it does not matter where they go or what they talk about They walked and talked of the strange light on the sea the water was of a soft warm lilac hue and there was a golden streak from the moon upon it They talked of how sultry it was after a hot day Gurov told her that he came from Moscow that he had taken his degree in Arts but had a post in a bank that he had trained as an opera singer but had given it up that he owned two houses in Moscow And from her he learnt that she had grown up in Petersburg but had lived in S since her marriage two years before that she was staying another month in Yalta and that her husband who needed a holiday too might perhaps come and fetch her She was not sure whether her husband had a post in a Crown Department or under the Provincial Council and was amused by her own ignorance And Gurov learnt too that she was called Anna Sergeyevna Afterwards he thought about her in his room at the hotel thought she would certainly meet him next day it would be sure to happen As he got into bed he thought how lately she had been a girl at school doing lessons like his own daughter he recalled the diffidence the angularity that was still manifest in her laugh and her manner of talking with a stranger This must have been the first time in her life she had been alone in surroundings in which she was followed looked at and spoken to merely from a secret motive which she could hardly fail to guess He recalled her slender delicate neck her lovely grey eyes There s something pathetic about her anyway he thought and fell asleep II A week had passed since they had made acquaintance It was a holiday It was sultry indoors while in the street the wind whirled the dust round and round and blew people s hats off It was a thirsty day and Gurov often went into the pavilion and pressed Anna Sergeyevna to have syrup and water or an ice One did not know what to do with oneself In the evening when the wind had dropped a little they went out on the groyne to see the steamer come in There were a great many people walking about the harbour they had gathered to welcome some one bringing bouquets And two peculiarities of a well dressed Yalta crowd were very conspicuous the elderly ladies were dressed like young ones and there were great numbers of generals Owing to the roughness of the sea the steamer arrived late after the sun had set and it was a long time turning about before it reached the groyne Anna Sergeyevna looked through her lorgnette at the steamer and the passengers as though looking for acquaintances and when she turned to Gurov her eyes were shining She talked a great deal and asked disconnected questions forgetting next moment what she had asked then she dropped her lorgnette in the crush The festive crowd began to disperse it was too dark to see people s faces The wind had completely dropped but Gurov and Anna Sergeyevna still stood as though waiting to see some one else come from the steamer Anna Sergeyevna was silent now and sniffed the flowers without looking at Gurov The weather is better this evening he said Where shall we go now Shall we drive somewhere She made no answer Then he looked at her intently and all at once put his arm round her and kissed her on the lips and breathed in the moisture and the fragrance of the flowers and he immediately looked round him anxiously wondering whether any one had seen them Let us go to your hotel he said softly And both walked quickly The room was close and smelt of the scent she had bought at the Japanese shop Gurov looked at her and thought What different people one meets in the world From the past he preserved memories of careless good natured women who loved cheerfully and were grateful to him for the happiness he gave them however brief it might be and of women like his wife who loved without any genuine feeling with superfluous phrases affectedly hysterically with an expression that suggested that it was not love nor passion but something more significant and of two or three others very beautiful cold women on whose faces he had caught a glimpse of a rapacious expression an obstinate desire to snatch from life more than it could give and these were capricious unreflecting domineering unintelligent women not in their first youth and when Gurov grew cold to them their beauty excited his hatred and the lace on their linen seemed to him like scales But in this case there was still the diffidence the angularity of inexperienced youth an awkward feeling and there was a sense of consternation as though some one had suddenly knocked at the door The attitude of Anna Sergeyevna the lady with the dog to what had happened was somehow peculiar very grave as though it were her fall so it seemed and it was strange and inappropriate Her face dropped and faded and on both sides of it her long hair hung down mournfully she mused in a dejected attitude like the woman who was a sinner in an old fashioned picture It s wrong she said You will be the first to despise me now There was a water melon on the table Gurov cut himself a slice and began eating it without haste There followed at least half an hour of silence Anna Sergeyevna was touching there was about her the purity of a good simple woman who had seen little of life The solitary candle burning on the table threw a faint light on her face yet it was clear that she was very unhappy How could I despise you asked Gurov You don t know what you are saying God forgive me she said and her eyes filled with tears It s awful You seem to feel you need to be forgiven Forgiven No I am a bad low woman I despise myself and don t attempt to justify myself It s not my husband but myself I have deceived And not only just now I have been deceiving myself for a long time My husband may be a good honest man but he is a flunkey I don t know what he does there what his work is but I know he is a flunkey I was twenty when I was married to him I have been tormented by curiosity I wanted something better There must be a different sort of life I said to myself I wanted to live To live to live I was fired by curiosity you don t understand it but I swear to God I could not control myself something happened to me I could not be restrained I told my husband I was ill and came here And here I have been walking about as though I were dazed like a mad creature and now I have become a vulgar contemptible woman whom any one may despise Gurov felt bored already listening to her He was irritated by the naive tone by this remorse so unexpected and inopportune but for the tears in her eyes he might have thought she was jesting or playing a part I don t understand he said softly What is it you want She hid her face on his breast and pressed close to him Believe me believe me I beseech you she said I love a pure honest life and sin is loathsome to me I don t know what I am doing Simple people say The Evil One has beguiled me And I may say of myself now that the Evil One has beguiled me Hush hush he muttered He looked at her fixed scared eyes kissed her talked softly and affectionately and by degrees she was comforted and her gaiety returned they both began laughing Afterwards when they went out there was not a soul on the sea front The town with its cypresses had quite a deathlike air but the sea still broke noisily on the shore a single barge was rocking on the waves and a lantern was blinking sleepily on it They found a cab and drove to Oreanda I found out your surname in the hall just now it was written on the board Von Diderits said Gurov Is your husband a German No I believe his grandfather was a German but he is an Orthodox Russian himself At Oreanda they sat on a seat not far from the church looked down at the sea and were silent Yalta was hardly visible through the morning mist white clouds stood motionless on the mountain tops The leaves did not stir on the trees grasshoppers chirruped and the monotonous hollow sound of the sea rising up from below spoke of the peace of the eternal sleep awaiting us So it must have sounded when there was no Yalta no Oreanda here so it sounds now and it will sound as indifferently and monotonously when we are all no more And in this constancy in this complete indifference to the life and death of each of us there lies hid perhaps a pledge of our eternal salvation of the unceasing movement of life upon earth of unceasing progress towards perfection Sitting beside a young woman who in the dawn seemed so lovely soothed and spellbound in these magical surroundings the sea mountains clouds the open sky Gurov thought how in reality everything is beautiful in this world when one reflects everything except what we think or do ourselves when we forget our human dignity and the higher aims of our existence A man walked up to them probably a keeper looked at them and walked away And this detail seemed mysterious and beautiful too They saw a steamer come from Theodosia with its lights out in the glow of dawn There is dew on the grass said Anna Sergeyevna after a silence Yes It s time to go home They went back to the town Then they met every day at twelve o clock on the sea front lunched and dined together went for walks admired the sea She complained that she slept badly that her heart throbbed violently asked the same questions troubled now by jealousy and now by the fear that he did not respect her sufficiently And often in the square or gardens when there was no one near them he suddenly drew her to him and kissed her passionately Complete idleness these kisses in broad daylight while he looked round in dread of some one s seeing them the heat the smell of the sea and the continual passing to and fro before him of idle well dressed well fed people made a new man of him he told Anna Sergeyevna how beautiful she was how fascinating He was impatiently passionate he would not move a step away from her while she was often pensive and continually urged him to confess that he did not respect her did not love her in the least and thought of her as nothing but a common woman Rather late almost every evening they drove somewhere out of town to Oreanda or to the waterfall and the expedition was always a success the scenery invariably impressed them as grand and beautiful They were expecting her husband to come but a letter came from him saying that there was something wrong with his eyes and he entreated his wife to come home as quickly as possible Anna Sergeyevna made haste to go It s a good thing I am going away she said to Gurov It s the finger of destiny She went by coach and he went with her They were driving the whole day When she had got into a compartment of the express and when the second bell had rung she said Let me look at you once more look at you once again That s right She did not shed tears but was so sad that she seemed ill and her face was quivering I shall remember you think of you she said God be with you be happy Don t remember evil against me We are parting forever it must be so for we ought never to have met Well God be with you The train moved off rapidly its lights soon vanished from sight and a minute later there was no sound of it as though everything had conspired together to end as quickly as possible that sweet delirium that madness Left alone on the platform and gazing into the dark distance Gurov listened to the chirrup of the grasshoppers and the hum of the telegraph wires feeling as though he had only just waked up And he thought musing that there had been another episode or adventure in his life and it too was at an end and nothing was left of it but a memory He was moved sad and conscious of a slight remorse This young woman whom he would never meet again had not been happy with him he was genuinely warm and affectionate with her but yet in his manner his tone and his caresses there had been a shade of light irony the coarse condescension of a happy man who was besides almost twice her age All the time she had called him kind exceptional lofty obviously he had seemed to her different from what he really was so he had unintentionally deceived her Here at the station was already a scent of autumn it was a cold evening It s time for me to go north thought Gurov as he left the platform High time III At home in Moscow everything was in its winter routine the stoves were heated and in the morning it was still dark when the children were having breakfast and getting ready for school and the nurse would light the lamp for a short time The frosts had begun already When the first snow has fallen on the first day of sledge driving it is pleasant to see the white earth the white roofs to draw soft delicious breath and the season brings back the days of one s youth The old limes and birches white with hoar frost have a good natured expression they are nearer to one s heart than cypresses and palms and near them one doesn t want to be thinking of the sea and the mountains Gurov was Moscow born he arrived in Moscow on a fine frosty day and when he put on his fur coat and warm gloves and walked along Petrovka and when on Saturday evening he heard the ringing of the bells his recent trip and the places he had seen lost all charm for him Little by little he became absorbed in Moscow life greedily read three newspapers a day and declared he did not read the Moscow papers on principle He already felt a longing to go to restaurants clubs dinner parties anniversary celebrations and he felt flattered at entertaining distinguished lawyers and artists and at playing cards with a professor at the doctors club He could already eat a whole plateful of salt fish and cabbage In another month he fancied the image of Anna Sergeyevna would be shrouded in a mist in his memory and only from time to time would visit him in his dreams with a touching smile as others did But more than a month passed real winter had come and everything was still clear in his memory as though he had parted with Anna Sergeyevna only the day before And his memories glowed more and more vividly When in the evening stillness he heard from his study the voices of his children preparing their lessons or when he listened to a song or the organ at the restaurant or the storm howled in the chimney suddenly everything would rise up in his memory what had happened on the groyne and the early morning with the mist on the mountains and the steamer coming from Theodosia and the kisses He would pace a long time about his room remembering it all and smiling then his memories passed into dreams and in his fancy the past was mingled with what was to come Anna Sergeyevna did not visit him in dreams but followed him about everywhere like a shadow and haunted him When he shut his eyes he saw her as though she were living before him and she seemed to him lovelier younger tenderer than she was and he imagined himself finer than he had been in Yalta In the evenings she peeped out at him from the bookcase from the fireplace from the corner he heard her breathing the caressing rustle of her dress In the street he watched the women looking for some one like her He was tormented by an intense desire to confide his memories to some one But in his home it was impossible to talk of his love and he had no one outside he could not talk to his tenants nor to any one at the bank And what had he to talk of Had he been in love then Had there been anything beautiful poetical or edifying or simply interesting in his relations with Anna Sergeyevna And there was nothing for him but to talk vaguely of love of woman and no one guessed what it meant only his wife twitched her black eyebrows and said The part of a lady killer does not suit you at all Dimitri One evening coming out of the doctors club with an official with whom he had been playing cards he could not resist saying If only you knew what a fascinating woman I made the acquaintance of in Yalta The official got into his sledge and was driving away but turned suddenly and shouted Dmitri Dmitritch What You were right this evening the sturgeon was a bit too strong These words so ordinary for some reason moved Gurov to indignation and struck him as degrading and unclean What savage manners what people What senseless nights what uninteresting uneventful days The rage for card playing the gluttony the drunkenness the continual talk always about the same thing Useless pursuits and conversations always about the same things absorb the better part of one s time the better part of one s strength and in the end there is left a life grovelling and curtailed worthless and trivial and there is no escaping or getting away from it just as though one were in a madhouse or a prison Gurov did not sleep all night and was filled with indignation And he had a headache all next day And the next night he slept badly he sat up in bed thinking or paced up and down his room He was sick of his children sick of the bank he had no desire to go anywhere or to talk of anything In the holidays in December he prepared for a journey and told his wife he was going to Petersburg to do something in the interests of a young friend and he set off for S What for He did not very well know himself He wanted to see Anna Sergeyevna and to talk with her to arrange a meeting if possible He reached S in the morning and took the best room at the hotel in which the floor was covered with grey army cloth and on the table was an inkstand grey with dust and adorned with a figure on horseback with its hat in its hand and its head broken off The hotel porter gave him the necessary information Von Diderits lived in a house of his own in Old Gontcharny Street it was not far from the hotel he was rich and lived in good style and had his own horses every one in the town knew him The porter pronounced the name Dridirits Gurov went without haste to Old Gontcharny Street and found the house Just opposite the house stretched a long grey fence adorned with nails One would run away from a fence like that thought Gurov looking from the fence to the windows of the house and back again He considered to day was a holiday and the husband would probably be at home And in any case it would be tactless to go into the house and upset her If he were to send her a note it might fall into her husband s hands and then it might ruin everything The best thing was to trust to chance And he kept walking up and down the street by the fence waiting for the chance He saw a beggar go in at the gate and dogs fly at him then an hour later he heard a piano and the sounds were faint and indistinct Probably it was Anna Sergeyevna playing The front door suddenly opened and an old woman came out followed by the familiar white Pomeranian Gurov was on the point of calling to the dog but his heart began beating violently and in his excitement he could not remember the dog s name He walked up and down and loathed the grey fence more and more and by now he thought irritably that Anna Sergeyevna had forgotten him and was perhaps already amusing herself with some one else and that that was very natural in a young woman who had nothing to look at from morning till night but that confounded fence He went back to his hotel room and sat for a long while on the sofa not knowing what to do then he had dinner and a long nap How stupid and worrying it is he thought when he woke and looked at the dark windows it was already evening Here I ve had a good sleep for some reason What shall I do in the night He sat on the bed which was covered by a cheap grey blanket such as one sees in hospitals and he taunted himself in his vexation So much for the lady with the dog so much for the adventure You re in a nice fix That morning at the station a poster in large letters had caught his eye The Geisha was to be performed for the first time He thought of this and went to the theatre It s quite possible she may go to the first performance he thought The theatre was full As in all provincial theatres there was a fog above the chandelier the gallery was noisy and restless in the front row the local dandies were standing up before the beginning of the performance with their hands behind them in the Governor s box the Governor s daughter wearing a boa was sitting in the front seat while the Governor himself lurked modestly behind the curtain with only his hands visible the orchestra was a long time tuning up the stage curtain swayed All the time the audience were coming in and taking their seats Gurov looked at them eagerly Anna Sergeyevna too came in She sat down in the third row and when Gurov looked at her his heart contracted and he understood clearly that for him there was in the whole world no creature so near so precious and so important to him she this little woman in no way remarkable lost in a provincial crowd with a vulgar lorgnette in her hand filled his whole life now was his sorrow and his joy the one happiness that he now desired for himself and to the sounds of the inferior orchestra of the wretched provincial violins he thought how lovely she was He thought and dreamed A young man with small side whiskers tall and stooping came in with Anna Sergeyevna and sat down beside her he bent his head at every step and seemed to be continually bowing Most likely this was the husband whom at Yalta in a rush of bitter feeling she had called a flunkey And there really was in his long figure his side whiskers and the small bald patch on his head something of the flunkey s obsequiousness his smile was sugary and in his buttonhole there was some badge of distinction like the number on a waiter During the first interval the husband went away to smoke she remained alone in her stall Gurov who was sitting in the stalls too went up to her and said in a trembling voice with a forced smile Good evening She glanced at him and turned pale then glanced again with horror unable to believe her eyes and tightly gripped the fan and the lorgnette in her hands evidently struggling with herself not to faint Both were silent She was sitting he was standing frightened by her confusion and not venturing to sit down beside her The violins and the flute began tuning up He felt suddenly frightened it seemed as though all the people in the boxes were looking at them She got up and went quickly to the door he followed her and both walked senselessly along passages and up and down stairs and figures in legal scholastic and civil service uniforms all wearing badges flitted before their eyes They caught glimpses of ladies of fur coats hanging on pegs the draughts blew on them bringing a smell of stale tobacco And Gurov whose heart was beating violently thought Oh heavens

667_107247_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 Why 
none	none	are these people here and this orchestra And at that instant he recalled how when he had seen Anna Sergeyevna off at the station he had thought that everything was over and they would never meet again But how far they were still from the end On the narrow gloomy staircase over which was written To the Amphitheatre she stopped How you have frightened me she said breathing hard still pale and overwhelmed Oh how you have frightened me I am half dead Why have you come Why But do understand Anna do understand he said hastily in a low voice I entreat you to understand She looked at him with dread with entreaty with love she looked at him intently to keep his features more distinctly in her memory I am so unhappy she went on not heeding him I have thought of nothing but you all the time I live only in the thought of you And I wanted to forget to forget you but why oh why have you come On the landing above them two schoolboys were smoking and looking down but that was nothing to Gurov he drew Anna Sergeyevna to him and began kissing her face her cheeks and her hands What are you doing what are you doing she cried in horror pushing him away We are mad Go away to day go away at once I beseech you by all that is sacred I implore you There are people coming this way Some one was coming up the stairs You must go away Anna Sergeyevna went on in a whisper Do you hear Dmitri Dmitritch I will come and see you in Moscow I have never been happy I am miserable now and I never never shall be happy never Don t make me suffer still more I swear I ll come to Moscow But now let us part My precious good dear one we must part She pressed his hand and began rapidly going downstairs looking round at him and from her eyes he could see that she really was unhappy Gurov stood for a little while listened then when all sound had died away he found his coat and left the theatre IV And Anna Sergeyevna began coming to see him in Moscow Once in two or three months she left S telling her husband that she was going to consult a doctor about an internal complaint and her husband believed her and did not believe her In Moscow she stayed at the Slaviansky Bazaar hotel and at once sent a man in a red cap to Gurov Gurov went to see her and no one in Moscow knew of it Once he was going to see her in this way on a winter morning the messenger had come the evening before when he was out With him walked his daughter whom he wanted to take to school it was on the way Snow was falling in big wet flakes It s three degrees above freezing point and yet it is snowing said Gurov to his daughter The thaw is only on the surface of the earth there is quite a different temperature at a greater height in the atmosphere And why are there no thunderstorms in the winter father He explained that too He talked thinking all the while that he was going to see her and no living soul knew of it and probably never would know He had two lives one open seen and known by all who cared to know full of relative truth and of relative falsehood exactly like the lives of his friends and acquaintances and another life running its course in secret And through some strange perhaps accidental conjunction of circumstances everything that was essential of interest and of value to him everything in which he was sincere and did not deceive himself everything that made the kernel of his life was hidden from other people and all that was false in him the sheath in which he hid himself to conceal the truth such for instance as his work in the bank his discussions at the club his lower race his presence with his wife at anniversary festivities all that was open And he judged of others by himself not believing in what he saw and always believing that every man had his real most interesting life under the cover of secrecy and under the cover of night All personal life rested on secrecy and possibly it was partly on that account that civilised man was so nervously anxious that personal privacy should be respected After leaving his daughter at school Gurov went on to the Slaviansky Bazaar He took off his fur coat below went upstairs and softly knocked at the door Anna Sergeyevna wearing his favourite grey dress exhausted by the journey and the suspense had been expecting him since the evening before She was pale she looked at him and did not smile and he had hardly come in when she fell on his breast Their kiss was slow and prolonged as though they had not met for two years Well how are you getting on there he asked What news Wait I ll tell you directly I can t talk She could not speak she was crying She turned away from him and pressed her handkerchief to her eyes Let her have her cry out I ll sit down and wait he thought and he sat down in an arm chair Then he rang and asked for tea to be brought him and while he drank his tea she remained standing at the window with her back to him She was crying from emotion from the miserable consciousness that their life was so hard for them they could only meet in secret hiding themselves from people like thieves Was not their life shattered Come do stop he said It was evident to him that this love of theirs would not soon be over that he could not see the end of it Anna Sergeyevna grew more and more attached to him She adored him and it was unthinkable to say to her that it was bound to have an end some day besides she would not have believed it He went up to her and took her by the shoulders to say something affectionate and cheering and at that moment he saw himself in the looking glass His hair was already beginning to turn grey And it seemed strange to him that he had grown so much older so much plainer during the last few years The shoulders on which his hands rested were warm and quivering He felt compassion for this life still so warm and lovely but probably already not far from beginning to fade and wither like his own Why did she love him so much He always seemed to women different from what he was and they loved in him not himself but the man created by their imagination whom they had been eagerly seeking all their lives and afterwards when they noticed their mistake they loved him all the same And not one of them had been happy with him Time passed he had made their acquaintance got on with them parted but he had never once loved it was anything you like but not love And only now when his head was grey he had fallen properly really in love for the first time in his life Anna Sergeyevna and he loved each other like people very close and akin like husband and wife like tender friends it seemed to them that fate itself had meant them for one another and they could not understand why he had a wife and she a husband and it was as though they were a pair of birds of passage caught and forced to live in different cages They forgave each other for what they were ashamed of in their past they forgave everything in the present and felt that this love of theirs had changed them both In moments of depression in the past he had comforted himself with any arguments that came into his mind but now he no longer cared for arguments he felt profound compassion he wanted to be sincere and tender Don t cry my darling he said You ve had your cry that s enough Let us talk now let us think of some plan Then they spent a long while taking counsel together talked of how to avoid the necessity for secrecy for deception for living in different towns and not seeing each other for long at a time How could they be free from this intolerable bondage How How he asked clutching his head How And it seemed as though in a little while the solution would be found and then a new and splendid life would begin and it was clear to both of them that they had still a long long road before them and that the most complicated and difficult part of it was only just beginning A DOCTOR S VISIT THE Professor received a telegram from the Lyalikovs factory he was asked to come as quickly as possible The daughter of some Madame Lyalikov apparently the owner of the factory was ill and that was all that one could make out of the long incoherent telegram And the Professor did not go himself but sent instead his assistant Korolyov It was two stations from Moscow and there was a drive of three miles from the station A carriage with three horses had been sent to the station to meet Korolyov the coachman wore a hat with a peacock s feather on it and answered every question in a loud voice like a soldier No sir Certainly sir It was Saturday evening the sun was setting the workpeople were coming in crowds from the factory to the station and they bowed to the carriage in which Korolyov was driving And he was charmed with the evening the farmhouses and villas on the road and the birch trees and the quiet atmosphere all around when the fields and woods and the sun seemed preparing like the workpeople now on the eve of the holiday to rest and perhaps to pray He was born and had grown up in Moscow he did not know the country and he had never taken any interest in factories or been inside one but he had happened to read about factories and had been in the houses of manufacturers and had talked to them and whenever he saw a factory far or near he always thought how quiet and peaceable it was outside but within there was always sure to be impenetrable ignorance and dull egoism on the side of the owners wearisome unhealthy toil on the side of the workpeople squabbling vermin vodka And now when the workpeople timidly and respectfully made way for the carriage in their faces their caps their walk he read physical impurity drunkenness nervous exhaustion bewilderment They drove in at the factory gates On each side he caught glimpses of the little houses of workpeople of the faces of women of quilts and linen on the railings Look out shouted the coachman not pulling up the horses It was a wide courtyard without grass with five immense blocks of buildings with tall chimneys a little distance one from another warehouses and barracks and over everything a sort of grey powder as though from dust Here and there like oases in the desert there were pitiful gardens and the green and red roofs of the houses in which the managers and clerks lived The coachman suddenly pulled up the horses and the carriage stopped at the house which had been newly painted grey here was a flower garden with a lilac bush covered with dust and on the yellow steps at the front door there was a strong smell of paint Please come in doctor said women s voices in the passage and the entry and at the same time he heard sighs and whisperings Pray walk in We ve been expecting you so long we re in real trouble Here this way Madame Lyalikov a stout elderly lady wearing a black silk dress with fashionable sleeves but judging from her face a simple uneducated woman looked at the doctor in a flutter and could not bring herself to hold out her hand to him she did not dare Beside her stood a personage with short hair and a pince nez she was wearing a blouse of many colours and was very thin and no longer young The servants called her Christina Dmitryevna and Korolyov guessed that this was the governess Probably as the person of most education in the house she had been charged to meet and receive the doctor for she began immediately in great haste stating the causes of the illness giving trivial and tiresome details but without saying who was ill or what was the matter The doctor and the governess were sitting talking while the lady of the house stood motionless at the door waiting From the conversation Korolyov learned that the patient was Madame Lyalikov s only daughter and heiress a girl of twenty called Liza she had been ill for a long time and had consulted various doctors and the previous night she had suffered till morning from such violent palpitations of the heart that no one in the house had slept and they had been afraid she might die She has been one may say ailing from a child said Christina Dmitryevna in a sing song voice continually wiping her lips with her hand The doctors say it is nerves when she was a little girl she was scrofulous and the doctors drove it inwards so I think it may be due to that They went to see the invalid Fully grown up big and tall but ugly like her mother with the same little eyes and disproportionate breadth of the lower part of the face lying with her hair in disorder muffled up to the chin she made upon Korolyov at the first minute the impression of a poor destitute creature sheltered and cared for here out of charity and he could hardly believe that this was the heiress of the five huge buildings I am the doctor come to see you said Korolyov Good evening He mentioned his name and pressed her hand a large cold ugly hand she sat up and evidently accustomed to doctors let herself be sounded without showing the least concern that her shoulders and chest were uncovered I have palpitations of the heart she said It was so awful all night I almost died of fright Do give me something I will I will don t worry yourself Korolyov examined her and shrugged his shoulders The heart is all right he said it s all going on satisfactorily everything is in good order Your nerves must have been playing pranks a little but that s so common The attack is over by now one must suppose lie down and go to sleep At that moment a lamp was brought into the bed room The patient screwed up her eyes at the light then suddenly put her hands to her head and broke into sobs And the impression of a destitute ugly creature vanished and Korolyov no longer noticed the little eyes or the heavy development of the lower part of the face He saw a soft suffering expression which was intelligent and touching she seemed to him altogether graceful feminine and simple and he longed to soothe her not with drugs not with advice but with simple kindly words Her mother put her arms round her head and hugged her What despair what grief was in the old woman s face She her mother had reared her and brought her up spared nothing and devoted her whole life to having her daughter taught French dancing music had engaged a dozen teachers for her had consulted the best doctors kept a governess And now she could not make out the reason of these tears why there was all this misery she could not understand and was bewildered and she had a guilty agitated despairing expression as though she had omitted something very important had left something undone had neglected to call in somebody and whom she did not know Lizanka you are crying again again she said hugging her daughter to her My own my darling my child tell me what it is Have pity on me Tell me Both wept bitterly Korolyov sat down on the side of the bed and took Liza s hand Come give over it s no use crying he said kindly Why there is nothing in the world that is worth those tears Come we won t cry that s no good And inwardly he thought It s high time she was married Our doctor at the factory gave her kalibromati said the governess but I notice it only makes her worse I should have thought that if she is given anything for the heart it ought to be drops I forget the name Convallaria isn t it And there followed all sorts of details She interrupted the doctor preventing his speaking and there was a look of effort on her face as though she supposed that as the woman of most education in the house she was duty bound to keep up a conversation with the doctor and on no other subject but medicine Korolyov felt bored I find nothing special the matter he said addressing the mother as he went out of the bedroom If your daughter is being attended by the factory doctor let him go on attending her The treatment so far has been perfectly correct and I see no reason for changing your doctor Why change It s such an ordinary trouble there s nothing seriously wrong He spoke deliberately as he put on his gloves while Madame Lyalikov stood without moving and looked at him with her tearful eyes I have half an hour to catch the ten o clock train he said I hope I am not too late And can t you stay she asked and tears trickled down her cheeks again I am ashamed to trouble you but if you would be so good For God s sake she went on in an undertone glancing towards the door do stay to night with us She is all I have my only daughter She frightened me last night I can t get over it Don t go away for goodness sake He wanted to tell her that he had a great deal of work in Moscow that his family were expecting him home it was disagreeable to him to spend the evening and the whole night in a strange house quite needlessly but he looked at her face heaved a sigh and began taking off his gloves without a word All the lamps and candles were lighted in his honour in the drawing room and the dining room He sat down at the piano and began turning over the music Then he looked at the pictures on the walls at the portraits The pictures oil paintings in gold frames were views of the Crimea a stormy sea with a ship a Catholic monk with a wineglass they were all dull smooth daubs with no trace of talent in them There was not a single good looking face among the portraits nothing but broad cheekbones and astonished looking eyes Lyalikov Liza s father had a low forehead and a self satisfied expression his uniform sat like a sack on his bulky plebeian figure on his breast was a medal and a Red Cross Badge There was little sign of culture and the luxury was senseless and haphazard and was as ill fitting as that uniform The floors irritated him with their brilliant polish the lustres on the chandelier irritated him and he was reminded for some reason of the story of the merchant who used to go to the baths with a medal on his neck He heard a whispering in the entry some one was softly snoring And suddenly from outside came harsh abrupt metallic sounds such as Korolyov had never heard before and which he did not understand now they roused strange unpleasant echoes in his soul I believe nothing would induce me to remain here to live he thought and went back to the music books again Doctor please come to supper the governess called him in a low voice He went into supper The table was large and laid with a vast number of dishes and wines but there were only two to supper himself and Christina Dmitryevna She drank Madeira ate rapidly and talked looking at him through her pince nez Our workpeople are very contented We have performances at the factory every winter the workpeople act themselves They have lectures with a magic lantern a splendid tea room and everything they want They are very much attached to us and when they heard that Lizanka was worse they had a service sung for her Though they have no education they have their feelings too It looks as though you have no man in the house at all said Korolyov Not one Pyotr Nikanoritch died a year and a half ago and left us alone And so there are the three of us In the summer we live here and in winter we live in Moscow in Polianka I have been living with them for eleven years as one of the family At supper they served sterlet chicken rissoles and stewed fruit the wines were expensive French wines Please don t stand on ceremony doctor said Christina Dmitryevna eating and wiping her mouth with her fist and it was evident she found her life here exceedingly pleasant Please have some more After supper the doctor was shown to his room where a bed had been made up for him but he did not feel sleepy The room was stuffy and it smelt of paint he put on his coat and went out It was cool in the open air there was already a glimmer of dawn and all the five blocks of buildings with their tall chimneys barracks and warehouses were distinctly outlined against the damp air As it was a holiday they were not working and the windows were dark and in only one of the buildings was there a furnace burning two windows were crimson and fire mixed with smoke came from time to time from the chimney Far away beyond the yard the frogs were croaking and the nightingales singing Looking at the factory buildings and the barracks where the workpeople were asleep he thought again what he always thought when he saw a factory They may have performances for the workpeople magic lanterns factory doctors and improvements of all sorts but all the same the workpeople he had met that day on his way from the station did not look in any way different from those he had known long ago in his childhood before there were factory performances and improvements As a doctor accustomed to judging correctly of chronic complaints the radical cause of which was incomprehensible and incurable he looked upon factories as something baffling the cause of which also was obscure and not removable and all the improvements in the life of the factory hands he looked upon not as superfluous but as comparable with the treatment of incurable illnesses There is something baffling in it of course he thought looking at the crimson windows Fifteen hundred or two thousand workpeople are working without rest in unhealthy surroundings making bad cotton goods living on the verge of starvation and only waking from this nightmare at rare intervals in the tavern a hundred people act as overseers and the whole life of that hundred is spent in imposing fines in abuse in injustice and only two or three so called owners enjoy the profits though they don t work at all and despise the wretched cotton But what are the profits and how do they enjoy them Madame Lyalikov and her daughter are unhappy it makes one wretched to look at them the only one who enjoys her life is Christina Dmitryevna a stupid middle aged maiden lady in pince nez And so it appears that all these five blocks of buildings are at work and inferior cotton is sold in the Eastern markets simply that Christina Dmitryevna may eat sterlet and drink Madeira Suddenly there came a strange noise the same sound Korolyov had heard before supper Some one was striking on a sheet of metal near one of the buildings he struck a note and then at once checked the vibrations so that short abrupt discordant sounds were produced rather like Dair dair dair Then there was half a minute of stillness and from another building there came sounds equally abrupt and unpleasant lower bass notes Drin drin drin Eleven times Evidently it was the watchman striking the hour Near the third building he heard Zhuk zhuk zhuk And so near all the buildings and then behind the barracks and beyond the gates And in the stillness of the night it seemed as though these sounds were uttered by a monster with crimson eyes the devil himself who controlled the owners and the work people alike and was deceiving both Korolyov went out of the yard into the open country Who goes there some one called to him at the gates in an abrupt voice It s just like being in prison he thought and made no answer Here the nightingales and the frogs could be heard more distinctly and one could feel it was a night in May From the station came the noise of a train somewhere in the distance drowsy cocks were crowing but all the same the night was still the world was sleeping tranquilly In a field not far from the factory there could be seen the framework of a house and heaps of building material Korolyov sat down on the planks and went on thinking The only person who feels happy here is the governess and the factory hands are working for her gratification But that s only apparent she is only the figurehead The real person for whom everything is being done is the devil And he thought about the devil in whom he did not believe and he looked round at the two windows where the fires were gleaming It seemed to him that out of those crimson eyes the devil himself was looking at him that unknown force that had created the mutual relation of the strong and the weak that coarse blunder which one could never correct The strong must hinder the weak from living such was the law of Nature but only in a newspaper article or in a school book was that intelligible and easily accepted In the hotchpotch which was everyday life in the tangle of trivialities out of which human relations were woven it was no longer a law but a logical absurdity when the strong and the weak were both equally victims of their mutual relations unwillingly submitting to some directing force unknown standing outside life apart from man So thought Korolyov sitting on the planks and little by little he was possessed by a feeling that this unknown and mysterious force was really close by and looking at him Meanwhile the east was growing paler time passed rapidly when there was not a soul anywhere near as though everything were dead the five buildings and their chimneys against the grey background of the dawn had a peculiar look not the same as by day one forgot altogether that inside there were steam motors electricity telephones and kept thinking of lake dwellings of the Stone Age feeling the presence of a crude unconscious force And again there came the sound Dair dair dair dair twelve times Then there was stillness stillness for half a minute and at the other end of the yard there rang out Drin drin drin Horribly disagreeable thought Korolyov Zhuk zhuk there resounded from a third place abruptly sharply as though with annoyance Zhuk zhuk And it took four minutes to strike twelve Then there was a hush and again it seemed as though everything were dead Korolyov sat a little longer then went to the house but sat up for a good while longer In the adjoining rooms there was whispering there was a sound of shuffling slippers and bare feet Is she having another attack thought Korolyov He went out to have a look at the patient By now it was quite light in the rooms and a faint glimmer of sunlight piercing through the morning mist quivered on the floor and on the wall of the drawing room The door of Liza s room was open and she was sitting in a low chair beside her bed with her hair down wearing a dressing gown and wrapped in a shawl The blinds were down on the windows How do you feel asked Korolyov Well thank you He touched her pulse then straightened her hair that had fallen over her forehead You are not asleep he said It s beautiful weather outside It s spring The nightingales are singing and you sit in the dark and think of something She listened and looked into his face her eyes were sorrowful and intelligent and it was evident she wanted to say something to him Does this happen to you often he said She moved her lips and answered Often I feel wretched almost every night At that moment the watchman in the yard began striking two o clock They heard Dair dair and she shuddered Do those knockings worry you he asked I don t know Everything here worries me she answered and pondered Everything worries me I hear sympathy in your voice it seemed to me as soon as I saw you that I could tell you all about it Tell me I beg you I want to tell you of my opinion It seems to me that I have no illness but that I am weary and frightened because it is bound to be so and cannot be otherwise Even the healthiest person can t help being uneasy if for instance a robber is moving about under his window I am constantly being doctored she went on looking at her knees and she gave a shy smile I am very grateful of course and I do not deny that the treatment is a benefit but I should like to talk not with a doctor but with some intimate friend who would understand me and would convince me that I was right or wrong Have you no friends asked Korolyov I am lonely I have a mother I love her but all the same I am lonely That s how it happens to be Lonely people read a great deal but say little and hear little Life for them is mysterious they are mystics and often see the devil where he is not Lermontov s Tamara was lonely and she saw the devil Do you read a great deal Yes You see my whole time is free from morning till night I read by day and by night my head is empty instead of thoughts there are shadows in it Do you see anything at night asked Korolyov No but I feel She smiled again raised her eyes to the doctor and looked at him so sorrowfully so intelligently and it seemed to him that she trusted him and that she wanted to speak frankly to him and that she thought the same as he did But she was silent perhaps waiting for him to speak And he knew what to say to her It was clear to him that she needed as quickly as possible to give up the five buildings and the million if she had it to leave that devil that looked out at night it was clear to him too that she thought so herself and was only waiting for some one she trusted to confirm her But he did not know how to say it How One is shy of asking men under sentence what they have been sentenced for and in the same way it is awkward to ask very rich people what they want so much money for why they make such a poor use of their wealth why they don t give it up even when they see in it their unhappiness and if they begin a conversation about it themselves it is usually embarrassing awkward and long How is one to say it Korolyov wondered And is it necessary to speak And he said what he meant in a roundabout way You in the position of a factory owner and a wealthy heiress are dissatisfied you don t believe in your right to it and here now you can t sleep That of course is better than if you were satisfied slept soundly and thought everything was satisfactory Your sleeplessness does you credit in any case it is a good sign In reality such a conversation as this between us now would have been unthinkable for our parents At night they did not talk but slept sound we our generation sleep badly are restless but talk a great deal and are always trying to settle whether we are right or not For our children or grandchildren that question whether they are right or not will have been settled Things will be clearer for them than for us Life will be good in fifty years time it s only a pity we shall not last out till then It would be interesting to have a peep at it What will our children and grandchildren do asked Liza I don t know I suppose they will throw it all up and go away Go where Where Why where they like said Korolyov and he laughed There are lots of places a good intelligent person can go to He glanced at his watch The sun has risen though he said It is time you were asleep Undress and sleep soundly Very glad to have made your acquaintance he went on pressing her hand You are a good interesting woman Good night He went to his room and went to bed In the morning when the carriage was brought round they all came out on to the steps to see him off Liza pale and exhausted was in a white dress as though for a holiday with a flower in her hair she looked at him as yesterday sorrowfully and intelligently smiled and talked and all with an expression as though she wanted to tell him something special important him alone They could hear the larks trilling and the church bells pealing The windows in the factory buildings were sparkling gaily and driving across the yard and afterwards along the road to the station Korolyov thought neither of the workpeople nor of lake dwellings nor of the devil but thought of the time perhaps close at hand when life would be as bright and joyous as that still Sunday morning and he thought how pleasant it was on such a morning in the spring to drive with three horses in a good carriage and to bask in the sunshine AN UPHEAVAL MASHENKA PAVLETSKY a young girl who had only just finished her studies at a boarding school returning from a walk to the house of the Kushkins with whom she was living as a governess found the household in a terrible turmoil Mihailo the porter who opened the door to her was excited and red as a crab Loud voices were heard from upstairs Madame Kushkin is in a fit most likely or else she has quarrelled with her husband thought Mashenka In the hall and in the corridor she met maid servants One of them was crying Then Mashenka saw running out of her room the master of the house himself Nikolay Sergeitch a little man with a flabby face and a bald head though he was not old He was red in the face and twitching all over He passed the governess without noticing her and throwing up his arms exclaimed Oh how horrible it is How tactless How stupid How barbarous Abominable Mashenka went into her room and then for the first time in her life it was her lot to experience in all its acuteness the feeling that is so familiar to persons in dependent positions who eat the bread of the rich and powerful and cannot speak their minds There was a search going on in her room The lady of the house Fedosya Vassilyevna a stout broad shouldered uncouth woman with thick black eyebrows a faintly perceptible moustache and red hands who was exactly like a plain illiterate cook in face and manners was standing without her cap on at the table putting back into Mashenka s workbag balls of wool scraps of materials and bits of paper Evidently the governess s arrival took her by surprise since on looking round and seeing the girl s pale and astonished face she was a little taken aback and muttered Pardon I I upset it accidentally My sleeve caught in it And saying something more Madame Kushkin rustled her long skirts and went out Mashenka looked round her room with wondering eyes and unable to understand it not knowing what to think shrugged her shoulders and turned cold with dismay What had Fedosya Vassilyevna been looking for in her work bag If she really had as she said caught her sleeve in it and upset everything why had Nikolay Sergeitch dashed out of her room so excited and red in the face Why was one drawer of the table pulled out a little way The money box in which the governess put away ten kopeck pieces and old stamps was open They had opened it but did not know how to shut it though they had scratched the lock all over The whatnot with her books on it the things on the table the bed all bore fresh traces of a search Her linen basket too The linen had been carefully folded but it was not in the same order as Mashenka had left it when she went out So the search had been thorough most thorough But what was it for Why What had happened Mashenka remembered the excited porter the general turmoil which was still going on the weeping servant girl had it not all some connection with the search that had just been made in her room Was not she mixed up in something dreadful Mashenka turned pale and feeling cold all over sank on to her linen basket A maid servant came into the room Liza you don t know why they have been rummaging in my room the governess asked her Mistress has lost a brooch worth two thousand said Liza Yes but why have they been rummaging in my room They ve been searching every one miss They ve searched all my things too They stripped us all naked and searched us God knows miss I never went near her toilet table let alone touching the brooch I shall say the same at the police station But why have they been rummaging here the governess still wondered A brooch has been stolen I tell you The mistress has been rummaging in everything with her own hands She even searched Mihailo the porter herself It s a perfect disgrace Nikolay Sergeitch simply looks on and cackles like a hen But you ve no need to tremble like that miss They found nothing here You ve nothing to be afraid of if you didn t take the brooch But Liza it s vile it s insulting said Mashenka breathless with indignation It s so mean so low What right had she to suspect me and to rummage in my things You are living with strangers miss sighed Liza Though you are a young lady still you are as it were a servant It s not like living with your papa and mamma Mashenka threw herself on the bed and sobbed bitterly Never in her life had she been subjected to such an outrage never had she been so deeply insulted She well educated refined the daughter of a teacher was suspected of theft she had been searched like a street walker She could not imagine a greater insult And to this feeling of resentment was added an oppressive dread of what would come next All sorts of absurd ideas came into her mind If they could suspect her of theft then they might arrest her strip her naked and search her then lead her through the street with an escort of soldiers cast her into a cold dark cell with mice and woodlice exactly like the dungeon in which Princess Tarakanov was imprisoned Who would stand up for her Her parents lived far away in the provinces they had not the money to come to her In the capital she was as solitary as in a desert without friends or kindred They could do what they liked with her I will go to all the courts and all the lawyers Mashenka thought trembling I will explain to them I will take an oath They will believe that I could not be a thief Mashenka remembered that under the sheets in her basket she had some sweetmeats which following the habits of her schooldays she had put in her pocket at dinner and carried off to her room She felt hot all over and was ashamed at the thought that her little secret was known to the lady of the house and all this terror shame resentment brought on an attack of palpitation of the heart which set up a throbbing in her temples in her heart and deep down in her stomach Dinner is ready the servant summoned Mashenka Shall I go or not Mashenka brushed her hair wiped her face with a wet towel and went into the dining room There they had already begun dinner At one end of the table sat Fedosya Vassilyevna with a stupid solemn serious face at the other end Nikolay Sergeitch At the sides there were the visitors and the children The dishes were handed by two footmen in swallowtails and white gloves Every one knew that there was an upset in the house that Madame Kushkin was in trouble and every one was silent Nothing was heard but the sound of munching and the rattle of spoons on the plates The lady of the house herself was the first to speak What is the third course she asked the footman in a weary injured voice Esturgeon a la russe answered the footman I ordered that Fenya Nikolay Sergeitch hastened to observe I wanted some fish If you don t like it ma chere don t let them serve it I just ordered it Fedosya Vassilyevna did not like dishes that she had not ordered herself and now her eyes filled with tears Come don t let us agitate ourselves Mamikov her household doctor observed in a honeyed voice just touching her arm with a smile as honeyed We are nervous enough as it is Let us forget the brooch Health is worth more than two thousand roubles It s not the two thousand I regret answered the lady and a big tear rolled down her cheek It s the fact itself that revolts me I cannot put up with thieves in my house I don t regret it I regret nothing but to steal from me is such ingratitude That s how they repay me for my kindness They all looked into their plates but Mashenka fancied after the lady s words that every one was looking at her A lump rose in her throat she began crying and put her handkerchief to her lips Pardon she muttered I can t help it My head aches I ll go away And she got up from the table scraping her chair awkwardly and went out quickly still more overcome with confusion It s beyond everything said Nikolay Sergeitch frowning What need was there to search her room How out of place it was I don t say she took the brooch said Fedosya Vassilyevna but can you answer for her To tell the truth I haven t much confidence in these learned paupers It really was unsuitable Fenya Excuse me Fenya but you ve no kind of legal right to make a search I know nothing about your laws All I know is that I ve lost my brooch And I will find the brooch She brought her fork down on the plate with a clatter and her eyes flashed angrily And you eat your dinner and don t interfere in what doesn t concern you Nikolay Sergeitch dropped his eyes mildly and sighed Meanwhile Mashenka reaching her room flung herself on her bed She felt now neither alarm nor shame but she felt an intense longing to go and slap the cheeks of this hard arrogant dull witted prosperous woman Lying on her bed she breathed into her pillow and dreamed of how nice it would be to go and buy the most expensive brooch and fling it into the face of this bullying woman If only it were God s will that Fedosya Vassilyevna should come to ruin and wander about begging and should taste all the horrors of poverty and dependence and that Mashenka whom she had insulted might give her alms Oh if only she could come in for a big fortune could buy a carriage and could drive noisily past the windows so as to be envied by that woman But all these were only dreams in reality there was only one thing left to do to get away as quickly as possible not to stay another hour in this place It was true it was terrible to lose her place to go back to her parents who had nothing but what could she do Mashenka could not bear the sight of the lady of the house nor of her little room she felt stifled and wretched here She was so disgusted with Fedosya Vassilyevna who was so obsessed by her illnesses and her supposed aristocratic rank that everything in the world seemed to have become coarse and unattractive because this woman was living in it Mashenka jumped up from the bed and began packing May I come in asked Nikolay Sergeitch at the door he had come up noiselessly to the door and spoke in a soft subdued voice May I Come in He came in and stood still near the door His eyes looked dim and his red little nose was shiny After dinner he used to drink beer and the fact was perceptible in his walk in his feeble flabby hands What s this he asked pointing to the basket I am packing Forgive me Nikolay Sergeitch but I cannot remain in your house I feel deeply insulted by this search I understand Only you are wrong to go Why should you They ve searched your things but you what does it matter to you You will be none the worse for it Mashenka was silent and went on packing Nikolay Sergeitch pinched his moustache as though wondering what he should say next and went on in an ingratiating voice I understand of course but you must make allowances You know my wife is nervous headstrong you mustn t judge her too harshly Mashenka did not speak If you are so offended Nikolay Sergeitch went on well if you like I m ready to apologise I ask your pardon Mashenka made no answer but only bent lower over her box This exhausted irresolute man was of absolutely no significance in the household He stood in the pitiful position of a dependent and hanger on even with the servants and his apology meant nothing either H m You say nothing That s not enough for you In that case I will apologise for my wife In my wife s name She behaved tactlessly I admit it as a gentleman Nikolay Sergeitch walked about the room heaved a sigh and went on Then you want me to have it rankling here under my heart You want my conscience to torment me I know it s not your fault Nikolay Sergeitch said Mashenka looking him full in the face with her big tear stained eyes Why should you worry yourself Of course no But still don t you go away I entreat you Mashenka shook her head Nikolay Sergeitch stopped at the window and drummed on the pane with his finger tips Such misunderstandings are simply torture to me he said Why do you want me to go down on my knees to you or what Your pride is wounded and here you ve been crying and packing up to go but I have pride too and you do not spare it Or do you want me to tell you what I would not tell as Confession Do you Listen you want me to tell you what I won t tell the priest on my deathbed Mashenka made no answer I took my wife s brooch Nikolay Sergeitch said quickly Is that enough now Are you satisfied Yes I took it But of course I count on your discretion For God s sake not a word not half a hint to any one Mashenka amazed and frightened went on packing she snatched her things crumpled them up and thrust them anyhow into the box and the basket Now after this candid avowal on the part of Nikolay Sergeitch she could not remain another minute and could not understand how she could have gone on living in the house before And it s nothing to wonder at Nikolay Sergeitch went on after a pause It s an everyday story I need money and she won t give it to me It was my father s money that bought this house and everything you know It s all mine and the brooch belonged to my mother and it s all mine And she took it took possession of everything I can t go to law with her you ll admit I beg you most earnestly overlook it stay on Tout comprendre tout pardonner Will you stay No said Mashenka resolutely beginning to tremble Let me alone I entreat you Well God bless you sighed Nikolay Sergeitch sitting down on the stool near the box I must own I like people who still can feel resentment contempt and so on I could sit here forever and look at your indignant face So you won t stay then I understand It s bound to be so Yes of course It s all right for you but for me wo o o o I can t stir a step out of this cellar I d go off to one of our estates but in every one of them there are some of my wife s rascals stewards experts damn them all They mortgage and remortgage You mustn t catch fish must keep off the grass mustn t break the trees Nikolay Sergeitch his wife s voice called from the drawing room Agnia call your master Then you won t stay asked Nikolay Sergeitch getting up quickly and going towards the door You might as well stay really In the evenings I could come and have a talk with you Eh Stay If you go there won t be a human face left in the house It s awful Nikolay Sergeitch s pale exhausted face besought her but Mashenka shook her head and with a wave of his hand he went out Half an hour later she was on her way IONITCH I WHEN visitors to the provincial town S complained of the dreariness and monotony of life the inhabitants of the town as though defending themselves declared that it was very nice in S that there was a library a theatre a club that they had balls and finally that there were clever agreeable and interesting families with whom one could make acquaintance And they used to point to the family of the Turkins as the most highly cultivated and talented This family lived in their own house in the principal street near the Governor s Ivan Petrovitch Turkin himself a stout handsome dark man with whiskers used to get up amateur performances for benevolent objects and used to take the part of an elderly general and cough very amusingly He knew a number of anecdotes charades proverbs and was fond of being humorous and witty and he always wore an expression from which it was impossible to tell whether he were joking or in earnest His wife Vera Iosifovna a thin nice looking lady who wore a pince nez used to write novels and stories and was very fond of reading them aloud to her visitors The daughter Ekaterina Ivanovna a young girl used to play on the piano In short every member of the family had a special talent The Turkins welcomed visitors and good humouredly displayed their talents with genuine simplicity Their stone house was roomy and cool in summer half of the windows looked into a shady old garden where nightingales used to sing in the spring When there were visitors in the house there was a clatter of knives in the kitchen and a smell of fried onions in the yard and that was always a sure sign of a plentiful and savoury supper to follow And as soon as Dmitri Ionitch Startsev was appointed the district doctor and took up his abode at Dyalizh six miles from S he too was told that as a cultivated man it was essential for him to make the acquaintance of the Turkins In the winter he was introduced to Ivan Petrovitch in the street they talked about the weather about the theatre about the cholera an invitation followed On a holiday in the spring it was Ascension Day after seeing his patients Startsev set off for town in search of a little recreation and to make some purchases He walked in a leisurely way he had not yet set up his carriage humming all the time Before I d drunk the tears from life s goblet In town he dined went for a walk in the gardens then Ivan Petrovitch s invitation came into his mind as it were of itself and he decided to call on the Turkins and see what sort of people they were How do you do if you please said Ivan Petrovitch meeting him on the steps Delighted delighted to see such an agreeable visitor Come along I will introduce you to my better half I tell him Verotchka he went on as he presented the doctor to his wife I tell him that he has no human right to sit at home in a hospital he ought to devote his leisure to society Oughtn t he darling Sit here said Vera Iosifovna making her visitor sit down beside her You can dance attendance on me My husband is jealous he is an Othello but we will try and behave so well that he will notice nothing Ah you spoilt chicken Ivan Petrovitch muttered tenderly and he kissed her on the forehead You have come just in the nick of time he said addressing the doctor again My better half has written a hugeous novel and she is going to read it aloud to day Petit Jean said Vera Iosifovna to her husband dites que l on nous donne du the Startsev was introduced to Ekaterina Ivanovna a girl of eighteen very much like her mother thin and pretty Her expression was still childish and her figure was soft and slim and her developed girlish bosom healthy and beautiful was suggestive of spring real spring Then they drank tea with jam honey and sweetmeats and with very nice cakes which melted in the mouth As the evening came on other visitors gradually arrived and Ivan Petrovitch fixed his laughing eyes on each of them and said How do you do if you please Then they all sat down in the drawing room with very serious faces and Vera Iosifovna read her novel It began like this The frost was intense The windows were wide open from the kitchen came the clatter of knives and the smell of fried onions It was comfortable in the soft deep arm chair the lights had such a friendly twinkle in the twilight of the drawing room and at the moment on a summer evening when sounds of voices and laughter floated in from the street and whiffs of lilac from the yard it was difficult to grasp that the frost was intense and that the setting sun was lighting with its chilly rays a solitary wayfarer on the snowy plain Vera Iosifovna read how a beautiful young countess founded a school a hospital a library in her village and fell in love with a wandering artist she read of what never happens in real life and yet it was pleasant to listen it was comfortable and such agreeable serene thoughts kept coming into the mind one had no desire to get up Not badsome Ivan Petrovitch said softly And one of the visitors hearing with his thoughts far away said hardly audibly Yes truly One hour passed another In the town gardens close by a band was playing and a chorus was singing When Vera Iosifovna shut her manuscript book the company was silent for five minutes listening to Lutchina being sung by the chorus and the song gave what was not in the novel and is in real life Do you publish your stories in magazines Startsev asked Vera Iosifovna No she answered I never publish I write it and put it away in my cupboard Why publish she explained We have enough to live on And for some reason every one sighed And now Kitten you play something Ivan Petrovitch said to his daughter The lid of the piano was raised and the music lying ready was opened Ekaterina Ivanovna sat down and banged on the piano with both hands and then banged again with all her might and then again and again her shoulders and bosom shook She obstinately banged on the same notes and it sounded as if she would not leave off until she had hammered the keys into the piano The drawing room was filled with the din everything was resounding the floor the ceiling the furniture Ekaterina Ivanovna was playing a difficult passage interesting simply on account of its difficulty long and monotonous and Startsev listening pictured stones dropping down a steep hill and going on dropping and he wished they would leave off dropping and at the same time Ekaterina Ivanovna rosy from the violent exercise strong and vigorous with a lock of hair falling over her forehead attracted him very much After the winter spent at Dyalizh among patients and peasants to sit in a drawing room to watch this young elegant and in all probability pure creature and to listen to these noisy tedious but still cultured sounds was so pleasant so novel Well Kitten you have played as never before said Ivan Petrovitch with tears in his eyes when his daughter had finished and stood up Die Denis you won t write anything better All flocked round her congratulated her expressed astonishment declared that it was long since they had heard such music and she listened in silence with a faint smile and her whole figure was expressive of triumph Splendid superb Splendid said Startsev too carried away by the general enthusiasm Where have you studied he asked Ekaterina Ivanovna At the Conservatoire No I am only preparing for the Conservatoire and till now have been working with Madame Zavlovsky Have you finished at the high school here Oh no Vera Iosifovna answered for her We have teachers for her at home there might be bad influences at the high school or a boarding school you know While a young girl is growing up she ought to be under no influence but her mother s All the same I m going to the Conservatoire said Ekaterina Ivanovna No Kitten loves her mamma Kitten won t grieve papa and mamma No I m going I m going said Ekaterina Ivanovna with playful caprice and stamping her foot And at supper it was Ivan Petrovitch who displayed his talents Laughing only with his eyes he told anecdotes made epigrams asked ridiculous riddles and answered them himself talking the whole time in his extraordinary language evolved in the course of prolonged practice in witticism and evidently now become a habit Badsome Hugeous Thank you most dumbly and so on But that was not all When the guests replete and satisfied trooped into the hall looking for their coats and sticks there bustled about them the footman Pavlusha or as he was called in the family Pava a lad of fourteen with shaven head and chubby cheeks Come Pava perform Ivan Petrovitch said to him Pava struck an attitude flung up his arm and said in a tragic tone Unhappy woman die And every one roared with laughter It s entertaining thought Startsev as he went out into the street He went to a restaurant and drank some beer then set off to walk home to Dyalizh he walked all the way singing Thy voice to me so languid and caressing On going to bed he felt not the slightest fatigue after the six miles walk On the contrary he felt as though he could with pleasure have walked another twenty Not badsome he thought and laughed as he fell asleep II Startsev kept meaning to go to the Turkins again but there was a great deal of work in the hospital and he was unable to find free time In this way more than a year passed in work and solitude But one day a letter in a light blue envelope was brought him from the town Vera Iosifovna had been suffering for some time from migraine but now since Kitten frightened her every day by saying that she was going away to the Conservatoire the attacks began to be more frequent All the doctors of the town had been at the Turkins at last it was the district doctor s turn Vera Iosifovna wrote him a touching letter in which she begged him to come and relieve her sufferings Startsev went and after that he began to be often very often at the Turkins He really did something for Vera Iosifovna and she was already telling all her visitors that he was a wonderful and exceptional doctor But it was not for the sake of her migraine that he visited the Turkins now It was a holiday Ekaterina Ivanovna finished her long wearisome exercises on the piano Then they sat a long time in the dining room drinking tea and Ivan Petrovitch told some amusing story Then there was a ring and he had to go into the hall to welcome a guest Startsev took advantage of the momentary commotion and whispered to Ekaterina Ivanovna in great agitation For God s sake I entreat you don t torment me let us go into the garden She shrugged her shoulders as though perplexed and not knowing what he wanted of her but she got up and went You play the piano for three or four hours he said following her then you sit with your mother and there is no possibility of speaking to you Give me a quarter of an hour at least I beseech you Autumn was approaching and it was quiet and melancholy in the old garden the dark leaves lay thick in the walks It was already beginning to get dark early I haven t seen you for a whole week Startsev went on and if you only knew what suffering it is Let us sit down Listen to me They had a favourite place in the garden a seat under an old spreading maple And now they sat down on this seat What do you want said Ekaterina Ivanovna drily in a matter of fact tone I have not seen you for a whole week I have not heard you for so long I long passionately I thirst for your voice Speak She fascinated him by her freshness the naive expression of her eyes and cheeks Even in the way her dress hung on her he saw something extraordinarily charming touching in its simplicity and naive grace and at the same time in spite of this naivete she seemed to him intelligent and developed beyond her years He could talk with her about literature about art about anything he liked could complain to her of life of people though it sometimes happened in the middle of serious conversation she would laugh inappropriately or run away into the house Like almost all girls of her neighbourhood she had read a great deal as a rule people read very little in S and at the lending library they said if it were not for the girls and the young Jews they might as well shut up the library This afforded Startsev infinite delight he used to ask her eagerly every time what she had been reading the last few days and listened enthralled while she told him What have you been reading this week since I saw you last he asked now Do please tell me I have been reading Pisemsky What exactly A Thousand Souls answered Kitten And what a funny name Pisemsky had Alexey Feofilaktitch Where are you going cried Startsev in horror as she suddenly got up and walked towards the house I must talk to you I want to explain myself Stay with me just five minutes I supplicate you She stopped as though she wanted to say something then awkwardly thrust a note into his hand ran home and sat down to the piano again Be in the cemetery Startsev read at eleven o clock to night near the tomb of Demetti Well that s not at all clever he thought coming to himself Why the cemetery What for It was clear Kitten was playing a prank Who would seriously dream of making an appointment at night in the cemetery far out of the town when it might have been arranged in the street or in the town gardens And was it in keeping with him a district doctor an intelligent staid man to be sighing receiving notes to hang about cemeteries to do silly things that even schoolboys think ridiculous nowadays What would this romance lead to What would his colleagues say when they heard of it Such were Startsev s reflections as he wandered round the tables at the club and at half past ten he suddenly set off for the cemetery By now he had his own pair of horses and a coachman called Panteleimon in a velvet waistcoat The moon was shining It was still warm warm as it is in autumn Dogs were howling in the suburb near the slaughter house Startsev left his horses in one of the side streets at the end of the town and walked on foot to the cemetery We all have our oddities he thought Kitten is odd too and who knows perhaps she is not joking perhaps she will come and he abandoned himself to this faint vain hope and it intoxicated him He walked for half a mile through the fields the cemetery showed as a dark streak in the distance like a forest or a big garden The wall of white stone came into sight the gate In the moonlight he could read on the gate The hour cometh Startsev went in at the little gate and before anything else he saw the white crosses and monuments on both sides of the broad avenue and the black shadows of them and the poplars and for a long way round it was all white and black and the slumbering trees bowed their branches over the white stones It seemed as though it were lighter here than in the fields the maple leaves stood out sharply like paws on the yellow sand of the avenue and on the stones and the inscriptions on the tombs could be clearly read For the first moments Startsev was struck now by what he saw for the first time in his life and what he would probably never see again a world not like anything else a world in which the moonlight was as soft and beautiful as though slumbering here in its cradle where there was no life none whatever but in every dark poplar in every tomb there was felt the presence of a mystery that promised a life peaceful beautiful eternal The stones and faded flowers together with the autumn scent of the leaves all told of forgiveness melancholy and peace All was silence around the stars looked down from the sky in the profound stillness and Startsev s footsteps sounded loud and out of place and only when the church clock began striking and he imagined himself dead buried there for ever he felt as though some one were looking at him and for a moment he thought that it was not peace and tranquillity but stifled despair the dumb dreariness of non existence Demetti s tomb was in the form of a shrine with an angel at the top The Italian opera had once visited S and one of the singers had died she had been buried here and this monument put up to her No one in the town remembered her but the lamp at the entrance reflected the moonlight and looked as though it were burning There was no one and indeed who would come here at midnight But Startsev waited and as though the moonlight warmed his passion he waited passionately and in imagination pictured kisses and embraces He sat near the monument for half an hour then paced up and down the side avenues with his hat in his hand waiting and thinking of the many women and girls buried in these tombs who had been beautiful and fascinating who had loved at night burned with passion yielding themselves to caresses How wickedly Mother Nature jested at man s expense after all How humiliating it was to recognise it Startsev thought this and at the same time he wanted to cry out that he wanted love that he was eager for it at all costs To his eyes they were not slabs of marble but fair white bodies in the moonlight he saw shapes hiding bashfully in the shadows of the trees felt their warmth and the languor was oppressive And as though a curtain were lowered the moon went behind a cloud and suddenly all was darkness Startsev could scarcely find the gate by now it was as dark as it is on an autumn night Then he wandered about for an hour and a half looking for the side street in which he had left his horses I am tired I can scarcely stand on my legs he said to Panteleimon And settling himself with relief in his carriage he thought Och I ought not to get fat III The following evening he went to the Turkins to make an offer But it turned out to be an inconvenient moment as Ekaterina Ivanovna was in her own room having her hair done by a hair dresser She was getting ready to go to a dance at the club He had to sit a long time again in the dining room drinking tea Ivan Petrovitch seeing that his visitor was bored and preoccupied drew some notes out of his waistcoat pocket read a funny letter from a German steward saying that all the ironmongery was ruined and the plasticity was peeling off the walls I expect they will give a decent dowry thought Startsev listening absent mindedly After a sleepless night he found himself in a state of stupefaction as though he had been given something sweet and soporific to drink there was fog in his soul but joy and warmth and at the same time a sort of cold heavy fragment of his brain was reflecting Stop before it is too late Is she the match for you She is spoilt whimsical sleeps till two o clock in the afternoon while you are a deacon s son a district doctor What of it he thought I don t care Besides if you marry her the fragment went on then her relations will make you give up the district work and live in the town After all he thought if it must be the town the town it must be They will give a dowry we can establish ourselves suitably At last Ekaterina Ivanovna came in dressed for the ball with a low neck looking fresh and pretty and Startsev admired her so much and went into such ecstasies that he could say nothing but simply stared at her and laughed She began saying good bye and he he had no reason for staying now got up saying that it was time for him to go home his patients were waiting for him Well there s no help for that said Ivan Petrovitch Go and you might take Kitten to the club on the way It was spotting with rain it was very dark and they could only tell where the horses were by Panteleimon s husky cough The hood of the carriage was put up I stand upright you lie down right he lies all right said Ivan Petrovitch as he put his daughter into the carriage They drove off I was at the cemetery yesterday Startsev began How ungenerous and merciless it was on your part You went to the cemetery Yes I went there and waited almost till two o clock I suffered Well suffer if you cannot understand a joke Ekaterina Ivanovna pleased at having so cleverly taken in a man who was in love with her and at being the object of such intense love burst out laughing and suddenly uttered a shriek of terror for at that very minute the horses turned sharply in at the gate of the club and the carriage almost tilted over Startsev put his arm round Ekaterina Ivanovna s waist in her fright she nestled up to him and he could not restrain himself and passionately kissed her on the lips and on the chin and hugged her more tightly That s enough she said drily And a minute later she was not in the carriage and a policeman near the lighted entrance of the club shouted in a detestable voice to Panteleimon What are you stopping for you crow Drive on Startsev drove home but soon afterwards returned Attired in another man s dress suit and a stiff white tie which kept sawing at his neck and trying to slip away from the collar he was sitting at midnight in the club drawing room and was saying with enthusiasm to Ekaterina Ivanovna Ah how little people know who have never loved It seems to me that no one has ever yet written of love truly and I doubt whether this tender joyful agonising feeling can be described and any one who has once experienced it would not attempt to put it into words What is the use of preliminaries and introductions What is the use of unnecessary fine words My love is immeasurable I beg I beseech you Startsev brought out at last be my wife Dmitri Ionitch said Ekaterina Ivanovna with a very grave face after a moment s thought Dmitri Ionitch I am very grateful to you for the honour I respect you but she got up and continued standing but forgive me I cannot be your wife Let us talk seriously Dmitri Ionitch you know I love art beyond everything in life I adore music I love it frantically I have dedicated my whole life to it I want to be an artist I want fame success freedom and you want me to go on living in this town to go on living this empty useless life which has become insufferable to me To become a wife oh no forgive me One must strive towards a lofty glorious goal and married life would put me in bondage for ever Dmitri Ionitch she faintly smiled as she pronounced his name she thought of Alexey Feofilaktitch Dmitri Ionitch you are a good clever honourable man you are better than any one Tears came into her eyes I feel for you with my whole heart but but you will understand And she turned away and went out of the drawing room to prevent herself from crying Startsev s heart left off throbbing uneasily Going out of the club into the street he first of all tore off the stiff tie and drew a deep breath He was a little ashamed and his vanity was wounded he had not expected a refusal and could not believe that all his dreams his hopes and yearnings had led him up to such a stupid end just as in some little play at an amateur performance and he was sorry for his feeling for that love of his so sorry that he felt as though he could have burst into sobs or have violently belaboured Panteleimon s broad back with his umbrella For three days he could not get on with anything he could not eat nor sleep but when the news reached him that Ekaterina Ivanovna had gone away to Moscow to enter the Conservatoire he grew calmer and lived as before Afterwards remembering sometimes how he had wandered about the cemetery or how he had driven all over the town to get a dress suit he stretched lazily and said What a lot of trouble though IV Four years had passed Startsev already had a large practice in the town Every morning he hurriedly saw his patients at Dyalizh then he drove in to see his town patients By now he drove not with a pair but with a team of three with bells on them and he returned home late at night He had grown broader and stouter and was not very fond of walking as he was somewhat asthmatic And Panteleimon had grown stout too and the broader he grew the more mournfully he sighed and complained of his hard luck he was sick of driving Startsev used to visit various households and met many people but did not become intimate with any one The inhabitants irritated him by their conversation their views of life and even their appearance Experience taught him by degrees that while he played cards or lunched with one of these people the man was a peaceable friendly and even intelligent human being that as soon as one talked of anything not eatable for instance of politics or science he would be completely at a loss or would expound a philosophy so stupid and ill natured that there was nothing else to do but wave one s hand in despair and go away Even when Startsev tried to talk to liberal citizens saying for instance that humanity thank God was progressing and that one day it would be possible to dispense with passports and capital punishment the liberal citizen would look at him askance and ask him mistrustfully Then any one could murder any one he chose in the open street And when at tea or supper Startsev observed in company that one should work and that one ought not to live without working every one took this as a reproach and began to get angry and argue aggressively With all that the inhabitants did nothing absolutely nothing and took no interest in anything and it was quite impossible to think of anything to say And Startsev avoided conversation and confined himself to eating and playing vint and when there was a family festivity in some household and he was invited to a meal then he sat and ate in silence looking at his plate And everything that was said at the time was uninteresting unjust and stupid he felt irritated and disturbed but held his tongue and because he sat glumly silent and looked at his plate he was nicknamed in the town the haughty Pole though he never had been a Pole All such entertainments as theatres and concerts he declined but he played vint every evening for three hours with enjoyment He had another diversion to which he took imperceptibly little by little in the evening he would take out of his pockets the notes he had gained by his practice and sometimes there were stuffed in his pockets notes yellow and green and smelling of scent and vinegar and incense and fish oil up to the value of seventy roubles and when they amounted to some hundreds he took them to the Mutual Credit Bank and deposited the money there to his account He was only twice at the Turkins in the course of the four years after Ekaterina Ivanovna had gone away on each occasion at the invitation of Vera Iosifovna who was still undergoing treatment for migraine Every summer Ekaterina Ivanovna came to stay with her parents but he did not once see her it somehow never happened But now four years had passed One still warm morning a letter was brought to the hospital Vera Iosifovna wrote to Dmitri Ionitch that she was missing him very much and begged him to come and see them and to relieve her sufferings and by the way it was her birthday Below was a postscript I join in mother s request K Startsev considered and in the evening he went to the Turkins How do you do if you please Ivan Petrovitch met him smiling with his eyes only Bongjour Vera Iosifovna white haired and looking much older shook Startsev s hand sighed affectedly and said You don t care to pay attentions to me doctor You never come and see us I am too old for you But now some one young has come perhaps she will be more fortunate And Kitten She had grown thinner paler had grown handsomer and more graceful but now she was Ekaterina Ivanovna not Kitten she had lost the freshness and look of childish naivete And in her expression and manners there was something new guilty and diffident as though she did not feel herself at home here in the Turkins house How many summers how many winters she said giving Startsev her hand and he could see that her heart was beating with excitement and looking at him intently and curiously she went on How much stouter you are You look sunburnt and more manly but on the whole you have changed very little Now too he thought her attractive very attractive but there was something lacking in her or else something superfluous he could not himself have said exactly what it was but something prevented him from feeling as before He did not like her pallor her new expression her faint smile her voice and soon afterwards he disliked her clothes too the low chair in which she was sitting he disliked something in the past when he had almost married her He thought of his love of the dreams and the hopes which had troubled him four years before and he felt awkward They had tea with cakes Then Vera Iosifovna read aloud a novel she read of things that never happen in real life and Startsev listened looked at her handsome grey head and waited for her to finish People are not stupid because they can t write novels but because they can t conceal it when they do he thought Not badsome said Ivan Petrovitch Then Ekaterina Ivanovna played long and noisily on the piano and when she finished she was profusely thanked and warmly praised It s a good thing I did not marry her thought Startsev She looked at him and evidently expected him to ask her to go into the garden but he remained silent Let us have a talk she said going up to him How are you getting on What are you doing How are things I have been thinking about you all these days she went on nervously I wanted to write to you wanted to come myself to see you at Dyalizh I quite made up my mind to go but afterwards I thought better of it God knows what your attitude is towards me now I have been looking forward to seeing you to day with such emotion For goodness sake let us go into the garden They went into the garden and sat down on the seat under the old maple just as they had done four years before It was dark How are you getting on asked Ekaterina Ivanovna Oh all right I am jogging along answered Startsev And he could think of nothing more They were silent I feel so excited said Ekaterina Ivanovna and she hid her face in her hands But don t pay attention to it I am so happy to be at home I am so glad to see every one I can t get used to it So many memories I thought we should talk without stopping till morning Now he saw her face near her shining eyes and in the darkness she looked younger than in the room and even her old childish expression seemed to have come back to her And indeed she was looking at him with naive curiosity as though she wanted to get a closer view and understanding of the man who had loved her so ardently with such tenderness and so unsuccessfully her eyes thanked him for that love And he remembered all that had been every minute detail how he had wandered about the cemetery how he had returned home in the morning exhausted and he suddenly felt sad and regretted the past A warmth began glowing in his heart Do you remember how I took you to the dance at the club he asked It was dark and rainy then The warmth was glowing now in his heart and he longed to talk to rail at life Ech he said with a sigh You ask how I am living How do we live here Why not at all We grow old we grow stout we grow slack Day after day passes life slips by without colour without expressions without thoughts In the daytime working for gain and in the evening the club the company of card players alcoholic raucous voiced gentlemen whom I can t endure What is there nice in it Well you have work a noble object in life You used to be so fond of talking of your hospital I was such a queer girl then I imagined myself such a great pianist Nowadays all young ladies play the piano and I played too like everybody else and there was nothing special about me I am just such a pianist as my mother is an authoress And of course I didn t understand you then but afterwards in Moscow I often thought of you I thought of no one but you What happiness to be a district doctor to help the suffering to be serving the people What happiness Ekaterina Ivanovna repeated with enthusiasm When I thought of you in Moscow you seemed to me so ideal so lofty Startsev thought of the notes he used to take out of his pockets in the evening with such pleasure and the glow in his heart was quenched He got up to go into the house She took his arm You are the best man I ve known in my life she went on We will see each other and talk won t we Promise me I am not a pianist I am not in error about myself now and I will not play before you or talk of music When they had gone into the house and when Startsev saw in the lamplight her face and her sad grateful searching eyes fixed upon him he felt uneasy and thought again It s a good thing I did not marry her then He began taking leave You have no human right to go before supper said Ivan Petrovitch as he saw him off It s extremely perpendicular on your part Well now perform he added addressing Pava in the hall Pava no longer a boy but a young man with moustaches threw himself into an attitude flung up his arm and said in a tragic voice Unhappy woman die All this irritated Startsev Getting into his carriage and looking at the dark house and garden which had once been so precious and so dear he thought of everything at once Vera Iosifovna s novels and Kitten s noisy playing and Ivan Petrovitch s jokes and Pava s tragic posturing and thought if the most talented people in the town were so futile what must the town be Three days later Pava brought a letter from Ekaterina Ivanovna You don t come and see us why she wrote to him I am afraid that you have changed towards us I am afraid and I am terrified at the very thought of it Reassure me come and tell me that everything is well I must talk to you Your E I He read this letter thought a moment and said to Pava Tell them my good fellow that I can t come to day I am very busy Say I will come in three days or so But three days passed a week passed he still did not go Happening once to drive past the Turkins house he thought he must go in if only for a moment but on second thoughts did not go in And he never went to the Turkins again V Several more years have passed Startsev has grown stouter still has grown corpulent breathes heavily and already walks with his head thrown back When stout and red in the face he drives with his bells and his team of three horses and Panteleimon also stout and red in the face with his thick beefy neck sits on the box holding his arms stiffly out before him as though they were made of wood and shouts to those he meets Keep to the ri i ight it is an impressive picture one might think it was not a mortal but some heathen deity in his chariot He has an immense practice in the town no time to breathe and already has an estate and two houses in the town and he is looking out for a third more profitable and when at the Mutual Credit Bank he is told of a house that is for sale he goes to the house without ceremony and marching through all the rooms regardless of half dressed women and children who gaze at him in amazement and alarm he prods at the doors with his stick and says Is that the study Is that a bedroom And what s here And as he does so he breathes heavily and wipes the sweat from his brow He has a great deal to do but still he does not give up his work as district doctor he is greedy for gain and he tries to be in all places at once At Dyalizh and in the town he is called simply Ionitch Where is Ionitch off to or Should not we call in Ionitch to a consultation Probably because his throat is covered with rolls of fat his voice has changed it has become thin and sharp His temper has changed too he has grown ill humoured and irritable When he sees his patients he is usually out of temper he impatiently taps the floor with his stick and shouts in his disagreeable voice Be so good as to confine yourself to answering my questions Don t talk so much He is solitary He leads a dreary life nothing interests him During all the years he had lived at Dyalizh his love for Kitten had been his one joy and probably his last In the evenings he plays vint at the club and then sits alone at a big table and has supper Ivan the oldest and most respectable of the waiters serves him hands him Lafitte No seventeen and every one at the club the members of the committee the cook and waiters know what he likes and what he doesn t like and do their very utmost to satisfy him or else he is sure to fly into a rage and bang on the floor with his stick As he eats his supper he turns round from time to time and puts in his spoke in some conversation What are you talking about Eh Whom And when at a neighbouring table there is talk of the Turkins he asks What Turkins are you speaking of Do you mean the people whose daughter plays on the piano That is all that can be said about him And the Turkins Ivan Petrovitch has grown no older he is not changed in the least and still makes jokes and tells anecdotes as of old Vera Iosifovna still reads her novels aloud to her visitors with eagerness and touching simplicity And Kitten plays the piano for four hours every day She has grown visibly older is constantly ailing and every autumn goes to the Crimea with her mother When Ivan Petrovitch sees them off at the station he wipes his tears as the train starts and shouts Good bye if you please And he waves his handkerchief THE HEAD OF THE FAMILY IT is as a rule after losing heavily at cards or after a drinking bout when an attack of dyspepsia is setting in that Stepan Stepanitch Zhilin wakes up in an exceptionally gloomy frame of mind He looks sour rumpled and dishevelled there is an expression of displeasure on his grey face as though he were offended or disgusted by something He dresses slowly sips his Vichy water deliberately and begins walking about the rooms I should like to know what b b beast comes in here and does not shut the door he grumbles angrily wrapping his dressing gown about him and spitting loudly Take away that paper Why is it lying about here We keep twenty servants and the place is more untidy than a pot house Who was that ringing Who the devil is that That s Anfissa the midwife who brought our Fedya into the world answers his wife Always hanging about these cadging toadies There s no making you out Stepan Stepanitch You asked her yourself and now you scold I am not scolding I am speaking You might find something to do my dear instead of sitting with your hands in your lap trying to pick a quarrel Upon my word women are beyond my comprehension Beyond my comprehension How can they waste whole days doing nothing A man works like an ox like a b beast while his wife the partner of his life sits like a pretty doll sits and does nothing but watch for an opportunity to quarrel with her husband by way of diversion It s time to drop these schoolgirlish ways my dear You are not a schoolgirl not a young lady you are a wife and mother You turn away Aha It s not agreeable to listen to the bitter truth It s strange that you only speak the bitter truth when your liver is out of order That s right get up a scene Have you been out late Or playing cards What if I have Is that anybody s business Am I obliged to give an account of my doings to any one It s my own money I lose I suppose What I spend as well as what is spent in this house belongs to me me Do you hear To me And so on all in the same style But at no other time is Stepan Stepanitch so reasonable virtuous stern or just as at dinner when all his household are sitting about him It usually begins with the soup After swallowing the first spoonful Zhilin suddenly frowns and puts down his spoon Damn it all he mutters I shall have to dine at a restaurant I suppose What s wrong asks his wife anxiously Isn t the soup good One must have the taste of a pig to eat hogwash like that There s too much salt in it it smells of dirty rags more like bugs than onions It s simply revolting Anfissa Ivanovna he says addressing the midwife Every day I give no end of money for housekeeping I deny myself everything and this is what they provide for my dinner I suppose they want me to give up the office and go into the kitchen to do the cooking myself The soup is very good to day the governess ventures timidly Oh you think so says Zhilin looking at her angrily from under his eyelids Every one to his taste of course It must be confessed our tastes are very different Varvara Vassilyevna You for instance are satisfied with the behaviour of this boy Zhilin with a tragic gesture points to his son Fedya you are delighted with him while I I am disgusted Yes Fedya a boy of seven with a pale sickly face leaves off eating and drops his eyes His face grows paler still Yes you are delighted and I am disgusted Which of us is right I cannot say but I venture to think as his father I know my own son better than you do Look how he is sitting Is that the way decently brought up children sit Sit properly Fedya tilts his chin up cranes his neck and fancies that he is holding himself better Tears come into his eyes Eat your dinner Hold your spoon properly You wait I ll show you you horrid boy Don t dare to whimper Look straight at me Fedya tries to look straight at him but his face is quivering and his eyes fill with tears A ah you cry You are naughty and then you cry Go and stand in the corner you beast But let him have his dinner first his wife intervenes No dinner for him Such bla such rascals don t deserve dinner Fedya wincing and quivering all over creeps down from his chair and goes into the corner You won t get off with that his parent persists If nobody else cares to look after your bringing up so be it I must begin I won t let you be naughty and cry at dinner my lad Idiot You must do your duty Do you understand Do your duty Your father works and you must work too No one must eat the bread of idleness You must be a man A m man For God s sake leave off says his wife in French Don t nag at us before outsiders at least The old woman is all ears and now thanks to her all the town will hear of it I am not afraid of outsiders answers Zhilin in Russian Anfissa Ivanovna sees that I am speaking the truth Why do you think I ought to be pleased with the boy Do you know what he costs me Do you know you nasty boy what you cost me Or do you imagine that I coin money that I get it for nothing Don t howl Hold your tongue Do you hear what I say Do you want me to whip you you young ruffian Fedya wails aloud and begins to sob This is insufferable says his mother getting up from the table and flinging down her dinner napkin You never let us have dinner in peace Your bread sticks in my throat And putting her handkerchief to her eyes she walks out of the dining room Now she is offended grumbles Zhilin with a forced smile She s been spoilt That s how it is Anfissa Ivanovna no one likes to hear the truth nowadays It s all my fault it seems Several minutes of silence follow Zhilin looks round at the plates and noticing that no one has yet touched their soup heaves a deep sigh and stares at the flushed and uneasy face of the governess Why don t you eat Varvara Vassilyevna he asks Offended I suppose I see You don t like to be told the truth You must forgive me it s my nature I can t be a hypocrite I always blurt out the plain truth a sigh But I notice that my presence is unwelcome No one can eat or talk while I am here Well you should have told me and I would have gone away I will go Zhilin gets up and walks with dignity to the door As he passes the weeping Fedya he stops After all that has passed here you are free he says to Fedya throwing back his head with dignity I won t meddle in your bringing up again I wash my hands of it I humbly apologise that as a father from a sincere desire for your welfare I have disturbed you and your mentors At the same time once for all I disclaim all responsibility for your future Fedya wails and sobs more loudly than ever Zhilin turns with dignity to the door and departs to his bedroom When he wakes from his after dinner nap he begins to feel the stings of conscience He is ashamed to face his wife his son Anfissa Ivanovna and even feels very wretched when he recalls the scene at dinner but his amour propre is too much for him he has not the manliness to be frank and he goes on sulking and grumbling Waking up next morning he feels in excellent spirits and whistles gaily as he washes Going into the dining room to breakfast he finds there Fedya who at the sight of his father gets up and looks at him helplessly Well young man Zhilin greets him good humouredly sitting down to the table What have you got to tell me young man Are you all right Well come chubby give your father a kiss With a pale grave face Fedya goes up to his father and touches his cheek with his quivering lips then walks away and sits down in his place without a word THE BLACK MONK I ANDREY VASSILITCH KOVRIN who held a master s degree at the University had exhausted himself and had upset his nerves He did not send for a doctor but casually over a bottle of wine he spoke to a friend who was a doctor and the latter advised him to spend the spring and summer in the country Very opportunely a long letter came from Tanya Pesotsky who asked him to come and stay with them at Borissovka And he made up his mind that he really must go To begin with that was in April he went to his own home Kovrinka and there spent three weeks in solitude then as soon as the roads were in good condition he set off driving in a carriage to visit Pesotsky his former guardian who had brought him up and was a horticulturist well known all over Russia The distance from Kovrinka to Borissovka was reckoned only a little over fifty miles To drive along a soft road in May in a comfortable carriage with springs was a real pleasure Pesotsky had an immense house with columns and lions off which the stucco was peeling and with a footman in swallow tails at the entrance The old park laid out in the English style gloomy and severe stretched for almost three quarters of a mile to the river and there ended in a steep precipitous clay bank where pines grew with bare roots that looked like shaggy paws the water shone below with an unfriendly gleam and the peewits flew up with a plaintive cry and there one always felt that one must sit down and write a ballad But near the house itself in the courtyard and orchard which together with the nurseries covered ninety acres it was all life and gaiety even in bad weather Such marvellous roses lilies camellias such tulips of all possible shades from glistening white to sooty black such a wealth of flowers in fact Kovrin had never seen anywhere as at Pesotsky s It was only the beginning of spring and the real glory of the flower beds was still hidden away in the hot houses But even the flowers along the avenues and here and there in the flower beds were enough to make one feel as one walked about the garden as though one were in a realm of tender colours especially in the early morning when the dew was glistening on every petal What was the decorative part of the garden and what Pesotsky contemptuously spoke of as rubbish had at one time in his childhood given Kovrin an impression of fairyland Every sort of caprice of elaborate monstrosity and mockery at Nature was here There were espaliers of fruit trees a pear tree in the shape of a pyramidal poplar spherical oaks and lime trees an apple tree in the shape of an umbrella plum trees trained into arches crests candelabra and even into the number eighteen sixty two the year when Pesotsky first took up horticulture One came across too lovely graceful trees with strong straight stems like palms and it was only by looking intently that one could recognise these trees as gooseberries or currants But what made the garden most cheerful and gave it a lively air was the continual coming and going in it from early morning till evening people with wheelbarrows shovels and watering cans swarmed round the trees and bushes in the avenues and the flower beds like ants Kovrin arrived at Pesotsky s at ten o clock in the evening He found Tanya and her father Yegor Semyonitch in great anxiety The clear starlight sky and the thermometer foretold a frost towards morning and meanwhile Ivan Karlovitch the gardener had gone to the town and they had no one to rely upon At supper they talked of nothing but the morning frost and it was settled that Tanya should not go to bed and between twelve and one should walk through the garden and see that everything was done properly and Yegor Semyonitch should get up at three o clock or even earlier Kovrin sat with Tanya all the evening and after midnight went out with her into the garden It was cold There was a strong smell of burning already in the garden In the big orchard which was called the commercial garden and which brought Yegor Semyonitch several thousand clear profit a thick black acrid smoke was creeping over the ground and curling around the trees was saving those thousands from the frost Here the trees were arranged as on a chessboard in straight and regular rows like ranks of soldiers and this severe pedantic regularity and the fact that all the trees were of the same size and had tops and trunks all exactly alike made them look monotonous and even dreary Kovrin and Tanya walked along the rows where fires of dung straw and all sorts of refuse were smouldering and from time to time they were met by labourers who wandered in the smoke like shadows The only trees in flower were the cherries plums and certain sorts of apples but the whole garden was plunged in smoke and it was only near the nurseries that Kovrin could breathe freely Even as a child I used to sneeze from the smoke here he said shrugging his shoulders but to this day I don t understand how smoke can keep off frost Smoke takes the place of clouds when there are none answered Tanya And what do you want clouds for In overcast and cloudy weather there is no frost You don t say so He laughed and took her arm Her broad very earnest face chilled with the frost with her delicate black eyebrows the turned up collar of her coat which prevented her moving her head freely and the whole of her thin graceful figure with her skirts tucked up on account of the dew touched him Good heavens she is grown up he said When I went away from here last five years ago you were still a child You were such a thin longlegged creature with your hair hanging on your shoulders you used to wear short frocks and I used to tease you calling you a heron What time does Yes five years sighed Tanya Much water has flowed since then Tell me Andryusha honestly she began eagerly looking him in the face do you feel strange with us now But why do I ask you You are a man you live your own interesting life you are somebody To grow apart is so natural But however that may be Andryusha I want you to think of us as your people We have a right to that I do Tanya On your word of honour Yes on my word of honour You were surprised this evening that we have so many of your photographs You know my father adores you Sometimes it seems to me that he loves you more than he does me He is proud of you You are a clever extraordinary man you have made a brilliant career for yourself and he is persuaded that you have turned out like this because he brought you up I don t try to prevent him from thinking so Let him Dawn was already beginning and that was especially perceptible from the distinctness with which the coils of smoke and the tops of the trees began to stand out in the air It s time we were asleep though said Tanya and it s cold too She took his arm Thank you for coming Andryusha We have only uninteresting acquaintances and not many of them We have only the garden the garden the garden and nothing else Standards half standards she laughed Aports Reinettes Borovinkas budded stocks grafted stocks All all our life has gone into the garden I never even dream of anything but apples and pears Of course it is very nice and useful but sometimes one longs for something else for variety I remember that when you used to come to us for the summer holidays or simply a visit it always seemed to be fresher and brighter in the house as though the covers had been taken off the lustres and the furniture I was only a little girl then but yet I understood it She talked a long while and with great feeling For some reason the idea came into his head that in the course of the summer he might grow fond of this little weak talkative creature might be carried away and fall in love in their position it was so possible and natural This thought touched and amused him he bent down to her sweet preoccupied face and hummed softly Onyegin I won t conceal it I madly love Tatiana By the time they reached the house Yegor Semyonitch had got up Kovrin did not feel sleepy he talked to the old man and went to the garden with him Yegor Semyonitch was a tall broad shouldered corpulent man and he suffered from asthma yet he walked so fast that it was hard work to hurry after him He had an extremely preoccupied air he was always hurrying somewhere with an expression that suggested that if he were one minute late all would be ruined Here is a business brother he began standing still to take breath On the surface of the ground as you see is frost but if you raise the thermometer on a stick fourteen feet above the ground there it is warm Why is that I really don t know said Kovrin and he laughed H m One can t know everything of course However large the intellect may be you can t find room for everything in it I suppose you still go in chiefly for philosophy Yes I lecture in psychology I am working at philosophy in general And it does not bore you On the contrary it s all I live for Well God bless you said Yegor Semyonitch meditatively stroking his grey whiskers God bless you I am delighted about you delighted my boy But suddenly he listened and with a terrible face ran off and quickly disappeared behind the trees in a cloud of smoke Who tied this horse to an apple tree Kovrin heard his despairing heart rending cry Who is the low scoundrel who has dared to tie this horse to an apple tree My God my God They have ruined everything they have spoilt everything they have done everything filthy horrible and abominable The orchard s done for the orchard s ruined My God When he came back to Kovrin his face looked exhausted and mortified What is one to do with these accursed people he said in a tearful voice flinging up his hands Styopka was carting dung at night and tied the horse to an apple tree He twisted the reins round it the rascal as tightly as he could so that the bark is rubbed off in three places What do you think of that I spoke to him and he stands like a post and only blinks his eyes Hanging is too good for him Growing calmer he embraced Kovrin and kissed him on the cheek Well God bless you God bless you he muttered I am very glad you have come Unutterably glad Thank you Then with the same rapid step and preoccupied face he made the round of the whole garden and showed his former ward all his greenhouses and hot houses his covered in garden and two apiaries which he called the marvel of our century While they were walking the sun rose flooding the garden with brilliant light It grew warm Foreseeing a long bright cheerful day Kovrin recollected that it was only the beginning of May and that he had before him a whole summer as bright cheerful and long and suddenly there stirred in his bosom a joyous youthful feeling such as he used to experience in his childhood running about in that garden And he hugged the old man and kissed him affectionately Both of them feeling touched went indoors and drank tea out of old fashioned china cups with cream and satisfying krendels made with milk and eggs and these trifles reminded Kovrin again of his childhood and boyhood The delightful present was blended with the impressions of the past that stirred within him there was a tightness at his heart yet he was happy He waited till Tanya was awake and had coffee with her went for a walk then went to his room and sat down to work He read attentively making notes and from time to time raised his eyes to look out at the open windows or at the fresh still dewy flowers in the vases on the table and again he dropped his eyes to his book and it seemed to him as though every vein in his body was quivering and fluttering with pleasure II In the country he led just as nervous and restless a life as in town He read and wrote a great deal he studied Italian and when he was out for a walk thought with pleasure that he would soon sit down to work again He slept so little that every one wondered at him if he accidentally dozed for half an hour in the daytime he would lie awake all night and after a sleepless night would feel cheerful and vigorous as though nothing had happened He talked a great deal drank wine and smoked expensive cigars Very often almost every day young ladies of neighbouring families would come to the Pesotskys and would sing and play the piano with Tanya sometimes a young neighbour who was a good violinist would come too Kovrin listened with eagerness to the music and singing and was exhausted by it and this showed itself by his eyes closing and his head falling to one side One day he was sitting on the balcony after evening tea reading At the same time in the drawing room Tanya taking soprano one of the young ladies a contralto and the young man with his violin were practising a well known serenade of Braga s Kovrin listened to the words they were Russian and could not understand their meaning At last leaving his book and listening attentively he understood a maiden full of sick fancies heard one night in her garden mysterious sounds so strange and lovely that she was obliged to recognise them as a holy harmony which is unintelligible to us mortals and so flies back to heaven Kovrin s eyes began to close He got up and in exhaustion walked up and down the drawing room and then the dining room When the singing was over he took Tanya s arm and with her went out on the balcony I have been all day thinking of a legend he said I don t remember whether I have read it somewhere or heard it but it is a strange and almost grotesque legend To begin with it is somewhat obscure A thousand years ago a monk dressed in black wandered about the desert somewhere in Syria or Arabia Some miles from where he was some fisherman saw another black monk who was moving slowly over the surface of a lake This second monk was a mirage Now forget all the laws of optics which the legend does not recognise and listen to the rest From that mirage there was cast another mirage then from that other a third so that the image of the black monk began to be repeated endlessly from one layer of the atmosphere to another So that he was seen at one time in Africa at another in Spain then in Italy then in the Far North Then he passed out of the atmosphere of the earth and now he is wandering all over the universe still never coming into conditions in which he might disappear Possibly he may be seen now in Mars or in some star of the Southern Cross But my dear the real point on which the whole legend hangs lies in the fact that exactly a thousand years from the day when the monk walked in the desert the mirage will return to the atmosphere of the earth again and will appear to men And it seems that the thousand years is almost up According to the legend we may look out for the black monk to day or to morrow A queer mirage said Tanya who did not like the legend But the most wonderful part of it all laughed Kovrin is that I simply cannot recall where I got this legend from Have I read it somewhere Have I heard it Or perhaps I dreamed of the black monk I swear I don t remember But the legend interests me I have been thinking about it all day Letting Tanya go back to her visitors he went out of the house and lost in meditation walked by the flower beds The sun was already setting The flowers having just been watered gave forth a damp irritating fragrance Indoors they began singing again and in the distance the violin had the effect of a human voice Kovrin racking his brains to remember where he had read or heard the legend turned slowly towards the park and unconsciously went as far as the river By a little path that ran along the steep bank between the bare roots he went down to the water disturbed the peewits there and frightened two ducks The last rays of the setting sun still threw light here and there on the gloomy pines but it was quite dark on the surface of the river Kovrin crossed to the other side by the narrow bridge Before him lay a wide field covered with young rye not yet in blossom There was no living habitation no living soul in the distance and it seemed as though the little path if one went along it would take one to the unknown mysterious place where the sun had just gone down and where the evening glow was flaming in immensity and splendour How open how free how still it is here thought Kovrin walking along the path And it feels as though all the world were watching me hiding and waiting for me to understand it But then waves began running across the rye and a light evening breeze softly touched his uncovered head A minute later there was another gust of wind but stronger the rye began rustling and he heard behind him the hollow murmur of the pines Kovrin stood still in amazement From the horizon there rose up to the sky like a whirlwind or a waterspout a tall black column Its outline was indistinct but from the first instant it could be seen that it was not standing still but moving with fearful rapidity moving straight towards Kovrin and the nearer it came the smaller and the more distinct it was Kovrin moved aside into the rye to make way for it and only just had time to do so A monk dressed in black with a grey head and black eyebrows his arms crossed over his breast floated by him His bare feet did not touch the earth After he had floated twenty feet beyond him he looked round at Kovrin and nodded to him with a friendly but sly smile But what a pale fearfully pale thin face Beginning to grow larger again he flew across the river collided noiselessly with the clay bank and pines and passing through them vanished like smoke Why you see muttered Kovrin there must be truth in the legend Without trying to explain to himself the strange apparition glad that he had succeeded in seeing so near and so distinctly not only the monk s black garments but even his face and eyes agreeably excited he went back to the house In the park and in the garden people were moving about quietly in the house they were playing so he alone had seen the monk He had an intense desire to tell Tanya and Yegor Semyonitch but he reflected that they would certainly think his words the ravings of delirium and that would frighten them he had better say nothing He laughed aloud sang and danced the mazurka he was in high spirits and all of them the visitors and Tanya thought he had a peculiar look radiant and inspired and that he was very interesting III After supper when the visitors had gone he went to his room and lay down on the sofa he wanted to think about the monk But a minute later Tanya came in Here Andryusha read father s articles she said giving him a bundle of pamphlets and proofs They are splendid articles He writes capitally Capitally indeed said Yegor Semyonitch following her and smiling constrainedly he was ashamed Don t listen to her please don t read them Though if you want to go to sleep read them by all means they are a fine soporific I think they are splendid articles said Tanya with deep conviction You read them Andryusha and persuade father to write oftener He could write a complete manual of horticulture Yegor Semyonitch gave a forced laugh blushed and began uttering the phrases usually made use of by an embarrassed author At last he began to give way In that case begin with Gaucher s article and these Russian articles he muttered turning over the pamphlets with a trembling hand or else you won t understand Before you read my objections you must know what I am objecting to But it s all nonsense tiresome stuff Besides I believe it s bedtime Tanya went away Yegor Semyonitch sat down on the sofa by Kovrin and heaved a deep sigh Yes my boy he began after a pause That s how it is my dear lecturer Here I write articles and take part in exhibitions and receive medals Pesotsky they say has apples the size of a head and Pesotsky they say has made his fortune with his garden In short Kotcheby is rich and glorious But one asks oneself what is it all for The garden is certainly fine a model It s not really a garden but a regular institution which is of the greatest public importance because it marks so to say a new era in Russian agriculture and Russian industry But what s it for What s the object of it The fact speaks for itself I do not mean in that sense I meant to ask what will happen to the garden when I die In the condition in which you see it now it would not be maintained for one month without me The whole secret of success lies not in its being a big garden or a great number of labourers being employed in it but in the fact that I love the work Do you understand I love it perhaps more than myself Look at me I do everything myself I work from morning to night I do all the grafting myself the pruning myself the planting myself I do it all myself when any one helps me I am jealous and irritable till I am rude The whole secret lies in loving it that is in the sharp eye of the master yes and in the master s hands and in the feeling that makes one when one goes anywhere for an hour s visit sit ill at ease with one s heart far away afraid that something may have happened in the garden But when I die who will look after it Who will work The gardener The labourers Yes But I will tell you my dear fellow the worst enemy in the garden is not a hare not a cockchafer and not the frost but any outside person And Tanya asked Kovrin laughing She can t be more harmful than a hare She loves the work and understands it Yes she loves it and understands it If after my death the garden goes to her and she is the mistress of course nothing better could be wished But if which God forbid she should marry Yegor Semyonitch whispered and looked with a frightened look at Kovrin that s just it If she marries and children come she will have no time to think about the garden What I fear most is she will marry some fine gentleman and he will be greedy and he will let the garden to people who will run it for profit and everything will go to the devil the very first year In our work females are the scourge of God Yegor Semyonitch sighed and paused for a while Perhaps it is egoism but I tell you frankly I don t want Tanya to get married I am afraid of it There is one young dandy comes to see us bringing his violin and scraping on it I know Tanya will not marry him I know it quite well but I can t bear to see him Altogether my boy I am very queer I know that Yegor Semyonitch got up and walked about the room in excitement and it was evident that he wanted to say something very important but could not bring himself to it I am very fond of you and so I am going to speak to you openly he decided at last thrusting his hands into his pockets I deal plainly with certain delicate questions and say exactly what I think and I cannot endure so called hidden thoughts I will speak plainly you are the only man to whom I should not be afraid to marry my daughter You are a clever man with a good heart and would not let my beloved work go to ruin and the chief reason is that I love you as a son and I am proud of you If Tanya and you could get up a romance somehow then well I should be very glad and even happy I tell you this plainly without mincing matters like an honest man Kovrin laughed Yegor Semyonitch opened the door to go out and stood in the doorway If Tanya and you had a son I would make a horticulturist of him he said after a moment s thought However this is idle dreaming Goodnight Left alone Kovrin settled himself more comfortably on the sofa and took up the articles The title of one was On Intercropping of another A few Words on the Remarks of Monsieur Z concerning the Trenching of the Soil for a New Garden a third Additional Matter concerning Grafting with a Dormant Bud and they were all of the same sort But what a restless jerky tone What nervous almost hysterical passion Here was an article one would have thought with most peaceable and impersonal contents the subject of it was the Russian Antonovsky Apple But Yegor Semyonitch began it with Audiatur altera pars and finished it with Sapienti sat and between these two quotations a perfect torrent of venomous phrases directed at the learned ignorance of our recognised horticultural authorities who observe Nature from the height of their university chairs or at Monsieur Gaucher whose success has been the work of the vulgar and the dilettanti And then followed an inappropriate affected and insincere regret that peasants who stole fruit and broke the branches could not nowadays be flogged It is beautiful charming healthy work but even in this there is strife and passion thought Kovrin I suppose that everywhere and in all careers men of ideas are nervous and marked by exaggerated sensitiveness Most likely it must be so He thought of Tanya who was so pleased with Yegor Semyonitch s articles Small pale and so thin that her shoulder blades stuck out her eyes wide and open dark and intelligent had an intent gaze as though looking for something She walked like her father with a little hurried step She talked a great deal and was fond of arguing accompanying every phrase however insignificant with expressive mimicry and gesticulation No doubt she was nervous in the extreme Kovrin went on reading the articles but he understood nothing of them and flung them aside The same pleasant excitement with which he had earlier in the evening danced the mazurka and listened to the music was now mastering him again and rousing a multitude of thoughts He got up and began walking about the room thinking about the black monk It occurred to him that if this strange supernatural monk had appeared to him only that meant that he was ill and had reached the point of having hallucinations This reflection frightened him but not for long But I am all right and I am doing no harm to any one so there is no harm in my hallucinations he thought and he felt happy again He sat down on the sofa and clasped his hands round his head Restraining the unaccountable joy which filled his whole being he then paced up and down again and sat down to his work But the thought that he read in the book did not satisfy him He wanted something gigantic unfathomable stupendous Towards morning he undressed and reluctantly went to bed he ought to sleep When he heard the footsteps of Yegor Semyonitch going out into the garden Kovrin rang the bell and asked the footman to bring him some wine He drank several glasses of Lafitte then wrapped himself up head and all his consciousness grew clouded and he fell asleep IV Yegor Semyonitch and Tanya often quarrelled and said nasty things to each other They quarrelled about something that morning Tanya burst out crying and went to her room She would not come down to dinner nor to tea At first Yegor Semyonitch went about looking sulky and dignified as though to give every one to understand that for him the claims of justice and good order were more important than anything else in the world but he could not keep it up for long and soon sank into depression He walked about the park dejectedly continually sighing Oh my God My God and at dinner did not eat a morsel At last guilty and conscience stricken he knocked at the locked door and called timidly Tanya Tanya And from behind the door came a faint voice weak with crying but still determined Leave me alone if you please The depression of the master and mistress was reflected in the whole household even in the labourers working in the garden Kovrin was absorbed in his interesting work but at last he too felt dreary and uncomfortable To dissipate the general ill humour in some way he made up his mind to intervene and towards evening he knocked at Tanya s door He was admitted Fie fie for shame he began playfully looking with surprise at Tanya s tear stained woebegone face flushed in patches with crying Is it really so serious Fie fie But if you knew how he tortures me she said and floods of scalding tears streamed from her big eyes He torments me to death she went on wringing her hands I said nothing to him nothing I only said that there was no need to keep too many labourers if we could hire them by the day when we wanted them You know you know the labourers have been doing nothing for a whole week I I only said that and he shouted and said a lot of horrible insulting things to me What for There there said Kovrin smoothing her hair You ve quarrelled with each other you ve cried and that s enough You must not be angry for long that s wrong all the more as he loves you beyond everything He has has spoiled my whole life Tanya went on sobbing I hear nothing but abuse and insults He thinks I am of no use in the house Well He is right I shall go away to morrow I shall become a telegraph clerk I don t care Come come come You mustn t cry Tanya You mustn t dear You are both hot tempered and irritable and you are both to blame Come along I will reconcile you Kovrin talked affectionately and persuasively while she went on crying twitching her shoulders and wringing her hands as though some terrible misfortune had really befallen her He felt all the sorrier for her because her grief was not a serious one yet she suffered extremely What trivialities were enough to make this little creature miserable for a whole day perhaps for her whole life Comforting Tanya Kovrin thought that apart from this girl and her father he might hunt the world over and would not find people who would love him as one of themselves as one of their kindred If it had not been for those two he might very likely having lost his father and mother in early childhood never to the day of his death have known what was meant by genuine affection and that naive uncritical love which is only lavished on very close blood relations and he felt that the nerves of this weeping shaking girl responded to his half sick overstrained nerves like iron to a magnet He never could have loved a healthy strong rosy cheeked woman but pale weak unhappy Tanya attracted him And he liked stroking her hair and her shoulders pressing her hand and wiping away her tears At last she left off crying She went on for a long time complaining of her father and her hard insufferable life in that house entreating Kovrin to put himself in her place then she began little by little smiling and sighing that God had given her such a bad temper At last laughing aloud she called herself a fool and ran out of the room When a little later Kovrin went into the garden Yegor Semyonitch and Tanya were walking side by side along an avenue as though nothing had happened and both were eating rye bread with salt on it as both were hungry V Glad that he had been so successful in the part of peacemaker Kovrin went into the park Sitting on a garden seat thinking he heard the rattle of a carriage and a feminine laugh visitors were arriving When the shades of evening began falling on the garden the sounds of the violin and singing voices reached him indistinctly and that reminded him of the black monk Where in what land or in what planet was that optical absurdity moving now Hardly had he recalled the legend and pictured in his imagination the dark apparition he had seen in the rye field when from behind a pine tree exactly opposite there came out noiselessly without the slightest rustle a man of medium height with uncovered grey head all in black and barefooted like a beggar and his black eyebrows stood out conspicuously on his pale death like face Nodding his head graciously this beggar or pilgrim came noiselessly to the seat and sat down and Kovrin recognised him as the black monk For a minute they looked at one another Kovrin with amazement and the monk with friendliness and just as before a little slyness as though he were thinking something to himself But you are a mirage said Kovrin Why are you here and sitting still That does not fit in with the legend That does not matter the monk answered in a low voice not immediately turning his face towards him The legend the mirage and I are all the products of your excited imagination I am a phantom Then you don t exist said Kovrin You can think as you like said the monk with a faint smile I exist in your imagination and your imagination is part of nature so I exist in nature You have a very old wise and extremely expressive face as though you really had lived more than a thousand years said Kovrin I did not know that my imagination was capable of creating such phenomena But why do you look at me with such enthusiasm Do you like me Yes you are one of those few who are justly called the chosen of God You do the service of eternal truth Your thoughts your designs the marvellous studies you are engaged in and all your life bear the Divine the heavenly stamp seeing that they are consecrated to the rational and the beautiful that is to what is eternal You said eternal truth But is eternal truth of use to man and within his reach if there is no eternal life There is eternal life said the monk Do you believe in the immortality of man Yes of course A grand brilliant future is in store for you men And the more there are like you on earth the sooner will this future be realised Without you who serve the higher principle and live in full understanding and freedom mankind would be of little account developing in a natural way it would have to wait a long time for the end of its earthly history You will lead it some thousands of years earlier into the kingdom of eternal truth and therein lies your supreme service You are the incarnation of the blessing of God which rests upon men And what is the object of eternal life asked Kovrin As of all life enjoyment True enjoyment lies in knowledge and eternal life provides innumerable and inexhaustible sources of knowledge and in that sense it has been said In My Father s house there are many mansions If only you knew how pleasant it is to hear you said Kovrin rubbing his hands with satisfaction I am very glad But I know that when you go away I shall be worried by the question of your reality You are a phantom an hallucination So I am mentally deranged not normal What if you are Why trouble yourself You are ill because you have overworked and exhausted yourself and that means that you have sacrificed your health to the idea and the time is near at hand when you will give up life itself to it What could be better That is the goal towards which all divinely endowed noble natures strive If I know I am mentally affected can I trust myself And are you sure that the men of genius whom all men trust did not see phantoms too The learned say now that genius is allied to madness My friend healthy and normal people are only the common herd Reflections upon the neurasthenia of the age nervous exhaustion and degeneracy et cetera can only seriously agitate those who place the object of life in the present that is the common herd The Romans used to say Mens sana in corpore sano Not everything the Greeks and the Romans said is true Exaltation enthusiasm ecstasy all that distinguishes prophets poets martyrs for the idea from the common folk is repellent to the animal side of man that is his physical health I repeat if you want to be healthy and normal go to the common herd Strange that you repeat what often comes into my mind said Kovrin It is as though you had seen and overheard my secret thoughts But don t let us talk about me What do you mean by eternal truth The monk did not answer Kovrin looked at him and could not distinguish his face His features grew blurred and misty Then the monk s head and arms disappeared his body seemed merged into the seat and the evening twilight and he vanished altogether The hallucination is over said Kovrin and he laughed It s a pity He went back to the house light hearted and happy The little the monk had said to him had flattered not his vanity but his whole soul his whole being To be one of the chosen to serve eternal truth to stand in the ranks of those who could make mankind worthy of the kingdom of God some thousands of years sooner that is to free men from some thousands of years of unnecessary struggle sin and suffering to sacrifice to the idea everything youth strength health to be ready to die for the common weal what an exalted what a happy lot He recalled his past pure chaste laborious he remembered what he had learned himself and what he had taught to others and decided that there was no exaggeration in the monk s words Tanya came to meet him in the park she was by now wearing a different dress Are you here she said And we have been looking and looking for you But what is the matter with you she asked in wonder glancing at his radiant ecstatic face and eyes full of tears How strange you are Andryusha I am pleased Tanya said Kovrin laying his hand on her shoulders I am more than pleased I am happy Tanya darling Tanya you are an extraordinary nice creature Dear Tanya I am so glad I am so glad He kissed both her hands ardently and went on I have just passed through an exalted wonderful unearthly moment But I can t tell you all about it or you would call me mad and not believe me Let us talk of you Dear delightful Tanya I love you and am used to loving you To have you near me to meet you a dozen times a day has become a necessity of my existence I don t know how I shall get on without you when I go back home Oh laughed Tanya you will forget about us in two days We are humble people and you are a great man No let us talk in earnest he said I shall take you with me Tanya Yes Will you come with me Will you be mine Come said Tanya and tried to laugh again but the laugh would not come and patches of colour came into her face She began breathing quickly and walked very quickly but not to the house but further into the park I was not thinking of it I was not thinking of it she said wringing her hands in despair And Kovrin followed her and went on talking with the same radiant enthusiastic face I want a love that will dominate me altogether and that love only you Tanya can give me I am happy I am happy She was overwhelmed and huddling and shrinking together seemed ten years older all at once while he thought her beautiful and expressed his rapture aloud How lovely she is VI Learning from Kovrin that not only a romance had been got up but that there would even be a wedding Yegor Semyonitch spent a long time in pacing from one corner of the room to the other trying to conceal his agitation His hands began trembling his neck swelled and turned purple he ordered his racing droshky and drove off somewhere Tanya seeing how he lashed the horse and seeing how he pulled his cap over his ears understood what he was feeling shut herself up in her room and cried the whole day In the hot houses the peaches and plums were already ripe the packing and sending off of these tender and fragile goods to Moscow took a great deal of care work and trouble Owing to the fact that the summer was very hot and dry it was necessary to water every tree and a great deal of time and labour was spent on doing it Numbers of caterpillars made their appearance which to Kovrin s disgust the labourers and even Yegor Semyonitch and Tanya squashed with their fingers In spite of all that they had already to book autumn orders for fruit and trees and to carry on a great deal of correspondence And at the very busiest time when no one seemed to have a free moment the work of the fields carried off more than half their labourers from the garden Yegor Semyonitch sunburnt exhausted ill humoured galloped from the fields to the garden and back again cried that he was being torn to pieces and that he should put a bullet through his brains Then came the fuss and worry of the trousseau to which the Pesotskys attached a good deal of importance Every one s head was in a whirl from the snipping of the scissors the rattle of the sewing machine the smell of hot irons and the caprices of the dressmaker a huffy and nervous lady And as ill luck would have it visitors came every day who had to be entertained fed and even put up for the night But all this hard labour passed unnoticed as though in a fog Tanya felt that love and happiness had taken her unawares though she had since she was fourteen for some reason been convinced that Kovrin would marry her and no one else She was bewildered could not grasp it could not believe herself At one minute such joy would swoop down upon her that she longed to fly away to the clouds and there pray to God at another moment she would remember that in August she would have to part from her home and leave her father or goodness knows why the idea would occur to her that she was worthless insignificant and unworthy of a great man like Kovrin and she would go to her room lock herself in and cry bitterly for several hours When there were visitors she would suddenly fancy that Kovrin looked extraordinarily handsome and that all the women were in love with him and envying her and her soul was filled with pride and rapture as though she had vanquished the whole world but he had only to smile politely at any young lady for her to be trembling with jealousy to retreat to her room and tears again These new sensations mastered her completely she helped her father mechanically without noticing peaches caterpillars or labourers or how rapidly the time was passing It was almost the same with Yegor Semyonitch He worked from morning till night was always in a hurry was irritable and flew into rages but all of this was in a sort of spellbound dream It seemed as though there were two men in him one was the real Yegor Semyonitch who was moved to indignation and clutched his head in despair when he heard of some irregularity from Ivan Karlovitch the gardener and another not the real one who seemed as though he were half drunk would interrupt a business conversation at half a word touch the gardener on the shoulder and begin muttering Say what you like there is a great deal in blood His mother was a wonderful woman most high minded and intelligent It was a pleasure to look at her good candid pure face it was like the face of an angel She drew splendidly wrote verses spoke five foreign languages sang Poor thing she died of consumption The Kingdom of Heaven be hers The unreal Yegor Semyonitch sighed and after a pause went on When he was a boy and growing up in my house he had the same angelic face good and candid The way he looks and talks and moves is as soft and elegant as his mother s And his intellect We were always struck with his intelligence To be sure it s not for nothing he s a Master of Arts It s not for nothing And wait a bit Ivan Karlovitch what will he be in ten years time He will be far above us But at this point the real Yegor Semyonitch suddenly coming to himself would make a terrible face would clutch his head and cry The devils They have spoilt everything They have ruined everything They have spoilt everything The garden s done for the garden s ruined Kovrin meanwhile worked with the same ardour as before and did not notice the general commotion Love only added fuel to the flames After every talk with Tanya he went to his room happy and triumphant took up his book or his manuscript with the same passion with which he had just kissed Tanya and told her of his love What the black monk had told him of the chosen of God of eternal truth of the brilliant future of mankind and so on gave peculiar and extraordinary significance to his work and filled his soul with pride and the consciousness of his own exalted consequence Once or twice a week in the park or in the house he met the black monk and had long conversations with him but this did not alarm him but on the contrary delighted him as he was now firmly persuaded that such apparitions only visited the elect few who rise up above their fellows and devote themselves to the service of the idea One day the monk appeared at dinner time and sat in the dining room window Kovrin was delighted and very adroitly began a conversation with Yegor Semyonitch and Tanya of what might be of interest to the monk the black robed visitor listened and nodded his head graciously and Yegor Semyonitch and Tanya listened too and smiled gaily without suspecting that Kovrin was not talking to them but to his hallucination Imperceptibly the fast of the Assumption was approaching and soon after came the wedding which at Yegor Semyonitch s urgent desire was celebrated with a flourish that is with senseless festivities that lasted for two whole days and nights Three thousand roubles worth of food and drink was consumed but the music of the wretched hired band the noisy toasts the scurrying to and fro of the footmen the uproar and crowding prevented them from appreciating the taste of the expensive wines and wonderful delicacies ordered from Moscow VII One long winter night Kovrin was lying in bed reading a French novel Poor Tanya who had headaches in the evenings from living in town to which she was not accustomed had been asleep a long while and from time to time articulated some incoherent phrase in her restless dreams It struck three o clock Kovrin put out the light and lay down to sleep lay for a long time with his eyes closed but could not get to sleep because as he fancied the room was very hot and Tanya talked in her sleep At half past four he lighted the candle again and this time he saw the black monk sitting in an arm chair near the bed Good morning said the monk and after a brief pause he asked What are you thinking of now Of fame answered Kovrin In the French novel I have just been reading there is a description of a young savant who does silly things and pines away through worrying about fame I can t understand such anxiety Because you are wise Your attitude towards fame is one of indifference as towards a toy which no longer interests you Yes that is true Renown does not allure you now What is there flattering amusing or edifying in their carving your name on a tombstone then time rubbing off the inscription together with the gilding Moreover happily there are too many of you for the weak memory of mankind to be able to retain your names Of course assented Kovrin Besides why should they be remembered But let us talk of something else Of happiness for instance What is happiness When the clock struck five he was sitting on the bed dangling his feet to the carpet talking to the monk In ancient times a happy man grew at last frightened of his happiness it was so great and to propitiate the gods he brought as a sacrifice his favourite ring Do you know I too like Polykrates begin to be uneasy of my happiness It seems strange to me that from morning to night I feel nothing but joy it fills my whole being and smothers all other feelings I don t know what sadness grief or boredom is Here I am not asleep I suffer from sleeplessness but I am not dull I say it in earnest I begin to feel perplexed But why the monk asked in wonder Is joy a supernatural feeling Ought it not to be the normal state of man The more highly a man is developed on the intellectual and moral side the more independent he is the more pleasure life gives him Socrates Diogenes and Marcus Aurelius were joyful not sorrowful And the Apostle tells us Rejoice continually Rejoice and be glad But will the gods be suddenly wrathful Kovrin jested and he laughed If they take from me comfort and make me go cold and hungry it won t be very much to my taste Meanwhile Tanya woke up and looked with amazement and horror at her husband He was talking addressing the arm chair laughing and gesticulating his eyes were gleaming and there was something strange in his laugh Andryusha whom are you talking to she asked clutching the hand he stretched out to the monk Andryusha Whom Oh Whom said Kovrin in confusion Why to him He is sitting here he said pointing to the black monk There is no one here no one Andryusha you are ill Tanya put her arm round her husband and held him tight as though protecting him from the apparition and put her hand over his eyes You are ill she sobbed trembling all over Forgive me my precious my dear one but I have noticed for a long time that your mind is clouded in some way You are mentally ill Andryusha Her trembling infected him too He glanced once more at the arm chair which was now empty felt a sudden weakness in his arms and legs was frightened and began dressing It s nothing Tanya it s nothing he muttered shivering I really am not quite well it s time to admit that I have noticed it for a long time and father has noticed it she said trying to suppress her sobs You talk to yourself smile somehow strangely and can t sleep Oh my God my God save us she said in terror But don t be frightened Andryusha for God s sake don t be frightened She began dressing too Only now looking at her Kovrin realised the danger of his position realised the meaning of the black monk and his conversations with him It was clear to him now that he was mad Neither of them knew why they dressed and went into the dining room she in front and he following her There they found Yegor Semyonitch standing in his dressing gown and with a candle in his hand He was staying with them and had been awakened by Tanya s sobs Don t be frightened Andryusha Tanya was saying shivering as though in a fever don t be frightened Father it will all pass over it will all pass over Kovrin was too much agitated to speak He wanted to say to his father in law in a playful tone Congratulate me it appears I have gone out of my mind but he could only move his lips and smile bitterly At nine o clock in the morning they put on his jacket and fur coat wrapped him up in a shawl and took him in a carriage to a doctor VIII Summer had come again and the doctor advised their going into the country Kovrin had recovered he had left off seeing the black monk and he had only to get up his strength Staying at his father in law s he drank a great deal of milk worked for only two hours out of the twenty four and neither smoked nor drank wine On the evening before Elijah s Day they had an evening service in the house When the deacon was handing the priest the censer the immense old room smelt like a graveyard and Kovrin felt bored He went out into the garden Without noticing the gorgeous flowers he walked about the garden sat down on a seat then strolled about the park reaching the river he went down and then stood lost in thought looking at the water The sullen pines with their shaggy roots which had seen him a year before so young so joyful and confident were not whispering now but standing mute and motionless as though they did not recognise him And indeed his head was closely cropped his beautiful long hair was gone his step was lagging his face was fuller and paler than last summer He crossed by the footbridge to the other side Where the year before there had been rye the oats stood reaped and lay in rows The sun had set and there was a broad stretch of glowing red on the horizon a sign of windy weather next day It was still Looking in the direction from which the year before the black monk had first appeared Kovrin stood for twenty minutes till the evening glow had begun to fade When listless and dissatisfied he returned home the service was over Yegor Semyonitch and Tanya were sitting on the steps of the verandah drinking tea They were talking of something but seeing Kovrin ceased at once and he concluded from their faces that their talk had been about him I believe it is time for you to have your milk Tanya said to her husband No it is not time yet he said sitting down on the bottom step Drink it yourself I don t want it Tanya exchanged a troubled glance with her father and said in a guilty voice You notice yourself that milk does you good Yes a great deal of good Kovrin laughed I congratulate you I have gained a pound in weight since Friday He pressed his head tightly in his hands and said miserably Why why have you cured me Preparations of bromide idleness hot baths supervision cowardly consternation at every mouthful at every step all this will reduce me at last to idiocy I went out of my mind I had megalomania but then I was cheerful confident and even happy I was interesting and original Now I have become more sensible and stolid but I am just like every one else I am mediocrity I am weary of life Oh how cruelly you have treated me I saw hallucinations but what harm did that do to any one I ask what harm did that do any one Goodness knows what you are saying sighed Yegor Semyonitch It s positively wearisome to listen to it Then don t listen The presence of other people especially Yegor Semyonitch irritated Kovrin now he answered him drily coldly and even rudely never looked at him but with irony and hatred while Yegor Semyonitch was overcome with confusion and cleared his throat guiltily though he was not conscious of any fault in himself At a loss to understand why their charming and affectionate relations had changed so abruptly Tanya huddled up to her father and looked anxiously in his face she wanted to understand and could not understand and all that was clear to her was that their relations were growing worse and worse every day that of late her father had begun to look much older and her husband had grown irritable capricious quarrelsome and uninteresting She could not laugh or sing at dinner she ate nothing did not sleep for nights together expecting something awful and was so worn out that on one occasion she lay in a dead faint from dinner time till evening During the service she thought her father was crying and now while the three of them were sitting together on the terrace she made an effort not to think of it How fortunate Buddha Mahomed and Shakespeare were that their kind relations and doctors did not cure them of their ecstasy and their inspiration said Kovrin If Mahomed had taken bromide for his nerves had worked only two hours out of the twenty four and had drunk milk that remarkable man would have left no more trace after him than his dog Doctors and kind relations will succeed in stupefying mankind in making mediocrity pass for genius and in bringing civilisation to ruin If only you knew Kovrin said with annoyance how grateful I am to you He felt intense irritation and to avoid saying too much he got up quickly and went into the house It was still and the fragrance of the tobacco plant and the marvel of Peru floated in at the open window The moonlight lay in green patches on the floor and on the piano in the big dark dining room Kovrin remembered the raptures of the previous summer when there had been the same scent of the marvel of Peru and the moon had shone in at the window To bring back the mood of last year he went quickly to his study lighted a strong cigar and told the footman to bring him some wine But the cigar left a bitter and disgusting taste in his mouth and the wine had not the same flavour as it had the year before And so great is the effect of giving up a habit the cigar and the two gulps of wine made him giddy and brought on palpitations of the heart so that he was obliged to take bromide Before going to bed Tanya said to him Father adores you You are cross with him about something and it is killing him Look at him he is ageing not from day to day but from hour to hour I entreat you Andryusha for God s sake for the sake of your dead father for the sake of my peace of mind be affectionate to him I can t I don t want to But why asked Tanya beginning to tremble all over Explain why Because he is antipathetic to me that s all said Kovrin carelessly and he shrugged his shoulders But we won t talk about him he is your father I can t understand I can t said Tanya pressing her hands to her temples and staring at a fixed point Something incomprehensible awful is going on in the house You have changed grown unlike yourself You clever extraordinary man as you are are irritated over trifles meddle in paltry nonsense Such trivial things excite you that sometimes one is simply amazed and can t believe that it is you Come come don t be angry don t be angry she went on kissing his hands frightened of her own words You are clever kind noble You will be just to father He is so good He is not good he is just good natured Burlesque old uncles like your father with well fed good natured faces extraordinarily hospitable and queer at one time used to touch me and amuse me in novels and in farces and in life now I dislike them They are egoists to the marrow of their bones What disgusts me most of all is their being so well fed and that purely bovine purely hoggish optimism of a full stomach Tanya sat down on the bed and laid her head on the pillow This is torture she said and from her voice it was evident that she was utterly exhausted and that it was hard for her to speak Not one moment of peace since the winter Why it s awful My God I am wretched Oh of course I am Herod and you and your father are the innocents Of course His face seemed to Tanya ugly and unpleasant Hatred and an ironical expression did not suit him And indeed she had noticed before that there was something lacking in his face as though ever since his hair had been cut his face had changed too She wanted to say something wounding to him but immediately she caught herself in this antagonistic feeling she was frightened and went out of the bedroom IX Kovrin received a professorship at the University The inaugural address was fixed for the second of December and a notice to that effect was hung up in the corridor at the University But on the day appointed he informed the students inspector by telegram that he was prevented by illness from giving the lecture He had haemorrhage from the throat He was often spitting blood but it happened two or three times a month that there was a considerable loss of blood and then he grew extremely weak and sank into a drowsy condition This illness did not particularly frighten him as he knew that his mother had lived for ten years or longer suffering from the same disease and the doctors assured him that there was no danger and had only advised him to avoid excitement to lead a regular life and to speak as little as possible In January again his lecture did not take place owing to the same reason and in February it was too late to begin the course It had to be postponed to the following year By now he was living not with Tanya but with another woman who was two years older than he was and who looked after him as though he were a baby He was in a calm and tranquil state of mind he readily gave in to her and when Varvara Nikolaevna that was the name of his friend decided to take him to the Crimea he agreed though he had a presentiment that no good would come of the trip They reached Sevastopol in the evening and stopped at an hotel to rest and go on the next day to Yalta They were both exhausted by the journey Varvara Nikolaevna had some tea went to bed and was soon asleep But Kovrin did not go to bed An hour before starting for the station he had received a letter from Tanya and had not brought himself to open it and now it was lying in his coat pocket and the thought of it excited him disagreeably At the bottom of his heart he genuinely considered now that his marriage to Tanya had been a mistake He was glad that their separation was final and the thought of that woman who in the end had turned into a living relic still walking about though everything seemed dead in her except her big staring intelligent eyes the thought of her roused in him nothing but pity and disgust with himself The handwriting on the envelope reminded him how cruel and unjust he had been two years before how he had worked off his anger at his spiritual emptiness his boredom his loneliness and his dissatisfaction with life by revenging himself on people in no way to blame He remembered also how he had torn up his dissertation and all the articles he had written during his illness and how he had thrown them out of window and the bits of paper had fluttered in the wind and caught on the trees and flowers In every line of them he saw strange utterly groundless pretension shallow defiance arrogance megalomania and they made him feel as though he were reading a description of his vices But when the last manuscript had been torn up and sent flying out of window he felt for some reason suddenly bitter and angry he went to his wife and said a great many unpleasant things to her My God how he had tormented her One day wanting to cause her pain he told her that her father had played a very unattractive part in their romance that he had asked him to marry her Yegor Semyonitch accidentally overheard this ran into the room and in his despair could not utter a word could only stamp and make a strange bellowing sound as though he had lost the power of speech and Tanya looking at her father had uttered a heart rending shriek and had fallen into a swoon It was hideous All this came back into his memory as he looked at the familiar writing Kovrin went out on to the balcony it was still warm weather and there was a smell of the sea The wonderful bay reflected the moonshine and the lights and was of a colour for which it was difficult to find a name It was a soft and tender blending of dark blue and green in places the water was like blue vitriol and in places it seemed as though the moonlight were liquefied and filling the bay instead of water And what harmony of colours what an atmosphere of peace calm and sublimity In the lower storey under the balcony the windows were probably open for women s voices and laughter could be heard distinctly Apparently there was an evening party Kovrin made an effort tore open the envelope and going back into his room read My father is just dead I owe that to you for you have killed him Our garden is being ruined strangers are managing it already that is the very thing is happening that poor father dreaded That too I owe to you I hate you with my whole soul and I hope you may soon perish Oh how wretched I am Insufferable anguish is burning my soul My curses on you I took you for an extraordinary man a genius I loved you and you have turned out a madman Kovrin could read no more he tore up the letter and threw it away He was overcome by an uneasiness that was akin to terror Varvara Nikolaevna was asleep behind the screen and he could hear her breathing From the lower storey came the sounds of laughter and women s voices but he felt as though in the whole hotel there were no living soul but him Because Tanya unhappy broken by sorrow had cursed him in her letter and hoped for his perdition he felt eerie and kept glancing hurriedly at the door as though he were afraid that the uncomprehended force which two years before had wrought such havoc in his life and in the life of those near him might come into the room and master him once more He knew by experience that when his nerves were out of hand the best thing for him to do was to work He must sit down to the table and force himself at all costs to concentrate his mind on some one thought He took from his red portfolio a manuscript containing a sketch of a small work of the nature of a compilation which he had planned in case he should find it dull in the Crimea without work He sat down to the table and began working at this plan and it seemed to him that his calm peaceful indifferent mood was coming back The manuscript with the sketch even led him to meditation on the vanity of the world He thought how much life exacts for the worthless or very commonplace blessings it can give a man For instance to gain before forty a university chair to be an ordinary professor to expound ordinary and second hand thoughts in dull heavy insipid language in fact to gain the position of a mediocre learned man he Kovrin had had to study for fifteen years to work day and night to endure a terrible mental illness to experience an unhappy marriage and to do a great number of stupid and unjust things which it would have been pleasant not to remember Kovrin recognised clearly now that he was a mediocrity and readily resigned himself to it as he considered that every man ought to be satisfied with what he is The plan of the volume would have soothed him completely but the torn letter showed white on the floor and prevented him from concentrating his attention He got up from the table picked up the pieces of the letter and threw them out of window but there was a light wind blowing from the sea and the bits of paper were scattered on the windowsill Again he was overcome by uneasiness akin to terror and he felt as though in the whole hotel there were no living soul but himself He went out on the balcony The bay like a living thing looked at him with its multitude of light blue dark blue turquoise and fiery eyes and seemed beckoning to him And it really was hot and oppressive and it would not have been amiss to have a bathe Suddenly in the lower storey under the balcony a violin began playing and two soft feminine voices began singing It was something familiar The song was about a maiden full of sick fancies who heard one night in her garden mysterious sounds so strange and lovely that she was obliged to recognise them as a holy harmony which is unintelligible to us mortals and so flies back to heaven Kovrin caught his breath and there was a pang of sadness at his heart and a thrill of the sweet exquisite delight he had so long forgotten began to stir in his breast A tall black column like a whirlwind or a waterspout appeared on the further side of the bay It moved with fearful rapidity across the bay towards the hotel growing smaller and darker as it came and Kovrin only just had time to get out of the way to let it pass The monk with bare grey head black eyebrows barefoot his arms crossed over his breast floated by him and stood still in the middle of the room Why did you not believe me he asked reproachfully looking affectionately at Kovrin If you had believed me then that you were a genius you would not have spent these two years so gloomily and so wretchedly Kovrin already believed that he was one of God s chosen and a genius he vividly recalled his conversations with the monk in the past and tried to speak but the blood flowed from his throat on to his breast and not knowing what he was doing he passed his hands over his breast and his cuffs were soaked with blood He tried to call Varvara Nikolaevna who was asleep behind the screen he made an effort and said Tanya He fell on the floor and propping himself on his arms called again Tanya He called Tanya called to the great garden with the gorgeous flowers sprinkled with dew called to the park the pines with their shaggy roots the rye field his marvellous learning his youth courage joy called to life which was so lovely He saw on the floor near his face a great pool of blood and was too weak to utter a word but an unspeakable infinite happiness flooded his whole being Below under the balcony they were playing the serenade and the black monk whispered to him that he was a genius and that he was dying only because his frail human body had lost its balance and could no longer serve as the mortal garb of genius When Varvara Nikolaevna woke up and came out from behind the screen Kovrin was dead and a blissful smile was set upon his face VOLODYA AT five o clock one Sunday afternoon in summer Volodya a plain shy sickly looking lad of seventeen was sitting in the arbour of the Shumihins country villa feeling dreary His despondent thought flowed in three directions In the first place he had next day Monday an examination in mathematics he knew that if he did not get through the written examination on the morrow he would be expelled for he had already been two years in the sixth form and had two and three quarter marks for algebra in his annual report In the second place his presence at the villa of the Shumihins a wealthy family with aristocratic pretensions was a continual source of mortification to his amour propre It seemed to him that Madame Shumihin looked upon him and his maman as poor relations and dependents that they laughed at his maman and did not respect her He had on one occasion accidently overheard Madame Shumihin in the verandah telling her cousin Anna Fyodorovna that his maman still tried to look young and got herself up that she never paid her losses at cards and had a partiality for other people s shoes and tobacco Every day Volodya besought his maman not to go to the Shumihins and drew a picture of the humiliating part she played with these gentlefolk He tried to persuade her said rude things but she a frivolous pampered woman who had run through two fortunes her own and her husband s in her time and always gravitated towards acquaintances of high rank did not understand him and twice a week Volodya had to accompany her to the villa he hated In the third place the youth could not for one instant get rid of a strange unpleasant feeling which was absolutely new to him It seemed to him that he was in love with Anna Fyodorovna the Shumihins cousin who was staying with them She was a vivacious loud voiced laughter loving healthy and vigorous lady of thirty with rosy cheeks plump shoulders a plump round chin and a continual smile on her thin lips She was neither young nor beautiful Volodya knew that perfectly well but for some reason he could not help thinking of her looking at her while she shrugged her plump shoulders and moved her flat back as she played croquet or after prolonged laughter and running up and down stairs sank into a low chair and half closing her eyes and gasping for breath pretended that she was stifling and could not breathe She was married Her husband a staid and dignified architect came once a week to the villa slept soundly and returned to town Volodya s strange feeling had begun with his conceiving an unaccountable hatred for the architect and feeling relieved every time he went back to town Now sitting in the arbour thinking of his examination next day and of his maman at whom they laughed he felt an intense desire to see Nyuta that was what the Shumihins called Anna Fyodorovna to hear her laughter and the rustle of her dress This desire was not like the pure poetic love of which he read in novels and about which he dreamed every night when he went to bed it was strange incomprehensible he was ashamed of it and afraid of it as of something very wrong and impure something which it was disagreeable to confess even to himself It s not love he said to himself One can t fall in love with women of thirty who are married It is only a little intrigue Yes an intrigue Pondering on the intrigue he thought of his uncontrollable shyness his lack of moustache his freckles his narrow eyes and put himself in his imagination side by side with Nyuta and the juxtaposition seemed to him impossible then he made haste to imagine himself bold handsome witty dressed in the latest fashion When his dreams were at their height as he sat huddled together and looking at the ground in a dark corner of the arbour he heard the sound of light footsteps Some one was coming slowly along the avenue Soon the steps stopped and something white gleamed in the entrance Is there any one here asked a woman s voice Volodya recognised the voice and raised his head in a fright Who is here asked Nyuta going into the arbour Ah it is you Volodya What are you doing here Thinking And how can you go on thinking thinking thinking That s the way to go out of your mind Volodya got up and looked in a dazed way at Nyuta She had only just come back from bathing Over her shoulder there was hanging a sheet and a rough towel and from under the white silk kerchief on her head he could see the wet hair sticking to her forehead There was the cool damp smell of the bath house and of almond soap still hanging about her She was out of breath from running quickly The top button of her blouse was undone so that the boy saw her throat and bosom Why don t you say something said Nyuta looking Volodya up and down It s not polite to be silent when a lady talks to you What a clumsy seal you are though Volodya You always sit saying nothing thinking like some philosopher There s not a spark of life or fire in you You are really horrid At your age you ought to be living skipping and jumping chattering flirting falling in love Volodya looked at the sheet that was held by a plump white hand and thought He s mute said Nyuta with wonder it is strange really Listen Be a man Come you might smile at least Phew the horrid philosopher she laughed But do you know Volodya why you are such a clumsy seal Because you don t devote yourself to the ladies Why don t you It s true there are no girls here but there is nothing to prevent your flirting with the married ladies Why don t you flirt with me for instance Volodya listened and scratched his forehead in acute and painful irresolution It s only very proud people who are silent and love solitude Nyuta went on pulling his hand away from his forehead You are proud Volodya Why do you look at me like that from under your brows Look me straight in the face if you please Yes now then clumsy seal Volodya made up his mind to speak Wanting to smile he twitched his lower lip blinked and again put his hand to his forehead I I love you he said Nyuta raised her eyebrows in surprise and laughed What do I hear she sang as prima donnas sing at the opera when they hear something awful What What did you say Say it again say it again I I love you repeated Volodya And without his will s having any part in his action without reflection or understanding he took half a step towards Nyuta and clutched her by the arm Everything was dark before his eyes and tears came into them The whole world was turned into one big rough towel which smelt of the bathhouse Bravo bravo he heard a merry laugh Why don t you speak I want you to speak Well Seeing that he was not prevented from holding her arm Volodya glanced at Nyuta s laughing face and clumsily awkwardly put both arms round her waist his hands meeting behind her back He held her round the waist with both arms while putting her hands up to her head showing the dimples in her elbows she set her hair straight under the kerchief and said in a calm voice You must be tactful polite charming and you can only become that under feminine influence But what a wicked angry face you have You must talk laugh Yes Volodya don t be surly you are young and will have plenty of time for philosophising Come let go of me I am going Let go Without effort she released her waist and humming something walked out of the arbour Volodya was left alone He smoothed his hair smiled and walked three times to and fro across the arbour then he sat down on the bench and smiled again He felt insufferably ashamed so much so that he wondered that human shame could reach such a pitch of acuteness and intensity Shame made him smile gesticulate and whisper some disconnected words He was ashamed that he had been treated like a small boy ashamed of his shyness and most of all that he had had the audacity to put his arms round the waist of a respectable married woman though as it seemed to him he had neither through age nor by external quality nor by social position any right to do so He jumped up went out of the arbour and without looking round walked into the recesses of the garden furthest from the house Ah only to get away from here as soon as possible he thought clutching his head My God as soon as possible The train by which Volodya was to go back with his maman was at eight forty There were three hours before the train started but he would with pleasure have gone to the station at once without waiting for his maman At eight o clock he went to the house His whole figure was expressive of determination what would be would be He made up his mind to go in boldly to look them straight in the face to speak in a loud voice regardless of everything He crossed the terrace the big hall and the drawing room and there stopped to take breath He could hear them in the dining room drinking tea Madame Shumihin maman and Nyuta were talking and laughing about something Volodya listened I assure you said Nyuta I could not believe my eyes When he began declaring his passion and just imagine put his arms round my waist I should not have recognised him And you know he has a way with him When he told me he was in love with me there was something brutal in his face like a Circassian Really gasped maman going off into a peal of laughter Really How he does remind me of his father Volodya ran back and dashed out into the open air How could they talk of it aloud he wondered in agony clasping his hands and looking up to the sky in horror They talk aloud in cold blood and maman laughed Maman My God why didst Thou give me such a mother Why But he had to go to the house come what might He walked three times up and down the avenue grew a little calmer and went into the house Why didn t you come in in time for tea Madame Shumihin asked sternly I am sorry it s it s time for me to go he muttered not raising his eyes Maman it s eight o clock You go alone my dear said his maman languidly I am staying the night with Lili Goodbye my dear Let me make the sign of the cross over you She made the sign of the cross over her son and said in French turning to Nyuta He s rather like Lermontov isn t he Saying good bye after a fashion without looking any one in the face Volodya went out of the dining room Ten minutes later he was walking along the road to the station and was glad of it Now he felt neither frightened nor ashamed he breathed freely and easily About half a mile from the station he sat down on a stone by the side of the road and gazed at the sun which was half hidden behind a barrow There were lights already here and there at the station and one green light glimmered dimly but the train was not yet in sight It was pleasant to Volodya to sit still without moving and to watch the evening coming little by little The darkness of the arbour the footsteps the smell of the bath house the laughter and the waist all these rose with amazing vividness before his imagination and all this was no longer so terrible and important as before It s of no consequence She did not pull her hand away and laughed when I held her by the waist he thought So she must have liked it If she had disliked it she would have been angry And now Volodya felt sorry that he had not had more boldness there in the arbour He felt sorry that he was so stupidly going away and he was by now persuaded that if the same thing happened again he would be bolder and look at it more simply And it would not be difficult for the opportunity to occur again They used to stroll about for a long time after supper at the Shumihins If Volodya went for a walk with Nyuta in the dark garden there would be an opportunity I will go back he thought and will go by the morning train to morrow I will say I have missed the train And he turned back Madame Shumihin Maman Nyuta and one of the nieces were sitting on the verandah playing vint When Volodya told them the lie that he had missed the train they were uneasy that he might be late for the examination day and advised him to get up early All the while they were playing he sat on one side greedily watching Nyuta and waiting He already had a plan prepared in his mind he would go up to Nyuta in the dark would take her by the hand then would embrace her there would be no need to say anything as both of them would understand without words But after supper the ladies did not go for a walk in the garden but went on playing cards They played till one o clock at night and then broke up to go to bed How stupid it all is Volodya thought with vexation as he got into bed But never mind I ll wait till to morrow to morrow in the arbour It doesn t matter He did not attempt to go to sleep but sat in bed hugging his knees and thinking All thought of the examination was hateful to him He had already made up his mind that they would expel him and that there was nothing terrible about his being expelled On the contrary it was a good thing a very good thing in fact Next day he would be as free as a bird he would put on ordinary clothes instead of his school uniform would smoke openly come out here and make love to Nyuta when he liked and he would not be a schoolboy but a young man And as for the rest of it what is called a career a future that was clear Volodya would go into the army or the telegraph service or he would go into a chemist s shop and work his way up till he was a dispenser There were lots of callings An hour or two passed and he was still sitting and thinking Towards three o clock when it was beginning to get light the door creaked cautiously and his maman came into the room Aren t you asleep she asked yawning Go to sleep I have only come in for a minute I am only fetching the drops What for Poor Lili has got spasms again Go to sleep my child your examination s to morrow She took a bottle of something out of the cupboard went to the window read the label and went away Marya Leontyevna those are not the drops Volodya heard a woman s voice a minute later That s convallaria and Lili wants morphine Is your son asleep Ask him to look for it It was Nyuta s voice Volodya turned cold He hurriedly put on his trousers flung his coat over his shoulders and went to the door Do you understand Morphine Nyuta explained in a whisper There must be a label in Latin Wake Volodya he will find it Maman opened the door and Volodya caught sight of Nyuta She was wearing the same loose wrapper in which she had gone to bathe Her hair hung loose and disordered on her shoulders her face looked sleepy and dark in the half light Why Volodya is not asleep she said Volodya look in the cupboard for the morphine there s a dear What a nuisance Lili is She has always something the matter Maman muttered something yawned and went away Look for it said Nyuta Why are you standing still Volodya went to the cupboard knelt down and began looking through the bottles and boxes of medicine His hands were trembling and he had a feeling in his chest and stomach as though cold waves were running all over his inside He felt suffocated and giddy from the smell of ether carbolic acid and various drugs which he quite unnecessarily snatched up with his trembling fingers and spilled in so doing I believe maman has gone he thought That s a good thing a good thing Will you be quick said Nyuta drawling In a minute Here I believe this is morphine said Volodya reading on one of the labels the word morph Here it is Nyuta was standing in the doorway in such a way that one foot was in his room and one was in the passage She was tidying her hair which was difficult to put in order because it was so thick and long and looked absent mindedly at Volodya In her loose wrap with her sleepy face and her hair down in the dim light that came into the white sky not yet lit by the sun she seemed to Volodya captivating magnificent Fascinated trembling all over and remembering with relish how he had held that exquisite body in his arms in the arbour he handed her the bottle and said How wonderful you are What She came into the room What she asked smiling He was silent and looked at her then just as in the arbour he took her hand and she looked at him with a smile and waited for what would happen next I love you he whispered She left off smiling thought a minute and said Wait a little I think somebody is coming Oh these schoolboys she said in an undertone going to the door and peeping out into the passage No there is no one to be seen She came back Then it seemed to Volodya that the room Nyuta the sunrise and himself all melted together in one sensation of acute extraordinary incredible bliss for which one might give up one s whole life and face eternal torments But half a minute passed and all that vanished Volodya saw only a fat plain face distorted by an expression of repulsion and he himself suddenly felt a loathing for what had happened I must go away though said Nyuta looking at Volodya with disgust What a wretched ugly fie ugly duckling How unseemly her long hair her loose wrap her steps her voice seemed to Volodya now Ugly duckling he thought after she had gone away I really am ugly everything is ugly The sun was rising the birds were singing loudly he could hear the gardener walking in the garden and the creaking of his wheelbarrow and soon afterwards he heard the lowing of the cows and the sounds of the shepherd s pipe The sunlight and the sounds told him that somewhere in this world there is a pure refined poetical life But where was it Volodya had never heard a word of it from his maman or any of the people round about him When the footman came to wake him for the morning train he pretended to be asleep Bother it Damn it all he thought He got up between ten and eleven Combing his hair before the looking glass and looking at his ugly face pale from his sleepless night he thought It s perfectly true an ugly duckling When maman saw him and was horrified that he was not at his examination Volodya said I overslept myself maman But don t worry I will get a medical certificate Madame Shumihin and Nyuta waked up at one o clock Volodya heard Madame Shumihin open her window with a bang heard Nyuta go off into a peal of laughter in reply to her coarse voice He saw the door open and a string of nieces and other toadies among the latter was his maman file into lunch caught a glimpse of Nyuta s freshly washed laughing face and beside her the black brows and beard of her husband the architect who had just arrived Nyuta was wearing a Little Russian dress which did not suit her at all and made her look clumsy the architect was making dull and vulgar jokes The rissoles served at lunch had too much onion in them so it seemed to Volodya It also seemed to him that Nyuta laughed loudly on purpose and kept glancing in his direction to give him to understand that the memory of the night did not trouble her in the least and that she was not aware of the presence at table of the ugly duckling At four o clock Volodya drove to the station with his maman Foul memories the sleepless night the prospect of expulsion from school the stings of conscience all roused in him now an oppressive gloomy anger He looked at maman s sharp profile at her little nose and at the raincoat which was a present from Nyuta and muttered Why do you powder It s not becoming at your age You make yourself up don t pay your debts at cards smoke other people s tobacco It s hateful I don t love you I don t love you He was insulting her and she moved her little eyes about in alarm flung up her hands and whispered in horror What are you saying my dear Good gracious the coachman will hear Be quiet or the coachman will hear He can overhear everything I don t love you I don t love you he went on breathlessly You ve no soul and no morals Don t dare to wear that raincoat Do you hear Or else I will tear it into rags Control yourself my child maman wept the coachman can hear And where is my father s fortune Where is your money You have wasted it all I am not ashamed of being poor but I am ashamed of having such a mother When my schoolfellows ask questions about you I always blush In the train they had to pass two stations before they reached the town Volodya spent all the time on the little platform between two carriages and shivered all over He did not want to go into the compartment because there the mother he hated was sitting He hated himself hated the ticket collectors the smoke from the engine the cold to which he attributed his shivering And the heavier the weight on his heart the more strongly he felt that somewhere in the world among some people there was a pure honourable warm refined life full of love affection gaiety and serenity He felt this and was so intensely miserable that one of the passengers after looking in his face attentively actually asked You have the toothache I suppose In the town maman and Volodya lived with Marya Petrovna a lady of noble rank who had a large flat and let rooms to boarders Maman had two rooms one with windows and two pictures in gold frames hanging on the walls in which her bed stood and in which she lived and a little dark room opening out of it in which Volodya lived Here there was a sofa on which he slept and except that sofa there was no other furniture the rest of the room was entirely filled up with wicker baskets full of clothes cardboard hat boxes and all sorts of rubbish which maman preserved for some reason or other Volodya prepared his lessons either in his mother s room or in the general room as the large room in which the boarders assembled at dinner time and in the evening was called On reaching home he lay down on his sofa and put the quilt over him to stop his shivering The cardboard hat boxes the wicker baskets and the other rubbish reminded him that he had not a room of his own that he had no refuge in which he could get away from his mother from her visitors and from the voices that were floating up from the general room The satchel and the books lying about in the corners reminded him of the examination he had missed For some reason there came into his mind quite inappropriately Mentone where he had lived with his father when he was seven years old he thought of Biarritz and two little English girls with whom he ran about on the sand He tried to recall to his memory the colour of the sky the sea the height of the waves and his mood at the time but he could not succeed The English girls flitted before his imagination as though they were living all the rest was a medley of images that floated away in confusion No it s cold here thought Volodya He got up put on his overcoat and went into the general room There they were drinking tea There were three people at the samovar maman an old lady with tortoiseshell pince nez who gave music lessons and Avgustin Mihalitch an elderly and very stout Frenchman who was employed at a perfumery factory I have had no dinner to day said maman I ought to send the maid to buy some bread Dunyasha shouted the Frenchman It appeared that the maid had been sent out somewhere by the lady of the house Oh that s of no consequence said the Frenchman with a broad smile I will go for some bread myself at once Oh it s nothing He laid his strong pungent cigar in a conspicuous place put on his hat and went out After he had gone away maman began telling the music teacher how she had been staying at the Shumihins and how warmly they welcomed her Lili Shumihin is a relation of mine you know she said Her late husband General Shumihin was a cousin of my husband And she was a Baroness Kolb by birth Maman that s false said Volodya irritably Why tell lies He knew perfectly well that what his mother said was true in what she was saying about General Shumihin and about Baroness Kolb there was not a word of lying but nevertheless he felt that she was lying There was a suggestion of falsehood in her manner of speaking in the expression of her face in her eyes in everything You are lying repeated Volodya and he brought his fist down on the table with such force that all the crockery shook and maman s tea was spilt over Why do you talk about generals and baronesses It s all lies The music teacher was disconcerted and coughed into her handkerchief affecting to sneeze and maman began to cry Where can I go thought Volodya He had been in the street already he was ashamed to go to his schoolfellows Again quite incongruously he remembered the two little English girls He paced up and down the general room and went into Avgustin Mihalitch s room Here there was a strong smell of ethereal oils and glycerine soap On the table in the window and even on the chairs there were a number of bottles glasses and wineglasses containing fluids of various colours Volodya took up from the table a newspaper opened it and read the title Figaro There was a strong and pleasant scent about the paper Then he took a revolver from the table There there Don t take any notice of it The music teacher was comforting maman in the next room He is young Young people of his age never restrain themselves One must resign oneself to that No Yevgenya Andreyevna he s too spoilt said maman in a singsong voice He has no one in authority over him and I am weak and can do nothing Oh I am unhappy Volodya put the muzzle of the revolver to his mouth felt something like a trigger or spring and pressed it with his finger Then felt something else projecting and once more pressed it Taking the muzzle out of his mouth he wiped it with the lapel of his coat looked at the lock He had never in his life taken a weapon in his hand before I believe one ought to raise this he reflected Yes it seems so Avgustin Mihalitch went into the general room and with a laugh began telling them about something Volodya put the muzzle in his mouth again pressed it with his teeth and pressed something with his fingers There was a sound of a shot Something hit Volodya in the back of his head with terrible violence and he fell on the table with his face downwards among the bottles and glasses Then he saw his father as in Mentone in a top hat with a wide black band on it wearing mourning for some lady suddenly seize him by both hands and they fell headlong into a very deep dark pit Then everything was blurred and vanished AN ANONYMOUS STORY I THROUGH causes which it is not the time to go into in detail I had to enter the service of a Petersburg official called Orlov in the capacity of a footman He was about five and thirty and was called Georgy Ivanitch Both g s hard as in Gorgon e like ai in rain I entered this Orlov s service on account of his father a prominent political man whom I looked upon as a serious enemy of my cause I reckoned that living with the son I should from the conversations I should hear and from the letters and papers I should find on the table learn every detail of the father s plans and intentions As a rule at eleven o clock in the morning the electric bell rang in my footman s quarters to let me know that my master was awake When I went into the bedroom with his polished shoes and brushed clothes Georgy Ivanitch would be sitting in his bed with a face that looked not drowsy but rather exhausted by sleep and he would gaze off in one direction without any sign of satisfaction at having waked I helped him to dress and he let me do it with an air of reluctance without speaking or noticing my presence then with his head wet with washing smelling of fresh scent he used to go into the dining room to drink his coffee He used to sit at the table sipping his coffee and glancing through the newspapers while the maid Polya and I stood respectfully at the door gazing at him Two grown up persons had to stand watching with the gravest attention a third drinking coffee and munching rusks It was probably ludicrous and grotesque but I saw nothing humiliating in having to stand near the door though I was quite as well born and well educated as Orlov himself I was in the first stage of consumption and was suffering from something else possibly even more serious than consumption I don t know whether it was the effect of my illness or of an incipient change in my philosophy of life of which I was not conscious at the time but I was day by day more possessed by a passionate irritating longing for ordinary everyday life I yearned for mental tranquillity health fresh air good food I was becoming a dreamer and like a dreamer I did not know exactly what I wanted Sometimes I felt inclined to go into a monastery to sit there for days together by the window and gaze at the trees and the fields sometimes I fancied I would buy fifteen acres of land and settle down as a country gentleman sometimes I inwardly vowed to take up science and become a professor at some provincial university I was a retired navy lieutenant I dreamed of the sea of our squadron and of the corvette in which I had made the cruise round the world I longed to experience again the indescribable feeling when walking in the tropical forest or looking at the sunset in the Bay of Bengal one is thrilled with ecstasy and at the same time homesick I dreamed of mountains women music and with the curiosity of a child I looked into people s faces listened to their voices And when I stood at the door and watched Orlov sipping his coffee I felt not a footman but a man interested in everything in the world even in Orlov In appearance Orlov was a typical Petersburger with narrow shoulders a long waist sunken temples eyes of an indefinite colour and scanty dingy coloured hair beard and moustaches His face had a stale unpleasant look though it was studiously cared for It was particularly unpleasant when he was asleep or lost in thought It is not worth while describing a quite ordinary appearance besides Petersburg is not Spain and a man s appearance is not of much consequence even in love affairs and is only of value to a handsome footman or coachman I have spoken of Orlov s face and hair only because there was something in his appearance worth mentioning When Orlov took a newspaper or book whatever it might be or met people whoever they be an ironical smile began to come into his eyes and his whole countenance assumed an expression of light mockery in which there was no malice Before reading or hearing anything he always had his irony in readiness as a savage has his shield It was an habitual irony like some old liquor brewed years ago and now it came into his face probably without any participation of his will as it were by reflex action But of that later Soon after midday he took his portfolio full of papers and drove to his office He dined away from home and returned after eight o clock I used to light the lamp and candles in his study and he would sit down in a low chair with his legs stretched out on another chair and reclining in that position would begin reading Almost every day he brought in new books with him or received parcels of them from the shops and there were heaps of books in three languages to say nothing of Russian which he had read and thrown away in the corners of my room and under my bed He read with extraordinary rapidity They say Tell me what you read and I ll tell you who you are That may be true but it was absolutely impossible to judge of Orlov by what he read It was a regular hotchpotch Philosophy French novels political economy finance new poets and publications of the firm Posrednik and he read it all with the same rapidity and with the same ironical expression in his eyes I e Tchertkov and others publishers of Tolstoy who issued good literature for peasants reading After ten o clock he carefully dressed often in evening dress very rarely in his kammer junker s uniform and went out returning in the morning Our relations were quiet and peaceful and we never had any misunderstanding As a rule he did not notice my presence and when he talked to me there was no expression of irony on his face he evidently did not look upon me as a human being I only once saw him angry One day it was a week after I had entered his service he came back from some dinner at nine o clock his face looked ill humoured and exhausted When I followed him into his study to light the candles he said to me There s a nasty smell in the flat No the air is fresh I answered I tell you there s a bad smell he answered irritably I open the movable panes every day Don t argue blockhead he shouted I was offended and was on the point of answering and goodness knows how it would have ended if Polya who knew her master better than I did had not intervened There really is a disagreeable smell she said raising her eyebrows What can it be from Stepan open the pane in the drawing room and light the fire With much bustle and many exclamations she went through all the rooms rustling her skirts and squeezing the sprayer with a hissing sound And Orlov was still out of humour he was obviously restraining himself not to vent his ill temper aloud He was sitting at the table and rapidly writing a letter After writing a few lines he snorted angrily and tore it up then he began writing again Damn them all he muttered They expect me to have an abnormal memory At last the letter was written he got up from the table and said turning to me Go to Znamensky Street and deliver this letter to Zinaida Fyodorovna Krasnovsky in person But first ask the porter whether her husband that is mister Krasnovsky has returned yet If he has returned don t deliver the letter but come back Wait a minute If she asks whether I have any one here tell her that there have been two gentlemen here since eight o clock writing something I drove to Znamensky Street The porter told me that mister Krasnovsky had not yet come in and I made my way up to the third storey The door was opened by a tall stout drab coloured flunkey with black whiskers who in a sleepy churlish and apathetic voice such as only flunkeys use in addressing other flunkeys asked me what I wanted Before I had time to answer a lady dressed in black came hurriedly into the hall She screwed up her eyes and looked at me Is Zinaida Fyodorovna at home I asked That is me said the lady A letter from Georgy Ivanitch She tore the letter open impatiently and holding it in both hands so that I saw her sparkling diamond rings she began reading I made out a pale face with soft lines a prominent chin and long dark lashes From her appearance I should not have judged the lady to be more than five and twenty Give him my thanks and my greetings she said when she had finished the letter Is there any one with Georgy Ivanitch she asked softly joyfully and as though ashamed of her mistrust Two gentlemen I answered They re writing something Give him my greetings and thanks she repeated bending her head sideways and reading the letter as she walked she went noiselessly out I saw few women at that time and this lady of whom I had a passing glimpse made an impression on me As I walked home I recalled her face and the delicate fragrance about her and fell to dreaming By the time I got home Orlov had gone out II And so my relations with my employer were quiet and peaceful but still the unclean and degrading element which I so dreaded on becoming a footman was conspicuous and made itself felt every day I did not get on with Polya She was a well fed and pampered hussy who adored Orlov because he was a gentleman and despised me because I was a footman Probably from the point of view of a real flunkey or cook she was fascinating with her red cheeks her turned up nose her coquettish glances and the plumpness one might almost say fatness of her person She powdered her face coloured her lips and eyebrows laced herself in and wore a bustle and a bangle made of coins She walked with little ripping steps as she walked she swayed or as they say wriggled her shoulders and back The rustle of her skirts the creaking of her stays the jingle her bangle and the vulgar smell of lip salve toilet vinegar and scent stolen from her master aroused me whilst I was doing the rooms with her in the morning a sensation as though I were taking part with her in some abomination Either because I did not steal as she did or because I displayed no desire to become her lover which she probably looked upon as an insult or perhaps because she felt that I was a man of a different order she hated me from the first day My inexperience my appearance so unlike a flunkey and my illness seemed to her pitiful and excited her disgust I had a bad cough at that time and sometimes at night I prevented her from sleeping as our rooms were only divided by a wooden partition and every morning she said to me Again you didn t let me sleep You ought to be in hospital instead of in service She so genuinely believed that I was hardly a human being but something infinitely below her that like the Roman matrons who were not ashamed to bathe before their slaves she sometimes went about in my presence in nothing but her chemise Once when I was in a happy dreamy mood I asked her at dinner we had soup and roast meat sent in from a restaurant every day Polya do you believe in God Why of course Then I went on you believe there will be a day of judgment and that we shall have to answer to God for every evil action She gave me no reply but simply made a contemptuous grimace and looking that time at her cold eyes and over fed expression I realised that for her complete and finished personality no God no conscience no laws existed and that if I had had to set fire to the house to murder or to rob I could not have hired a better accomplice In my novel surroundings I felt very uncomfortable for the first week at Orlov s before I got used to being addressed as thou and being constantly obliged to tell lies saying My master is not at home when he was In my flunkey s swallow tail I felt as though I were in armour But I grew accustomed to it in time Like a genuine footman I waited at table tidied the rooms ran and drove about on errands of all sorts When Orlov did not want to keep an appointment with Zinaida Fyodorovna or when he forgot that he had promised to go and see her I drove to Znamensky Street put a letter into her hands and told a lie And the result of it all was quite different from what I had expected when I became a footman Every day of this new life of mine was wasted for me and my cause as Orlov never spoke of his father nor did his visitors and all I could learn of the stateman s doings was as before what I could glean from the newspapers or from correspondence with my comrades The hundreds of notes and papers I used to find in the study and read had not the remotest connection with what I was looking for Orlov was absolutely uninterested in his father s political work and looked as though he had never heard of it or as though his father had long been dead III Every Thursday we had visitors I ordered a piece of roast beef from the restaurant and telephoned to Eliseyev s to send us caviare cheese oysters and so on I bought playing cards Polya was busy all day getting ready the tea things and the dinner service To tell the truth this spurt of activity came as a pleasant change in our idle life and Thursdays were for us the most interesting days Only three visitors used to come The most important and perhaps the most interesting was the one called Pekarsky a tall lean man of five and forty with a long hooked nose with a big black beard and a bald patch on his head His eyes were large and prominent and his expression was grave and thoughtful like that of a Greek philosopher He was on the board of management of some railway and also had some post in a bank he was a consulting lawyer in some important Government institution and had business relations with a large number of private persons as a trustee chairman of committees and so on He was of quite a low grade in the service and modestly spoke of himself as a lawyer but he had a vast influence A note or card from him was enough to make a celebrated doctor a director of a railway or a great dignitary see any one without waiting and it was said that through his protection one might obtain even a post of the Fourth Class and get any sort of unpleasant business hushed up He was looked upon as a very intelligent man but his was a strange peculiar intelligence He was able to multiply two hundred thirteen by three hundred seventy three in his head instantaneously or turn English pounds into German marks without help of pencil or paper he understood finance and railway business thoroughly and the machinery of Russian administration had no secrets for him he was a most skilful pleader in civil suits and it was not easy to get the better of him at law But that exceptional intelligence could not grasp many things which are understood even by some stupid people For instance he was absolutely unable to understand why people are depressed why they weep shoot themselves and even kill others why they fret about things that do not affect them personally and why they laugh when they read Gogol or Shtchedrin Everything abstract everything belonging to the domain of thought and feeling was to him boring and incomprehensible like music to one who has no ear He looked at people simply from the business point of view and divided them into competent and incompetent No other classification existed for him Honesty and rectitude were only signs of competence Drinking gambling and debauchery were permissible but must not be allowed to interfere with business Believing in God was rather stupid but religion ought be safeguarded as the common people must have some principle to restrain them otherwise they would not work Punishment is only necessary as deterrent There was no need to go away for holidays as it was just as nice in town And so on He was a widower and had no children but lived on a large scale as though he had a family and paid three thousand roubles a year for his flat The second visitor Kukushkin an actual civil councillor though a young man was short and was conspicuous for his extremely unpleasant appearance which was due to the disproportion between his fat puffy body and his lean little face His lips were puckered up suavely and his little trimmed moustaches looked as though they had been fixed on with glue He was a man with the manners of a lizard He did not walk but as it were crept along with tiny steps squirming and sniggering and when he laughed he showed his teeth He was a clerk on special commissions and did nothing though he received a good salary especially in the summer when special and lucrative jobs were found for him He was a man of personal ambition not only to the marrow of his bones but more fundamentally to the last drop of his blood but even in his ambitions he was petty and did not rely on himself but was building his career on the chance favour flung him by his superiors For the sake of obtaining some foreign decoration or for the sake of having his name mentioned in the newspapers as having been present at some special service in the company of other great personages he was ready to submit to any kind of humiliation to beg to flatter to promise He flattered Orlov and Pekarsky from cowardice because he thought they were powerful he flattered Polya and me because we were in the service of a powerful man Whenever I took off his fur coat he tittered and asked me Stepan are you married and then unseemly vulgarities followed by way of showing me special attention Kukushkin flattered Orlov s weaknesses humoured his corrupted and blase ways to please him he affected malicious raillery and atheism in his company criticised persons before whom in other places he would slavishly grovel When at supper they talked of love and women he pretended to be a subtle and perverse voluptuary As a rule one may say Petersburg rakes are fond of talking of their abnormal tastes Some young actual civil councillor is perfectly satisfied with the embraces of his cook or of some unhappy street walker on the Nevsky Prospect but to listen to him you would think he was contaminated by all the vices of East and West combined that he was an honourary member of a dozen iniquitous secret societies and was already marked by the police Kukushkin lied about himself in an unconscionable way and they did not exactly disbelieve him but paid little heed to his incredible stories The third guest was Gruzin the son of a worthy and learned general a man of Orlov s age with long hair short sighted eyes and gold spectacles I remember his long white fingers that looked like a pianist s and indeed there was something of a musician of a virtuoso about his whole figure The first violins in orchestras look just like that He used to cough suffered from migraine and seemed invalidish and delicate Probably at home he was dressed and undressed like a baby He had finished at the College of Jurisprudence and had at first served in the Department of Justice then he was transferred to the Senate he left that and through patronage had received a post in the Department of Crown Estates and had soon afterwards given that up In my time he was serving in Orlov s department he was his head clerk but he said that he should soon exchange into the Department of Justice again He took his duties and his shifting about from one post to another with exceptional levity and when people talked before him seriously of grades in the service decorations salaries he smiled good naturedly and repeated Prutkov s aphorism It s only in the Government service you learn the truth He had a little wife with a wrinkled face who was very jealous of him and five weedy looking children He was unfaithful to his wife he was only fond of his children when he saw them and on the whole was rather indifferent to his family and made fun of them He and his family existed on credit borrowing wherever they could at every opportunity even from his superiors in the office and porters in people s houses His was a flabby nature he was so lazy that he did not care what became of himself and drifted along heedless where or why he was going He went where he was taken If he was taken to some low haunt he went if wine was set before him he drank if it were not put before him he abstained if wives were abused in his presence he abused his wife declaring she had ruined his life when wives were praised he praised his and said quite sincerely I am very fond of her poor thing He had no fur coat and always wore a rug which smelt of the nursery When at supper he rolled balls of bread and drank a great deal of red wine absorbed in thought strange to say I used to feel almost certain that there was something in him of which perhaps he had a vague sense though in the bustle and vulgarity of his daily life he had not time to understand and appreciate it He played a little on the piano Sometimes he would sit down at the piano play a chord or two and begin singing softly What does the coming day bring to me But at once as though afraid he would get up and walk from the piano The visitors usually arrived about ten o clock They played cards in Orlov s study and Polya and I handed them tea It was only on these occasions that I could gauge the full sweetness of a flunkey s life Standing for four or five hours at the door watching that no one s glass should be empty changing the ash trays running to the table to pick up the chalk or a card when it was dropped and above all standing waiting being attentive without venturing to speak to cough to smile is harder I assure you is harder than the hardest of field labour I have stood on watch at sea for four hours at a stretch on stormy winter nights and to my thinking it is an infinitely easier duty They used to play cards till two sometimes till three o clock at night and then stretching they would go into the dining room to supper or as Orlov said for a snack of something At supper there was conversation It usually began by Orlov s speaking with laughing eyes of some acquaintance of some book he had lately been reading of a new appointment or Government scheme Kukushkin always ingratiating would fall into his tone and what followed was to me in my mood at that time a revolting exhibition The irony of Orlov and his friends knew no bounds and spared no one and nothing If they spoke of religion it was with irony they spoke of philosophy of the significance and object of life irony again if any one began about the peasantry it was with irony There is in Petersburg a species of men whose specialty it is to jeer at every aspect of life they cannot even pass by a starving man or a suicide without saying something vulgar But Orlov and his friends did not jeer or make jokes they talked ironically They used to say that there was no God and personality was completely lost at death the immortals only existed in the French Academy Real good did not and could not possibly exist as its existence was conditional upon human perfection which was a logical absurdity Russia was a country as poor and dull as Persia The intellectual class was hopeless in Pekarsky s opinion the overwhelming majority in it were incompetent persons good for nothing The people were drunken lazy thievish and degenerate We had no science our literature was uncouth our commerce rested on swindling No selling without cheating And everything was in that style and everything was a subject for laughter Towards the end of supper the wine made them more good humoured and they passed to more lively conversation They laughed over Gruzin s family life over Kukushkin s conquests or at Pekarsky who had they said in his account book one page headed Charity and another Physiological Necessities They said that no wife was faithful that there was no wife from whom one could not with practice obtain caresses without leaving her drawing room while her husband was sitting in his study close by that girls in their teens were perverted and knew everything Orlov had preserved a letter of a schoolgirl of fourteen on her way home from school she had hooked an officer on the Nevsky who had it appears taken her home with him and had only let her go late in the evening and she hastened to write about this to her school friend to share her joy with her They maintained that there was not and never had been such a thing as moral purity and that evidently it was unnecessary mankind had so far done very well without it The harm done by so called vice was undoubtedly exaggerated Vices which are punished by our legal code had not prevented Diogenes from being a philosopher and a teacher Caesar and Cicero were profligates and at the same time great men Cato in his old age married a young girl and yet he was regarded as a great ascetic and a pillar of morality At three or four o clock the party broke up or they went off together out of town or to Officers Street to the house of a certain Varvara Ossipovna while I retired to my quarters and was kept awake a long while by coughing and headache IV Three weeks after I entered Orlov s service it was Sunday morning I remember somebody rang the bell It was not yet eleven and Orlov was still asleep I went to open the door You can imagine my astonishment when I found a lady in a veil standing at the door on the landing Is Georgy Ivanitch up she asked From her voice I recognised Zinaida Fyodorovna to whom I had taken letters in Znamensky Street I don t remember whether I had time or self possession to answer her I was taken aback at seeing her And indeed she did not need my answer In a flash she had darted by me and filling the hall with the fragrance of her perfume which I remember to this day she went on and her footsteps died away For at least half an hour afterwards I heard nothing But again some one rang This time it was a smartly dressed girl who looked like a maid in a wealthy family accompanied by our house porter Both were out of breath carrying two trunks and a dress basket These are for Zinaida Fyodorovna said the girl And she went down without saying another word All this was mysterious and made Polya who had a deep admiration for the pranks of her betters smile slyly to herself she looked as though she would like to say So that s what we re up to and she walked about the whole time on tiptoe At last we heard footsteps Zinaida Fyodorovna came quickly into the hall and seeing me at the door of my room said Stepan take Georgy Ivanitch his things When I went in to Orlov with his clothes and his boots he was sitting on the bed with his feet on the bearskin rug There was an air of embarrassment about his whole figure He did not notice me and my menial opinion did not interest him he was evidently perturbed and embarrassed before himself before his inner eye He dressed washed and used his combs and brushes silently and deliberately as though allowing himself time to think over his position and to reflect and even from his back one could see he was troubled and dissatisfied with himself They drank coffee together Zinaida Fyodorovna poured out coffee for herself and for Orlov then she put her elbows on the table and laughed I still can t believe it she said When one has been a long while on one s travels and reaches a hotel at last it s difficult to believe that one hasn t to go on It is pleasant to breathe freely With the expression of a child who very much wants to be mischievous she sighed with relief and laughed again You will excuse me said Orlov nodding towards the coffee Reading at breakfast is a habit I can t get over But I can do two things at once read and listen Read away You shall keep your habits and your freedom But why do you look so solemn Are you always like that in the morning or is it only to day Aren t you glad Yes I am But I must own I am a little overwhelmed Why You had plenty of time to prepare yourself for my descent upon you I ve been threatening to come every day Yes but I didn t expect you to carry out your threat to day I didn t expect it myself but that s all the better It s all the better my dear It s best to have an aching tooth out and have done with it Yes of course Oh my dear she said closing her eyes all is well that ends well but before this happy ending what suffering there has been My laughing means nothing I am glad I am happy but I feel more like crying than laughing Yesterday I had to fight a regular battle she went on in French God alone knows how wretched I was But I laugh because I can t believe in it I keep fancying that my sitting here drinking coffee with you is not real but a dream Then still speaking French she described how she had broken with her husband the day before and her eyes were alternately full of tears and of laughter while she gazed with rapture at Orlov She told him her husband had long suspected her but had avoided explanations they had frequent quarrels and usually at the most heated moment he would suddenly subside into silence and depart to his study for fear that in his exasperation he might give utterance to his suspicions or she might herself begin to speak openly And she had felt guilty worthless incapable of taking a bold and serious step and that had made her hate herself and her husband more every day and she had suffered the torments of hell But the day before when during a quarrel he had cried out in a tearful voice My God when will it end and had walked off to his study she had run after him like a cat after a mouse and preventing him from shutting the door she had cried that she hated him with her whole soul Then he let her come into the study and she had told him everything had confessed that she loved some one else that that some one else was her real most lawful husband and that she thought it her true duty to go away to him that very day whatever might happen if she were to be shot for it There s a very romantic streak in you Orlov interrupted keeping his eyes fixed on the newspaper She laughed and went on talking without touching her coffee Her cheeks glowed and she was a little embarrassed by it and she looked in confusion at Polya and me From what she went on to say I learnt that her husband had answered her with threats reproaches and finally tears and that it would have been more accurate to say that she and not he had been the attacking party Yes my dear so long as I was worked up everything went all right she told Orlov but as night came on my spirits sank You don t believe in God George but I do believe a little and I fear retribution God requires of us patience magnanimity self sacrifice and here I am refusing to be patient and want to remodel my life to suit myself Is that right What if from the point of view of God it s wrong At two o clock in the night my husband came to me and said You dare not go away I ll fetch you back through the police and make a scandal And soon afterwards I saw him like a shadow at my door Have mercy on me Your elopement may injure me in the service Those words had a coarse effect upon me and made me feel stiff all over I felt as though the retribution were beginning already I began crying and trembling with terror I felt as though the ceiling would fall upon me that I should be dragged off to the police station at once that you would grow cold to me all sorts of things in fact I thought I would go into a nunnery or become a nurse and give up all thought of happiness but then I remembered that you loved me and that I had no right to dispose of myself without your knowledge and everything in my mind was in a tangle I was in despair and did not know what to do or think But the sun rose and I grew happier As soon as it was morning I dashed off to you Ah what I ve been through dear one I haven t slept for two nights She was tired out and excited She was sleepy and at the same time she wanted to talk endlessly to laugh and to cry and to go to a restaurant to lunch that she might feel her freedom You have a cosy flat but I am afraid it may be small for the two of us she said walking rapidly through all the rooms when they had finished breakfast What room will you give me I like this one because it is next to your study At one o clock she changed her dress in the room next to the study which from that time she called hers and she went off with Orlov to lunch They dined too at a restaurant and spent the long interval between lunch and dinner in shopping Till late at night I was opening the door to messengers and errand boys from the shops They bought among other things a splendid pier glass a dressing table a bedstead and a gorgeous tea service which we did not need They bought a regular collection of copper saucepans which we set in a row on the shelf in our cold empty kitchen As we were unpacking the tea service Polya s eyes gleamed and she looked at me two or three times with hatred and fear that I not she would be the first to steal one of these charming cups A lady s writing table very expensive and inconvenient came too It was evident that Zinaida Fyodorovna contemplated settling with us for good and meant to make the flat her home She came back with Orlov between nine and ten Full of proud consciousness that she had done something bold and out of the common passionately in love and as she imagined passionately loved exhausted looking forward to a sweet sound sleep Zinaida Fyodorovna was revelling in her new life She squeezed her hands together in the excess of her joy declared that everything was delightful and swore that she would love Orlov for ever and these vows and the naive almost childish confidence that she too was deeply loved and would be loved forever made her at least five years younger She talked charming nonsense and laughed at herself There s no other blessing greater than freedom she said forcing herself to say something serious and edifying How absurd it is when you think of it We attach no value to our own opinion even when it is wise but tremble before the opinion of all sorts of stupid people Up to the last minute I was afraid of what other people would say but as soon as I followed my own instinct and made up my mind to go my own way my eyes were opened I overcame my silly fears and now I am happy and wish every one could be as happy But her thoughts immediately took another turn and she began talking of another flat of wallpapers horses a trip to Switzerland and Italy Orlov was tired by the restaurants and the shops and was still suffering from the same uneasiness that I had noticed in the morning He smiled but more from politeness than pleasure and when she spoke of anything seriously he agreed ironically Oh yes Stepan make haste and find us a good cook she said to me There s no need to be in a hurry over the kitchen arrangements said Orlov looking at me coldly We must first move into another flat We had never had cooking done at home nor kept horses because as he said he did not like disorder about him and only put up with having Polya and me in his flat from necessity The so called domestic hearth with its everyday joys and its petty cares offended his taste as vulgarity to be with child or to have children and talk about them was bad form like a petty bourgeois And I began to feel very curious to see how these two creatures would get on together in one flat she domestic and home loving with her copper saucepans and her dreams of a good cook and horses and he fond of saying to his friends that a decent and orderly man s flat ought like a warship to have nothing in it superfluous no women no children no rags no kitchen utensils V Then I will tell you what happened the following Thursday That day Zinaida Fyodorovna dined at Content s or Donon s Orlov returned home alone and Zinaida Fyodorovna as I learnt afterwards went to the Petersburg Side to spend with her old governess the time visitors were with us Orlov did not care to show her to his friends I realised that at breakfast when he began assuring her that for the sake of her peace of mind it was essential to give up his Thursday evenings As usual the visitors arrived at almost the same time Is your mistress at home too Kukushkin asked me in a whisper No sir I answered He went in with a sly oily look in his eyes smiling mysteriously rubbing his hands which were cold from the frost I have the honour to congratulate you he said to Orlov shaking all over with ingratiating obsequious laughter May you increase and multiply like the cedars of Lebanon The visitors went into the bedroom and were extremely jocose on the subject of a pair of feminine slippers the rug that had been put down between the two beds and a grey dressing jacket that hung at the foot of the bedstead They were amused that the obstinate man who despised all the common place details of love had been caught in feminine snares in such a simple and ordinary way He who pointed the finger of scorn is bowing the knee in homage Kukushkin repeated several times He had I may say in parenthesis an unpleasant habit of adorning his conversation with texts in Church Slavonic Sh sh he said as they went from the bedroom into the room next to the study Sh sh Here Gretchen is dreaming of her Faust He went off into a peal of laughter as though he had said something very amusing I watched Gruzin expecting that his musical soul would not endure this laughter but I was mistaken His thin good natured face beamed with pleasure When they sat down to play cards he lisping and choking with laughter said that all that dear George wanted to complete his domestic felicity was a cherry wood pipe and a guitar Pekarsky laughed sedately but from his serious expression one could see that Orlov s new love affair was distasteful to him He did not understand what had happened exactly But how about the husband he asked in perplexity after they had played three rubbers I don t know answered Orlov Pekarsky combed his big beard with his fingers and sank into thought and he did not speak again till supper time When they were seated at supper he began deliberately drawling every word Altogether excuse my saying so I don t understand either of you You might love each other and break the seventh commandment to your heart s content that I understand Yes that s comprehensible But why make the husband a party to your secrets Was there any need for that But does it make any difference Hm Pekarsky mused Well then let me tell you this my friend he went on evidently thinking hard if I ever marry again and you take it into your head to seduce my wife please do it so that I don t notice it It s much more honest to deceive a man than to break up his family life and injure his reputation I understand You both imagine that in living together openly you are doing something exceptionally honourable and advanced but I can t agree with that what shall I call it romantic attitude Orlov made no reply He was out of humour and disinclined to talk Pekarsky still perplexed drummed on the table with his fingers thought a little and said I don t understand you all the same You are not a student and she is not a dressmaker You are both of you people with means I should have thought you might have arranged a separate flat for her No I couldn t Read Turgenev Why should I read him I have read him already Turgenev teaches us in his novels that every exalted noble minded girl should follow the man she loves to the ends of the earth and should serve his idea said Orlov screwing up his eyes ironically The ends of the earth are poetic license the earth and all its ends can be reduced to the flat of the man she loves And so not to live in the same flat with the woman who loves you is to deny her her exalted vocation and to refuse to share her ideals Yes my dear fellow Turgenev wrote and I have to suffer for it What Turgenev has got to do with it I don t understand said Gruzin softly and he shrugged his shoulders Do you remember George how in Three Meetings he is walking late in the evening somewhere in Italy and suddenly hears Vieni pensando a me segretamente Gruzin hummed It s fine But she hasn t come to settle with you by force said Pekarsky It was your own wish What next Far from wishing it I never imagined that this would ever happen When she said she was coming to live with me I thought it was a charming joke on her part Everybody laughed I couldn t have wished for such a thing said Orlov in the tone of a man compelled to justify himself I am not a Turgenev hero and if I ever wanted to free Bulgaria I shouldn t need a lady s company I look upon love primarily as a necessity of my physical nature degrading and antagonistic to my spirit it must either be satisfied with discretion or renounced altogether otherwise it will bring into one s life elements as unclean as itself For it to be an enjoyment and not a torment I will try to make it beautiful and to surround it with a mass of illusions I should never go and see a woman unless I were sure beforehand that she would be beautiful and fascinating and I should never go unless I were in the mood And it is only in that way that we succeed in deceiving one another and fancying that we are in love and happy But can I wish for copper saucepans and untidy hair or like to be seen myself when I am unwashed or out of humour Zinaida Fyodorovna in the simplicity of her heart wants me to love what I have been shunning all my life She wants my flat to smell of cooking and washing up she wants all the fuss of moving into another flat of driving about with her own horses she wants to count over my linen and to look after my health she wants to meddle in my personal life at every instant and to watch over every step and at the same time she assures me genuinely that my habits and my freedom will be untouched She is persuaded that like a young couple we shall very soon go for a honeymoon that is she wants to be with me all the time in trains and hotels while I like to read on the journey and cannot endure talking in trains You should give her a talking to said Pekarsky What Do you suppose she would understand me Why we think so differently In her opinion to leave one s papa and mamma or one s husband for the sake of the man one loves is the height of civic virtue while I look upon it as childish To fall in love and run away with a man to her means beginning a new life while to my mind it means nothing at all Love and man constitute the chief interest of her life and possibly it is the philosophy of the unconscious at work in her Try and make her believe that love is only a simple physical need like the need of food or clothes that it doesn t mean the end of the world if wives and husbands are unsatisfactory that a man may be a profligate and a libertine and yet a man of honour and a genius and that on the other hand one may abstain from the pleasures of love and at the same time be a stupid vicious animal The civilised man of to day even among the lower classes for instance the French workman spends ten sous on dinner five sous on his wine and five or ten sous on woman and devotes his brain and nerves entirely to his work But Zinaida Fyodorovna assigns to love not so many sous but her whole soul I might give her a talking to but she would raise a wail in answer and declare in all sincerity that I had ruined her that she had nothing left to live for Don t say anything to her said Pekarsky but simply take a separate flat for her that s all That s easy to say There was a brief silence But she is charming said Kukushkin She is exquisite Such women imagine that they will be in love for ever and abandon themselves with tragic intensity But one must keep a head on one s shoulders said Orlov one must be reasonable All experience gained from everyday life and handed down in innumerable novels and plays uniformly confirms the fact that adultery and cohabitation of any sort between decent people never lasts longer than two or at most three years however great the love may have been at the beginning That she ought to know And so all this business of moving of saucepans hopes of eternal love and harmony are nothing but a desire to delude herself and me She is charming and exquisite who denies it But she has turned my life upside down what I have regarded as trivial and nonsensical till now she has forced me to raise to the level of a serious problem I serve an idol whom I have never looked upon as God She is charming exquisite but for some reason now when I am going home I feel uneasy as though I expected to meet with something inconvenient at home such as workmen pulling the stove to pieces and blocking up the place with heaps of bricks In fact I am no longer giving up to love a sous but part of my peace of mind and my nerves And that s bad And she doesn t hear this villain sighed Kukushkin My dear sir he said theatrically I will relieve you from the burdensome obligation to love that adorable creature I will wrest Zinaida Fyodorovna from you You may said Orlov carelessly For half a minute Kukushkin laughed a shrill little laugh shaking all over then he said Look out I am in earnest Don t you play the Othello afterwards They all began talking of Kukushkin s indefatigable energy in love affairs how irresistible he was to women and what a danger he was to husbands and how the devil would roast him in the other world for his immorality in this He screwed up his eyes and remained silent and when the names of ladies of their acquaintance were mentioned he held up his little finger as though to say they mustn t give away other people s secrets Orlov suddenly looked at his watch His friends understood and began to take their leave I remember that Gruzin who was a little drunk was wearisomely long in getting off He put on his coat which was cut like children s coats in poor families pulled up the collar and began telling some long winded story then seeing he was not listened to he flung the rug that smelt of the nursery over one shoulder and with a guilty and imploring face begged me to find his hat George my angel he said tenderly Do as I ask you dear boy come out of town with us You can go but I can t I am in the position of a married man now She is a dear she won t be angry My dear chief come along It s glorious weather there s snow and frost Upon my word you want shaking up a bit you are out of humour I don t know what the devil is the matter with you Orlov stretched yawned and looked at Pekarsky Are you going he said hesitating I don t know Perhaps Shall I get drunk All right I ll come said Orlov after some hesitation Wait a minute I ll get some money He went into the study and Gruzin slouched in too dragging his rug after him A minute later both came back into the hall Gruzin a little drunk and very pleased was crumpling a ten rouble note in his hands We ll settle up to morrow he said And she is kind she won t be cross She is my Lisotchka s godmother I am fond of her poor thing Ah my dear fellow he laughed joyfully and pressing his forehead on Pekarsky s back Ah Pekarsky my dear soul Advocatissimus as dry as a biscuit but you bet he is fond of women Fat ones said Orlov putting on his fur coat But let us get off or we shall be meeting her on the doorstep Vieni pensando a me segretamente hummed Gruzin At last they drove off Orlov did not sleep at home and returned next day at dinner time VI Zinaida Fyodorovna had lost her gold watch a present from her father This loss surprised and alarmed her She spent half a day going through the rooms looking helplessly on all the tables and on all the windows But the watch had disappeared completely Only three days afterwards Zinaida Fyodorovna on coming in left her purse in the hall Luckily for me on that occasion it was not I but Polya who helped her off with her coat When the purse was missed it could not be found in the hall Strange said Zinaida Fyodorovna in bewilderment I distinctly remember taking it out of my pocket to pay the cabman and then I put it here near the looking glass It s very odd I had not stolen it but I felt as though I had stolen it and had been caught in the theft Tears actually came into my eyes When they were seated at dinner Zinaida Fyodorovna said to Orlov in French There seem to be spirits in the flat I lost my purse in the hall to day and now lo and behold it is on my table But it s not quite a disinterested trick of the spirits They took out a gold coin and twenty roubles in notes You are always losing something first it s your watch and then it s your money said Orlov Why is it nothing of the sort ever happens to me A minute later Zinaida Fyodorovna had forgotten the trick played by the spirits and was telling with a laugh how the week before she had ordered some notepaper and had forgotten to give her new address and the shop had sent the paper to her old home at her husband s who had to pay twelve roubles for it And suddenly she turned her eyes on Polya and looked at her intently She blushed as she did so and was so confused that she began talking of something else When I took in the coffee to the study Orlov was standing with his back to the fire and she was sitting in an arm chair facing him I am not in a bad temper at all she was saying in French But I have been putting things together and now I see it clearly I can give you the day and the hour when she stole my watch And the purse There can be no doubt about it Oh she laughed as she took the coffee from me Now I understand why I am always losing my handkerchiefs and gloves Whatever you say I shall dismiss the magpie to morrow and send Stepan for my Sofya She is not a thief and has not got such a repulsive appearance You are out of humour To morrow you will feel differently and will realise that you can t discharge people simply because you suspect them It s not suspicion it s certainty said Zinaida Fyodorovna So long as I suspected that unhappy faced poor looking valet of yours I said nothing It s too bad of you not to believe me George If we think differently about anything it doesn t follow that I don t believe you You may be right said Orlov turning round and flinging his cigarette end into the fire but there is no need to be excited about it anyway In fact I must say I never expected my humble establishment would cause you so much serious worry and agitation You ve lost a gold coin never mind you may have a hundred of mine but to change my habits to pick up a new housemaid to wait till she is used to the place all that s a tedious tiring business and does not suit me Our present maid certainly is fat and has perhaps a weakness for gloves and handkerchiefs but she is perfectly well behaved well trained and does not shriek when Kukushkin pinches her You mean that you can t part with her Why don t you say so Are you jealous Yes I am said Zinaida Fyodorovna decidedly Thank you Yes I am jealous she repeated and tears glistened in her eyes No it s something worse which I find it difficult to find a name for She pressed her hands on her temples and went on impulsively You men are so disgusting It s horrible I see nothing horrible about it I ve not seen it I don t know but they say that you men begin with housemaids as boys and get so used to it that you feel no repugnance I don t know I don t know but I have actually read George of course you are right she said going up to Orlov and changing to a caressing and imploring tone I really am out of humour to day But you must understand I can t help it She disgusts me and I am afraid of her It makes me miserable to see her Surely you can rise above such paltriness said Orlov shrugging his shoulders in perplexity and walking away from the fire Nothing could be simpler take no notice of her and then she won t disgust you and you won t need to make a regular tragedy out of a trifle I went out of the study and I don t know what answer Orlov received Whatever it was Polya remained After that Zinaida Fyodorovna never applied to her for anything and evidently tried to dispense with her services When Polya handed her anything or even passed by her jingling her bangle and rustling her skirts she shuddered I believe that if Gruzin or Pekarsky had asked Orlov to dismiss Polya he would have done so without the slightest hesitation without troubling about any explanations He was easily persuaded like all indifferent people But in his relations with Zinaida Fyodorovna he displayed for some reason even in trifles an obstinacy which sometimes was almost irrational I knew beforehand that if Zinaida Fyodorovna liked anything it would be certain not to please Orlov When on coming in from shopping she made haste to show him with pride some new purchase he would glance at it and say coldly that the more unnecessary objects they had in the flat the less airy it would be It sometimes happened that after putting on his dress clothes to go out somewhere and after saying good bye to Zinaida Fyodorovna he would suddenly change his mind and remain at home from sheer perversity I used to think that he remained at home then simply in order to feel injured Why are you staying said Zinaida Fyodorovna with a show of vexation though at the same time she was radiant with delight Why do you You are not accustomed to spending your evenings at home and I don t want you to alter your habits on my account Do go out as usual if you don t want me to feel guilty No one is blaming you said Orlov With the air of a victim he stretched himself in his easy chair in the study and shading his eyes with his hand took up a book But soon the book dropped from his hand he turned heavily in his chair and again screened his eyes as though from the sun Now he felt annoyed that he had not gone out May I come in Zinaida Fyodorovna would say coming irresolutely into the study Are you reading I felt dull by myself and have come just for a minute to have a peep at you I remember one evening she went in like that irresolutely and inappropriately and sank on the rug at Orlov s feet and from her soft timid movements one could see that she did not understand his mood and was afraid You are always reading she said cajolingly evidently wishing to flatter him Do you know George what is one of the secrets of your success You are very clever and well read What book have you there Orlov answered A silence followed for some minutes which seemed to me very long I was standing in the drawing room from which I could watch them and was afraid of coughing There is something I wanted to tell you said Zinaida Fyodorovna and she laughed shall I Very likely you ll laugh and say that I flatter myself You know I want I want horribly to believe that you are staying at home to night for my sake that we might spend the evening together Yes May I think so Do he said screening his eyes The really happy man is he who thinks not only of what is but of what is not That was a long sentence which I did not quite understand You mean happy people live in their imagination Yes that s true I love to sit in your study in the evening and let my thoughts carry me far far away It s pleasant sometimes to dream Let us dream aloud George I ve never been at a girls boarding school I never learnt the art You are out of humour said Zinaida Fyodorovna taking Orlov s hand Tell me why When you are like that I m afraid I don t know whether your head aches or whether you are angry with me Again there was a silence lasting several long minutes Why have you changed she said softly Why are you never so tender or so gay as you used to be at Znamensky Street I ve been with you almost a month but it seems to me as though we had not yet begun to live and have not yet talked of anything as we ought to You always answer me with jokes or else with a long cold lecture like a teacher And there is something cold in your jokes Why have you given up talking to me seriously I always talk seriously Well then let us talk For God s sake George Shall we Certainly but about what Let us talk of our life of our future said Zinaida Fyodorovna dreamily I keep making plans for our life plans and plans and I enjoy doing it so George I ll begin with the question when are you going to give up your post What for asked Orlov taking his hand from his forehead With your views you cannot remain in the service You are out of place there My views Orlov repeated My views In conviction and temperament I am an ordinary official one of Shtchedrin s heroes You take me for something different I venture to assure you Joking again George Not in the least The service does not satisfy me perhaps but anyway it is better for me than anything else I am used to it and in it I meet men of my own sort I am in my place there and find it tolerable You hate the service and it revolts you Indeed If I resign my post take to dreaming aloud and letting myself be carried away into another world do you suppose that that world would be less hateful to me than the service You are ready to libel yourself in order to contradict me Zinaida Fyodorovna was offended and got up I am sorry I began this talk Why are you angry I am not angry with you for not being an official Every one lives as he likes best Why do you live as you like best Are you free To spend your life writing documents that are opposed to your own ideas Zinaida Fyodorovna went on clasping her hands in despair to submit to authority congratulate your superiors at the New Year and then cards and nothing but cards worst of all to be working for a system which must be distasteful to you no George no You should not make such horrid jokes It s dreadful You are a man of ideas and you ought to be working for your ideas and nothing else You really take me for quite a different person from what I am sighed Orlov Say simply that you don t want to talk to me You dislike me that s all said Zinaida Fyodorovna through her tears Look here my dear said Orlov admonishingly sitting up in his chair You were pleased to observe yourself that I am a clever well read man and to teach one who knows does nothing but harm I know very well all the ideas great and small which you mean when you call me a man of ideas So if I prefer the service and cards to those ideas you may be sure I have good grounds for it That s one thing Secondly you have so far as I know never been in the service and can only have drawn your ideas of Government service from anecdotes and indifferent novels So it would not be amiss for us to make a compact once for all not to talk of things we know already or of things about which we are not competent to speak Why do you speak to me like that said Zinaida Fyodorovna stepping back as though in horror What for George for God s sake think what you are saying Her voice quivered and broke she was evidently trying to restrain her tears but she suddenly broke into sobs George my darling I am perishing she said in French dropping down before Orlov and laying her head on his knees I am miserable I am exhausted I can t bear it I can t bear it In my childhood my hateful depraved stepmother then my husband now you you You meet my mad love with coldness and irony And that horrible insolent servant she went on sobbing Yes yes I see I am not your wife nor your friend but a woman you don t respect because she has become your mistress I shall kill myself I had not expected that her words and her tears would make such an impression on Orlov He flushed moved uneasily in his chair and instead of irony his face wore a look of stupid schoolboyish dismay My darling you misunderstood me he muttered helplessly touching her hair and her shoulders Forgive me I entreat you I was unjust and I hate myself I insult you with my whining and complaints You are a true generous rare man I am conscious of it every minute but I ve been horribly depressed for the last few days Zinaida Fyodorovna impulsively embraced Orlov and kissed him on the cheek Only please don t cry he said No no I ve had my cry and now I am better As for the servant she shall be gone to morrow he said still moving uneasily in his chair No she must stay George Do you hear I am not afraid of her now One must rise above trifles and not imagine silly things You are right You are a wonderful rare person She soon left off crying With tears glistening on her eyelashes sitting on Orlov s knee she told him in a low voice something touching something like a reminiscence of childhood and youth She stroked his face kissed him and carefully examined his hands with the rings on them and the charms on his watch chain She was carried away by what she was saying and by being near the man she loved and probably because her tears had cleared and refreshed her soul there was a note of wonderful candour and sincerity in her voice And Orlov played with her chestnut hair and kissed her hands noiselessly pressing them to his lips Then they had tea in the study and Zinaida Fyodorovna read aloud some letters Soon after midnight they went to bed I had a fearful pain in my side that night and I could not get warm or go to sleep till morning I could hear Orlov go from the bedroom into his study After sitting there about an hour he rang the bell In my pain and exhaustion I forgot all the rules and conventions and went to his study in my night attire barefooted Orlov in his dressing gown and cap was standing in the doorway waiting for me When you are sent for you should come dressed he said sternly Bring some fresh candles I was about to apologise but suddenly broke into a violent cough and clutched at the side of the door to save myself from falling Are you ill said Orlov I believe it was the first time of our acquaintance that he addressed me not in the singular goodness knows why Most likely in my night clothes and with my face distorted by coughing I played my part poorly and was very little like a flunkey If you are ill why do you take a place he said That I may not die of starvation I answered How disgusting it all is really he said softly going up to his table While hurriedly getting into my coat I put up and lighted fresh candles He was sitting at the table with feet stretched out on a low chair cutting a book I left him deeply engrossed and the book did not drop out of his hands as it had done in the evening VII Now that I am writing these lines I am restrained by that dread of appearing sentimental and ridiculous in which I have been trained from childhood when I want to be affectionate or to say anything tender I don t know how to be natural And it is that dread together with lack of practice that prevents me from being able to express with perfect clearness what was passing in my soul at that time I was not in love with Zinaida Fyodorovna but in the ordinary human feeling I had for her there was far more youth freshness and joyousness than in Orlov s love As I worked in the morning cleaning boots or sweeping the rooms I waited with a thrill at my heart for the moment when I should hear her voice and her footsteps To stand watching her as she drank her coffee in the morning or ate her lunch to hold her fur coat for her in the hall and to put the goloshes on her little feet while she rested her hand on my shoulder then to wait till the hall porter rang up for me to meet her at the door cold and rosy powdered with the snow to listen to her brief exclamations about the frost or the cabman if only you knew how much all that meant to me I longed to be in love to have a wife and child of my own I wanted my future wife to have just such a face such a voice I dreamed of it at dinner and in the street when I was sent on some errand and when I lay awake at night Orlov rejected with disgust children cooking copper saucepans and feminine knicknacks and I gathered them all up tenderly cherished them in my dreams loved them and begged them of destiny I had visions of a wife a nursery a little house with garden paths I knew that if I did love her I could never dare hope for the miracle of her returning my love but that reflection did not worry me In my quiet modest feeling akin to ordinary affection there was no jealousy of Orlov or even envy of him since I realised that for a wreck like me happiness was only to be found in dreams When Zinaida Fyodorovna sat up night after night for her George looking immovably at a book of which she never turned a page or when she shuddered and turned pale at Polya s crossing the room I suffered with her and the idea occurred to me to lance this festering wound as quickly as possible by letting her know what was said here at supper on Thursdays but how was it to be done More and more often I saw her tears For the first weeks she laughed and sang to herself even when Orlov was not at home but by the second month there was a mournful stillness in our flat broken only on Thursday evenings She flattered Orlov and to wring from him a counterfeit smile or kiss was ready to go on her knees to him to fawn on him like a dog Even when her heart was heaviest she could not resist glancing into a looking glass if she passed one and straightening her hair It seemed strange to me that she could still take an interest in clothes and go into ecstasies over her purchases It did not seem in keeping with her genuine grief She paid attention to the fashions and ordered expensive dresses What for On whose account I particularly remember one dress which cost four hundred roubles To give four hundred roubles for an unnecessary useless dress while women for their hard day s work get only twenty kopecks a day without food and the makers of Venice and Brussels lace are only paid half a franc a day on the supposition that they can earn the rest by immorality And it seemed strange to me that Zinaida Fyodorovna was not conscious of it it vexed me But she had only to go out of the house for me to find excuses and explanations for everything and to be waiting eagerly for the hall porter to ring for me She treated me as a flunkey a being of a lower order One may pat a dog and yet not notice it I was given orders and asked questions but my presence was not observed My master and mistress thought it unseemly to say more to me than is usually said to servants if when waiting at dinner I had laughed or put in my word in the conversation they would certainly have thought I was mad and have dismissed me Zinaida Fyodorovna was favourably disposed to me all the same When she was sending me on some errand or explaining to me the working of a new lamp or anything of that sort her face was extraordinarily kind frank and cordial and her eyes looked me straight in the face At such moments I always fancied she remembered with gratitude how I used to bring her letters to Znamensky Street When she rang the bell Polya who considered me her favourite and hated me for it used to say with a jeering smile Go along your mistress wants you Zinaida Fyodorovna considered me as a being of a lower order and did not suspect that if any one in the house were in a humiliating position it was she She did not know that I a footman was unhappy on her account and used to ask myself twenty times a day what was in store for her and how it would all end Things were growing visibly worse day by day After the evening on which they had talked of his official work Orlov who could not endure tears unmistakably began to avoid conversation with her whenever Zinaida Fyodorovna began to argue or to beseech him or seemed on the point of crying he seized some plausible excuse for retreating to his study or going out He more and more rarely slept at home and still more rarely dined there on Thursdays he was the one to suggest some expedition to his friends Zinaida Fyodorovna was still dreaming of having the cooking done at home of moving to a new flat of travelling abroad but her dreams remained dreams Dinner was sent in from the restaurant Orlov asked her not to broach the question of moving until after they had come back from abroad and apropos of their foreign tour declared that they could not go till his hair had grown long as one could not go trailing from hotel to hotel and serving the idea without long hair To crown it all in Orlov s absence Kukushkin began calling at the flat in the evening There was nothing exceptional in his behaviour but I could never forget the conversation in which he had offered to cut Orlov out He was regaled with tea and red wine and he used to titter and anxious to say something pleasant would declare that a free union was superior in every respect to legal marriage and that all decent people ought really to come to Zinaida Fyodorovna and fall at her feet VIII Christmas was spent drearily in vague anticipations of calamity On New Year s Eve Orlov unexpectedly announced at breakfast that he was being sent to assist a senator who was on a revising commission in a certain province I don t want to go but I can t find an excuse to get off he said with vexation I must go there s nothing for it Such news instantly made Zinaida Fyodorovna s eyes look red Is it for long she asked Five days or so I am glad really you are going she said after a moment s thought It will be a change for you You will fall in love with some one on the way and tell me about it afterwards At every opportunity she tried to make Orlov feel that she did not restrict his liberty in any way and that he could do exactly as he liked and this artless transparent strategy deceived no one and only unnecessarily reminded Orlov that he was not free I am going this evening he said and began reading the paper Zinaida Fyodorovna wanted to see him off at the station but he dissuaded her saying that he was not going to America and not going to be away five years but only five days possibly less The parting took place between seven and eight He put one arm round her and kissed her on the lips and on the forehead Be a good girl and don t be depressed while I am away he said in a warm affectionate tone which touched even me God keep you She looked greedily into his face to stamp his dear features on her memory then she put her arms gracefully round his neck and laid her head on his breast Forgive me our misunderstandings she said in French Husband and wife cannot help quarrelling if they love each other and I love you madly Don t forget me Wire to me often and fully Orlov kissed her once more and without saying a word went out in confusion When he heard the click of the lock as the door closed he stood still in the middle of the staircase in hesitation and glanced upwards It seemed to me that if a sound had reached him at that moment from above he would have turned back But all was quiet He straightened his coat and went downstairs irresolutely The sledges had been waiting a long while at the door Orlov got into one I got into the other with two portmanteaus It was a hard frost and there were fires smoking at the cross roads The cold wind nipped my face and hands and took my breath away as we drove rapidly along and closing my eyes I thought what a splendid woman she was How she loved him Even useless rubbish is collected in the courtyards nowadays and used for some purpose even broken glass is considered a useful commodity but something so precious so rare as the love of a refined young intelligent and good woman is utterly thrown away and wasted One of the early sociologists regarded every evil passion as a force which might by judicious management be turned to good while among us even a fine noble passion springs up and dies away in impotence turned to no account misunderstood or vulgarised Why is it The sledges stopped unexpectedly I opened my eyes and I saw that we had come to a standstill in Sergievsky Street near a big house where Pekarsky lived Orlov got out of the sledge and vanished into the entry Five minutes later Pekarsky s footman came out bareheaded and angry with the frost shouted to me Are you deaf Pay the cabmen and go upstairs You are wanted At a complete loss I went to the first storey I had been to Pekarsky s flat before that is I had stood in the hall and looked into the drawing room and after the damp gloomy street it always struck me by the brilliance of its picture frames its bronzes and expensive furniture To day in the midst of this splendour I saw Gruzin Kukushkin and after a minute Orlov Look here Stepan he said coming up to me I shall be staying here till Friday or Saturday If any letters or telegrams come you must bring them here every day At home of course you will say that I have gone and send my greetings Now you can go When I reached home Zinaida Fyodorovna was lying on the sofa in the drawing room eating a pear There was only one candle burning in the candelabra Did you catch the train asked Zinaida Fyodorovna Yes madam His honour sends his greetings I went into my room and I too lay down I had nothing to do and I did not want to read I was not surprised and I was not indignant I only racked my brains to think why this deception was necessary It is only boys in their teens who deceive their mistresses like that How was it that a man who had thought and read so much could not imagine anything more sensible I must confess I had by no means a poor opinion of his intelligence I believe if he had had to deceive his minister or any other influential person he would have put a great deal of skill and energy into doing so but to deceive a woman the first idea that occurred to him was evidently good enough If it succeeded well and good if it did not there would be no harm done he could tell some other lie just as quickly and simply with no mental effort At midnight when the people on the floor overhead were moving their chairs and shouting hurrah to welcome the New Year Zinaida Fyodorovna rang for me from the room next to the study Languid from lying down so long she was sitting at the table writing something on a scrap of paper I must send a telegram she said with a smile Go to the station as quick as you can and ask them to send it after him Going out into the street I read on the scrap of paper May the New Year bring new happiness Make haste and telegraph I miss you dreadfully It seems an eternity I am only sorry I can t send a thousand kisses and my very heart by telegraph Enjoy yourself my darling ZINA I sent the telegram and next morning I gave her the receipt IX The worst of it was that Orlov had thoughtlessly let Polya too into the secret of his deception telling her to bring his shirts to Sergievsky Street After that she looked at Zinaida Fyodorovna with a malignant joy and hatred I could not understand and was never tired of snorting with delight to herself in her own room and in the hall She s outstayed her welcome it s time she took herself off she would say with zest She ought to realise that herself She already divined by instinct that Zinaida Fyodorovna would not be with us much longer and not to let the chance slip carried off everything she set her eyes on smelling bottles tortoise shell hairpins handkerchiefs shoes On the day after New Year s Day Zinaida Fyodorovna summoned me to her room and told me in a low voice that she missed her black dress And then she walked through all the rooms with a pale frightened and indignant face talking to herself It s too much It s beyond everything Why it s unheard of insolence At dinner she tried to help herself to soup but could not her hands were trembling Her lips were trembling too She looked helplessly at the soup and at the little pies waiting for the trembling to pass off and suddenly she could not resist looking at Polya You can go Polya she said Stepan is enough by himself I ll stay I don t mind answered Polya There s no need for you to stay You go away altogether Zinaida Fyodorovna went on getting up in great agitation You may look out for another place You can go at once I can t go away without the master s orders He engaged me It must be as he orders You can take orders from me too I am mistress here said Zinaida Fyodorovna and she flushed crimson You may be the mistress but only the master can dismiss me It was he engaged me You dare not stay here another minute cried Zinaida Fyodorovna and she struck the plate with her knife You are a thief Do you hear Zinaida Fyodorovna flung her dinner napkin on the table and with a pitiful suffering face went quickly out of the room Loudly sobbing and wailing something indistinct Polya too went away The soup and the grouse got cold And for some reason all the restaurant dainties on the table struck me as poor thievish like Polya Two pies on a plate had a particularly miserable and guilty air We shall be taken back to the restaurant to day they seemed to be saying and to morrow we shall be put on the table again for some official or celebrated singer She is a fine lady indeed I heard uttered in Polya s room I could have been a lady like that long ago but I have some self respect We ll see which of us will be the first to go Zinaida Fyodorovna rang the bell She was sitting in her room in the corner looking as though she had been put in the corner as a punishment No telegram has come she asked No madam Ask the porter perhaps there is a telegram And don t leave the house she called after me I am afraid to be left alone After that I had to run down almost every hour to ask the porter whether a telegram had come I must own it was a dreadful time To avoid seeing Polya Zinaida Fyodorovna dined and had tea in her own room it was here that she slept too on a short sofa like a half moon and she made her own bed For the first days I took the telegrams but getting no answer she lost her faith in me and began telegraphing herself Looking at her I too began impatiently hoping for a telegram I hoped he would contrive some deception would make arrangements for instance that a telegram should be sent to her from some station If he were too much engrossed with cards or had been attracted by some other woman I thought that both Gruzin and Kukushkin would remind him of us But our expectations were vain Five times a day I would go in to Zinaida Fyodorovna intending to tell her the truth But her eyes looked piteous as a fawn s her shoulders seemed to droop her lips were moving and I went away again without saying a word Pity and sympathy seemed to rob me of all manliness Polya as cheerful and well satisfied with herself as though nothing had happened was tidying the master s study and the bedroom rummaging in the cupboards and making the crockery jingle and when she passed Zinaida Fyodorovna s door she hummed something and coughed She was pleased that her mistress was hiding from her In the evening she would go out somewhere and rang at two or three o clock in the morning and I had to open the door to her and listen to remarks about my cough Immediately afterwards I would hear another ring I would run to the room next to the study and Zinaida Fyodorovna putting her head out of the door would ask Who was it rung while she looked at my hands to see whether I had a telegram When at last on Saturday the bell rang below and she heard the familiar voice on the stairs she was so delighted that she broke into sobs She rushed to meet him embraced him kissed him on the breast and sleeves said something one could not understand The hall porter brought up the portmanteaus Polya s cheerful voice was heard It was as though some one had come home for the holidays Why didn t you wire asked Zinaida Fyodorovna breathless with joy Why was it I have been in misery I don t know how I ve lived through it Oh my God It was very simple I returned with the senator to Moscow the very first day and didn t get your telegrams said Orlov After dinner my love I ll give you a full account of my doings but now I must sleep and sleep I am worn out with the journey It was evident that he had not slept all night he had probably been playing cards and drinking freely Zinaida Fyodorovna put him to bed and we all walked about on tiptoe all that day The dinner went off quite satisfactorily but when they went into the study and had coffee the explanation began Zinaida Fyodorovna began talking of something rapidly in a low voice she spoke in French and her words flowed like a stream Then I heard a loud sigh from Orlov and his voice My God he said in French Have you really nothing fresher to tell me than this everlasting tale of your servant s misdeeds But my dear she robbed me and said insulting things to me But why is it she doesn t rob me or say insulting things to me Why is it I never notice the maids nor the porters nor the footmen My dear you are simply capricious and refuse to know your own mind I really begin to suspect that you must be in a certain condition When I offered to let her go you insisted on her remaining and now you want me to turn her away I can be obstinate too in such cases You want her to go but I want her to remain That s the only way to cure you of your nerves Oh very well very well said Zinaida Fyodorovna in alarm Let us say no more about that Let us put it off till to morrow Now tell me about Moscow What is going on in Moscow X After lunch next day it was the seventh of January saint John the Baptist s Day Orlov put on his black dress coat and his decoration to go to visit his father and congratulate him on his name day He had to go at two o clock and it was only half past one when he had finished dressing What was he to do for that half hour He walked about the drawing room declaiming some congratulatory verses which he had recited as a child to his father and mother Zinaida Fyodorovna who was just going out to a dressmaker s or to the shops was sitting listening to him with a smile I don t know how their conversation began but when I took Orlov his gloves he was standing before her with a capricious beseeching face saying For God s sake in the name of everything that s holy don t talk of things that everybody knows What an unfortunate gift our intellectual thoughtful ladies have for talking with enthusiasm and an air of profundity of things that every schoolboy is sick to death of Ah if only you would exclude from our conjugal programme all these serious questions How grateful I should be to you We women may not dare it seems to have views of our own I give you full liberty to be as liberal as you like and quote from any authors you choose but make me one concession don t hold forth in my presence on either of two subjects the corruption of the upper classes and the evils of the marriage system Do understand me at last The upper class is always abused in contrast with the world of tradesmen priests workmen and peasants Sidors and Nikitas of all sorts I detest both classes but if I had honestly to choose between the two I should without hesitation prefer the upper class and there would be no falsity or affectation about it since all my tastes are in that direction Our world is trivial and empty but at any rate we speak French decently read something and don t punch each other in the ribs even in our most violent quarrels while the Sidors and the Nikitas and their worships in trade talk about being quite agreeable in a jiffy blast your eyes and display the utmost license of pothouse manners and the most degrading superstition The peasant and the tradesman feed you Yes but what of it That s not only to my discredit but to theirs too They feed me and take off their caps to me so it seems they have not the intelligence and honesty to do otherwise I don t blame or praise any one I only mean that the upper class and the lower are as bad as one another My feelings and my intelligence are opposed to both but my tastes lie more in the direction of the former Well now for the evils of marriage Orlov went on glancing at his watch It s high time for you to understand that there are no evils in the system itself what is the matter is that you don t know yourselves what you want from marriage What is it you want In legal and illegal cohabitation in every sort of union and cohabitation good or bad the underlying reality is the same You ladies live for that underlying reality alone for you it s everything your existence would have no meaning for you without it You want nothing but that and you get it but since you ve taken to reading novels you are ashamed of it you rush from pillar to post you recklessly change your men and to justify this turmoil you have begun talking of the evils of marriage So long as you can t and won t renounce what underlies it all your chief foe your devil so long as you serve that slavishly what use is there in discussing the matter seriously Everything you may say to me will be falsity and affectation I shall not believe you I went to find out from the hall porter whether the sledge was at the door and when I came back I found it had become a quarrel As sailors say a squall had blown up I see you want to shock me by your cynicism today said Zinaida Fyodorovna walking about the drawing room in great emotion It revolts me to listen to you I am pure before God and man and have nothing to repent of I left my husband and came to you and am proud of it I swear on my honour I am proud of it Well that s all right then If you are a decent honest man you too ought to be proud of what I did It raises you and me above thousands of people who would like to do as we have done but do not venture through cowardice or petty prudence But you are not a decent man You are afraid of freedom and you mock the promptings of genuine feeling from fear that some ignoramus may suspect you of being sincere You are afraid to show me to your friends there s no greater infliction for you than to go about with me in the street Isn t that true Why haven t you introduced me to your father or your cousin all this time Why is it No I am sick of it at last cried Zinaida Fyodorovna stamping I demand what is mine by right You must present me to your father If you want to know him go and present yourself He receives visitors every morning from ten till half past How base you are said Zinaida Fyodorovna wringing her hands in despair Even if you are not sincere and are not saying what you think I might hate you for your cruelty Oh how base you are We keep going round and round and never reach the real point The real point is that you made a mistake and you won t acknowledge it aloud You imagined that I was a hero and that I had some extraordinary ideas and ideals and it has turned out that I am a most ordinary official a cardplayer and have no partiality for ideas of any sort I am a worthy representative of the rotten world from which you have run away because you were revolted with its triviality and emptiness Recognise it and be just don t be indignant with me but with yourself as it is your mistake and not mine Yes I admit I was mistaken Well that s all right then We ve reached that point at last thank God Now hear something more if you please I can t rise to your level I am too depraved you can t descend to my level either for you are too exalted So there is only one thing left to do What Zinaida Fyodorovna asked quickly holding her breath and turning suddenly as white as a sheet of paper To call logic to our aid Georgy why are you torturing me Zinaida Fyodorovna said suddenly in Russian in a breaking voice What is it for Think of my misery Orlov afraid of tears went quickly into his study and I don t know why whether it was that he wished to cause her extra pain or whether he remembered it was usually done in such cases he locked the door after him She cried out and ran after him with a rustle of her skirt What does this mean she cried knocking at his door What what does this mean she repeated in a shrill voice breaking with indignation Ah so this is what you do Then let me tell you I hate you I despise you Everything is over between us now I heard hysterical weeping mingled with laughter Something small in the drawing room fell off the table and was broken Orlov went out into the hall by another door and looking round him nervously he hurriedly put on his great coat and went out Half an hour passed an hour and she was still weeping I remembered that she had no father or mother no relations and here she was living between a man who hated her and Polya who robbed her and how desolate her life seemed to me I do not know why but I went into the drawing room to her Weak and helpless looking with her lovely hair like an embodiment of tenderness and grace she was in anguish as though she were ill she was lying on a couch hiding her face and quivering all over Madam shouldn t I fetch a doctor I asked gently No there s no need it s nothing she said and she looked at me with her tear stained eyes I have a little headache Thank you I went out and in the evening she was writing letter after letter and sent me out first to Pekarsky then to Gruzin then to Kukushkin and finally anywhere I chose if only I could find Orlov and give him the letter Every time I came back with the letter she scolded me entreated me thrust money into my hand as though she were in a fever And all the night she did not sleep but sat in the drawing room talking to herself Orlov returned to dinner next day and they were reconciled The first Thursday afterwards Orlov complained to his friends of the intolerable life he led he smoked a great deal and said with irritation It is no life at all it s the rack Tears wailing intellectual conversations begging for forgiveness again tears and wailing and the long and the short of it is that I have no flat of my own now I am wretched and I make her wretched Surely I haven t to live another month or two like this How can I But yet I may have to Why don t you speak then said Pekarsky I ve tried but I can t One can boldly tell the truth whatever it may be to an independent rational man but in this case one has to do with a creature who has no will no strength of character and no logic I cannot endure tears they disarm me When she cries I am ready to swear eternal love and cry myself Pekarsky did not understand he scratched his broad forehead in perplexity and said You really had better take another flat for her It s so simple She wants me not the flat But what s the good of talking sighed Orlov I only hear endless conversations but no way out of my position It certainly is a case of being guilty without guilt I don t claim to be a mushroom but it seems I ve got to go into the basket The last thing I ve ever set out to be is a hero I never could endure Turgenev s novels and now all of a sudden as though to spite me I ve heroism forced upon me I assure her on my honour that I m not a hero at all I adduce irrefutable proofs of the same but she doesn t believe me Why doesn t she believe me I suppose I really must have something of the appearance of a hero You go off on a tour of inspection in the provinces said Kukushkin laughing Yes that s the only thing left for me A week after this conversation Orlov announced that he was again ordered to attend the senator and the same evening he went off with his portmanteaus to Pekarsky XI An old man of sixty in a long fur coat reaching to the ground and a beaver cap was standing at the door Is Georgy Ivanitch at home he asked At first I thought it was one of the moneylenders Gruzin s creditors who sometimes used to come to Orlov for small payments on account but when he came into the hall and flung open his coat I saw the thick brows and the characteristically compressed lips which I knew so well from the photographs and two rows of stars on the uniform I recognised him it was Orlov s father the distinguished statesman I answered that Georgy Ivanitch was not at home The old man pursed up his lips tightly and looked into space reflecting showing me his dried up toothless profile I ll leave a note he said show me in He left his goloshes in the hall and without taking off his long heavy fur coat went into the study There he sat down before the table and before taking up the pen for three minutes he pondered shading his eyes with his hand as though from the sun exactly as his son did when he was out of humour His face was sad thoughtful with that look of resignation which I have only seen on the faces of the old and religious I stood behind him gazed at his bald head and at the hollow at the nape of his neck and it was clear as daylight to me that this weak old man was now in my power There was not a soul in the flat except my enemy and me I had only to use a little physical violence then snatch his watch to disguise the object of the crime and to get off by the back way and I should have gained infinitely more than I could have imagined possible when I took up the part of a footman I thought that I could hardly get a better opportunity But instead of acting I looked quite unconcernedly first at his bald patch and then at his fur and calmly meditated on this man s relation to his only son and on the fact that people spoiled by power and wealth probably don t want to die Have you been long in my son s service he asked writing a large hand on the paper Three months your High Excellency He finished the letter and stood up I still had time I urged myself on and clenched my fists trying to wring out of my soul some trace of my former hatred I recalled what a passionate implacable obstinate hate I had felt for him only a little while before But it is difficult to strike a match against a crumbling stone The sad old face and the cold glitter of his stars roused in me nothing but petty cheap unnecessary thoughts of the transitoriness of everything earthly of the nearness of death Good day brother said the old man He put on his cap and went out There could be no doubt about it I had undergone a change I had become different To convince myself I began to recall the past but at once I felt uneasy as though I had accidentally peeped into a dark damp corner I remembered my comrades and friends and my first thought was how I should blush in confusion if ever I met any of them What was I now What had I to think of and to do Where was I to go What was I living for I could make nothing of it I only knew one thing that I must make haste to pack my things and be off Before the old man s visit my position as a flunkey had a meaning now it was absurd Tears dropped into my open portmanteau I felt insufferably sad but how I longed to live I was ready to embrace and include in my short life every possibility open to man I wanted to speak to read and to hammer in some big factory and to stand on watch and to plough I yearned for the Nevsky Prospect for the sea and the fields for every place to which my imagination travelled When Zinaida Fyodorovna came in I rushed to open the door for her and with peculiar tenderness took off her fur coat The last time We had two other visitors that day besides the old man In the evening when it was quite dark Gruzin came to fetch some papers for Orlov He opened the table drawer took the necessary papers and rolling them up told me to put them in the hall beside his cap while he went in to see Zinaida Fyodorovna She was lying on the sofa in the drawing room with her arms behind her head Five or six days had already passed since Orlov went on his tour of inspection and no one knew when he would be back but this time she did not send telegrams and did not expect them She did not seem to notice the presence of Polya who was still living with us So be it then was what I read on her passionless and very pale face Like Orlov she wanted to be unhappy out of obstinacy To spite herself and everything in the world she lay for days together on the sofa desiring and expecting nothing but evil for herself Probably she was picturing to herself Orlov s return and the inevitable quarrels with him then his growing indifference to her his infidelities then how they would separate and perhaps these agonising thoughts gave her satisfaction But what would she have said if she found out the actual truth I love you Godmother said Gruzin greeting her and kissing her hand You are so kind And so dear George has gone away he lied He has gone away the rascal He sat down with a sigh and tenderly stroked her hand Let me spend an hour with you my dear he said I don t want to go home and it s too early to go to the Birshovs The Birshovs are keeping their Katya s birthday to day She is a nice child I brought him a glass of tea and a decanter of brandy He slowly and with obvious reluctance drank the tea and returning the glass to me asked timidly Can you give me something to eat my friend I have had no dinner We had nothing in the flat I went to the restaurant and brought him the ordinary rouble dinner To your health my dear he said to Zinaida Fyodorovna and he tossed off a glass of vodka My little girl your godchild sends you her love Poor child she s rickety Ah children children he sighed Whatever you may say Godmother it is nice to be a father Dear George can t understand that feeling He drank some more Pale and lean with his dinner napkin over his chest like a little pinafore he ate greedily and raising his eyebrows kept looking guiltily like a little boy first at Zinaida Fyodorovna and then at me It seemed as though he would have begun crying if I had not given him the grouse or the jelly When he had satisfied his hunger he grew more lively and began laughingly telling some story about the Birshov household but perceiving that it was tiresome and that Zinaida Fyodorovna was not laughing he ceased And there was a sudden feeling of dreariness After he had finished his dinner they sat in the drawing room by the light of a single lamp and did not speak it was painful to him to lie to her and she wanted to ask him something but could not make up her mind to So passed half an hour Gruzin glanced at his watch I suppose it s time for me to go No stay a little We must have a talk Again they were silent He sat down to the piano struck one chord then began playing and sang softly What does the coming day bring me but as usual he got up suddenly and tossed his head Play something Zinaida Fyodorovna asked him What shall I play he asked shrugging his shoulders I have forgotten everything I ve given it up long ago Looking at the ceiling as though trying to remember he played two pieces of Tchaikovsky with exquisite expression with such warmth such insight His face was just as usual neither stupid nor intelligent and it seemed to me a perfect marvel that a man whom I was accustomed to see in the midst of the most degrading impure surroundings was capable of such purity of rising to a feeling so lofty so far beyond my reach Zinaida Fyodorovna s face glowed and she walked about the drawing room in emotion Wait a bit Godmother if I can remember it I will play you something he said I heard it played on the violoncello Beginning timidly and picking out the notes and then gathering confidence he played Saint Saens s Swan Song He played it through and then played it a second time It s nice isn t it he said Moved by the music Zinaida Fyodorovna stood beside him and asked Tell me honestly as a friend what do you think about me What am I to say he said raising his eyebrows I love you and think nothing but good of you But if you wish that I should speak generally about the question that interests you he went on rubbing his sleeve near the elbow and frowning then my dear you know To follow freely the promptings of the heart does not always give good people happiness To feel free and at the same time to be happy it seems to me one must not conceal from oneself that life is coarse cruel and merciless in its conservatism and one must retaliate with what it deserves that is be as coarse and as merciless in one s striving for freedom That s what I think That s beyond me said Zinaida Fyodorovna with a mournful smile I am exhausted already I am so exhausted that I wouldn t stir a finger for my own salvation Go into a nunnery He said this in jest but after he had said it tears glistened in Zinaida Fyodorovna s eyes and then in his Well he said we ve been sitting and sitting and now we must go Good bye dear Godmother God give you health He kissed both her hands and stroking them tenderly said that he should certainly come to see her again in a day or two In the hall as he was putting on his overcoat that was so like a child s pelisse he fumbled long in his pockets to find a tip for me but found nothing there Good bye my dear fellow he said sadly and went away I shall never forget the feeling that this man left behind him Zinaida Fyodorovna still walked about the room in her excitement That she was walking about and not still lying down was so much to the good I wanted to take advantage of this mood to speak to her openly and then to go away but I had hardly seen Gruzin out when I heard a ring It was Kukushkin Is Georgy Ivanitch at home he said Has he come back You say no What a pity In that case I ll go in and kiss your mistress s hand and so away Zinaida Fyodorovna may I come in he cried I want to kiss your hand Excuse my being so late He was not long in the drawing room not more than ten minutes but I felt as though he were staying a long while and would never go away I bit my lips from indignation and annoyance and already hated Zinaida Fyodorovna Why does she not turn him out I thought indignantly though it was evident that she was bored by his company When I held his fur coat for him he asked me as a mark of special good will how I managed to get on without a wife But I don t suppose you waste your time he said laughingly I ve no doubt Polya and you are as thick as thieves You rascal In spite of my experience of life I knew very little of mankind at that time and it is very likely that I often exaggerated what was of little consequence and failed to observe what was important It seemed to me it was not without motive that Kukushkin tittered and flattered me Could it be that he was hoping that I like a flunkey would gossip in other kitchens and servants quarters of his coming to see us in the evenings when Orlov was away and staying with Zinaida Fyodorovna till late at night And when my tittle tattle came to the ears of his acquaintance he would drop his eyes in confusion and shake his little finger And would not he I thought looking at his little honeyed face this very evening at cards pretend and perhaps declare that he had already won Zinaida Fyodorovna from Orlov That hatred which failed me at midday when the old father had come took possession of me now Kukushkin went away at last and as I listened to the shuffle of his leather goloshes I felt greatly tempted to fling after him as a parting shot some coarse word of abuse but I restrained myself And when the steps had died away on the stairs I went back to the hall and hardly conscious of what I was doing took up the roll of papers that Gruzin had left behind and ran headlong downstairs Without cap or overcoat I ran down into the street It was not cold but big flakes of snow were falling and it was windy Your Excellency I cried catching up Kukushkin Your Excellency He stopped under a lamp post and looked round with surprise Your Excellency I said breathless your Excellency And not able to think of anything to say I hit him two or three times on the face with the roll of paper Completely at a loss and hardly wondering I had so completely taken him by surprise he leaned his back against the lamp post and put up his hands to protect his face At that moment an army doctor passed and saw how I was beating the man but he merely looked at us in astonishment and went on I felt ashamed and I ran back to the house XII With my head wet from the snow and gasping for breath I ran to my room and immediately flung off my swallow tails put on a reefer jacket and an overcoat and carried my portmanteau out into the passage I must get away But before going I hurriedly sat down and began writing to Orlov I leave you my false passport I began I beg you to keep it as a memento you false man you Petersburg official To steal into another man s house under a false name to watch under the mask of a flunkey this person s intimate life to hear everything to see everything in order later on unasked to accuse a man of lying all this you will say is on a level with theft Yes but I care nothing for fine feelings now I have endured dozens of your dinners and suppers when you said and did what you liked and I had to hear to look on and be silent I don t want to make you a present of my silence Besides if there is not a living soul at hand who dares to tell you the truth without flattery let your flunkey Stepan wash your magnificent countenance for you I did not like this beginning but I did not care to alter it Besides what did it matter The big windows with their dark curtains the bed the crumpled dress coat on the floor and my wet footprints looked gloomy and forbidding And there was a peculiar stillness Possibly because I had run out into the street without my cap and goloshes I was in a high fever My face burned my legs ached My heavy head drooped over the table and there was that kind of division in my thought when every idea in the brain seemed dogged by its shadow I am ill weak morally cast down I went on I cannot write to you as I should like to From the first moment I desired to insult and humiliate you but now I do not feel that I have the right to do so You and I have both fallen and neither of us will ever rise up again and even if my letter were eloquent terrible and passionate it would still seem like beating on the lid of a coffin however one knocks upon it one will not wake up the dead No efforts could warm your accursed cold blood and you know that better than I do Why write But my mind and heart are burning and I go on writing for some reason I am moved as though this letter still might save you and me I am so feverish that my thoughts are disconnected and my pen scratches the paper without meaning but the question I want to put to you stands before me as clear as though in letters of flame Why I am prematurely weak and fallen is not hard to explain Like Samson of old I have taken the gates of Gaza on my shoulders to carry them to the top of the mountain and only when I was exhausted when youth and health were quenched in me forever I noticed that that burden was not for my shoulders and that I had deceived myself I have been moreover in cruel and continual pain I have endured cold hunger illness and loss of liberty Of personal happiness I know and have known nothing I have no home my memories are bitter and my conscience is often in dread of them But why have you fallen you What fatal diabolical causes hindered your life from blossoming into full flower Why almost before beginning life were you in such haste to cast off the image and likeness of God and to become a cowardly beast who backs and scares others because he is afraid himself You are afraid of life as afraid of it as an Oriental who sits all day on a cushion smoking his hookah Yes you read a great deal and a European coat fits you well but yet with what tender purely Oriental pasha like care you protect yourself from hunger cold physical effort from pain and uneasiness How early your soul has taken to its dressing gown What a cowardly part you have played towards real life and nature with which every healthy and normal man struggles How soft how snug how warm how comfortable and how bored you are Yes it is deathly boredom unrelieved by one ray of light as in solitary confinement but you try to hide from that enemy too you play cards eight hours out of twenty four And your irony Oh but how well I understand it Free bold living thought is searching and dominating for an indolent sluggish mind it is intolerable That it may not disturb your peace like thousands of your contemporaries you made haste in youth to put it under bar and bolt Your ironical attitude to life or whatever you like to call it is your armour and your thought fettered and frightened dare not leap over the fence you have put round it and when you jeer at ideas which you pretend to know all about you are like the deserter fleeing from the field of battle and to stifle his shame sneering at war and at valour Cynicism stifles pain In some novel of Dostoevsky s an old man tramples underfoot the portrait of his dearly loved daughter because he had been unjust to her and you vent your foul and vulgar jeers upon the ideas of goodness and truth because you have not the strength to follow them You are frightened of every honest and truthful hint at your degradation and you purposely surround yourself with people who do nothing but flatter your weaknesses And you may well you may well dread the sight of tears By the way your attitude to women Shamelessness has been handed down to us in our flesh and blood and we are trained to shamelessness but that is what we are men for to subdue the beast in us When you reached manhood and all ideas became known to you you could not have failed to see the truth you knew it but you did not follow it you were afraid of it and to deceive your conscience you began loudly assuring yourself that it was not you but woman that was to blame that she was as degraded as your attitude to her Your cold scabrous anecdotes your coarse laughter all your innumerable theories concerning the underlying reality of marriage and the definite demands made upon it concerning the ten sous the French workman pays his woman your everlasting attacks on female logic lying weakness and so on doesn t it all look like a desire at all costs to force woman down into the mud that she may be on the same level as your attitude to her You are a weak unhappy unpleasant person Zinaida Fyodorovna began playing the piano in the drawing room trying to recall the song of Saint Saens that Gruzin had played I went and lay on my bed but remembering that it was time for me to go I got up with an effort and with a heavy burning head went to the table again But this is the question I went on Why are we worn out Why are we at first so passionate so bold so noble and so full of faith complete bankrupts at thirty or thirty five Why does one waste in consumption another put a bullet through his brains a third seeks forgetfulness in vodka and cards while the fourth tries to stifle his fear and misery by cynically trampling underfoot the pure image of his fair youth Why is it that having once fallen we do not try to rise up again and losing one thing do not seek something else Why is it The thief hanging on the Cross could bring back the joy of life and the courage of confident hope though perhaps he had not more than an hour to live You have long years before you and I shall probably not die so soon as one might suppose What if by a miracle the present turned out to be a dream a horrible nightmare and we should wake up renewed pure strong proud of our righteousness Sweet visions fire me and I am almost breathless with emotion I have a terrible longing to live I long for our life to be holy lofty and majestic as the heavens above Let us live The sun doesn t rise twice a day and life is not given us again clutch at what is left of your life and save it I did not write another word I had a multitude of thoughts in my mind but I could not connect them and get them on to paper Without finishing the letter I signed it with my name and rank and went into the study It was dark I felt for the table and put the letter on it I must have stumbled against the furniture in the dark and made a noise Who is there I heard an alarmed voice in the drawing room And the clock on the table softly struck one at the moment XIII For at least half a minute I fumbled at the door in the dark feeling for the handle then I slowly opened it and walked into the drawing room Zinaida Fyodorovna was lying on the couch and raising herself on her elbow she looked towards me Unable to bring myself to speak I walked slowly by and she followed me with her eyes I stood for a little time in the dining room and then walked by her again and she looked at me intently and with perplexity even with alarm At last I stood still and said with an effort He is not coming back She quickly got on to her feet and looked at me without understanding He is not coming back I repeated and my heart beat violently He will not come back for he has not left Petersburg He is staying at Pekarsky s She understood and believed me I saw that from her sudden pallor and from the way she laid her arms upon her bosom in terror and entreaty In one instant all that had happened of late flashed through her mind she reflected and with pitiless clarity she saw the whole truth But at the same time she remembered that I was a flunkey a being of a lower order A casual stranger with hair ruffled with face flushed with fever perhaps drunk in a common overcoat was coarsely intruding into her intimate life and that offended her She said to me sternly It s not your business go away Oh believe me I cried impetuously holding out my hands to her I am not a footman I am as free as you I mentioned my name and speaking very rapidly that she might not interrupt me or go away explained to her who I was and why I was living there This new discovery struck her more than the first Till then she had hoped that her footman had lied or made a mistake or been silly but now after my confession she had no doubts left From the expression of her unhappy eyes and face which suddenly lost its softness and beauty and looked old I saw that she was insufferably miserable and that the conversation would lead to no good but I went on impetuously The senator and the tour of inspection were invented to deceive you In January just as now he did not go away but stayed at Pekarsky s and I saw him every day and took part in the deception He was weary of you he hated your presence here he mocked at you If you could have heard how he and his friends here jeered at you and your love you would not have remained here one minute Go away from here Go away Well she said in a shaking voice and moved her hand over her hair Well so be it Her eyes were full of tears her lips were quivering and her whole face was strikingly pale and distorted with anger Orlov s coarse petty lying revolted her and seemed to her contemptible ridiculous she smiled and I did not like that smile Well she repeated passing her hand over her hair again so be it He imagines that I shall die of humiliation and instead of that I am amused by it There s no need for him to hide She walked away from the piano and said shrugging her shoulders There s no need It would have been simpler to have it out with me instead of keeping in hiding in other people s flats I have eyes I saw it myself long ago I was only waiting for him to come back to have things out once for all Then she sat down on a low chair by the table and leaning her head on the arm of the sofa wept bitterly In the drawing room there was only one candle burning in the candelabra and the chair where she was sitting was in darkness but I saw how her head and shoulders were quivering and how her hair escaping from her combs covered her neck her face her arms Her quiet steady weeping which was not hysterical but a woman s ordinary weeping expressed a sense of insult of wounded pride of injury and of something helpless hopeless which one could not set right and to which one could not get used Her tears stirred an echo in my troubled and suffering heart I forgot my illness and everything else in the world I walked about the drawing room and muttered distractedly Is this life Oh one can t go on living like this one can t Oh it s madness wickedness not life What humiliation she said through her tears To live together to smile at me at the very time when I was burdensome to him ridiculous in his eyes Oh how humiliating She lifted up her head and looking at me with tear stained eyes through her hair wet with her tears and pushing it back as it prevented her seeing me she asked They laughed at me To these men you were laughable you and your love and Turgenev they said your head was full of him And if we both die at once in despair that will amuse them too they will make a funny anecdote of it and tell it at your requiem service But why talk of them I said impatiently We must get away from here I cannot stay here one minute longer She began crying again while I walked to the piano and sat down What are we waiting for I asked dejectedly It s two o clock I am not waiting for anything she said I am utterly lost Why do you talk like that We had better consider together what we are to do Neither you nor I can stay here Where do you intend to go Suddenly there was a ring at the bell My heart stood still Could it be Orlov to whom perhaps Kukushkin had complained of me How should we meet I went to open the door It was Polya She came in shaking the snow off her pelisse and went into her room without saying a word to me When I went back to the drawing room Zinaida Fyodorovna pale as death was standing in the middle of the room looking towards me with big eyes Who was it she asked softly Polya I answered She passed her hand over her hair and closed her eyes wearily I will go away at once she said Will you be kind and take me to the Petersburg Side What time is it now A quarter to three XIV When a little afterwards we went out of the house it was dark and deserted in the street Wet snow was falling and a damp wind lashed in one s face I remember it was the beginning of March a thaw had set in and for some days past the cabmen had been driving on wheels Under the impression of the back stairs of the cold of the midnight darkness and the porter in his sheepskin who had questioned us before letting us out of the gate Zinaida Fyodorovna was utterly cast down and dispirited When we got into the cab and the hood was put up trembling all over she began hurriedly saying how grateful she was to me I do not doubt your good will but I am ashamed that you should be troubled she muttered Oh I understand I understand When Gruzin was here to day I felt that he was lying and concealing something Well so be it But I am ashamed anyway that you should be troubled She still had her doubts To dispel them finally I asked the cabman to drive through Sergievsky Street stopping him at Pekarsky s door I got out of the cab and rang When the porter came to the door I asked aloud that Zinaida Fyodorovna might hear whether Georgy Ivanitch was at home Yes was the answer he came in half an hour ago He must be in bed by now What do you want Zinaida Fyodorovna could not refrain from putting her head out Has Georgy Ivanitch been staying here long she asked Going on for three weeks And he s not been away No answered the porter looking at me with surprise Tell him early to morrow I said that his sister has arrived from Warsaw Good bye Then we drove on The cab had no apron the snow fell on us in big flakes and the wind especially on the Neva pierced us through and through I began to feel as though we had been driving for a long time that for ages we had been suffering and that for ages I had been listening to Zinaida Fyodorovna s shuddering breath In semi delirium as though half asleep I looked back upon my strange incoherent life and for some reason recalled a melodrama The Parisian Beggars which I had seen once or twice in my childhood And when to shake off that semi delirium I peeped out from the hood and saw the dawn all the images of the past all my misty thoughts for some reason blended in me into one distinct overpowering thought everything was irrevocably over for Zinaida Fyodorovna and for me This was as certain a conviction as though the cold blue sky contained a prophecy but a minute later I was already thinking of something else and believed differently What am I now said Zinaida Fyodorovna in a voice husky with the cold and the damp Where am I to go What am I to do Gruzin told me to go into a nunnery Oh I would I would change my dress my face my name my thoughts everything everything and would hide myself for ever But they will not take me into a nunnery I am with child We will go abroad together to morrow I said That s impossible My husband won t give me a passport I will take you without a passport The cabman stopped at a wooden house of two storeys painted a dark colour I rang Taking from me her small light basket the only luggage we had brought with us Zinaida Fyodorovna gave a wry smile and said These are my bijoux But she was so weak that she could not carry these bijoux It was a long while before the door was opened After the third or fourth ring a light gleamed in the windows and there was a sound of steps coughing and whispering at last the key grated in the lock and a stout peasant woman with a frightened red face appeared at the door Some distance behind her stood a thin little old woman with short grey hair carrying a candle in her hand Zinaida Fyodorovna ran into the passage and flung her arms round the old woman s neck Nina I ve been deceived she sobbed loudly I ve been coarsely foully deceived Nina Nina I handed the basket to the peasant woman The door was closed but still I heard her sobs and the cry Nina I got into the cab and told the man to drive slowly to the Nevsky Prospect I had to think of a night s lodging for myself Next day towards evening I went to see Zinaida Fyodorovna She was terribly changed There were no traces of tears on her pale terribly sunken face and her expression was different I don t know whether it was that I saw her now in different surroundings far from luxurious and that our relations were by now different or perhaps that intense grief had already set its mark upon her she did not strike me as so elegant and well dressed as before Her figure seemed smaller there was an abruptness and excessive nervousness about her as though she were in a hurry and there was not the same softness even in her smile I was dressed in an expensive suit which I had bought during the day She looked first of all at that suit and at the hat in my hand then turned an impatient searching glance upon my face as though studying it Your transformation still seems to me a sort of miracle she said Forgive me for looking at you with such curiosity You are an extraordinary man you know I told her again who I was and why I was living at Orlov s and I told her at greater length and in more detail than the day before She listened with great attention and said without letting me finish Everything there is over for me You know I could not refrain from writing a letter Here is the answer On the sheet which she gave there was written in Orlov s hand I am not going to justify myself But you must own that it was your mistake not mine I wish you happiness and beg you to make haste and forget Yours sincerely G O P S I am sending on your things The trunks and baskets despatched by Orlov were standing in the passage and my poor little portmanteau was there beside them So Zinaida Fyodorovna began but she did not finish We were silent She took the note and held it for a couple of minutes before her eyes and during that time her face wore the same haughty contemptuous proud and harsh expression as the day before at the beginning of our explanation tears came into her eyes not timid bitter tears but proud angry tears Listen she said getting up abruptly and moving away to the window that I might not see her face I have made up my mind to go abroad with you tomorrow I am very glad I am ready to go to day Accept me as a recruit Have you read Balzac she asked suddenly turning round Have you At the end of his novel Pere Goriot the hero looks down upon Paris from the top of a hill and threatens the town Now we shall settle our account and after this he begins a new life So when I look out of the train window at Petersburg for the last time I shall say Now we shall settle our account Saying this she smiled at her jest and for some reason shuddered all over XV At Venice I had an attack of pleurisy Probably I had caught cold in the evening when we were rowing from the station to the Hotel Bauer I had to take to my bed and stay there for a fortnight Every morning while I was ill Zinaida Fyodorovna came from her room to drink coffee with me and afterwards read aloud to me French and Russian books of which we had bought a number at Vienna These books were either long long familiar to me or else had no interest for me but I had the sound of a sweet kind voice beside me so that the meaning of all of them was summed up for me in the one thing I was not alone She would go out for a walk come back in her light grey dress her light straw hat gay warmed by the spring sun and sitting by my bed bending low down over me would tell me something about Venice or read me those books and I was happy At night I was cold ill and dreary but by day I revelled in life I can find no better expression for it The brilliant warm sunshine beating in at the open windows and at the door upon the balcony the shouts below the splash of oars the tinkle of bells the prolonged boom of the cannon at midday and the feeling of perfect perfect freedom did wonders with me I felt as though I were growing strong broad wings which were bearing me God knows whither And what charm what joy at times at the thought that another life was so close to mine that I was the servant the guardian the friend the indispensable fellow traveller of a creature young beautiful wealthy but weak lonely and insulted It is pleasant even to be ill when you know that there are people who are looking forward to your convalescence as to a holiday One day I heard her whispering behind the door with my doctor and then she came in to me with tear stained eyes It was a bad sign but I was touched and there was a wonderful lightness in my heart But at last they allowed me to go out on the balcony The sunshine and the breeze from the sea caressed and fondled my sick body I looked down at the familiar gondolas which glide with feminine grace smoothly and majestically as though they were alive and felt all the luxury of this original fascinating civilisation There was a smell of the sea Some one was playing a stringed instrument and two voices were singing How delightful it was How unlike it was to that Petersburg night when the wet snow was falling and beating so rudely on our faces If one looks straight across the canal one sees the sea and on the wide expanse towards the horizon the sun glittered on the water so dazzlingly that it hurt one s eyes to look at it My soul yearned towards that lovely sea which was so akin to me and to which I had given up my youth I longed to live to live and nothing more A fortnight later I began walking freely I loved to sit in the sun and to listen to the gondoliers without understanding them and for hours together to gaze at the little house where they said Desdemona lived a naive mournful little house with a demure expression as light as lace so light that it looked as though one could lift it from its place with one hand I stood for a long time by the tomb of Canova and could not take my eyes off the melancholy lion And in the Palace of the Doges I was always drawn to the corner where the portrait of the unhappy Marino Faliero was painted over with black It is fine to be an artist a poet a dramatist I thought but since that is not vouchsafed to me if only I could go in for mysticism If only I had a grain of some faith to add to the unruffled peace and serenity that fills the soul In the evening we ate oysters drank wine and went out in a gondola I remember our black gondola swayed softly in the same place while the water faintly gurgled under it Here and there the reflection of the stars and the lights on the bank quivered and trembled Not far from us in a gondola hung with coloured lanterns which were reflected in the water there were people singing The sounds of guitars of violins of mandolins of men s and women s voices were audible in the dark Zinaida Fyodorovna pale with a grave almost stern face was sitting beside me compressing her lips and clenching her hands She was thinking about something she did not stir an eyelash nor hear me Her face her attitude and her fixed expressionless gaze and her incredibly miserable dreadful and icy cold memories and around her the gondolas the lights the music the song with its vigorous passionate cry of Jam mo Jam mo what contrasts in life When she sat like that with tightly clasped hands stony mournful I used to feel as though we were both characters in some novel in the old fashioned style called The Ill fated The Abandoned or something of the sort Both of us she the ill fated the abandoned and I the faithful devoted friend the dreamer and if you like it a superfluous man a failure capable of nothing but coughing and dreaming and perhaps sacrificing myself But who and what needed my sacrifices now And what had I to sacrifice indeed When we came in in the evening we always drank tea in her room and talked We did not shrink from touching on old unhealed wounds on the contrary for some reason I felt a positive pleasure in telling her about my life at Orlov s or referring openly to relations which I knew and which could not have been concealed from me At moments I hated you I said to her When he was capricious condescending told you lies I marvelled how it was you did not see did not understand when it was all so clear You kissed his hands you knelt to him you flattered him When I kissed his hands and knelt to him I loved him she said blushing crimson Can it have been so difficult to see through him A fine sphinx A sphinx indeed a kammer junker I reproach you for nothing God forbid I went on feeling I was coarse that I had not the tact the delicacy which are so essential when you have to do with a fellow creature s soul in early days before I knew her I had not noticed this defect in myself But how could you fail to see what he was I went on speaking more softly and more diffidently however You mean to say you despise my past and you are right she said deeply stirred You belong to a special class of men who cannot be judged by ordinary standards your moral requirements are exceptionally rigorous and I understand you can t forgive things I understand you and if sometimes I say the opposite it doesn t mean that I look at things differently from you I speak the same old nonsense simply because I haven t had time yet to wear out my old clothes and prejudices I too hate and despise my past and Orlov and my love What was that love It s positively absurd now she said going to the window and looking down at the canal All this love only clouds the conscience and confuses the mind The meaning of life is to be found only in one thing fighting To get one s heel on the vile head of the serpent and to crush it That s the meaning of life In that alone or in nothing I told her long stories of my past and described my really astounding adventures But of the change that had taken place in me I did not say one word She always listened to me with great attention and at interesting places she rubbed her hands as though vexed that it had not yet been her lot to experience such adventures such joys and terrors Then she would suddenly fall to musing and retreat into herself and I could see from her face that she was not attending to me I closed the windows that looked out on the canal and asked whether we should not have the fire lighted No never mind I am not cold she said smiling listlessly I only feel weak Do you know I fancy I have grown much wiser lately I have extraordinary original ideas now When I think of my past of my life then people in general in fact it is all summed up for me in the image of my stepmother Coarse insolent soulless false depraved and a morphia maniac too My father who was feeble and weak willed married my mother for her money and drove her into consumption but his second wife my stepmother he loved passionately insanely What I had to put up with But what is the use of talking And so as I say it is all summed up in her image And it vexes me that my stepmother is dead I should like to meet her now Why I don t know she answered with a laugh and a graceful movement of her head Good night You must get well As soon as you are well we ll take up our work It s time to begin After I had said good night and had my hand on the door handle she said What do you think Is Polya still living there Probably And I went off to my room So we spent a whole month One grey morning when we both stood at my window looking at the clouds which were moving up from the sea and at the darkening canal expecting every minute that it would pour with rain and when a thick narrow streak of rain covered the sea as though with a muslin veil we both felt suddenly dreary The same day we both set off for Florence XVI It was autumn at Nice One morning when I went into her room she was sitting on a low chair bent together and huddled up with her legs crossed and her face hidden in her hands She was weeping bitterly with sobs and her long unbrushed hair fell on her knees The impression of the exquisite marvellous sea which I had only just seen and of which I wanted to tell her left me all at once and my heart ached What is it I asked she took one hand from her face and motioned me to go away What is it I repeated and for the first time during our acquaintance I kissed her hand No it s nothing nothing she said quickly Oh it s nothing nothing Go away You see I am not dressed I went out overwhelmed The calm and serene mood in which I had been for so long was poisoned by compassion I had a passionate longing to fall at her feet to entreat her not to weep in solitude but to share her grief with me and the monotonous murmur of the sea already sounded a gloomy prophecy in my ears and I foresaw fresh tears fresh troubles and fresh losses in the future What is she crying about What is it I wondered recalling her face and her agonised look I remembered she was with child She tried to conceal her condition from other people and also from herself At home she went about in a loose wrapper or in a blouse with extremely full folds over the bosom and when she went out anywhere she laced herself in so tightly that on two occasions she fainted when we were out She never spoke to me of her condition and when I hinted that it might be as well to see a doctor she flushed crimson and said not a word When I went to see her next time she was already dressed and had her hair done There there I said seeing that she was ready to cry again We had better go to the sea and have a talk I can t talk Forgive me I am in the mood now when one wants to be alone And if you please Vladimir Ivanitch another time you want to come into my room be so good as to give a knock at the door That be so good had a peculiar unfeminine sound I went away My accursed Petersburg mood came back and all my dreams were crushed and crumpled up like leaves by the heat I felt I was alone again and there was no nearness between us I was no more to her than that cobweb to that palm tree which hangs on it by chance and which will be torn off and carried away by the wind I walked about the square where the band was playing went into the Casino there I looked at overdressed and heavily perfumed women and every one of them glanced at me as though she would say You are alone that s all right Then I went out on the terrace and looked for a long time at the sea There was not one sail on the horizon On the left bank in the lilac coloured mist there were mountains gardens towers and houses the sun was sparkling over it all but it was all alien indifferent an incomprehensible tangle XVII She used as before to come into my room in the morning to coffee but we no longer dined together as she said she was not hungry and she lived only on coffee tea and various trifles such as oranges and caramels And we no longer had conversations in the evening I don t know why it was like this Ever since the day when I had found her in tears she had treated me somehow lightly at times casually even ironically and for some reason called me My good sir What had before seemed to her terrible heroic marvellous and had stirred her envy and enthusiasm did not touch her now at all and usually after listening to me she stretched and said Yes great things were done in days of yore my good sir It sometimes happened even that I did not see her for days together I would knock timidly and guiltily at her door and get no answer I would knock again still silence I would stand near the door and listen then the chambermaid would pass and say coldly Madame est partie Then I would walk about the passages of the hotel walk and walk English people full bosomed ladies waiters in swallow tails And as I keep gazing at the long striped rug that stretches the whole length of the corridor the idea occurs to me that I am playing in the life of this woman a strange probably false part and that it is beyond my power to alter that part I run to my room and fall on my bed and think and think and can come to no conclusion and all that is clear to me is that I want to live and that the plainer and the colder and the harder her face grows the nearer she is to me and the more intensely and painfully I feel our kinship Never mind My good sir never mind her light careless tone never mind anything you like only don t leave me my treasure I am afraid to be alone Then I go out into the corridor again listen in a tremor I have no dinner I don t notice the approach of evening At last about eleven I hear the familiar footstep and at the turn near the stairs Zinaida Fyodorovna comes into sight Are you taking a walk she would ask as she passes me You had better go out into the air Good night But shall we not meet again to day I think it s late But as you like Tell me where have you been I would ask following her into the room Where To Monte Carlo She took ten gold coins out of her pocket and said Look my good sir I have won That s at roulette Nonsense As though you would gamble Why not I am going again to morrow I imagined her with a sick and morbid face in her condition tightly laced standing near the gaming table in a crowd of cocottes of old women in their dotage who swarm round the gold like flies round the honey I remembered she had gone off to Monte Carlo for some reason in secret from me I don t believe you I said one day You wouldn t go there Don t agitate yourself I can t lose much It s not the question of what you lose I said with annoyance Has it never occurred to you while you were playing there that the glitter of gold all these women young and old the croupiers all the surroundings that it is all a vile loathsome mockery at the toiler s labour at his bloody sweat If one doesn t play what is one to do here she asked The toiler s labour and his bloody sweat all that eloquence you can put off till another time but now since you have begun let me go on Let me ask you bluntly what is there for me to do here and what am I to do What are you to do I said shrugging my shoulders That s a question that can t be answered straight off I beg you to answer me honestly Vladimir Ivanitch she said and her face looked angry Once I have brought myself to ask you this question I am not going to listen to stock phrases I am asking you she went on beating her hand on the table as though marking time what ought I to do here And not only here at Nice but in general I did not speak but looked out of window to the sea My heart was beating terribly Vladimir Ivanitch she said softly and breathlessly it was hard for her to speak Vladimir Ivanitch if you do not believe in the cause yourself if you no longer think of going back to it why why did you drag me out of Petersburg Why did you make me promises why did you rouse mad hopes Your convictions have changed you have become a different man and nobody blames you for it our convictions are not always in our power But but Vladimir Ivanitch for God s sake why are you not sincere she went on softly coming up to me All these months when I have been dreaming aloud raving going into raptures over my plans remodelling my life on a new pattern why didn t you tell me the truth Why were you silent or encouraged me by your stories and behaved as though you were in complete sympathy with me Why was it Why was it necessary It s difficult to acknowledge one s bankruptcy I said turning round but not looking at her Yes I have no faith I am worn out I have lost heart It is difficult to be truthful very difficult and I held my tongue God forbid that any one should have to go through what I have been through I felt that I was on the point of tears and ceased speaking Vladimir Ivanitch she said and took me by both hands you have been through so much and seen so much of life you know more than I do think seriously and tell me what am I to do Teach me If you haven t the strength to go forward yourself and take others with you at least show me where to go After all I am a living feeling thinking being To sink into a false position to play an absurd part is painful to me I don t reproach you I don t blame you I only ask you Tea was brought in Well said Zinaida Fyodorovna giving me a glass What do you say to me There is more light in the world than you see through your window I answered And there are other people besides me Zinaida Fyodorovna Then tell me who they are she said eagerly That s all I ask of you And I want to say too I went on one can serve an idea in more than one calling If one has made a mistake and lost faith in one one may find another The world of ideas is large and cannot be exhausted The world of ideas she said and she looked into my face sarcastically Then we had better leave off talking What s the use She flushed The world of ideas she repeated She threw her dinner napkin aside and an expression of indignation and contempt came into her face All your fine ideas I see lead up to one inevitable essential step I ought to become your mistress That s what s wanted To be taken up with ideas without being the mistress of an honourable progressive man is as good as not understanding the ideas One has to begin with that that is with being your mistress and the rest will come of itself You are irritated Zinaida Fyodorovna I said No I am sincere she cried breathing hard I am sincere You are sincere perhaps but you are in error and it hurts me to hear you I am in error she laughed Any one else might say that but not you my dear sir I may seem to you indelicate cruel but I don t care you love me You love me don t you I shrugged my shoulders Yes shrug your shoulders she went on sarcastically When you were ill I heard you in your delirium and ever since these adoring eyes these sighs and edifying conversations about friendship about spiritual kinship But the point is why haven t you been sincere Why have you concealed what is and talked about what isn t Had you said from the beginning what ideas exactly led you to drag me from Petersburg I should have known I should have poisoned myself then as I meant to and there would have been none of this tedious farce But what s the use of talking With a wave of the hand she sat down You speak to me as though you suspected me of dishonourable intentions I said offended Oh very well What s the use of talking I don t suspect you of intentions but of having no intentions If you had any I should have known them by now You had nothing but ideas and love For the present ideas and love and in prospect me as your mistress That s in the order of things both in life and in novels Here you abused him she said and she slapped the table with her hand but one can t help agreeing with him He has good reasons for despising these ideas He does not despise ideas he is afraid of them I cried He is a coward and a liar Oh very well He is a coward and a liar and deceived me And you Excuse my frankness what are you He deceived me and left me to take my chance in Petersburg and you have deceived me and abandoned me here But he did not mix up ideas with his deceit and you For goodness sake why are you saying this I cried in horror wringing my hands and going up to her quickly No Zinaida Fyodorovna this is cynicism You must not be so despairing listen to me I went on catching at a thought which flashed dimly upon me and which seemed to me might still save us both Listen I have passed through so many experiences in my time that my head goes round at the thought of them and I have realised with my mind with my racked soul that man finds his true destiny in nothing if not in self sacrificing love for his neighbour It is towards that we must strive and that is our destination That is my faith I wanted to go on to speak of mercy of forgiveness but there was an insincere note in my voice and I was embarrassed I want to live I said genuinely To live to live I want peace tranquillity I want warmth this sea here to have you near Oh how I wish I could rouse in you the same thirst for life You spoke just now of love but it would be enough for me to have you near to hear your voice to watch the look in your face She flushed crimson and to hinder my speaking said quickly You love life and I hate it So our ways lie apart She poured herself out some tea but did not touch it went into the bedroom and lay down I imagine it is better to cut short this conversation she said to me from within Everything is over for me and I want nothing What more is there to say No it s not all over Oh very well I know I am sick of it That s enough I got up took a turn from one end of the room to the other and went out into the corridor When late at night I went to her door and listened I distinctly heard her crying Next morning the waiter handing me my clothes informed me with a smile that the lady in number thirteen was confined I dressed somehow and almost fainting with terror ran to Zinaida Fyodorovna In her room I found a doctor a midwife and an elderly Russian lady from Harkov called Darya Milhailovna There was a smell of ether I had scarcely crossed the threshold when from the room where she was lying I heard a low plaintive moan and as though it had been wafted me by the wind from Russia I thought of Orlov his irony Polya the Neva the drifting snow then the cab without an apron the prediction I had read in the cold morning sky and the despairing cry Nina Nina Go in to her said the lady I went in to see Zinaida Fyodorovna feeling as though I were the father of the child She was lying with her eyes closed looking thin and pale wearing a white cap edged with lace I remember there were two expressions on her face one cold indifferent apathetic the other a look of childish helplessness given her by the white cap She did not hear me come in or heard perhaps but did not pay attention I stood looked at her and waited But her face was contorted with pain she opened her eyes and gazed at the ceiling as though wondering what was happening to her There was a look of loathing on her face It s horrible she whispered Zinaida Fyodorovna I spoke her name softly She looked at me indifferently listlessly and closed her eyes I stood there a little while then went away At night Darya Mihailovna informed me that the child a girl was born but that the mother was in a dangerous condition Then I heard noise and bustle in the passage Darya Mihailovna came to me again and with a face of despair wringing her hands said Oh this is awful The doctor suspects that she has taken poison Oh how badly Russians do behave here And at twelve o clock the next day Zinaida Fyodorovna died XVIII Two years had passed Circumstances had changed I had come to Petersburg again and could live here openly I was no longer afraid of being and seeming sentimental and gave myself up entirely to the fatherly or rather idolatrous feeling roused in me by Sonya Zinaida Fyodorovna s child I fed her with my own hands gave her her bath put her to bed never took my eyes off her for nights together and screamed when it seemed to me that the nurse was just going to drop her My thirst for normal ordinary life became stronger and more acute as time went on but wider visions stopped short at Sonya as though I had found in her at last just what I needed I loved the child madly In her I saw the continuation of my life and it was not exactly that I fancied but I felt I almost believed that when I had cast off at last my long bony bearded frame I should go on living in those little blue eyes that silky flaxen hair those dimpled pink hands which stroked my face so lovingly and were clasped round my neck Sonya s future made me anxious Orlov was her father in her birth certificate she was called Krasnovsky and the only person who knew of her existence and took interest in her that is I was at death s door I had to think about her seriously The day after I arrived in Petersburg I went to see Orlov The door was opened to me by a stout old fellow with red whiskers and no moustache who looked like a German Polya who was tidying the drawing room did not recognise me but Orlov knew me at once Ah mister Revolutionist he said looking at me with curiosity and laughing What fate has brought you He was not changed in the least the same well groomed unpleasant face the same irony And a new book was lying on the table just as of old with an ivory paper knife thrust in it He had evidently been reading before I came in He made me sit down offered me a cigar and with a delicacy only found in well bred people concealing the unpleasant feeling aroused by my face and my wasted figure observed casually that I was not in the least changed and that he would have known me anywhere in spite of my having grown a beard We talked of the weather of Paris To dispose as quickly as possible of the oppressive inevitable question which weighed upon him and me he asked Zinaida Fyodorovna is dead Yes I answered In childbirth Yes in childbirth The doctor suspected another cause of death but it is more comforting for you and for me to think that she died in childbirth He sighed decorously and was silent The angel of silence passed over us as they say Yes And here everything is as it used to be no changes he said briskly seeing that I was looking about the room My father as you know has left the service and is living in retirement I am still in the same department Do you remember Pekarsky He is just the same as ever Gruzin died of diphtheria a year ago Kukushkin is alive and often speaks of you By the way said Orlov dropping his eyes with an air of reserve when Kukushkin heard who you were he began telling every one you had attacked him and tried to murder him and that he only just escaped with his life I did not speak Old servants do not forget their masters It s very nice of you said Orlov jocosely Will you have some wine and some coffee though I will tell them to make some No thank you I have come to see you about a very important matter Georgy Ivanitch I am not very fond of important matters but I shall be glad to be of service to you What do you want You see I began growing agitated I have here with me Zinaida Fyodorovna s daughter Hitherto I have brought her up but as you see before many days I shall be an empty sound I should like to die with the thought that she is provided for Orlov coloured a little frowned a little and took a cursory and sullen glance at me He was unpleasantly affected not so much by the important matter as by my words about death about becoming an empty sound Yes it must be thought about he said screening his eyes as though from the sun Thank you You say it s a girl Yes a girl A wonderful child Yes Of course it s not a lap dog but a human being I understand we must consider it seriously I am prepared to do my part and am very grateful to you He got up walked about biting his nails and stopped before a picture We must think about it he said in a hollow voice standing with his back to me I shall go to Pekarsky s to day and will ask him to go to Krasnovsky s I don t think he will make much ado about consenting to take the child But excuse me I don t see what Krasnovsky has got to do with it I said also getting up and walking to a picture at the other end of the room But she bears his name of course said Orlov Yes he may be legally obliged to accept the child I don t know but I came to you Georgy Ivanitch not to discuss the legal aspect Yes yes you are right he agreed briskly I believe I am talking nonsense But don t excite yourself We will decide the matter to our mutual satisfaction If one thing won t do we ll try another and if that won t do we ll try a third one way or another this delicate question shall be settled Pekarsky will arrange it all Be so good as to leave me your address and I will let you know at once what we decide Where are you living Orlov wrote down my address sighed and said with a smile Oh Lord what a job it is to be the father of a little daughter But Pekarsky will arrange it all He is a sensible man Did you stay long in Paris Two months We were silent Orlov was evidently afraid I should begin talking of the child again and to turn my attention in another direction said You have probably forgotten your letter by now But I have kept it I understand your mood at the time and I must own I respect that letter Damnable cold blood Asiatic coarse laugh that was charming and characteristic he went on with an ironical smile And the fundamental thought is perhaps near the truth though one might dispute the question endlessly That is he hesitated not dispute the thought itself but your attitude to the question your temperament so to say Yes my life is abnormal corrupted of no use to any one and what prevents me from beginning a new life is cowardice there you are quite right But that you take it so much to heart are troubled and reduced to despair by it that s irrational there you are quite wrong A living man cannot help being troubled and reduced to despair when he sees that he himself is going to ruin and others are going to ruin round him Who doubts it I am not advocating indifference all I ask for is an objective attitude to life The more objective the less danger of falling into error One must look into the root of things and try to see in every phenomenon a cause of all the other causes We have grown feeble slack degraded in fact Our generation is entirely composed of neurasthenics and whimperers we do nothing but talk of fatigue and exhaustion But the fault is neither yours nor mine we are of too little consequence to affect the destiny of a whole generation We must suppose for that larger more general causes with a solid raison d etre from the biological point of view We are neurasthenics flabby renegades but perhaps it s necessary and of service for generations that will come after us Not one hair falls from the head without the will of the Heavenly Father in other words nothing happens by chance in Nature and in human environment Everything has its cause and is inevitable And if so why should we worry and write despairing letters That s all very well I said thinking a little I believe it will be easier and clearer for the generations to come our experience will be at their service But one wants to live apart from future generations and not only for their sake Life is only given us once and one wants to live it boldly with full consciousness and beauty One wants to play a striking independent noble part one wants to make history so that those generations may not have the right to say of each of us that we were nonentities or worse I believe what is going on about us is inevitable and not without a purpose but what have I to do with that inevitability Why should my ego be lost Well there s no help for it sighed Orlov getting up and as it were giving me to understand that our conversation was over I took my hat We ve only been sitting here half an hour and how many questions we have settled when you come to think of it said Orlov seeing me into the hall So I will see to that matter I will see Pekarsky to day Don t be uneasy He stood waiting while I put on my coat and was obviously relieved at the feeling that I was going away Georgy Ivanitch give me back my letter I said Certainly He went to his study and a minute later returned with the letter I thanked him and went away The next day I got a letter from him He congratulated me on the satisfactory settlement of the question Pekarsky knew a lady he wrote who kept a school something like a kindergarten where she took quite little children The lady could be entirely depended upon but before concluding anything with her it would be as well to discuss the matter with Krasnovsky it was a matter of form He advised me to see Pekarsky at once and to take the birth certificate with me if I had it Rest assured of the sincere respect and devotion of your humble servant I read this letter and Sonya sat on the table and gazed at me attentively without blinking as though she knew her fate was being decided THE HUSBAND IN the course of the maneuvres the N cavalry regiment halted for a night at the district town of K Such an event as the visit of officers always has the most exciting and inspiring effect on the inhabitants of provincial towns The shopkeepers dream of getting rid of the rusty sausages and best brand sardines that have been lying for ten years on their shelves the inns and restaurants keep open all night the Military Commandant his secretary and the local garrison put on their best uniforms the police flit to and fro like mad while the effect on the ladies is beyond all description The ladies of K hearing the regiment approaching forsook their pans of boiling jam and ran into the street Forgetting their morning deshabille and general untidiness they rushed breathless with excitement to meet the regiment and listened greedily to the band playing the march Looking at their pale ecstatic faces one might have thought those strains came from some heavenly choir rather than from a military brass band
667_107247_000004_000000	train-clean-360	 The regiment they cried joyfully 
none	none	The regiment is coming What could this unknown regiment that came by chance to day and would depart at dawn to morrow mean to them Afterwards when the officers were standing in the middle of the square and with their hands behind them discussing the question of billets all the ladies were gathered together at the examining magistrate s and vying with one another in their criticisms of the regiment They already knew goodness knows how that the colonel was married but not living with his wife that the senior officer s wife had a baby born dead every year that the adjutant was hopelessly in love with some countess and had even once attempted suicide 
667_107247_000006_000002	train-clean-360	They knew everything 
none	none	When a pock marked soldier in a red shirt darted past the windows they knew for certain that it was Lieutenant Rymzov s orderly running about the town trying to get some English bitter ale on tick for his master They had only caught a passing glimpse of the officers backs but had already decided that there was not one handsome or interesting man among them 
667_107247_000006_000005	train-clean-360	Having talked to their hearts content they sent for the Military Commandant and the committee of the club and instructed them at all costs to make arrangements for a dance 
667_107247_000007_000000	train-clean-360	Their wishes were carried out 
none	none	At nine o clock in the evening the military band was playing in the street before the club while in the club itself the officers were dancing with the ladies of K The ladies felt as though they were on wings Intoxicated by the dancing the music and the clank of spurs they threw themselves heart and soul into making the acquaintance of their new partners and quite forgot their old civilian friends Their fathers and husbands forced temporarily into the background crowded round the meagre refreshment table in the entrance hall All these government cashiers secretaries clerks and superintendents stale sickly looking clumsy figures were perfectly well aware of their inferiority They did not even enter the ball room but contented themselves with watching their wives and daughters in the distance dancing with the accomplished and graceful officers 
667_107247_000008_000000	train-clean-360	Among the husbands was Shalikov the tax collector a narrow spiteful soul given to drink with a big closely cropped head and thick protruding lips 
none	none	He had had a university education there had been a time when he used to read progressive literature and sing students songs but now as he said of himself he was a tax collector and nothing more He stood leaning against the doorpost his eyes fixed on his wife Anna Pavlovna a little brunette of thirty with a long nose and a pointed chin Tightly laced with her face carefully powdered she danced without pausing for breath danced till she was ready to drop exhausted But though she was exhausted in body her spirit was inexhaustible One could see as she danced that her thoughts were with the past that faraway past when she used to dance at the College for Young Ladies dreaming of a life of luxury and gaiety and never doubting that her husband was to be a prince or at the worst a baron 
667_107247_000010_000000	train-clean-360	The tax collector watched scowling with spite 
none	none	It was not jealousy he was feeling 
667_107247_000011_000001	train-clean-360	He was ill humoured first because the room was taken up with dancing and there was nowhere he could play a game of cards secondly because he could not endure the sound of wind instruments and thirdly because he fancied the officers treated the civilians somewhat too casually and disdainfully 
none	none	But what above everything revolted him and moved him to indignation was the expression of happiness on his wife s face
667_107247_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 It makes me sick to look at her he muttered 
none	none	Going on for forty and nothing to boast of at any time and she must powder her face and lace herself up And frizzing her hair Flirting and making faces and fancying she s doing the thing in style Ugh you re a pretty figure upon my soul Anna Pavlovna was so lost in the dance that she did not once glance at her husband
667_107247_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 Of course not 
667_107247_000014_000001	train-clean-360	Where do we poor country bumpkins come in sneered the tax collector 
667_107247_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 We are at a discount now 
667_107247_000015_000001	train-clean-360	We re clumsy seals unpolished provincial bears and she s the queen of the ball 
none	none	She has kept enough of her looks to please even officers They d not object to making love to her I dare say 
667_107247_000016_000000	train-clean-360	During the mazurka the tax collector s face twitched with spite 
none	none	A black haired officer with prominent eyes and Tartar cheekbones danced the mazurka with Anna Pavlovna Assuming a stern expression he worked his legs with gravity and feeling and so crooked his knees that he looked like a jack a dandy pulled by strings while Anna Pavlovna pale and thrilled bending her figure languidly and turning her eyes up tried to look as though she scarcely touched the floor and evidently felt herself that she was not on earth not at the local club but somewhere far far away in the clouds Not only her face but her whole figure was expressive of beatitude 
667_107247_000016_000004	train-clean-360	The tax collector could endure it no longer he felt a desire to jeer at that beatitude to make Anna Pavlovna feel that she had forgotten herself that life was by no means so delightful as she fancied now in her excitement 
667_107247_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 You wait I ll teach you to smile so blissfully he muttered 
none	none	You are not a boarding school miss you are not a girl 
667_107247_000017_000002	train-clean-360	An old fright ought to realise she is a fright 
none	none	Petty feelings of envy vexation wounded vanity of that small provincial misanthropy engendered in petty officials by vodka and a sedentary life swarmed in his heart like mice 
667_107247_000018_000001	train-clean-360	Waiting for the end of the mazurka he went into the hall and walked up to his wife 
none	none	Anna Pavlovna was sitting with her partner and flirting her fan and coquettishly dropping her eyelids was describing how she used to dance in Petersburg her lips were pursed up like a rosebud and she pronounced at home in Puetuersburg
667_107247_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 Anyuta let us go home croaked the tax collector 
667_107247_000020_000000	train-clean-360	Seeing her husband standing before her Anna Pavlovna started as though recalling the fact that she had a husband then she flushed all over she felt ashamed that she had such a sickly looking ill humoured ordinary husband 
none	none	Let us go home repeated the tax collector Why It s quite early
667_107247_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 I beg you to come home said the tax collector deliberately with a spiteful expression 
none	none	Why Has anything happened Anna Pavlovna asked in a flutter Nothing has happened but I wish you to go home at once 
667_107247_000025_000001	train-clean-360	I wish it that s enough and without further talk please 
none	none	Anna Pavlovna was not afraid of her husband but she felt ashamed on account of her partner who was looking at her husband with surprise and amusement She got up and moved a little apart with her husband What notion is this she began Why go home Why it s not eleven o clock
667_107247_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 I wish it and that s enough 
667_107247_000028_000001	train-clean-360	Come along and that s all about it 
none	none	Don t be silly Go home alone if you want to
667_107247_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 All right then I shall make a scene 
none	none	The tax collector saw the look of beatitude gradually vanish from his wife s face saw how ashamed and miserable she was and he felt a little happier
667_107247_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 Why do you want me at once asked his wife 
667_107247_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t want you but I wish you to be at home 
667_107247_000033_000001	train-clean-360	I wish it that s all 
none	none	At first Anna Pavlovna refused to hear of it then she began entreating her husband to let her stay just another half hour then without knowing why she began to apologise to protest and all in a whisper with a smile that the spectators might not suspect that she was having a tiff with her husband 
667_107247_000034_000001	train-clean-360	She began assuring him she would not stay long only another ten minutes only five minutes but the tax collector stuck obstinately to his point 
667_107247_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 Stay if you like he said but I ll make a scene if you do 
667_107247_000036_000000	train-clean-360	And as she talked to her husband Anna Pavlovna looked thinner older plainer 
none	none	Pale biting her lips and almost crying she went out to the entry and began putting on her things
667_107247_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 You are not going asked the ladies in surprise 
none	none	Anna Pavlovna you are not going dear
667_107247_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 Her head aches said the tax collector for his wife 
none	none	Coming out of the club the husband and wife walked all the way home in silence 
667_107247_000039_000001	train-clean-360	The tax collector walked behind his wife and watching her downcast sorrowful humiliated little figure he recalled the look of beatitude which had so irritated him at the club and the consciousness that the beatitude was gone filled his soul with triumph 
none	none	He was pleased and satisfied and at the same time he felt the lack of something he would have liked to go back to the club and make every one feel dreary and miserable so that all might know how stale and worthless life is when you walk along the streets in the dark and hear the slush of the mud under your feet and when you know that you will wake up next morning with nothing to look forward to but vodka and cards 
667_107247_000039_000003	train-clean-360	Oh how awful it is 
667_107247_000040_000000	train-clean-360	And Anna Pavlovna could scarcely walk 
667_107247_000040_000001	train-clean-360	She was still under the influence of the dancing the music the talk the lights and the noise she asked herself as she walked along why God had thus afflicted her 
667_107247_000040_000002	train-clean-360	She felt miserable insulted and choking with hate as she listened to her husband s heavy footsteps 
none	none	She was silent trying to think of the most offensive biting and venomous word she could hurl at her husband and at the same time she was fully aware that no word could penetrate her tax collector s hide What did he care for words Her bitterest enemy could not have contrived for her a more helpless position 
667_107247_000041_000000	train-clean-360	And meanwhile the band was playing and the darkness was full of the most rousing intoxicating dance tunes
