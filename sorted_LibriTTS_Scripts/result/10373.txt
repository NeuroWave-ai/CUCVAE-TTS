231_127936_000007_000004	train-clean-360	then 
none	none	gone to press There was nothing for him recently promoted to a sub editorship to do after he had passed the column for which he was responsible as a matter of fact he could have gone home before the machines began their clatter But he generally hung about trifling until two o clock came On this occasion the morning of the twenty second of June nineteen twelve he stopped longer than usual chatting with Hacket who had charge of the foreign news and who began telling him about a telegram which had just come through from Durazzo What Hacket had to tell was interesting Spargo lingered to hear all about it and to discuss it Altogether it was well beyond half past two when he went out of the office unconsciously puffing away from him as he reached the threshold the last breath of the atmosphere in which he had spent his midnight In Fleet Street the air was fresh almost to sweetness and the first grey of the coming dawn was breaking faintly around the high silence of saint Paul s Spargo lived in Bloomsbury on the west side of Russell Square Every night and every morning he walked to and from the Watchman office by the same route Southampton Row Kingsway the Strand Fleet Street He came to know several faces especially amongst the police he formed the habit of exchanging greetings with various officers whom he encountered at regular points as he went slowly homewards smoking his pipe And on this morning as he drew near to Middle Temple Lane he saw a policeman whom he knew one Driscoll standing at the entrance looking about him Further away another policeman appeared sauntering Driscoll raised an arm and signalled then turning he saw Spargo He moved a step or two towards him Spargo saw news in his face What is it asked Spargo Driscoll jerked a thumb over his shoulder towards the partly open door of the lane Within Spargo saw a man hastily donning a waistcoat and jacket He says answered Driscoll him there the porter that there s a man lying in one of them entries down the lane and he thinks he s dead Likewise he thinks he s murdered Spargo echoed the word But what makes him think that he asked peeping with curiosity beyond Driscoll s burly form Why He says there s blood about him answered Driscoll He turned and glanced at the oncoming constable and then turned again to Spargo You re a newspaper man sir he suggested I am replied Spargo You d better walk down with us said Driscoll with a grin There ll be something to write pieces in the paper about At least there may be Spargo made no answer He continued to look down the lane wondering what secret it held until the other policeman came up At the same moment the porter now fully clothed came out Come on he said shortly I ll show you Driscoll murmured a word or two to the newly arrived constable and then turned to the porter How came you to find him then he asked The porter jerked his head at the door which they were leaving I heard that door slam he replied irritably as if the fact which he mentioned caused him offence I know I did So I got up to look around Then well I saw that He raised a hand pointing down the lane The three men followed his outstretched finger And Spargo then saw a man s foot booted grey socked protruding from an entry on the left hand Sticking out there just as you see it now said the porter I ain t touched it And so He paused and made a grimace as if at the memory of some unpleasant thing Driscoll nodded comprehendingly And so you went along and looked he suggested Just so just to see who it belonged to as it might be Just to see what there was to see agreed the porter Then I saw there was blood And then well I made up the lane to tell one of you chaps Best thing you could have done said Driscoll Well now then The little procession came to a halt at the entry The entry was a cold and formal thing of itself not a nice place to lie dead in having glazed white tiles for its walls and concrete for its flooring something about its appearance in that grey morning air suggested to Spargo the idea of a mortuary And that the man whose foot projected over the step was dead he had no doubt the limpness of his pose certified to it For a moment none of the four men moved or spoke The two policemen unconsciously stuck their thumbs in their belts and made play with their fingers the porter rubbed his chin thoughtfully Spargo remembered afterwards the rasping sound of this action he himself put his hands in his pockets and began to jingle his money and his keys Each man had his own thoughts as he contemplated the piece of human wreckage which lay before him You ll notice suddenly observed Driscoll speaking in a hushed voice You ll notice that he s lying there in a queer way same as if as if he d been put there Sort of propped up against that wall at first and had slid down like Spargo was taking in all the details with a professional eye He saw at his feet the body of an elderly man the face was turned away from him crushed in against the glaze of the wall but he judged the man to be elderly because of grey hair and whitening whisker it was clothed in a good well made suit of grey check cloth tweed and the boots were good so too was the linen cuff which projected from the sleeve that hung so limply One leg was half doubled under the body the other was stretched straight out across the threshold the trunk was twisted to the wall Over the white glaze of the tiles against which it and the shoulder towards which it had sunk were crushed there were gouts and stains of blood And Driscoll taking a hand out of his belt pointed a finger at them Seems to me he said slowly seems to me as how he s been struck down from behind as he came out of here That blood s from his nose gushed out as he fell What do you say Jim The other policeman coughed Better get the inspector here he said And the doctor and the ambulance Dead ain t he Driscoll bent down and put a thumb on the hand which lay on the pavement As ever they make em he remarked laconically And stiff too Well hurry up Jim Spargo waited until the inspector arrived waited until the hand ambulance came More policemen came with it they moved the body for transference to the mortuary and Spargo then saw the dead man s face He looked long and steadily at it while the police arranged the limbs wondering all the time who it was that he gazed at how he came to that end what was the object of his murderer and many other things There was some professionalism in Spargo s curiosity but there was also a natural dislike that a fellow being should have been so unceremoniously smitten out of the world There was nothing very remarkable about the dead man s face It was that of a man of apparently sixty to sixty five years of age plain even homely of feature clean shaven except for a fringe of white whisker trimmed after an old fashioned pattern between the ear and the point of the jaw The only remarkable thing about it was that it was much lined and seamed the wrinkles were many and deep around the corners of the lips and the angles of the eyes this man you would have said to yourself has led a hard life and weathered storm mental as well as physical Driscoll nudged Spargo with a turn of his elbow He gave him a wink Better come down to the dead house he muttered confidentially Why asked Spargo They ll go through him whispered Driscoll Search him d ye see Then you ll get to know all about him and so on Help to write that piece in the paper eh Spargo hesitated He had had a stiff night s work and until his encounter with Driscoll he had cherished warm anticipation of the meal which would be laid out for him at his rooms and of the bed into which he would subsequently tumble Besides a telephone message would send a man from the Watchman to the mortuary This sort of thing was not in his line now now You ll be for getting one o them big play cards out with something about a mystery on it suggested Driscoll You never know what lies at the bottom o these affairs no more you don t That last observation decided Spargo moreover the old instinct for getting news began to assert itself

none	none	he said I ll go along with you And re lighting his pipe he followed the little cortege through the streets still deserted and quiet and as he walked behind he reflected on the unobtrusive fashion in which murder could stalk about Here was the work of murder no doubt and it was being quietly carried along a principal London thoroughfare without fuss or noise by officials to whom the dealing with it was all a matter of routine Surely My opinion said a voice at Spargo s elbow my opinion is that it was done elsewhere Not there He was put there That s what I say Spargo turned and saw that the porter was at his side He too was accompanying the body Oh said Spargo You think I think he was struck down elsewhere and carried there said the porter In somebody s chambers maybe I ve known of some queer games in our bit of London Well he never came in at my lodge last night I ll stand to that And
231_127936_000003_000001	train-clean-360	 who is he 
none	none	I should like to know From what I see of him not the sort to be about our place That s what we shall hear presently said Spargo They re going to search him But Spargo was presently made aware that the searchers had found nothing The police surgeon said that the dead man had without doubt been struck down from behind by a terrible blow which had fractured the skull and caused death almost instantaneously In Driscoll s opinion the murder had been committed for the sake of plunder For there was nothing whatever on the body It was reasonable to suppose that a man who is well dressed would possess a watch and chain and have money in his pockets and possibly rings on his fingers But there was nothing valuable to be found in fact there was nothing at all to be found that could lead to identification no letters no papers nothing It was plain that whoever had struck the dead man down had subsequently stripped him of whatever was on him The only clue to possible identity lay in the fact that a soft cap of grey cloth appeared to have been newly purchased at a fashionable shop in the West End Spargo went home there seemed to be nothing to stop for He ate his food and he went to bed only to do poor things in the way of sleeping He was not the sort to be impressed by horrors but he recognized at last that the morning s event had destroyed his chance of rest he accordingly rose took a cold bath drank a cup of coffee and went out He was not sure of any particular idea when he strolled away from Bloomsbury but it did not surprise him when half an hour later he found that he had walked down to the police station near which the unknown man s body lay in the mortuary And there he met Driscoll just going off duty Driscoll grinned at sight of him You re in luck he said Tisn t five minutes since they found a bit of grey writing paper crumpled up in the poor man s waistcoat pocket it had slipped into a crack Come in and you ll see it Spargo went into the inspector s office In another minute he found himself staring at the scrap of paper There was nothing on it but an address scrawled in pencil Ronald Breton Barrister King s Bench Walk Temple London CHAPTER TWO HIS FIRST BRIEF Spargo looked up at the inspector with a 
231_127936_000031_000003	train-clean-360	quick 
none	none	jerk of his head I know this man he said The inspector showed new interest What mister Breton he asked Yes I m on the Watchman you know sub editor I took an article from him the other day article on Ideal Sites for Campers Out He came to the office about it So this was in the dead man s pocket Found in a hole in his pocket I understand I wasn t present myself It s not much but it may afford some clue to identity Spargo picked up the scrap of grey paper and looked closely at it It seemed to him to be the sort of paper that is found in hotels and in clubs it had been torn roughly from the sheet What he asked meditatively what will you do about getting this man identified The inspector shrugged his shoulders Oh usual thing I suppose There ll be publicity you know I suppose you ll be doing a special account yourself for your paper eh Then there ll be the others And we shall put out the usual notice Somebody will come forward to identify sure to And A man came into the office a stolid faced quiet mannered soberly attired person who might have been a respectable tradesman out for a stroll and who gave the inspector a sidelong nod as he approached his desk at the same time extending his hand towards the scrap of paper which Spargo had just laid down I ll go along to King s Bench Walk and see mister Breton he observed looking at his watch It s just about ten I daresay he ll be there now I m going there too remarked Spargo but as if speaking to himself Yes I ll go there The newcomer glanced at Spargo and then at the inspector The inspector nodded at Spargo Journalist he said mister Spargo of the Watchman mister Spargo was there when the body was found And he knows mister Breton Then he nodded from Spargo to the stolid faced person This is Detective Sergeant Rathbury from the Yard he said to Spargo He s come to take charge of this case Oh said Spargo blankly I see what he went on with sudden abruptness what shall you do about Breton Get him to come and look at the body replied Rathbury He may know the man and he mayn t Anyway his name and address are here aren t they Come along said Spargo I ll walk there with you Spargo remained in a species of brown study all the way along Tudor Street his companion also maintained silence in a fashion which showed that he was by nature and custom a man of few words It was not until the two were climbing the old balustrated staircase of the house in King s Bench Walk in which Ronald Breton s chambers were somewhere situate that Spargo spoke Do you think that old chap was killed for what he may have had on him he asked suddenly turning on the detective I should like to know what he had on him before I answered that question mister Spargo replied Rathbury with a smile Yes said Spargo dreamily I suppose so He might have had nothing on him eh The detective laughed and pointed to a board on which names were printed We don t know anything yet sir he observed except that mister Breton is on the fourth floor By which I conclude that it isn t long since he was eating his dinner Oh he s young he s quite young said Spargo I should say he s about four and twenty I ve met him only At that moment the unmistakable sounds of girlish laughter came down the staircase Two girls seemed to be laughing presently masculine laughter mingled with the lighter feminine Seems to be studying law in very pleasant fashion up here anyway said Rathbury mister Breton s chambers too And the door s open The outer oak door of Ronald Breton s chambers stood thrown wide the inner one was well ajar through the opening thus made Spargo and the detective obtained a full view of the interior of mister Ronald Breton s rooms There against a background of law books bundles of papers tied up with pink tape and black framed pictures of famous legal notabilities they saw a pretty vivacious eyed girl who perched on a chair wigged and gowned and flourishing a mass of crisp paper was haranguing an imaginary judge and jury to the amusement of a young man who had his back to the door and of another girl who leant confidentially against his shoulder I put it to you gentlemen of the jury I put it to you with confidence feeling that you

none	none	be must necessarily be some perhaps brothers perhaps husbands and fathers can you on your consciences do my client the great wrong the irreparable injury the the Think of some more adjectives exclaimed the young man Hot and strong uns pile em up That s what they like they Hullo This exclamation arose from the fact that at this point of the proceedings the detective rapped at the inner door and then put his head round its edge Whereupon the young lady who was orating from the chair jumped hastily down the other young lady withdrew from the young man s protecting arm there was a feminine giggle and a feminine swishing of skirts and a hasty bolt into an inner room and mister Ronald Breton came forward blushing a little to greet the interrupter Come in come in he exclaimed hastily I Then he paused catching sight of Spargo and held out his hand with a look of surprise Oh mister Spargo he said How do you do we I we were just having a lark I m off to court in a few minutes What can I do for you mister Spargo He had backed to the inner door as he spoke and he now closed it and turned again to the two men looking from one to the other The detective on his part was looking at the young barrister He saw a tall slimly built youth of handsome features and engaging presence perfectly groomed and immaculately garbed and having upon him a general air of well to do ness and he formed the impression from these matters that mister Breton was one of those fortunate young men who may take up a profession but are certainly not dependent upon it He turned and glanced at the journalist How do you do said Spargo slowly I the fact is I came here with mister Rathbury He wants to see you Detective Sergeant Rathbury of New Scotland Yard Spargo pronounced this formal introduction as if he were repeating a lesson But he was watching the young barrister s face And Breton turned to the detective with a look of surprise Oh he said You wish Rathbury had been fumbling in his pocket for the scrap of grey paper which he had carefully bestowed in a much worn memorandum book I wished to ask a question mister Breton he said This morning about a quarter to three a man elderly man was found dead in Middle Temple Lane and there seems little doubt that he was murdered mister Spargo here he was present when the body was found Soon after corrected Spargo A few minutes after When this body was examined at the mortuary continued Rathbury in his matter of fact business like tones nothing was found that could lead to identification The man appears to have been robbed There was nothing whatever on him but this bit of torn paper which was found in a hole in the lining of his waistcoat pocket It s got your name and address on it mister Breton See Ronald Breton took the scrap of paper and looked at it with knitted brows By Jove he muttered So it has that s queer What s he like this man Rathbury glanced at a clock which stood on the mantelpiece Will you step round and take a look at him mister Breton he said It s close by Well I the fact is I ve got a case on in mister Justice Borrow s court Breton answered also glancing at his clock But it won t be called until after eleven Will Plenty of time sir said Rathbury it won t take you ten minutes to go round and back again a look will do You don t recognize this handwriting I suppose Breton still held the scrap of paper in his fingers He looked at it again intently No he answered I don t I don t know it at all I can t think of course who this man could be to have my name and address I thought he might have been some country solicitor wanting my professional services you know he went on with a shy smile at Spargo but three three o clock in the morning eh The doctor observed Rathbury the doctor thinks he had been dead about two and a half hours Breton turned to the inner door I ll I ll just tell these ladies I m going out for a quarter of an hour he said They re going over to the court with me I got my first brief yesterday he went on with a boyish laugh glancing right and left at his visitors It s nothing much small case but I promised my fiancee and her sister that they should be present you know A moment He disappeared into the next room and came back a moment later in all the glory of a new silk hat Spargo a young man who was never very particular about his dress began to contrast his own attire with the butterfly appearance of this youngster he had been quick to notice that the two girls who had whisked into the inner room had been similarly garbed in fine raiment more characteristic of Mayfair than of Fleet Street Already he felt a strange curiosity about Breton and about the young ladies whom he heard talking behind the inner door Well come on said Breton Let s go straight there The mortuary to which Rathbury led the way was cold drab repellent to the general gay sense of the summer morning Spargo shivered involuntarily as he entered it and took a first glance around But the young barrister showed no sign of feeling or concern he looked quickly about him and stepped alertly to the side of the dead man from whose face the detective was turning back a cloth He looked steadily and earnestly at the fixed features Then he drew back shaking his head No he said with decision Don t know him don t know him from Adam Never set eyes on him in my life that I know of Rathbury replaced the cloth I didn t suppose you would he remarked Well I expect we must go on the usual lines Somebody ll identify him You say he was murdered said Breton Is that certain Rathbury jerked his thumb at the corpse The back of his skull is smashed in he said laconically The doctor says he must have been struck down from behind and a fearful blow too I m much obliged to you mister Breton Oh all right said Breton Well you know where to find me if you want me I shall be curious about this Good bye good bye mister Spargo The young barrister hurried away and Rathbury turned to the journalist I didn t expect anything from that he remarked However it was a thing to be done You are going to write about this for your paper Spargo nodded Well continued Rathbury I ve sent a man to Fiskie s the hatter s where that cap came from you know We may get a bit of information from that quarter it s possible If you like to meet me here at twelve o clock I ll tell you anything I ve heard Just now I m going to get some breakfast I ll meet you here said Spargo at twelve o clock He watched Rathbury go away round one corner he himself suddenly set off round another He went to the Watchman office wrote a few lines which he enclosed in an envelope for the day editor and went out again Somehow or other his feet led him up Fleet Street and before he quite realized what he was doing he found himself turning into the Law Courts CHAPTER THREE THE CLUE OF THE CAP Having no clear conception of what had led him to these scenes of litigation Spargo went wandering aimlessly about in the great hall and the adjacent corridors until an official who took him to be lost asked him if there was any particular part of the building he wanted For a moment Spargo stared at the man as if he did not comprehend his question Then his mental powers reasserted themselves Isn t mister Justice Borrow sitting in one of the courts this morning he suddenly asked Number seven replied the official What s your case when s it down I haven t got a case said Spargo I m a pressman reporter you know The official stuck out a finger Round the corner first to your right second on the left he said automatically You ll find plenty of room nothing much doing there this morning He turned away and Spargo recommenced his apparently aimless perambulation of the dreary depressing corridors Upon my honour he muttered Upon my honour I really don t know what I ve come up here for I ve no business here Just then he turned a corner and came face to face with Ronald Breton The young barrister was now in his wig and gown and carried a bundle of papers tied up with pink tape he was escorting two young ladies who were laughing and chattering as they tripped along at his side And Spargo glancing at them meditatively instinctively told himself which of them it was that he and Rathbury had overheard as she made her burlesque speech it was not the elder one who walked by Ronald Breton with something of an air of proprietorship but the younger the girl with the laughing eyes and the vivacious smile and it suddenly dawned upon him that somewhere deep within him there had been a notion a hope of seeing this girl again why he could not then think Spargo thus coming face to face with these three mechanically lifted his hat Breton stopped half inquisitive His eyes seemed to ask a question Yes said Spargo I the fact is I remembered that you said you were coming up here and I came after you I want when you ve time to have a talk to ask you a few questions About this affair of the dead man you know Breton nodded He tapped Spargo on the arm 
231_127936_000018_000004	train-clean-360	Look here 
none	none	he said When this case of mine is over I can give you as much time as you like Can you wait a bit Yes Well I say do me a favour I was taking these ladies round to the gallery round there and up the stairs and I m a bit pressed for time I ve a solicitor waiting for me You take them there s a good fellow then when the case is over bring them down here and you and I will talk Here I ll introduce you all no ceremony Miss Aylmore Miss Jessie Aylmore mister Spargo of the Watchman Now I m off Breton turned on the instant his gown whisked round a corner and Spargo found himself staring at two smiling girls He saw then that both were pretty and attractive and that one seemed to be the elder by some three or four years That is very cool of Ronald observed the elder young lady Perhaps his scheme doesn t fit in with yours mister Spargo Pray don t Oh it s all right said Spargo feeling himself uncommonly stupid I ve nothing to do But where did mister Breton say you wished to be taken Into the gallery of number seven court said the younger girl promptly Round this corner I think I know the way Spargo still marvelling at the rapidity with which affairs were moving that morning bestirred himself to act as cicerone and presently led the two young ladies to the very front of one of those public galleries from which idlers and specially interested spectators may see and hear the proceedings which obtain in the badly ventilated ill lighted tanks wherein justice is dispensed at the Law Courts There was no one else in that gallery the attendant in the corridor outside seemed to be vastly amazed that any one should wish to enter it and he presently opened the door beckoned to Spargo and came half way down the stairs to meet him Nothing much going on here this morning he whispered behind a raised hand But there s a nice breach case in number five get you three good seats there if you like Spargo declined this tempting offer and went back to his charges He had decided by that time that Miss Aylmore was about twenty three and her sister about eighteen he also thought that young Breton was a lucky dog to be in possession of such a charming future wife and an equally charming sister in law And he dropped into a seat at Miss Jessie Aylmore s side and looked around him as if he were much awed by his surroundings I suppose one can talk until the judge enters he whispered Is this really mister Breton s first case His very first all on his own responsibility any way replied Spargo s companion smiling And he s very nervous and so s my sister Aren t you now Evelyn Evelyn Aylmore looked at Spargo and smiled quietly I suppose one s always nervous about first appearances she said However I think Ronald s got plenty of confidence and as he says it s not much of a case it isn t even a jury case I m afraid you ll find it dull mister Spargo it s only something about a promissory note Oh I m all right thank you replied Spargo unconsciously falling back on a favourite formula I always like to hear lawyers they manage to say such a lot about about About nothing said Jessie Aylmore But there so do gentlemen who write for the papers don t they Spargo was about to admit that there was a good deal to be said on that point when Miss Aylmore suddenly drew her sister s attention to a man who had just entered the well of the court Look Jessie she observed There s mister Elphick Spargo looked down at the person indicated an elderly large faced smooth shaven man a little inclined to stoutness who wigged and gowned was slowly making his way to a corner seat just outside that charmed inner sanctum wherein only King s Counsel are permitted to sit He dropped into this in a fashion which showed that he was one of those men who loved personal comfort he bestowed his plump person at the most convenient angle and fitting a monocle in his right eye glanced around him There were a few of his professional brethren in his vicinity there were half a dozen solicitors and their clerks in conversation with one or other of them there were court officials But the gentleman of the monocle swept all these with an indifferent look and cast his eyes upward until he caught sight of the two girls Thereupon he made a most gracious bow in their direction his broad face beamed in a genial smile and he waved a white hand Do you know mister Elphick mister Spargo enquired the younger Miss Aylmore I rather think I ve seen him somewhere about the Temple answered Spargo In fact I m sure I have His chambers are in Paper Buildings said Jessie Sometimes he gives tea parties in them He is Ronald s guardian and preceptor and mentor and all that and I suppose he s dropped into this court to hear how his pupil goes on Here is Ronald whispered Miss Aylmore And here said her sister is his lordship looking very cross Now mister Spargo you re in for it Spargo to tell the truth paid little attention to what went on beneath him The case which young Breton presently opened was a commercial one involving certain rights and properties in a promissory note it seemed to the journalist that Breton dealt with it very well showing himself master of the financial details and speaking with readiness and assurance He was much more interested in his companions and especially in the younger one and he was meditating on how he could improve his further acquaintance when he awoke to the fact that the defence realizing that it stood no chance had agreed to withdraw and that mister Justice Borrow was already giving judgment in Ronald Breton s favour In another minute he was walking out of the gallery in rear of the two sisters Very good very good indeed he said absent mindedly I thought he put his facts very clearly and concisely Downstairs in the corridor Ronald Breton was talking to mister Elphick He pointed a finger at Spargo as the latter came up with the girls Spargo gathered that Breton was speaking of the murder and of his Spargo s connection with it And directly they approached he spoke This is mister Spargo sub editor of the Watchman Breton said mister Elphick mister Spargo I was just telling mister Elphick Spargo that you saw this poor man soon after he was found Spargo glancing at mister Elphick saw that he was deeply interested The elderly barrister took him literally by the button hole My dear sir he said You saw this poor fellow Lying dead in the third entry down Middle Temple Lane The third entry eh Yes replied Spargo simply I saw him It was the third entry Singular said mister Elphick musingly I know a man who lives in that house In fact I visited him last night and did not leave until nearly midnight And this unfortunate man had mister Ronald Breton s name and address in his pocket Spargo nodded He looked at Breton and pulled out his watch Just then he had no idea of playing the part of informant to mister Elphick Yes that s so he answered shortly Then looking at Breton significantly he added If you can give me those few minutes now Yes yes responded Ronald Breton nodding I understand Evelyn I ll leave you and Jessie to mister Elphick I must go mister Elphick seized Spargo once more My dear sir he said eagerly Do you do you think I could possibly see the body It s at the mortuary answered Spargo I don t know what their regulations are Then he escaped with Breton They had crossed Fleet Street and were in the quieter shades of the Temple before Spargo spoke About what I wanted to say to you he said at last It was this I well I ve always wanted as a journalist to have a real big murder case I think this is one I want to go right into it thoroughly first and last And I think you can help me How do you know that it is a murder case asked Breton quietly It s a murder case answered Spargo stolidly I feel it Instinct perhaps I m going to ferret out the truth And it seems to me He paused and gave his companion a sharp glance It seems to me he presently continued that the clue lies in that scrap of paper That paper and that man are connecting links between you and somebody else Possibly agreed Breton You want to find the somebody else I want you to help me to find the somebody else answered Spargo I believe this is a big very big affair I want to do it I don t believe in police methods much By the by I m just going to meet Rathbury He may have heard of something Would you like to come Breton ran into his chambers in King s Bench Walk left his gown and wig and walked round with Spargo to the police office Rathbury came out as they were stepping in Oh he said Ah I ve got what may be helpful mister Spargo I told you I d sent a man to Fiskie s the hatter Well he s just returned The cap which the dead man was wearing was bought at Fiskie s yesterday afternoon and it was sent to mister Marbury Room twenty at the Anglo Orient Hotel Where is that asked Spargo Waterloo district answered Rathbury A small house I believe Well I m going there Are you coming Yes replied Spargo Of course And mister Breton wants to come too If I m not in the way said Breton Rathbury laughed Well we may find out something about this scrap of paper he observed And he waved a signal to the nearest taxi cab driver CHAPTER FOUR THE ANGLO ORIENT HOTEL The house at which Spargo and his companions presently drew up was an old fashioned place in the immediate vicinity of Waterloo Railway Station a plain fronted four square erection essentially mid Victorian in appearance and suggestive somehow of the very early days of railway travelling Anything more in contrast with the modern ideas of a hotel it would have been difficult to find in London and Ronald Breton said so as he and the others crossed the pavement And yet a good many people used to favour this place on their way to and from Southampton in the old days remarked Rathbury And I daresay that old travellers coming back from the East after a good many years absence still rush in here You see it s close to the station and travellers have a knack of walking into the nearest place when they ve a few thousand miles of steamboat and railway train behind them Look there now They had crossed the threshold as the detective spoke and as they entered a square heavily furnished hall he made a sidelong motion of his head towards a bar on the left wherein stood or lounged a number of men who from their general appearance their slouched hats and their bronzed faces appeared to be Colonials or at any rate to have spent a good part of their time beneath Oriental skies There was a murmur of tongues that had a Colonial accent in it an aroma of tobacco that suggested Sumatra and Trichinopoly and Rathbury wagged his head sagely Lay you anything the dead man was a Colonial mister Spargo he remarked Well now I suppose that s the landlord and landlady There was an office facing them at the rear of the hall and a man and woman were regarding them from a box window which opened above a ledge on which lay a register book They were middle aged folk the man a fleshy round faced somewhat pompous looking individual who might at some time have been a butler the woman a tall spare figured thin featured sharp eyed person who examined the newcomers with an enquiring gaze Rathbury went up to them with easy confidence You the landlord of this house sir he asked mister Walters Just so and missus Walters I presume The landlord made a stiff bow and looked sharply at his questioner What can I do for you sir he enquired A little matter of business mister Walters replied Rathbury pulling out a card You ll see there who I am Detective Sergeant Rathbury of the Yard This is mister Frank Spargo a newspaper man this is mister Ronald Breton a barrister The landlady hearing their names and description pointed to a side door and signed Rathbury and his companions to pass through Obeying her pointed finger they found themselves in a small private parlour Walters closed the two doors which led into it and looked at his principal visitor What is it mister Rathbury he enquired Anything wrong We want a bit of information answered Rathbury almost with indifference Did anybody of the name of Marbury put up here yesterday elderly man grey hair fresh complexion missus Walters started glancing at her husband There she exclaimed I knew some enquiry would be made Yes a mister Marbury took a room here yesterday morning just after the noon train got in from Southampton Number twenty he took But he didn t use it last night He went out very late and he never came back Rathbury nodded Answering a sign from the landlord he took a chair and sitting down looked at missus Walters What made you think some enquiry would be made ma am he asked Had you noticed anything missus Walters seemed a little confused by this direct question Her husband gave vent to a species of growl Nothing to notice he muttered Her way of speaking that s all Well why I said that was this said the landlady He happened to tell us did mister Marbury that he hadn t been in London for over twenty years and couldn t remember anything about it him he said never having known much about London at any time And of course when he went out so late and never came back why naturally I thought something had happened to him and that there d be enquiries made Just so just so said Rathbury So you would ma am so you would Well something has happened to him He s dead What s more there s strong reason to think he was murdered mister and missus Walters received this announcement with proper surprise and horror and the landlord suggested a little refreshment to his visitors Spargo and Breton declined on the ground that they had work to do during the afternoon Rathbury accepted it evidently as a matter of course My respects he said lifting his glass Well now perhaps you ll just tell me what you know of this man I may as well tell you mister and missus Walters that he was found dead in Middle Temple Lane this morning at a quarter to three that there wasn t anything on him but his clothes and a scrap of paper which bore this gentleman s name and address that this gentleman knows nothing whatever of him and that I traced him here because he bought a cap at a West End hatter s yesterday and had it sent to your hotel Yes said missus Walters quickly that s so And he went out in that cap last night Well we don t know much about him As I said he came in here about a quarter past twelve yesterday morning and booked Number twenty He had a porter with him that brought a trunk and a bag they re in twenty now of course He told me that he had stayed at this house over twenty years ago on his way to Australia that of course was long before we took it And he signed his name in the book as John Marbury We ll look at that if you please said Rathbury Walters fetched in the register and turned the leaf to the previous day s entries They all bent over the dead man s writing John Marbury Coolumbidgee New South Wales said Rathbury Ah now I was wondering if that writing would be the same as that on the scrap of paper mister Breton But you see it isn t it s quite different Quite different said Breton He too was regarding the handwriting with great interest And Rathbury noticed his keen inspection of it and asked another question Ever seen that writing before he suggested Never answered Breton And yet there s something very familiar about it Then the probability is that you have seen it before remarked Rathbury Well now we ll hear a little more about Marbury s doings here Just tell me all you know mister and missus Walters My wife knows most said Walters I scarcely saw the man I don t remember speaking with him No said missus Walters You didn t you weren t much in his way Well she continued I showed him up to his room He talked a bit said he d just landed at Southampton from Melbourne Did he mention his ship asked Rathbury But if he didn t it doesn t matter for we can find out I believe the name s on his things answered the landlady There are some labels of that sort Well he asked for a chop to be cooked for him at once as he was going out He had his chop and he went out at exactly one o clock saying to me that he expected he d get lost as he didn t know London well at any time and shouldn t know it at all now He went outside there I saw him looked about him and walked off towards Blackfriars way During the afternoon the cap you spoke of came for him from Fiskie s So of course I judged he d been Piccadilly way But he himself never came in until ten o clock And then he brought a gentleman with him Aye said Rathbury A gentleman now Did you see him Just replied the landlady They went straight up to twenty and I just caught a mere glimpse of the gentleman as they turned up the stairs A tall well built gentleman with a grey beard very well dressed as far as I could see with a top hat and a white silk muffler round his throat and carrying an umbrella And they went to Marbury s room said Rathbury What then Well then mister Marbury rang for some whiskey and soda continued missus Walters He was particular to have a decanter of whiskey that and a syphon of soda were taken up there I heard nothing more until nearly midnight then the hall porter told me that the gentleman in twenty had gone out and had asked him if there was a night porter as of course there is He went out at half past eleven And the other gentleman asked Rathbury The other gentleman answered the landlady went out with him The hall porter said they turned towards the station And that was the last anybody in this house saw of mister Marbury He certainly never came back That observed Rathbury with a quiet smile that is quite certain ma am Well I suppose we d better see this Number twenty room and have a look at what he left there Everything said missus Walters is just as he left it Nothing s been touched It seemed to two of the visitors that there was little to touch On the dressing table lay a few ordinary articles of toilet none of them of any quality or value the dead man had evidently been satisfied with the plain necessities of life An overcoat hung from a peg Rathbury without ceremony went through its pockets just as unceremoniously he proceeded to examine trunk and bag and finding both unlocked he laid out on the bed every article they contained and examined each separately and carefully And he found nothing whereby he could gather any clue to the dead owner s identity There you are he said making an end of his task You see it s just the same with these things as with the clothes he had on him There are no papers there s nothing to tell who he was what he was after where he d come from though that we may find out in other ways But it s not often that a man travels without some clue to his identity Beyond the fact that some of this linen was you see bought in Melbourne we know nothing of him Yet he must have had papers and money on him Did you see anything of his money now ma am he asked suddenly turning to missus Walters Did he pull out his purse in your presence now Yes answered the landlady with promptitude He came into the bar for a drink after he d been up to his room He pulled out a handful of gold when he paid for it a whole handful There must have been some thirty to forty sovereigns and half sovereigns And he hadn t a penny piece on him when found muttered Rathbury I noticed another thing too remarked the landlady He was wearing a very fine gold watch and chain and had a splendid ring on his left hand little finger gold with a big diamond in it Yes said the detective thoughtfully I noticed that he d worn a ring and that it had been a bit tight for him Well now there s only one thing to ask about Did your chambermaid notice if he left any torn paper around tore any letters up or anything like that But the chambermaid produced had not noticed anything of the sort on the contrary the gentleman of Number twenty had left his room very tidy indeed So Rathbury intimated that he had no more to ask and nothing further to say just then and he bade the landlord and landlady of the Anglo Orient Hotel good morning and went away followed by the two young men What next asked Spargo as they gained the street The next thing answered Rathbury is to find the man with whom Marbury left this hotel last night And how s that to be done asked Spargo At present replied Rathbury I don t know And with a careless nod he walked off apparently desirous of being alone CHAPTER FIVE SPARGO WISHES TO SPECIALIZE The barrister and the journalist left thus unceremoniously on a crowded pavement looked at each other Breton laughed We don t seem to have gained much information he remarked I m about as wise as ever No wiser said Spargo At any rate I am I know now that this dead man called himself John Marbury that he came from Australia that he only landed at Southampton yesterday morning and that he was in the company last night of a man whom we have had described to us a tall grey bearded well dressed man presumably a gentleman Breton shrugged his shoulders I should say that description would fit a hundred thousand men in London he remarked Exactly so it would answered Spargo But we know that it was one of the hundred thousand or half million if you like The thing is to find that one the one And you think you can do it I think I m going to have a big try at it Breton shrugged his shoulders again What by going up to every man who answers the description and saying Sir are you the man who accompanied John Marbury to the Aglo Spargo suddenly interrupted him Look here he said Didn t you say that you knew a man who lives in that block in the entry of which Marbury was found No I didn t answered Breton It was mister Elphick who said that All the same I do know that man he s mister Cardlestone another barrister He and mister Elphick are friends they re both enthusiastic philatelists stamp collectors you know and I dare say mister Elphick was round there last night examining something new Cardlestone s got hold of Why I d like to go round there and make some enquiries replied Spargo If you d be kind enough to Oh I ll go with you responded Breton with alacrity I m just as keen about this business as you are Spargo I want to know who this man Marbury is and how he came to have my name and address on him Now if I had been a well known man in my profession you know why Yes said Spargo as they got into a cab yes that would have explained a lot It seems to me that we ll get at the murderer through that scrap of paper a lot quicker than through Rathbury s line Yes that s what I think Breton looked at his companion with interest But you don t know what Rathbury s line is he remarked Yes I do said Spargo Rathbury s gone off to discover who the man is with whom Marbury left the Anglo Orient Hotel last night That s his line And you want I want to find out the full significance of that bit of paper and who wrote it answered Spargo I want to know why that old man was coming to you when he was murdered Breton started By Jove he exclaimed I I never thought of that You you really think he was coming to me when he was struck down Certain Hadn t he got an address in the Temple Wasn t he in the Temple Of course he was trying to find you But the late hour No matter How else can you explain his presence in the Temple I think he was asking his way That s why I want to make some enquiries in this block It appeared to Spargo that a considerable number of people chiefly of the office boy variety were desirous of making enquiries about the dead man Being luncheon hour that bit of Middle Temple Lane where the body was found was thick with the inquisitive and the sensation seeker for the news of the murder had spread and though there was nothing to see but the bare stones on which the body had lain there were more open mouths and staring eyes around the entry than Spargo had seen for many a day And the nuisance had become so great that the occupants of the adjacent chambers had sent for a policeman to move the curious away and when Spargo and his companion presented themselves at the entry this policeman was being lectured as to his duties by a little weazen faced gentleman in very snuffy and old fashioned garments and an ancient silk hat who was obviously greatly exercised by the unwonted commotion Drive them all out into the street exclaimed this personage Drive them all away constable into Fleet Street or upon the Embankment anywhere so long as you rid this place of them This is a disgrace and an inconvenience a nuisance a That s old Cardlestone whispered Breton He s always irascible and I don t suppose we ll get anything out of him mister Cardlestone he continued making his way up to the old gentleman who was now retreating up the stone steps brandishing an umbrella as ancient as himself I was just coming to see you sir This is mister Spargo a journalist who is much interested in this murder He I know nothing about the murder my dear sir exclaimed mister Cardlestone And I never talk to journalists a pack of busybodies sir saving your presence I am not aware that any murder has been committed and I object to my doorway being filled by a pack of office boys and street loungers Murder indeed I suppose the man fell down these steps and broke his neck drunk most likely He opened his outer door as he spoke and Breton with a reassuring smile and a nod at Spargo followed him into his chambers on the first landing motioning the journalist to keep at their heels mister Elphick tells me that he was with you until a late hour last evening mister Cardlestone he said Of course neither of you heard anything suspicious What should we hear that was suspicious in the Temple sir demanded mister Cardlestone angrily I hope the Temple is free from that sort of thing young mister Breton Your respected guardian and myself had a quiet evening on our usual peaceful pursuits and when he went away all was as quiet as the grave sir What may have gone on in the chambers above and around me I know not Fortunately our walls are thick sir substantial I say sir the man probably fell down and broke his neck What he was doing here I do not presume to say Well it s guess you know mister Cardlestone remarked Breton again winking at Spargo But all that was found on this man was a scrap of paper on which my name and address were written That s practically all that was known of him except that he d just arrived from Australia mister Cardlestone suddenly turned on the young barrister with a sharp acute glance Eh he exclaimed What s this You say this man had your name and address on him young Breton yours And that he came from Australia That s so answered Breton That s all that s known mister Cardlestone put aside his umbrella produced a bandanna handkerchief of strong colours and blew his nose in a reflective fashion That s a mysterious thing he observed Um does Elphick know all that Breton looked at Spargo as if he was asking him for an explanation of mister Cardlestone s altered manner And Spargo took up the conversation No he said All that mister Elphick knows is that mister Ronald Breton s name and address were on the scrap of paper found on the body mister Elphick here Spargo paused and looked at Breton mister Elphick he presently continued slowly transferring his glance to the old barrister spoke of going to view the body Ah exclaimed mister Cardlestone eagerly It can be seen Then I ll go and see it Where is it Breton started But my dear sir he said Why mister Cardlestone picked up his umbrella again I feel a proper curiosity about a mystery which occurs at my very door he said Also I have known more than one man who went to Australia This might I say might young gentlemen might be a man I had once known Show me where this body is Breton looked helplessly at Spargo it was plain that he did not understand the turn that things were taking But Spargo was quick to seize an opportunity In another minute he was conducting mister Cardlestone through the ins and outs of the Temple towards Blackfriars And as they turned into Tudor Street they encountered mister Elphick I am going to the mortuary he remarked So I suppose are you Cardlestone Has anything more been discovered young man Spargo tried a chance shot at what he did not know The man s name was Marbury he said He was from Australia He was keeping a keen eye on mister Elphick but he failed to see that mister Elphick showed any of the surprise which mister Cardlestone had exhibited Rather he seemed indifferent Oh he said Marbury And from Australia Well I should like to see the body Spargo and Breton had to wait outside the mortuary while the two elder gentlemen went in There was nothing to be learnt from either when they reappeared We don t know the man said mister Elphick calmly As mister Cardlestone I understand has said to you already we have known men who went to Australia and as this man was evidently wandering about the Temple we thought it might have been one of them come back But we don t recognize him Couldn t recognize him said mister Cardlestone No They went away together arm in arm and Breton looked at Spargo As if anybody on earth ever fancied they d recognize him he said Well what are you going to do now Spargo I must go Spargo who had been digging his walking stick into a crack in the pavement came out of a fit of abstraction I he said Oh I m going to the office And he turned abruptly away and walking straight off to the editorial rooms at the Watchman made for one in which sat the official guardian of the editor Try to get me a few minutes with the chief he said The private secretary looked up Really important he asked Big answered Spargo Fix it Once closeted with the great man whose idiosyncrasies he knew pretty well by that time Spargo lost no time You ve heard about this murder in Middle Temple Lane he suggested The mere facts replied the editor tersely I was there when the body was found continued Spargo and gave a brief resume of his doings I m certain this is a most unusual affair he went on It s as full of mystery as as it could be I want to give my attention to it I want to specialize on it I can make such a story of it as we haven t had for some time ages Let me have it And to start with let me have two columns for tomorrow morning I ll make it big The editor looked across his desk at Spargo s eager face Your other work he said Well in hand replied Spargo I m ahead a whole week both articles and reviews I can tackle both The editor put his finger tips together Have you got some idea about this young man he asked I ve got a great idea answered Spargo He faced the great man squarely and stared at him until he had brought a smile to the editorial face That s why I want to do it he added And it s not mere boasting nor over confidence I know I shall do it better than anybody else The editor considered matters for a brief moment You mean to find out who killed this man he said at last Spargo nodded his head twice I ll find that out he said doggedly The editor picked up a pencil and bent to his desk All right he said Go ahead You shall have your two columns Spargo went quietly away to his own nook and corner He got hold of a block of paper and began to write He was going to show how to do things CHAPTER SIX WITNESS TO A MEETING Ronald Breton walked into the Watchman office and into Spargo s room next morning holding a copy of the current issue in his hand He waved it at Spargo with an enthusiasm which was almost boyish I say he exclaimed That s the way to do it Spargo I congratulate you Yes that s the way certain Spargo idly turning over a pile of exchanges yawned What way he asked indifferently The way you ve written this thing up said Breton It s a hundred thousand times better than the usual cut and dried account of a murder It s it s like a a romance Merely a new method of giving news said Spargo He picked up a copy of the Watchman and glanced at his two columns which had somehow managed to make themselves into three viewing the displayed lettering the photograph of the dead man the line drawing of the entry in Middle Temple Lane and the facsimile of the scrap of grey paper with a critical eye Yes merely a new method he continued The question is will it achieve its object What s the object asked Breton Spargo fished out a box of cigarettes from an untidy drawer pushed it over to his visitor helped himself and tilting back his chair put his feet on his desk The object he said drily Oh well the object is the ultimate detection of the murderer You re after that I m after that just that And not not simply out to make effective news I m out to find the murderer of John Marbury said Spargo deliberately slow in his speech And I ll find him Well there doesn t seem to be much in the way of clues so far remarked Breton I see nothing Do you Spargo sent a spiral of scented smoke into the air I want to know an awful lot he said I m hungering for news I want to know who John Marbury is I want to know what he did with himself between the time when he walked out of the Anglo Orient Hotel alive and well and the time when he was found in Middle Temple Lane with his skull beaten in and dead I want to know where he got that scrap of paper Above everything Breton I want to know what he d got to do with you He gave the young barrister a keen look and Breton nodded Yes he said I confess that s a corker But I think
231_127936_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 Well said Spargo 
none	none	I think he may have been a man who had some legal business in hand or in prospect and had been recommended to me said Breton Spargo smiled a little sardonically That s good he said You had your very first brief yesterday Come your fame isn t blown abroad through all the heights yet my friend Besides don t intending clients approach isn t it strict etiquette for them to approach barristers through solicitors Quite right in both your remarks replied Breton good humouredly Of course I m not known a bit but all the same I ve known several cases where a barrister has been approached in the first instance and asked to recommend a solicitor Somebody who wanted to do me a good turn may have given this man my address Possible said Spargo But he wouldn t have come to consult you at midnight Breton the more I think of it the more I m certain there s a tremendous mystery in this affair That s why I got the chief to let me write it up as I have done here I m hoping that this photograph though to be sure it s of a dead face and this facsimile of the scrap of paper will lead to somebody coming forward who can Just then one of the uniformed youths who hang about the marble pillared vestibule of the Watchman office came into the room with the unmistakable look and air of one who carries news of moment I dare lay a sovereign to a cent that I know what this is muttered Spargo in an aside Well he said to the boy What is it The messenger came up to the desk mister Spargo he said there s a man downstairs who says that he wants to see somebody about that murder case that s in the paper this morning sir mister Barrett said I was to come to you Who is the man asked Spargo Won t say sir replied the boy I gave him a form to fill up but he said he wouldn t write anything said all he wanted was to see the man who wrote the piece in the paper Bring him here commanded Spargo He turned to Breton when the boy had gone and he smiled I knew we should have somebody here sooner or later he said That s why I hurried over my breakfast and came down at ten o clock Now then what will you bet on the chances of this chap s information proving valuable Nothing replied Breton He s probably some crank or faddist who s got some theory that he wants to ventilate The man who was presently ushered in by the messenger seemed from preliminary and outward appearance to justify Breton s prognostication He was obviously a countryman a tall loosely built middle aged man yellow of hair blue of eye who was wearing his Sunday best array of pearl grey trousers and black coat and sported a necktie in which were several distinct colours Oppressed with the splendour and grandeur of the Watchman building he had removed his hard billycock hat as he followed the boy and he ducked his bared head at the two young men as he stepped on to the thick pile of the carpet which made luxurious footing in Spargo s room His blue eyes opened to their widest looked round him in astonishment at the sumptuousness of modern newspaper office accommodation How do you do sir said Spargo pointing a finger to one of the easy chairs for which the Watchman office is famous I understand that you wish to see me The caller ducked his yellow head again sat down on the edge of the chair put his hat on the floor picked it up again and endeavoured to hang it on his knee and looked at Spargo innocently and shyly What I want to see sir he observed in a rustic accent is the gentleman as wrote that piece in your newspaper about this here murder in Middle Temple Lane You see him said Spargo I am that man The caller smiled generously Indeed sir he said A very nice bit of reading I m sure And what might your name be now sir I can always talk free er to a man when I know what his name is So can I answered Spargo My name is Spargo Frank Spargo What s yours Name of Webster sir William Webster I farm at One Ash Farm at Gosberton in Oakshire Me and my wife continued mister Webster again smiling and distributing his smile between both his hearers is at present in London on a holiday And very pleasant we find it weather and all That s right said Spargo And you wanted to see me about this murder mister Webster I did sir Me I believe knowing as I think something that ll do for you to put in your paper You see mister Spargo it come about in this fashion happen you ll be for me to tell it in my own way That answered Spargo is precisely what I desire Well to be sure I couldn t tell it in no other declared mister Webster You see sir I read your paper this morning while I was waiting for my breakfast they take their breakfasts so late in them hotels and when I d read it and looked at the pictures I says to my wife As soon as I ve had my breakfast I says I m going to where they print this newspaper to tell em something Aye she says Why what have you to tell I should like to know just like that mister Spargo missus Webster said Spargo is a lady of businesslike principles And what have you to tell mister Webster looked into the crown of his hat looked out of it and smiled knowingly Well sir he continued Last night my wife she went out to a part they call Clapham to take her tea and supper with an old friend of hers as lives there and as they wanted to have a bit of woman talk like I didn t go So thinks I to myself I ll go and see this here House of Commons There was a neighbour of mine as had told me that all you d got to do was to tell the policeman at the door that you wanted to see your own Member of Parliament So when I got there I told em that I wanted to see our M P mister Stonewood you ll have heard tell of him no doubt he knows me very well and they passed me and I wrote out a ticket for him and they told me to sit down while they found him So I sat down in a grand sort of hall where there were a rare lot of people going and coming and some fine pictures and images to look at and for a time I looked at them and then I began to take a bit of notice of the folk near at hand waiting you know like myself And as sure as I m a christened man sir the gentleman whose picture you ve got in your paper him as was murdered was sitting next to me I knew that picture as soon as I saw it this morning Spargo who had been making unmeaning scribbles on a block of paper suddenly looked at his visitor What time was that he asked It was between a quarter and half past nine sir answered mister Webster It might ha been twenty past it might ha been twenty five past Go on if you please said Spargo Well sir me and this here dead gentleman talked a bit About what a long time it took to get a member to attend to you and such like I made mention of the fact that I hadn t been in there before Neither have I he says I came in out of curiosity he says and then he laughed sir queer like And it was just after that that what I m going to tell you about happened Tell commanded Spargo Well sir there was a gentleman came along down this grand hall that we were sitting in a tall handsome gentleman with a grey beard He d no hat on and he was carrying a lot of paper and documents in his hand so I thought he was happen one of the members And all of a sudden this here man at my side he jumps up with a sort of start and an exclamation and Spargo lifted his hand He looked keenly at his visitor Now you re absolutely sure about what you heard him exclaim he asked Quite sure about it Because I see you are going to tell us what he did exclaim I ll tell you naught but what I m certain of sir replied Webster What he said as he jumped up was Good God he says sharp like and then he said a name and I didn t right catch it but it sounded like Danesworth or Painesworth or something of that sort one of them there or very like em at any rate And then he rushed up to this here gentleman and laid his hand on his arm sudden like And the gentleman asked Spargo quietly Well he seemed taken aback sir He jumped Then he stared at the man Then they shook hands And then after they d spoken a few words together like they walked off talking And of course I never saw no more of em But when I saw your paper this morning sir and that picture in it I said to myself That s the man I sat next to in that there hall at the House of Commons Oh there s no doubt of it sir And supposing you saw a photograph of the tall gentleman with the grey beard suggested Spargo Could you recognize him from that Make no doubt of it sir answered mister Webster I observed him particular Spargo rose and going over to a cabinet took from it a thick volume the leaves of which he turned over for several minutes Come here if you please mister Webster he said The farmer went across the room There is a full set of photographs of members of the present House of Commons here said Spargo Now pick out the one you saw Take your time and be sure He left his caller turning over the album and went back to Breton There he whispered Getting nearer a bit nearer eh To what asked Breton I don t see A sudden exclamation from the farmer interrupted Breton s remark This is him sir answered mister Webster That s the gentleman know him anywhere The two young men crossed the room The farmer was pointing a stubby finger to a photograph beneath which was written Stephen Aylmore esquire M P for Brookminster CHAPTER SEVEN mister AYLMORE Spargo keenly observant and watchful felt rather than saw Breton start he himself preserved an imperturbable equanimity He gave a mere glance at the photograph to which mister Webster was pointing Oh he said That he That s the gentleman sir replied Webster Done to the life that is No difficulty in recognizing of that mister Spargo You re absolutely sure demanded Spargo There are a lot of men in the House of Commons you know who wear beards and many of the beards are grey But Webster wagged his head That s him sir he repeated I m as sure of that as I am that my name s William Webster That s the man I saw talking to him whose picture you ve got in your paper Can t say no more sir Very good said Spargo I m much obliged to you I ll see mister Aylmore Leave me your address in London mister Webster How long do you remain in town My address is the Beachcroft Hotel Bloomsbury sir and I shall be there for another week answered the farmer Hope I ve been of some use mister Spargo As I says to my wife Spargo cut his visitor short in polite fashion and bowed him out He turned to Breton who still stood staring at the album of portraits There what did I tell you he said Didn t I say I should get some news There it is Breton nodded his head He seemed thoughtful Yes he agreed Yes I say Spargo Well mister Aylmore is my prospective father in law you know Quite aware of it Didn t you introduce me to his daughters only yesterday But how did you know they were his daughters Spargo laughed as he sat down to his desk Instinct intuition he answered However never mind that just now Well I ve found something out Marbury if that is the dead man s real name and anyway it s all we know him by was in the company of mister Aylmore that night Good What are you going to do about it asked Breton Do See mister Aylmore of course He was turning over the leaves of a telephone address book one hand had already picked up the mouthpiece of the instrument on his desk Look here said Breton I know where mister Aylmore is always to be found at twelve o clock At the A and P the Atlantic and Pacific Club you know in saint James s If you like I ll go with you Spargo glanced at the clock and laid down the telephone All right he said Eleven o clock now I ve something to do I ll meet you outside the A and P at exactly noon I ll be there agreed Breton He made for the door and with his hand on it turned What do you expect from from what we ve just heard he asked Spargo shrugged his shoulders Wait until we hear what mister Aylmore has to say he answered I suppose this man Marbury was some old acquaintance Breton closed the door and went away left alone Spargo began to mutter to himself Good God he says Dainsworth Painsworth something of that sort one of the two Excellent that our farmer friend should have so much observation Ah and why should mister Stephen Aylmore be recognized as Dainsworth or Painsworth or something of that sort Now who is mister Stephen Aylmore beyond being what I know him to be Spargo s fingers went instinctively to one of a number of books of reference which stood on his desk they turned with practised swiftness to a page over which his eye ran just as swiftly He read aloud AYLMORE STEPHEN M P for Brookminster since nineteen ten Residences twenty three saint Osythe Court Kensington Buena Vista Great Marlow Member Atlantic and Pacific and City Venturers Clubs Interested in South American enterprise Um muttered Spargo putting the book away That s not very illuminating However we ve got one move finished Now we ll make another Going over to the album of photographs Spargo deftly removed that of mister Aylmore put it in an envelope and the envelope in his pocket and leaving the office hailed a taxi cab and ordered its driver to take him to the Anglo Orient Hotel This was the something to do of which he had spoken to Breton Spargo wanted to do it alone missus Walters was in her low windowed office when Spargo entered the hall she recognized him at once and motioned him into her parlour I remember you said missus Walters you came with the detective mister Rathbury Have you seen him since asked Spargo Not since replied missus Walters No and I was wondering if he d be coming round because She paused there and looked at Spargo with particular enquiry You re a friend of his aren t you she asked I suppose you know as much as he does about this He and I replied Spargo with easy confidence are working this case together You can tell me anything you d tell him The landlady rummaged in her pocket and produced an old purse from an inner compartment of which she brought out a small object wrapped in tissue paper Well she said unwrapping the paper we found this in Number twenty this morning it was lying under the dressing table The girl that found it brought it to me and I thought it was a bit of glass but Walters he says as how he shouldn t be surprised if it s a diamond And since we found it the waiter who took the whisky up to twenty after mister Marbury came in with the other gentleman has told me that when he went into the room the two gentlemen were looking at a paper full of things like this So there Spargo fingered the shining bit of stone That s a diamond right enough he said Put it away missus Walters I shall see Rathbury presently and I ll tell him about it Now that other gentleman You told us you saw him Could you recognize him I mean a photograph of him Is this the man Spargo knew from the expression of missus Walters face that she had no more doubt than Webster had Oh yes she said That s the gentleman who came in with mister Marbury I should have known him in a thousand Anybody would recognize him from that perhaps you d let our hall porter and the waiter I mentioned just now look at it I ll see them separately and see if they ve ever seen a man who resembles this replied Spargo The two men recognized the photograph at once without any prompting and Spargo after a word or two with the landlady rode off to the Atlantic and Pacific Club and found Ronald Breton awaiting him on the steps He made no reference to his recent doings and together they went into the house and asked for mister Aylmore Spargo looked with more than uncommon interest at the man who presently came to them in the visitors room He was already familiar with mister Aylmore s photograph but he never remembered seeing him in real life the Member for Brookminster was one of that rapidly diminishing body of legislators whose members are disposed to work quietly and unobtrusively doing yeoman service on committees obeying every behest of the party whips without forcing themselves into the limelight or seizing every opportunity to air their opinions Now that Spargo met him in the flesh he proved to be pretty much what the journalist had expected a rather cold mannered self contained man who looked as if he had been brought up in a school of rigid repression and taught not to waste words He showed no more than the merest of languid interests in Spargo when Breton introduced him and his face was quite expressionless when Spargo brought to an end his brief explanation purposely shortened of his object in calling upon him Yes he said indifferently Yes it is quite true that I met Marbury and spent a little time with him on the evening your informant spoke of I met him as he told you in the lobby of the House I was much surprised to meet him I had not seen him for I really don t know how many years He paused and looked at Spargo as if he was wondering what he ought or not to say to a newspaper man Spargo remained silent waiting And presently mister Aylmore went on I read your account in the Watchman this morning he said I was wondering when you called just now if I would communicate with you or with the police The fact is I suppose you want this for your paper eh he continued after a sudden breaking off I shall not print anything that you wish me not to print answered Spargo If you care to give me any information Oh well said mister Aylmore I don t mind The fact is I knew next to nothing Marbury was a man with whom I had some well business relations of a sort a great many years ago It must be twenty years perhaps more since I lost sight of him When he came up to me in the lobby the other night I had to make an effort of memory to recall him He wished me having once met me to give him some advice and as there was little doing in the House that night and as he had once been almost a friend I walked to his hotel with him chatting He told me that he had only landed from Australia that morning and what he wanted my advice about principally was diamonds Australian diamonds I was unaware remarked Spargo that diamonds were ever found in Australia mister Aylmore smiled a little cynically Perhaps so he said But diamonds have been found in Australia from time to time ever since Australia was known to Europeans and in the opinion of experts they will eventually be found there in quantity Anyhow Marbury had got hold of some Australian diamonds and he showed them to me at his hotel a number of them We examined them in his room What did he do with them afterwards asked Spargo He put them in his waistcoat pocket in a very small wash leather bag from which he had taken them There were in all sixteen or twenty stones not more and they were all small I advised him to see some expert I mentioned Streeter s to him Now I can tell you how he got hold of mister Breton s address The two young men pricked up their ears Spargo unconsciously tightened his hold on the pencil with which he was making notes He got it from me continued mister Aylmore The handwriting on the scrap of paper is mine hurriedly scrawled He wanted legal advice As I knew very little about lawyers I told him that if he called on mister Breton mister Breton would be able to tell him of a first class sharp solicitor I wrote down mister Breton s address for him on a scrap of paper which he tore off a letter that he took from his pocket By the by I observe that when his body was found there was nothing on it in the shape of papers or money I am quite sure that when I left him he had a lot of gold on him those diamonds and a breast pocket full of letters Where did you leave him sir asked Spargo You left the hotel together I believe Yes We strolled along when we left it Having once met we had much to talk of and it was a fine night We walked across Waterloo Bridge and very shortly afterwards he left me And that is really all I know My own impression He paused for a moment and Spargo waited silently My own impression though I confess it may seem to have no very solid grounds is that Marbury was decoyed to where he was found and was robbed and murdered by some person who knew he had valuables on him There is the fact that he was robbed at any rate I ve had a notion said Breton diffidently Mayn t be worth much but I ve had it all the same Some fellow passenger of Marbury s may have tracked him all day Middle Temple Lane s pretty lonely at night you know No one made any comment upon this suggestion and on Spargo looking at mister Aylmore the Member of Parliament rose and glanced at the door Well that s all I can tell you mister Spargo he said You see it s not much after all Of course there ll be an inquest on Marbury and I shall have to re tell it But you re welcome to print what I ve told you Spargo left Breton with his future father in law and went away towards New Scotland Yard He and Rathbury had promised to share news now he had some to communicate CHAPTER EIGHT THE MAN FROM THE SAFE DEPOSIT Spargo found Rathbury sitting alone in a small somewhat dismal apartment which was chiefly remarkable for the business like paucity of its furnishings and its indefinable air of secrecy There was a plain writing table and a hard chair or two a map of London much discoloured on the wall a few faded photographs of eminent bands in the world of crime and a similar number of well thumbed books of reference The detective himself when Spargo was shown in to him was seated at the table chewing an unlighted cigar and engaged in the apparently aimless task of drawing hieroglyphics on scraps of paper He looked up as the journalist entered and held out his hand Well I congratulate you on what you stuck in the Watchman this morning he said Made extra good reading I thought They did right to let you tackle that job Going straight through with it now I suppose mister Spargo Spargo dropped into the chair nearest to Rathbury s right hand He lighted a cigarette and having blown out a whiff of smoke nodded his head in a fashion which indicated that the detective might consider his question answered in the affirmative Look here he said We settled yesterday didn t we that you and I are to consider ourselves partners as it were in this job That s all right he continued as Rathbury nodded very quietly Very well have you made any further progress Rathbury put his thumbs in the armholes of his waistcoat and leaning back in his chair shook his head Frankly I haven t he replied Of course there s a lot being done in the usual official routine way We ve men out making various enquiries We re enquiring about Marbury s voyage to England All that we know up to now is that he was certainly a passenger on a liner which landed at Southampton in accordance with what he told those people at the Anglo Orient that he left the ship in the usual way and was understood to take the train to town as he did That s all There s nothing in that We ve cabled to Melbourne for any news of him from there But I expect little from that All right said Spargo And what are you doing you yourself Because if we re to share facts I must know what my partner s after Just now you seemed to be drawing Rathbury laughed Well to tell you the truth he said when I want to work things out I come into this room it s quiet as you see and I scribble anything on paper while I think I was figuring on my next step and Do you see it asked Spargo quickly Well I want to find the man who went with Marbury to that hotel replied Rathbury It seems to me Spargo wagged his finger at his fellow contriver I ve found him he said That s what I wrote that article for to find him I knew it would find him I ve never had any training in your sort of work but I knew that article would get him And it has got him Rathbury accorded the journalist a look of admiration Good he said And who is he I ll tell you the story answered Spargo and in a summary This morning a man named Webster a farmer a visitor to London came to me at the office and said that being at the House of Commons last night he witnessed a meeting between Marbury and a man who was evidently a Member of Parliament and saw them go away together I showed him an album of photographs of the present members and he immediately recognized the portrait of one of them as the man in question I thereupon took the portrait to the Anglo Orient Hotel missus Walters also at once recognized it as that of the man who came to the hotel with Marbury stopped with him a while in his room and left with him The man is mister Stephen Aylmore the member for Brookminster Rathbury expressed his feelings in a sharp whistle I know him he said Of course I remember missus Walters s description now But his is a familiar type tall grey bearded well dressed Um well we ll have to see mister Aylmore at once I ve seen him said Spargo Naturally For you see missus Walters gave me a bit more evidence This morning they found a loose diamond on the floor of Number twenty and after it was found the waiter who took the drinks up to Marbury and his guest that night remembered that when he entered the room the two gentlemen were looking at a paper full of similar objects So then I went on to see mister Aylmore You know young Breton the barrister you met him with me you remember The young fellow whose name and address were found on Marbury replied Rathbury I remember Breton is engaged to Aylmore s daughter continued Spargo Breton took me to Aylmore s club And Aylmore gives a plain straightforward account of the matter which he s granted me leave to print It clears up a lot of things Aylmore knew Marbury over twenty years ago He lost sight of him They met accidentally in the lobby of the House on the evening preceding the murder Marbury told him that he wanted his advice about those rare things Australian diamonds He went back with him to his hotel and spent a while with him then they walked out together as far as Waterloo Bridge where Aylmore left him and went home Further the scrap of grey paper is accounted for Marbury wanted the address of a smart solicitor Aylmore didn t know of one but told Marbury that if he called on young Breton he d know and would put him in the way to find one Marbury wrote Breton s address down That s Aylmore s story But it s got an important addition Aylmore says that when he left Marbury Marbury had on him a quantity of those diamonds in a wash leather bag a lot of gold and a breast pocket full of letters and papers Now there was nothing on him when he was found dead in Middle Temple Lane Spargo stopped and lighted a fresh cigarette That s all I know he said What do you make of it Rathbury leaned back in his chair in his apparently favourite attitude and stared hard at the dusty ceiling above him Don t know he said It brings things up to a point certainly Aylmore and Marbury parted at Waterloo Bridge very late Waterloo Bridge is pretty well next door to the Temple But how did Marbury get into the Temple unobserved We ve made every enquiry and we can t trace him in any way as regards that movement There s a clue for his going there in the scrap of paper bearing Breton s address but even a Colonial would know that no business was done in the Temple at midnight eh Well said Spargo I ve thought of one or two things He may have been one of those men who like to wander around at night He may have seen he would see plenty of lights in the Temple at that hour he may have slipped in unobserved it s possible it s quite possible I once had a moonlight saunter in the Temple myself after midnight and had no difficulty about walking in and out either But if Marbury was murdered for the sake of what he had on him how did he meet with his murderer or murderers in there Criminals don t hang about Middle Temple Lane The detective shook his head He picked up his pencil and began making more hieroglyphics What s your theory mister Spargo he asked suddenly I suppose you ve got one Have you asked Spargo bluntly Well returned Rathbury hesitatingly I hadn t up to now But now now after what you ve told me I think I can make one It seems to me that after Marbury left Aylmore he probably mooned about by himself that he was decoyed into the Temple and was there murdered and robbed There are a lot of queer ins and outs nooks and corners in that old spot mister Spargo and the murderer if he knew his ground well could easily hide himself until he could get away in the morning He might be a man who had access to chambers or offices think how easy it would be for such a man having once killed and robbed his victim to lie hid for hours afterwards For aught we know the man who murdered Marbury may have been within twenty feet of you when you first saw his dead body that morning Eh Before Spargo could reply to this suggestion an official entered the room and whispered a few words in the detective s ear Show him in at once said Rathbury He turned to Spargo as the man quitted the room and smiled significantly Here s somebody wants to tell something about the Marbury case he remarked Let s hope it ll be news worth hearing Spargo smiled in his queer fashion It strikes me that you ve only got to interest an inquisitive public in order to get news he said The principal thing is to investigate it when you ve got it Who s this now The official had returned with a dapper looking gentleman in a frock coat and silk hat bearing upon him the unmistakable stamp of the city man who inspected Rathbury with deliberation and Spargo with a glance and being seated turned to the detective as undoubtedly the person he desired to converse with I understand that you are the officer in charge of the Marbury murder case he observed I believe I can give you some valuable information in respect to that I read the account of the affair in the Watchman newspaper this morning and saw the portrait of the murdered man there and I was at first inclined to go to the Watchman office with my information but I finally decided to approach the police instead of the Press regarding the police as being more more responsible Much obliged to you sir said Rathbury with a glance at Spargo Whom have I the pleasure of My name replied the visitor drawing out and laying down a card is Myerst mister E P Myerst Secretary of the London and Universal Safe Deposit Company I may I suppose speak with confidence continued mister Myerst with a side glance at Spargo My information is confidential Rathbury inclined his head and put his fingers together You may speak with every confidence mister Myerst he answered If what you have to tell has any real bearing on the Marbury case it will probably have to be repeated in public you know sir But at present it will be treated as private It has a very real bearing on the case I should say replied mister Myerst Yes I should decidedly say so The fact is that on June twenty first at about to be precise three o clock in the afternoon a stranger who gave the name of John Marbury and his present address as the Anglo Orient Hotel Waterloo called at our establishment and asked if he could rent a small safe He explained to me that he desired to deposit in such a safe a small leather box which by the by was of remarkably ancient appearance that he had brought with him I showed him a safe such as he wanted informed him of the rent and of the rules of the place and he engaged the safe paid the rent for one year in advance and deposited his leather box an affair of about a foot square there and then After that having exchanged a remark or two about the altered conditions of London which I understood him to say he had not seen for a great many years he took his key and his departure I think there can be no doubt about this being the mister Marbury who was found murdered None at all I should say mister Myerst said Rathbury And I m much obliged to you for coming here Now you might tell me a little more sir Did Marbury tell you anything about the contents of the box No He merely remarked that he wished the greatest care to be taken of it replied the secretary Didn t give you any hint as to what was in it asked Rathbury None But he was very particular to assure himself that it could not be burnt nor burgled nor otherwise molested replied mister Myerst He appeared to be greatly relieved when he found that it was impossible for anyone but himself to take his property from his safe Ah said Rathbury winking at Spargo So he would no doubt And Marbury himself sir now How did he strike you mister Myerst gravely considered this question mister Marbury struck me he answered at last as a man who had probably seen strange places And before leaving he made what I will term a remarkable remark About in fact about his leather box His leather box said Rathbury And what was it sir This replied the secretary That box he said is safe now But it s been safer It s been buried and deep down too for many and many a year CHAPTER NINE THE DEALER IN RARE STAMPS Buried and deep down too for many and many a year repeated mister Myerst eyeing his companions with keen glances I consider that gentlemen a very remarkable remark very remarkable Rathbury stuck his thumbs in the armholes of his waistcoat again and began swaying backwards and forwards in his chair He looked at Spargo And with his knowledge of men he knew that all Spargo s journalistic instincts had been aroused and that he was keen as mustard to be off on a new scent Remarkable remarkable mister Myerst he assented What do you say mister Spargo Spargo turned slowly and for the first time since Myerst had entered made a careful inspection of him The inspection lasted several seconds then Spargo spoke And what did you say to that he asked quietly Myerst looked from his questioner to Rathbury And Rathbury thought it time to enlighten the caller I may as well tell you mister Myerst he said smilingly that this is mister Spargo of the Watchman mister Spargo wrote the article about the Marbury case of which you spoke when you came in mister Spargo you ll gather is deeply interested in this matter and he and I in our different capacities are working together So you understand Myerst regarded Spargo in a new light And while he was so looking at him Spargo repeated the question he had just put I said What did you say to that Myerst hesitated Well er I don t think I said anything he replied Nothing that one might call material you know Didn t ask him what he meant suggested Spargo Oh no not at all replied Myerst Spargo got up abruptly from his chair Then you missed one of the finest opportunities I ever heard of he said half sneeringly You might have heard such a story He paused as if it were not worth while to continue and turned to Rathbury who was regarding him with amusement Look here Rathbury he said Is it possible to get that box opened It ll have to be opened answered Rathbury rising It s got to be opened It probably contains the clue we want I m going to ask mister Myerst here to go with me just now to take the first steps about having it opened I shall have to get an order We may get the matter through today but at any rate we ll have it done tomorrow morning Can you arrange for me to be present when that comes off asked Spargo You can certain That s all right Rathbury Now I m off and you ll ring me up or come round if you hear anything and I ll do the same by you And without further word Spargo went quickly away and just as quickly returned to the Watchman office There the assistant who had been told off to wait upon his orders during this new crusade met him with a business card This gentleman came in to see you about an hour ago mister Spargo he said He thinks he can tell you something about the Marbury affair and he said that as he couldn t wait perhaps you d step round to his place when you came in Spargo took the card and read mister JAMES CRIEDIR DEALER IN PHILATELIC RARITIES twenty twenty one STRAND Spargo put the card in his waistcoat pocket and went out again wondering why mister James Criedir could not would not or did not call himself a dealer in rare postage stamps and so use plain English He went up Fleet Street and soon found the shop indicated on the card and his first glance at its exterior showed that whatever business might have been done by mister Criedir in the past at that establishment there was to be none done there in the future by him for there were newly printed bills in the window announcing that the place was to let And inside he found a short portly elderly man who was superintending the packing up and removal of the last of his stock He turned a bright enquiring eye on the journalist mister Criedir said Spargo The same sir answered the philatelist You are mister Spargo of the Watchman You called on me mister Criedir opened the door of a tiny apartment at the rear of the very little shop and motioned his caller to enter He followed him in and carefully closed the door Glad to see you mister Spargo he said genially Take a seat sir I m all in confusion here giving up business you see Yes I called on you I think having read the Watchman account of that Marbury affair and having seen the murdered man s photograph in your columns that I can give you a bit of information Material asked Spargo tersely mister Criedir cocked one of his bright eyes at his visitor He coughed drily That s for you to decide when you ve heard it he said I should say considering everything that it was material Well it s this I kept open until yesterday everything as usual you know stock in the window and so on so that anybody who was passing would naturally have thought that the business was going on though as a matter of fact I m retiring retired added mister Criedir with a laugh last night Now but won t you take down what I ve got to tell you I am taking it down answered Spargo Every word In my head mister Criedir laughed and rubbed his hands Oh he said Ah well in my young days journalists used to pull out pencil and notebook at the first opportunity But you modern young men Just so agreed Spargo This information now Well said mister Criedir we ll go on then Yesterday afternoon the man described as Marbury came into my shop He What time exact time asked Spargo Two to the very minute by saint Clement Danes clock answered mister Criedir I d swear twenty affidavits on that point He was precisely as you ve described him dress everything I tell you I knew his photo as soon as I saw it He was carrying a little box What sort of box said Spargo A queer old fashioned much worn leather box a very miniature trunk in fact replied mister Criedir About a foot square the sort of thing you never see nowadays It was very much worn it attracted me for that very reason He set it on the counter and looked at me You re a dealer in stamps rare stamps he said I am I replied I ve something here I d like to show you he said unlocking the box It s Stop a bit said Spargo Where did he take the key from with which he unlocked the box It was one of several which he carried on a split ring and he took the bunch out of his left hand trousers pocket replied mister Criedir Oh I keep my eyes open young gentleman Well he opened his box It seemed to me to be full of papers at any rate there were a lot of legal looking documents on the top tied up with red tape To show you how I notice things I saw that the papers were stained with age and that the red tape was faded to a mere washed out pink Good good murmured Spargo Excellent Proceed sir He put his hand under the topmost papers and drew out an envelope continued mister Criedir From the envelope he produced an exceedingly rare exceedingly valuable set of Colonial stamps the very first ever issued I ve just come from Australia he said I promised a young friend of mine out there to sell these stamps for him in London and as I was passing this way I caught sight of your shop Will you buy em and how much will you give for em Prompt muttered Spargo He seemed to me the sort of man who doesn t waste words agreed mister Criedir Well there was no doubt about the stamps nor about their great value But I had to explain to him that I was retiring from business that very day and did not wish to enter into even a single deal and that therefore I couldn t do anything No matter he says I daresay there are lots of men in your line of trade perhaps you can recommend me to a good firm I could recommend you to a dozen extra good firms I answered But I can do better for you I ll give you the name and address of a private buyer who I haven t the least doubt will be very glad to buy that set from you and will give you a big price Write it down he says and thank you for your trouble So I gave him a bit of advice as to the price he ought to get and I wrote the name and address of the man I referred to on the back of one of my cards Whose name and address asked Spargo mister Nicholas Cardlestone two Pilcox Buildings Middle Temple Lane replied mister Criedir mister Cardlestone is one of the most enthusiastic and accomplished philatelists in Europe And I knew he didn t possess that set of stamps I know mister Cardlestone remarked Spargo It was at the foot of his stairs that Marbury was found murdered Just so said mister Criedir Which makes me think that he was going to see mister Cardlestone when he was set upon murdered and robbed Spargo looked fixedly at the retired stamp dealer What going to see an elderly gentleman in his rooms in the Temple to offer to sell him philatelic rarities at past midnight he said I think not much All right replied mister Criedir You think and argue on modern lines which are of course highly superior But how do you account for my having given Marbury mister Cardlestone s address and for his having been found dead murdered at the foot of Cardlestone s stairs a few hours later I don t account for it said Spargo I m trying to mister Criedir made no comment on this He looked his visitor up and down for a moment gathered some idea of his capabilities and suddenly offered him a cigarette Spargo accepted it with a laconic word of thanks and smoked half way through it before he spoke again Yes he said I m trying to account And I shall account And I m much obliged to you mister Criedir for what you ve told me Now then may I ask you a question or two A thousand responded mister Criedir with great geniality Very well Did Marbury say he d call on Cardlestone He did Said he d call as soon as he could that day Have you told Cardlestone what you ve just told me I have But not until an hour ago on my way back from your office in fact I met him in Fleet Street and told him Had he received a call from Marbury No Never heard of or seen the man At least never heard of him until he heard of the murder He told me he and his friend mister Elphick another philatelist went to see the body wondering if they could recognize it as any man they d ever known but they couldn t I know they did said Spargo I saw em at the mortuary Um Well one more question When Marbury left you did he put those stamps in his box again as before No replied mister Criedir He put them in his right hand breast pocket and he locked up his old box and went off swinging it in his left hand Spargo went away down Fleet Street seeing nobody He muttered to himself and he was still muttering when he got into his room at the office And what he muttered was the same thing repeated over and over again Six hours six hours six hours Those six hours Next morning the Watchman came out with four leaded columns of up to date news about the Marbury Case and right across the top of the four ran a heavy double line of great capitals black and staring WHO SAW JOHN MARBURY BETWEEN three point fifteen P M AND nine point fifteen P M ON THE DAY PRECEDING HIS MURDER CHAPTER TEN THE LEATHER BOX Whether Spargo was sanguine enough to expect that his staring headline would bring him information of the sort he wanted was a secret which he kept to himself That a good many thousands of human beings must have set eyes on John Marbury between the hours which Spargo set forth in that headline was certain the problem was What particular owner or owners of a pair or of many pairs of those eyes would remember him Why should they remember him Walters and his wife had reason to remember him Criedir had reason to remember him so had Myerst so had William Webster But between a quarter past three when he left the London and Universal Safe Deposit and a quarter past nine when he sat down by Webster s side in the lobby of the House of Commons nobody seemed to have any recollection of him except mister Fiskie the hatter and he only remembered him faintly and because Marbury had bought a fashionable cloth cap at his shop At any rate by noon of that day nobody had come forward with any recollection of him He must have gone West from seeing Myerst because he bought his cap at Fiskie s he must eventually have gone South West because he turned up at Westminster But where else did he go What did he do To whom did he speak No answer came to these questions That shows observed young mister Ronald Breton lazing an hour away in Spargo s room at the Watchman at that particular hour which is neither noon nor afternoon wherein even busy men do nothing that shows how a chap can go about London as if he were merely an ant that had strayed into another ant heap than his own Nobody notices You d better go and read up a little elementary entomology Breton said Spargo I don t know much about it myself but I ve a pretty good idea that when an ant walks into the highways and byways of a colony to which he doesn t belong he doesn t survive his intrusion by many seconds Well you know what I mean said Breton London s an ant heap isn t it One human ant more or less doesn t count This man Marbury must have gone about a pretty tidy lot during those six hours He d ride on a bus almost certain He d get into a taxi cab I think that s much more certain because it would be a novelty to him He d want some tea anyway he d be sure to want a drink and he d turn in somewhere to get one or the other He d buy things in shops these Colonials always do He d go somewhere to get his dinner He d but what s the use of enumeration in this case A mere piling up of platitudes answered Spargo What I mean is continued Breton that piles of people must have seen him and yet it s now hours and hours since your paper came out this morning and nobody s come forward to tell anything And when you come to think of it why should they Who d remember an ordinary man in a grey tweed suit An ordinary man in a grey tweed suit repeated Spargo Good line You haven t any copyright in it remember It would make a good cross heading Breton laughed You re a queer chap Spargo he said Seriously do you think you re getting any nearer anything I m getting nearer something with everything that s done Spargo answered You can t start on a business like this without evolving something out of it you know Well said Breton to me there s not so much mystery in it mister Aylmore s explained the reason why my address was found on the body Criedir the stamp man has explained Spargo suddenly looked up What he said sharply Why the reason of Marbury s being found where he was found replied Breton Of course I see it all Marbury was mooning around Fleet Street he slipped into Middle Temple Lane late as it was just to see where old Cardlestone hangs out and he was set upon and done for The thing s plain to me The only thing now is to find who did it Yes that s it agreed Spargo That s it He turned over the leaves of the diary which lay on his desk By the by he said looking up with some interest the adjourned inquest is at eleven o clock tomorrow morning Are you going I shall certainly go answered Breton What s more I m going to take Miss Aylmore and her sister As the gruesome details were over at the first sitting and as there ll he nothing but this new evidence tomorrow and as they ve never been in a coroner s court mister Aylmore ll be the principal witness tomorrow interrupted Spargo I suppose he ll be able to tell a lot more than he told me Breton shrugged his shoulders I don t see that there s much more to tell he said But he added with a sly laugh I suppose you want some more good copy eh Spargo glanced at his watch rose and picked up his hat I ll tell you what I want he said I want to know who John Marbury was That would make good copy Who he was twenty twenty five forty years ago Eh And you think mister Aylmore can tell asked Breton mister Aylmore answered Spargo as they walked towards the door is the only person I have met so far who has admitted that he knew John Marbury in the past But he didn t tell me much Perhaps he ll tell the coroner and his jury more Now I m off Breton I ve an appointment And leaving Breton to find his own way out Spargo hurried away jumped into a taxi cab and speeded to the London and Universal Safe Deposit At the corner of its building he found Rathbury awaiting him Well said Spargo as he sprang out How is it It s all right answered Rathbury You can be present I got the necessary permission As there are no relations known there ll only be one or two officials and you and the Safe Deposit people and myself Come on it s about time It sounds observed Spargo like an exhumation Rathbury laughed Well we re certainly going to dig up a dead man s secrets he said At least we may be going to do so In my opinion mister Spargo we ll find some clue in this leather box Spargo made no answer They entered the office to be shown into a room where were already assembled mister Myerst a gentleman who turned out to be the chairman of the company and the officials of whom Rathbury had spoken And in another moment Spargo heard the chairman explaining that the company possessed duplicate keys to all safes and that the proper authorization having been received from the proper authorities those present would now proceed to the safe recently tenanted by the late mister John Marbury and take from it the property which he himself had deposited there a small leather box which they would afterwards bring to that room and cause to be opened in each other s presence It seemed to Spargo that there was an unending unlocking of bolts and bars before he and his fellow processionists came to the safe so recently rented by the late mister John Marbury now undoubtedly deceased And at first sight of it he saw that it was so small an affair that it seemed ludicrous to imagine that it could contain anything of any importance In fact it looked to be no more than a plain wooden locker one amongst many in a small strong room it reminded Spargo irresistibly of the locker in which in his school days he had kept his personal belongings and the jam tarts sausage rolls and hardbake smuggled in from the tuck shop Marbury s name had been newly painted upon it the paint was scarcely dry But when the wooden door the front door as it were of this temple of mystery had been solemnly opened by the chairman a formidable door of steel was revealed and expectation still leapt in the bosoms of the beholders The duplicate key mister Myerst if you please commanded the chairman the duplicate key Myerst who was fully as solemn as his principal produced a curious looking key the chairman lifted his hand as if he were about to christen a battleship the steel door swung slowly back And there in a two foot square cavity lay the leather box It struck Spargo as they filed back to the secretary s room that the procession became more funereal like than ever First walked the chairman abreast with the high official who had brought the necessary authorization from the all powerful quarter then came Myerst carrying the box followed two other gentlemen both legal lights charged with watching official and police interests Rathbury and Spargo brought up the rear He whispered something of his notions to the detective Rathbury nodded a comprehensive understanding Let s hope we re going to see something he said In the secretary s room a man waited who touched his forelock respectfully as the heads of the procession entered Myerst set the box on the table the man made a musical jingle of keys the other members of the procession gathered round As we naturally possess no key to this box announced the chairman in grave tones it becomes our duty to employ professional assistance in opening it Jobson He waved a hand and the man of the keys stepped forward with alacrity He examined the lock of the box with a knowing eye it was easy to see that he was anxious to fall upon it While he considered matters Spargo looked at the box It was pretty much what it had been described to him as being a small square box of old cow hide very strongly made much worn and tarnished fitted with a handle projecting from the lid and having the appearance of having been hidden away somewhere for many a long day There was a click a spring Jobson stepped back That s it if you please sir he said The chairman motioned to the high official If you would be good enough to open the box sir he said Our duty is now concluded As the high official laid his hand on the lid the other men gathered round with craning necks and expectant eyes The lid was lifted somebody sighed deeply And Spargo pushed his own head and eyes nearer The box was empty Empty as anything that can be empty is empty thought Spargo there was literally nothing in it They were all staring into the interior of a plain time worn little receptacle lined out with old fashioned chintz stuff such as our Mid Victorian fore fathers were familiar with and containing nothing God bless my soul exclaimed the chairman This is dear me why there is nothing in the box That remarked the high official drily appears to be obvious The chairman looked at the secretary I understood the box was valuable mister Myerst he said with the half injured air of a man who considers himself to have been robbed of an exceptionally fine treat Valuable Myerst coughed I can only repeat what I have already said Sir Benjamin he answered The er late mister Marbury spoke of the deposit as being of great value to him he never permitted it out of his hand until he placed it in the safe He appeared to regard it as of the greatest value But we understand from the evidence of mister Criedir given to the Watchman newspaper that it was full of papers and and other articles said the chairman Criedir saw papers in it about an hour before it was brought here Myerst spread out his hands I can only repeat what I have said Sir Benjamin he answered I know nothing more But why should a man deposit an empty box began the chairman I The high official interposed That the box is empty is certain he observed Did you ever handle it yourself mister Myerst Myerst smiled in a superior fashion I have already observed sir that from the time the deceased entered this room until the moment he placed the box in the safe which he rented the box was never out of his hands he replied Then there was silence At last the high official turned to the chairman Very well he said We ve made the enquiry Rathbury take the box away with you and lock it up at the Yard So Spargo went out with Rathbury and the box and saw excellent if mystifying material for the article which had already become the daily feature of his paper CHAPTER ELEVEN mister AYLMORE IS QUESTIONED It seemed to Spargo as he sat listening to the proceedings at the adjourned inquest next day that the whole story of what was now world famous as the Middle Temple Murder Case was being reiterated before him for the thousandth time There was not a detail of the story with which he had not become familiar to fulness The first proceeding before the coroner had been of a merely formal nature these were thorough and exhaustive the representative of the Crown and twelve good men and true of the City of London were there to hear and to find out and to arrive at a conclusion as to how the man known as John Marbury came by his death And although he knew all about it Spargo found himself tabulating the evidence in a professional manner and noting how each successive witness contributed as it were a chapter to the story The story itself ran quite easily naturally consecutively you could make it in sections And Spargo sitting merely to listen made them one The Temple porter and Constable Driscoll proved the finding of the body two The police surgeon testified as to the cause of death the man had been struck down from behind by a blow a terrible blow from some heavy instrument and had died immediately three The police and the mortuary officials proved that when the body was examined nothing was found in the clothing but the now famous scrap of grey paper four Rathbury proved that by means of the dead man s new fashionable cloth cap bought at Fiskie s well known shop in the West End he traced Marbury to the Anglo Orient Hotel in the Waterloo District five mister and missus Walters gave evidence of the arrival of Marbury at the Anglo Orient Hotel and of his doings while he was in and about there six The purser of the ss Wambarino proved that Marbury sailed from Melbourne to Southampton on that ship excited no remark behaved himself like any other well regulated passenger and left the Wambarino at Southampton early in the morning of what was to be the last day of his life in just the ordinary manner seven mister Criedir gave evidence of his rencontre with Marbury in the matter of the stamps eight mister Myerst told of Marbury s visit to the Safe Deposit and further proved that the box which he placed there proved on official examination to be empty nine William Webster re told the story of his encounter with Marbury in one of the vestibules of the House of Commons and of his witnessing the meeting between him and the gentleman whom he Webster now knew to be mister Aylmore a Member of Parliament All this led up to the appearance of mister Aylmore M P in the witness box And Spargo knew and felt that it was that appearance for which the crowded court was waiting Thanks to his own vivid and realistic specials in the Watchman everybody there had already become well and thoroughly acquainted with the mass of evidence represented by the nine witnesses who had been in the box before mister Aylmore entered it They were familiar too with the facts which mister Aylmore had permitted Spargo to print after the interview at the club which Ronald Breton arranged Why then the extraordinary interest which the Member of Parliament s appearance aroused For everybody was extraordinarily interested from the Coroner downwards to the last man who had managed to squeeze himself into the last available inch of the public gallery all who were there wanted to hear and see the man who met Marbury under such dramatic circumstances and who went to his hotel with him hobnobbed with him gave him advice walked out of the hotel with him for a stroll from which Marbury never returned Spargo knew well why the interest was so keen everybody knew that Aylmore was the only man who could tell the court anything really pertinent about Marbury who he was what he was after what his life had been He looked round the court as the Member of Parliament entered the witness box a tall handsome perfectly groomed man whose beard was only slightly tinged with grey whose figure was as erect as a well drilled soldier s who carried about him an air of conscious power Aylmore s two daughters sat at a little distance away opposite Spargo with Ronald Breton in attendance upon them Spargo had encountered their glance as they entered the court and they had given him a friendly nod and smile He had watched them from time to time it was plain to him that they regarded the whole affair as a novel sort of entertainment they might have been idlers in some Eastern bazaar listening to the unfolding of many tales from the professional tale tellers Now as their father entered the box Spargo looked at them again he saw nothing more than a little heightening of colour in their cheeks a little brightening of their eyes All that they feel he thought is a bit of extra excitement at the idea that their father is mixed up in this delightful mystery Um Well now how much is he mixed up And he turned to the witness box and from that moment never took his eyes off the man who now stood in it For Spargo had ideas about the witness which he was anxious to develop The folk who expected something immediately sensational in mister Aylmore s evidence were disappointed Aylmore having been sworn and asked a question or two by the Coroner requested permission to tell in his own way what he knew of the dead man and of this sad affair and having received that permission he went on in a calm unimpassioned manner to repeat precisely what he had told Spargo It sounded a very plain ordinary story He had known Marbury many years ago He had lost sight of him for oh quite twenty years He had met him accidentally in one of the vestibules of the House of Commons on the evening preceding the murder Marbury had asked his advice Having no particular duty and willing to do an old acquaintance a good turn he had gone back to the Anglo Orient Hotel with Marbury had remained awhile with him in his room examining his Australian diamonds and had afterwards gone out with him He had given him the advice he wanted they had strolled across Waterloo Bridge shortly afterwards they had parted That was all he knew The court the public Spargo everybody there knew all this already It had been in print under a big headline in the Watchman Aylmore had now told it again having told it he seemed to consider that his next step was to leave the box and the court and after a perfunctory question or two from the Coroner and the foreman of the jury he made a motion as if to step down But Spargo who had been aware since the beginning of the enquiry of the presence of a certain eminent counsel who represented the Treasury cocked his eye in that gentleman s direction and was not surprised to see him rise in his well known apparently indifferent fashion fix his monocle in his right eye and glance at the tall figure in the witness box The fun is going to begin muttered Spargo The Treasury representative looked from Aylmore to the Coroner and made a jerky bow from the Coroner to Aylmore and straightened himself He looked like a man who is going to ask indifferent questions about the state of the weather or how Smith s wife was last time you heard of her or if stocks are likely to rise or fall But Spargo had heard this man before and he knew many signs of his in voice and manner and glance I want to ask you a few questions mister Aylmore about your acquaintanceship with the dead man It was an acquaintanceship of some time ago began the suave seemingly careless voice A considerable time ago answered Aylmore How long roughly speaking I should say from twenty to twenty two or three years Never saw him during that time until you met accidentally in the way you have described to us Never Ever heard from him No Ever heard of him No But when you met you knew each other at once Well almost at once Almost at once Then I take it you were very well known to each other twenty or twenty two years ago We were yes well known to each other Close friends I said we were acquaintances Acquaintances What was his name when you knew him at that time His name It was Marbury Marbury the same name Where did you know him I oh here in London What was he Do you mean what was his occupation What was his occupation I believe he was concerned in financial matters Concerned in financial matters Had you dealings with him Well yes on occasions What was his business address in London I can t remember that What was his private address That I never knew Where did you transact your business with him Well we met now and then Where What place office resort I can t remember particular places Sometimes in the City In the City Where in the City Mansion House or Lombard Street or saint Paul s Churchyard or the Old Bailey or where I have recollections of meeting him outside the Stock Exchange Oh Was he a member of that institution Not that I know of Were you Certainly not What were the dealings that you had with him Financial dealings small ones How long did your acquaintanceship with him last what period did it extend over I should say about six months to nine months No more Certainly no more It was quite a slight acquaintanceship then Oh quite And yet after losing sight of this merely slight acquaintance for over twenty years you on meeting him take great interest in him Well I was willing to do him a good turn I was interested in what he told me the other evening I see Now you will not object to my asking you a personal question or two You are a public man and the facts about the lives of public men are more or less public property You are represented in this work of popular reference as coming to this country in nineteen oh two from Argentina where you made a considerable fortune You have told us however that you were in London acquainted with Marbury about the years say eighteen ninety to eighteen ninety two Did you then leave England soon after knowing Marbury I did I left England in eighteen ninety one or eighteen ninety two I am not sure which We are wanting to be very sure about this matter mister Aylmore We want to solve the important question who is who was John Marbury and how did he come by his death You seem to be the only available person who knows anything about him What was your business before you left England I was interested in financial affairs Like Marbury Where did you carry on your business In London of course At what address For some moments Aylmore had been growing more and more restive His brow had flushed his moustache had begun to twitch And now he squared his shoulders and faced his questioner defiantly I resent these questions about my private affairs he snapped out Possibly But I must put them I repeat my last question And I refuse to answer it Then I ask you another Where did you live in London at the time you are telling us of when you knew John Marbury I refuse to answer that question also The Treasury Counsel sat down and looked at the Coroner CHAPTER TWELVE THE NEW WITNESS The voice of the Coroner bland suave deprecating broke the silence He was addressing the witness I am sure mister Aylmore he said there is no wish to trouble you with unnecessary questions But we are here to get at the truth of this matter of John Marbury s death and as you are the only witness we have had who knew him personally Aylmore turned impatiently to the Coroner I have every wish to respect your authority sir he exclaimed And I have told you all that I know of Marbury and of what happened when I met him the other evening But I resent being questioned on my private affairs of twenty years ago I very much resent it Any question that is really pertinent I will answer but I will not answer questions that seem to me wholly foreign to the scope of this enquiry The Treasury Counsel rose again His manner had become of the quietest and Spargo again became keenly attentive Perhaps I can put a question or two to mister Aylmore which will not yield him offence he remarked drily He turned once more to the witness regarding him as if with interest Can you tell us of any person now living who knew Marbury in London at the time under discussion twenty to twenty two or three years ago he asked Aylmore shook his head angrily No I can t he replied And yet you and he must have had several business acquaintances at that time who knew you both Possibly at that time But when I returned to England my business and my life lay in different directions to those of that time I don t know of anybody who knew Marbury then anybody The Counsel turned to a clerk who sat behind him whispered to him Spargo saw the clerk make a sidelong motion of his head towards the door of the court The Counsel looked again at the witness One more question You told the court a little time since that you parted with Marbury on the evening preceding his death at the end of Waterloo Bridge at I think you said a quarter to twelve About that time And at that place Yes That is all I want to ask you mister Aylmore just now said the Counsel He turned to the Coroner I am going to ask you sir at this point to call a witness who has volunteered certain evidence to the police authorities this morning That evidence is of a very important nature and I think that this is the stage at which it ought to be given to you and the jury If you would be pleased to direct that David Lyell be called Spargo turned instinctively to the door having seen the clerk who had sat behind the Treasury Counsel make his way there There came into view ushered by the clerk a smart looking alert self confident young man evidently a Scotsman who on the name of David Lyell being called stepped jauntily and readily into the place which the member of Parliament just vacated He took the oath Scotch fashion with the same readiness and turned easily to the Treasury Counsel And Spargo glancing quickly round saw that the court was breathless with anticipation and that its anticipation was that the new witness was going to tell something which related to the evidence just given by Aylmore Your name is David Lyell That is my name sir And you reside at twenty three Cumbrae Side Kilmarnock Scotland I do What are you mister Lyell Traveller sir for the firm of Messrs Stevenson Robertson Soutar distillers of Kilmarnock Your duties take you I think over to Paris occasionally They do once every six weeks I go to Paris On the evening of June twenty first last were you in London on your way to Paris I was I believe you stayed at De Keyser s Hotel at the Blackfriars end of the Embankment I did it s handy for the continental trains About half past eleven or a little later that evening did you go along the Embankment on the Temple Gardens side for a walk I did sir I m a bad sleeper and it s a habit of mine to take a walk of half an hour or so last thing before I go to bed How far did you walk As far as Waterloo Bridge Always on the Temple side Just so sir straight along on that side Very good When you got close to Waterloo Bridge did you meet anybody you knew Yes mister Aylmore the Member of Parliament Spargo could not avoid a glance at the two sisters The elder s head was averted the younger was staring at the witness steadily And Breton was nervously tapping his fingers on the crown of his shining silk hat mister Aylmore the Member of Parliament repeated the Counsel s suave clear tones Oh And how did you come to recognize mister Aylmore Member of Parliament Well sir in this way At home I m the secretary of our Liberal Ward Club and last year we had a demonstration and it fell to me to arrange with the principal speakers I got mister Aylmore to come and speak and naturally I met him several times in London and in Scotland So that you knew him quite well Oh yes sir Do you see him now mister Lyell Lyell smiled and half turned in the box Why of course he answered There is mister Aylmore There is mister Aylmore Very good Now we go on You met mister Aylmore close to Waterloo Bridge How close Well sir to be exact mister Aylmore came down the steps from the bridge on to the Embankment Alone No Who was with him A man sir Did you know the man No But seeing who he was with I took a good look at him I haven t forgotten his face You haven t forgotten his face mister Lyell has anything recalled that face to you within this last day or two Yes sir indeed What The picture of the man they say was murdered John Marbury You re sure of that I m as certain sir as that my name s what it is It is your belief that mister Aylmore when you met him was accompanied by the man who according to the photographs was John Marbury It is sir Very well Now having seen mister Aylmore and his companion what did you do Oh I just turned and walked after them You walked after them They were going eastward then They were walking by the way I d come You followed them eastward I did I was going back to the hotel you see What were they doing Talking uncommonly earnestly sir How far did you follow them I followed them until they came to the Embankment lodge of Middle Temple Lane sir And then Why sir they turned in there and I went straight on to De Keyser s and to my bed There was a deeper silence in court at that moment than at any other period of the long day and it grew still deeper when the quiet keen voice put the next question You swear on your oath that you saw mister Aylmore take his companion into the Temple by the Embankment entrance of Middle Temple Lane on the occasion in question I do I could swear no other sir Can you tell us as near as possible what time that would be Yes It was to a minute or so about five minutes past twelve The Treasury Counsel nodded to the Coroner and the Coroner after a whispered conference with the foreman of the jury looked at the witness You have only just given this information to the police I understand he said Yes sir I have been in Paris and in Amiens and I only returned by this morning s boat As soon as I had read all the news in the papers the English papers and seen the dead man s photographs I determined to tell the police what I knew and I went to New Scotland Yard as soon as I got to London this morning Nobody else wanted to ask mister David Lyell any questions and he stepped down And mister Aylmore suddenly came forward again seeking the Coroner s attention May I be allowed to make an explanation sir he began I But the Treasury Counsel was on his feet this time stern and implacable I would point out sir that you have had mister Aylmore in the box and that he was not then at all ready to give explanations or even to answer questions he said And before you allow him to make any explanation now I ask you to hear another witness whom I wish to interpose at this stage That witness is mister Aylmore turned almost angrily to the Coroner After the evidence of the last witness I think I have a right to be heard at once he said with emphasis As matters stand at present it looks as if I had trifled sir with you and the jury whereas if I am allowed to make an explanation I must respectfully ask that before mister Aylmore is allowed to make any explanation the witness I have referred to is heard said the Treasury Counsel sternly There are weighty reasons I am afraid you must wait a little mister Aylmore if you wish to give an explanation said the Coroner He turned to the Counsel Who is this other witness he asked Aylmore stepped back And Spargo noticed that the younger of his two daughters was staring at him with an anxious expression There was no distrust of her father in her face she was anxious She too slowly turned to the next witness This man was the porter of the Embankment lodge of Middle Temple Lane The Treasury Counsel put a straight question to him at once You see that gentleman he said pointing to Aylmore Do you know him as an inmate of the Temple The man stared at Aylmore evidently confused Why certainly sir he answered Quite well sir Very good And now what name do you know him by The man grew evidently more bewildered Name sir Why mister Anderson sir he replied mister Anderson CHAPTER THIRTEEN UNDER SUSPICION A distinct uncontrollable murmur of surprise ran round the packed court as this man in the witness box gave this answer It signified many things that there were people present who had expected some such dramatic development that there were others present who had not that the answer itself was only a prelude to further developments And Spargo looking narrowly about him saw that the answer had aroused different feelings in Aylmore s two daughters The elder one had dropped her face until it was quite hidden the younger was sitting bolt upright staring at her father in utter and genuine bewilderment And for the first time Aylmore made no response to her But the course of things was going steadily forward There was no stopping the Treasury Counsel now he was going to get at some truth in his own merciless fashion He had exchanged one glance with the Coroner had whispered a word to the solicitor who sat close by him and now he turned again to the witness So you know that gentleman make sure now as mister Anderson an inmate of the Temple Yes sir You don t know him by any other name No sir I don t How long have you known him by that name I should say two or three years sir See him go in and out regularly No sir not regularly How often then Now and then sir perhaps once a week Tell us what you know of mister Anderson s goings in and out Well sir I might see him two nights running then I mightn t see him again for perhaps a week or two Irregular as you might say sir You say nights Do I understand that you never see mister Anderson except at night Yes sir I ve never seen him except at night Always about the same time sir What time Just about midnight sir Very well Do you remember the midnight of June twenty first twenty second I do sir Did you see mister Anderson enter then Yes sir just after twelve Was he alone No sir there was another gentleman with him Remember anything about that other gentleman Nothing sir except that I noticed as they walked through that the other gentleman had grey clothes on Had grey clothes on You didn t see his face Not to remember it sir I don t remember anything but what I ve told you sir That is that the other gentleman wore a grey suit Where did mister Anderson and this gentleman in the grey suit go when they d passed through Straight up the Lane sir Do you know where mister Anderson s rooms in the Temple are Not exactly sir but I understood in Fountain Court Now on that night in question did mister Anderson leave again by your lodge No sir You heard of the discovery of the body of a dead man in Middle Temple Lane next morning I did sir Did you connect that man with the gentleman in the grey suit No sir I didn t It never occurred to me A lot of the gentlemen who live in the Temple bring friends in late of nights I never gave the matter any particular thought Never mentioned it to anybody until now when you were sent for to come here No sir never to anybody And you have never known the gentleman standing there as anybody but mister Anderson No sir never heard any other name but Anderson The Coroner glanced at the Counsel I think this may be a convenient opportunity for mister Aylmore to give the explanation he offered a few minutes ago he said Do you suggest anything I suggest sir that if mister Aylmore desires to give any explanation he should return to the witness box and submit himself to examination again on his oath replied the Counsel The matter is in your hands The Coroner turned to Aylmore Do you object to that he asked Aylmore stepped boldly forward and into the box I object to nothing he said in clear tones except to being asked to reply to questions about matters of the past which have not and cannot have anything to do with this case Ask me what questions you like arising out of the evidence of the last two witnesses and I will answer them so far as I see myself justified in doing so Ask me questions about matters of twenty years ago and I shall answer them or not as I see fit And I may as well say that I will take all the consequences of my silence or my speech The Treasury Counsel rose again Very well mister Aylmore he said I will put certain questions to you You heard the evidence of David Lyell I did Was that quite true as regards yourself Quite true absolutely true And you heard that of the last witness Was that also true Equally true Then you admit that the evidence you gave this morning before these witnesses came on the scene was not true No I do not Most emphatically I do not It was true True You told me on oath that you parted from John Marbury on Waterloo Bridge Pardon me I said nothing of the sort I said that from the Anglo Orient Hotel we strolled across Waterloo Bridge and that shortly afterwards we parted I did not say where we parted I see there is a shorthand writer here who is taking everything down ask him if that is not exactly what I said A reference to the stenographer proved Aylmore to be right and the Treasury Counsel showed plain annoyance Well at any rate you so phrased your answer that nine persons out of ten would have understood that you parted from Marbury in the open streets after crossing Waterloo Bridge he said Now Aylmore smiled I am not responsible for the understanding of nine people out of ten any more than I am for your understanding he said with a sneer I said what I now repeat Marbury and I walked across Waterloo Bridge and shortly afterwards we parted I told you the truth Indeed Perhaps you will continue to tell us the truth Since you have admitted that the evidence of the last two witnesses is absolutely correct perhaps you will tell us exactly where you and Marbury did part I will willingly We parted at the door of my chambers in Fountain Court Then to reiterate it was you who took Marbury into the Temple that night It was certainly I who took Marbury into the Temple that night There was another murmur amongst the crowded benches Here at any rate was fact solid substantial fact And Spargo began to see a possible course of events which he had not anticipated That is a candid admission mister Aylmore I suppose you see a certain danger to yourself in making it I need not say whether I do or I do not I have made it Very good Why did you not make it before For my own reasons I told you as much as I considered necessary for the purpose of this enquiry I have virtually altered nothing now I asked to be allowed to make a statement to give an explanation as soon as mister Lyell had left this box I was not allowed to do so I am willing to make it now Make it then It is simply this said Aylmore turning to the Coroner I have found it convenient during the past three years to rent a simple set of chambers in the Temple where I could occasionally very occasionally as a rule go late at night I also found it convenient for my own reasons with which I think no one has anything to do to rent those chambers under the name of mister Anderson It was to my chambers that Marbury accompanied me for a few moments on the midnight with which we are dealing He was not in them more than five minutes at the very outside I parted from him at my outer door and I understood that he would leave the Temple by the way we had entered and would drive or walk straight back to his hotel That is the whole truth I wish to add that I ought perhaps to have told all this at first I had reasons for not doing so I told what I considered necessary that I parted from Marbury leaving him well and alive soon after midnight What reasons were or are they which prevented you from telling all this at first asked the Treasury Counsel Reasons which are private to me Will you tell them to the court No Then will you tell us why Marbury went with you to the chambers in Fountain Court which you tenant under the name of Anderson Yes To fetch a document which I had in my keeping and had kept for him for twenty years or more A document of importance Of very great importance He would have it on him when he was as we believe he was murdered and robbed He had it on him when he left me Will you tell us what it was Certainly not In fact you won t tell us any more than you choose to tell I have told you all I can tell of the events of that night Then I am going to ask you a very pertinent question Is it not a fact that you know a great deal more about John Marbury than you have told this court That I shall not answer Is it not a fact that you could if you would tell this court more about John Marbury and your acquaintanceship with him twenty years ago I also decline to answer that The Treasury Counsel made a little movement of his shoulders and turned to the Coroner I should suggest sir that you adjourn this enquiry he said quietly For a week assented the Coroner turning to the jury The crowd surged out of the court chattering murmuring exclaiming spectators witnesses jurymen reporters legal folk police folk all mixed up together And Spargo elbowing his own way out and busily reckoning up the value of the new complexions put on everything by the day s work suddenly felt a hand laid on his arm Turning he found himself gazing at Jessie Aylmore CHAPTER FOURTEEN THE SILVER TICKET With a sudden instinct of protection Spargo quickly drew the girl aside from the struggling crowd and within a moment had led her into a quiet by street He looked down at her as she stood recovering her breath Yes he said quietly Jessie Aylmore looked up at him smiling faintly I want to speak to you she said I must speak to you Yes said Spargo But the others Your sister Breton I left them on purpose to speak to you she answered They knew I did I am well accustomed to looking after myself Spargo moved down the by street motioning his companion to move with him Tea he said is what you want I know a queer old fashioned place close by here where you can get the best China tea in London Come and have some Jessie Aylmore smiled and followed her guide obediently And Spargo said nothing marching stolidly along with his thumbs in his waistcoat pockets his fingers playing soundless tunes outside until he had installed himself and his companion in a quiet nook in the old tea house he had told her of and had given an order for tea and hot tea cakes to a waitress who evidently knew him Then he turned to her You want he said to talk to me about your father Yes she answered I do Why asked Spargo The girl gave him a searching look Ronald Breton says you re the man who s written all those special articles in the Watchman about the Marbury case she answered Are you I am said Spargo Then you re a man of great influence she went on You can stir the public mind mister Spargo what are you going to write about my father and today s proceedings Spargo signed to her to pour out the tea which had just arrived He seized without ceremony upon a piece of the hot buttered tea cake and bit a great lump out of it Frankly he mumbled speaking with his mouth full frankly I don t know I don t know yet But I ll tell you this it s best to be candid I shouldn t allow myself to be prejudiced or biassed in making up my conclusions by anything that you may say to me Understand Jessie Aylmore took a sudden liking to Spargo because of the unconventionality and brusqueness of his manners I m not wanting to prejudice or bias you she said All I want is that you should be very sure before you say anything I ll be sure said Spargo Don t bother Is the tea all right Beautiful she answered with a smile that made Spargo look at her again Delightful mister Spargo tell me what did you think about about what has just happened Spargo regardless of the fact that his fingers were liberally ornamented with butter lifted a hand and rubbed his always untidy hair Then he ate more tea cake and gulped more tea Look here he said suddenly I m no great hand at talking I can write pretty decently when I ve a good story to tell but I don t talk an awful lot because I never can express what I mean unless I ve got a pen in my hand Frankly I find it hard to tell you what I think When I write my article this evening I ll get all these things marshalled in proper form and I shall write clearly about em But I ll tell you one thing I do think I wish your father had made a clean breast of things to me at first when he gave me that interview or had told everything when he first went into that box Why she asked Because he s now set up an atmosphere of doubt and suspicion around himself People ll think Heaven knows what they ll think They already know that he knows more about Marbury than he ll tell that But does he she interrupted quickly Do you think he does Yes replied Spargo with emphasis I do A lot more If he had only been explicit at first however he wasn t Now it s done As things stand look here does it strike you that your father is in a very serious position Serious she exclaimed Dangerous Here s the fact he s admitted that he took Marbury to his rooms in the Temple that midnight Well next morning Marbury s found robbed and murdered in an entry not fifty yards off Does anybody suppose that my father would murder him for the sake of robbing him of whatever he had on him she laughed scornfully My father is a very wealthy man mister Spargo May be answered Spargo But millionaires have been known to murder men who held secrets Secrets she exclaimed Have some more tea said Spargo nodding at the teapot Look here this way it is The theory that people some people will build up I won t say that it hasn t suggested itself to me is this There s some mystery about the relationship acquaintanceship connection call it what you like of your father and Marbury twenty odd years ago Must be There s some mystery about your father s life twenty odd years ago Must be or else he d have answered those questions Very well Ha ha says the general public Now we have it Marbury says the general public was a man who had a hold on Aylmore He turned up Aylmore trapped him into the Temple killed him to preserve his own secret and robbed him of all he had on him as a blind Eh You think people will say that she exclaimed Cock sure They re saying it Heard half a dozen of em say it in more or less elegant fashion as I came out of that court Of course they ll say it Why what else could they say For a moment Jessie Aylmore sat looking silently into her tea cup Then she turned her eyes on Spargo who immediately manifested a new interest in what remained of the tea cakes Is that what you re going to say in your article tonight she asked quietly No replied Spargo promptly It isn t I m going to sit on the fence tonight Besides the case is sub judice All I m going to do is to tell in my way what took place at the inquest The girl impulsively put her hand across the table and laid it on Spargo s big fist Is it what you think she asked in a low voice Honour bright no exclaimed Spargo It isn t it isn t I don t think it I think there s a most extraordinary mystery at the bottom of Marbury s death and I think your father knows an enormous lot about Marbury that he won t tell but I m certain sure that he neither killed Marbury nor knows anything whatever about his death And as I m out to clear this mystery up and mean to do it nothing ll make me more glad than to clear your father I say do have some more tea cake We ll have fresh ones and fresh tea No thank you she said smiling And thank you for what you ve just said I m going now mister Spargo You ve done me good Oh rot exclaimed Spargo Nothing nothing I ve just told you what I m thinking You must go He saw her into a taxi cab presently and when she had gone stood vacantly staring after the cab until a hand clapped him smartly on the shoulder Turning he found Rathbury grinning at him All right mister Spargo I saw you he said Well it s a pleasant change to squire young ladies after being all day in that court Look here are you going to start your writing just now I m not going to start my writing as you call it until after I ve dined at seven o clock and given myself time to digest my modest dinner answered Spargo What is it Come back with me and have another look at that blessed leather box said Rathbury I ve got it in my room and I d like to examine it for myself Come on The thing s empty said Spargo There might be a false bottom in it remarked Rathbury One never knows Here jump into this He pushed Spargo into a passing taxi cab and following bade the driver go straight to the Yard Arrived there he locked Spargo and himself into the drab visaged room in which the journalist had seen him before What d ye think of today s doings Spargo he asked as he proceeded to unlock a cupboard I think said Spargo that some of you fellows must have had your ears set to tingling That s so assented Rathbury Of course the next thing ll be to find out all about the mister Aylmore of twenty years since When a man won t tell you where he lived twenty years ago what he was exactly doing what his precise relationship with another man was why then you ve just got to find out eh Oh some of our fellows are at work on the life history of Stephen Aylmore esquire M P already you bet Well now Spargo here s the famous box The detective brought the old leather case out of the cupboard in which he had been searching and placed it on his desk Spargo threw back the lid and looked inside measuring the inner capacity against the exterior lines No false bottom in that Rathbury he said There s just the outer leather case and the inner lining of this old bed hanging stuff and that s all There s no room for any false bottom or anything of that sort d you see Rathbury also sized up the box s capacity Looks like it he said disappointedly Well what about the lid then I remember there was an old box like this in my grandmother s farmhouse where I was reared there was a pocket in the lid Let s see if there s anything of the sort here He threw the lid back and began to poke about the lining of it with the tips of his fingers and presently he turned to his companion with a sharp exclamation By George Spargo he said I don t know about any pocket but there s something under this lining Feels like here you feel There and there Spargo put a finger on the places indicated Yes that s so he agreed Feels like two cards a large and a small one And the small one s harder than the other Better cut that lining out Rathbury That remarked Rathbury producing a pen knife is just what I m going to do We ll cut along this seam He ripped the lining carefully open along the upper part of the lining of the lid and looking into the pocket thus made drew out two objects which he dropped on his blotting pad A child s photograph he said glancing at one of them But what on earth is that The object to which he pointed was a small oblong piece of thin much worn silver about the size of a railway ticket On one side of it was what seemed to be a heraldic device or coat of arms almost obliterated by rubbing on the other similarly worn down by friction was the figure of a horse That s a curious object remarked Spargo picking it up I never saw anything like that before What can it be Don t know I never saw anything of the sort either said Rathbury Some old token I should say Now this photo Ah you see the photographer s name and address have been torn away or broken off there s nothing left but just two letters of what s apparently been the name of the town see Er that s all there is Portrait of a baby eh Spargo gave what might have been called in anybody else but him a casual glance at the baby s portrait He picked up the silver ticket again and turned it over and over Look here Rathbury he said Let me take this silver thing I know where I can find out what it is At least I think I do All right agreed the detective but take the greatest care of it and don t tell a soul that we found it in this box you know No connection with the Marbury case Spargo remember Oh all right said Spargo Trust me He put the silver ticket in his pocket and went back to the office wondering about this singular find And when he had written his article that evening and seen a proof of it Spargo went into Fleet Street intent on seeking peculiar information CHAPTER FIFTEEN MARKET MILCASTER The haunt of well informed men which Spargo had in view when he turned out of the Watchman office lay well hidden from ordinary sight and knowledge in one of those Fleet Street courts the like of which is not elsewhere in the world Only certain folk knew of it It was of course a club otherwise it would not have been what it was It is the simplest thing in life in England at any rate to form a club of congenial spirits You get so many of your choice friends and acquaintances to gather round you you register yourselves under a name of your own choosing you take a house and furnish it according to your means and your taste you comply with the very easy letter of the law and there you are Keep within that easy letter and you can do what you please on your own premises It is much more agreeable to have a small paradise of your own of this description than to lounge about Fleet Street bars The particular club to which Spargo bent his steps was called the Octoneumenoi Who evolved this extraordinary combination of Latin and Greek was a dark mystery there it was however on a tiny brass plate you once reached the portals The portals were gained by devious ways You turned out of Fleet Street by an alley so narrow that it seemed as if you might suddenly find yourself squeezed between the ancient walls Then you suddenly dived down another alley and found yourself in a small court with high walls around you and a smell of printer s ink in your nose and a whirring of printing presses in your ears You made another dive into a dark entry much encumbered by bales of paper crates of printing material jars of printing ink after falling over a few of these you struck an ancient flight of stairs and went up past various landings always travelling in a state of gloom and fear After a lot of twisting and turning you came to the very top of the house and found it heavily curtained off You lifted a curtain and found yourself in a small entresol somewhat artistically painted the whole and sole work of an artistic member who came one day with a formidable array of lumber and paint pots and worked his will on the ancient wood Then you saw the brass plate and its fearful name and beneath it the formal legal notice that this club was duly registered and so on and if you were a member you went in and if you weren t a member you tinkled an electric bell and asked to see a member if you knew one Spargo was not a member but he knew many members and he tinkled the bell and asked the boy who answered it for mister Starkey mister Starkey a young gentleman with the biceps of a prize fighter and a head of curly hair that would have done credit to Antinous came forth in due course and shook Spargo by the hand until his teeth rattled Had we known you were coming said mister Starkey we d have had a brass band on the stairs I want to come in remarked Spargo Sure said mister Starkey That s what you ve come for Well stand out of the way then and let s get in said Spargo Look here he continued when they had penetrated into a small vestibule doesn t old Crowfoot turn in here about this time every night Every night as true as the clock my son Spargo Crowfoot puts his nose in at precisely eleven having by that time finished that daily column wherein he informs a section of the populace as to the prospects of their spotting a winner tomorrow answered mister Starkey It s five minutes to his hour now Come in and drink till he comes Want him A word with him answered Spargo A mere word or two He followed Starkey into a room which was so filled with smoke and sound that for a moment it was impossible to either see or hear But the smoke was gradually making itself into a canopy and beneath the canopy Spargo made out various groups of men of all ages sitting around small tables smoking and drinking and all talking as if the great object of their lives was to get as many words as possible out of their mouths in the shortest possible time In the further corner was a small bar Starkey pulled Spargo up to it Name it my son commanded Starkey Try the Octoneumenoi very extra special Two of em Dick Come to beg to be a member Spargo I ll think about being a member of this ante room of the infernal regions when you start a ventilating fan and provide members with a route map of the way from Fleet Street answered Spargo taking his glass Phew what an atmosphere We re considering a ventilating fan said Starkey I m on the house committee now and I brought that very matter up at our last meeting But Templeson of the Bulletin you know Templeson he says what we want is a wine cooler to stand under that sideboard says no club is proper without a wine cooler and that he knows a chap second hand dealer don t you know what has a beauty to dispose of in old Sheffield plate Now if you were on our house committee Spargo old man would you go in for the wine cooler or the ventilating fan You see There is Crowfoot said Spargo Shout him over here Starkey before anybody else collars him Through the door by which Spargo had entered a few minutes previously came a man who stood for a moment blinking at the smoke and the lights He was a tall elderly man with a figure and bearing of a soldier a big sweeping moustache stood well out against a square cut jaw and beneath a prominent nose a pair of keen blue eyes looked out from beneath a tousled mass of crinkled hair He wore neither hat nor cap his attire was a carelessly put on Norfolk suit of brown tweed he looked half unkempt half groomed But knotted at the collar of his flannel shirt were the colours of one of the most famous and exclusive cricket clubs in the world and everybody knew that in his day their wearer had been a mighty figure in the public eye Hi Crowfoot shouted Starkey above the din and babel Crowfoot Crowfoot Come over here there s a chap dying to see you Yes that s the way to get him isn t it said Spargo Here I ll get him myself He went across the room and accosted the old sporting journalist I want a quiet word with you he said This place is like a pandemonium Crowfoot led the way into a side alcove and ordered a drink Always is this time he said yawning But it s companionable What is it Spargo Spargo took a pull at the glass which he had carried with him I should say he said that you know as much about sporting matters as any man writing about em Well I think you might say it with truth answered Crowfoot And old sporting matters said Spargo Yes and old sporting matters replied the other with a sudden flash of the eye Not that they greatly interest the modern generation you know Well there s something that s interesting me greatly just now anyway said Spargo And I believe it s got to do with old sporting affairs And I came to you for information about it believing you to be the only man I know of that could tell anything Yes what is it asked Crowfoot Spargo drew out an envelope and took from it the carefully wrapped up silver ticket He took off the wrappings and laid the ticket on Crowfoot s outstretched palm Can you tell me what that is he asked Another sudden flash came into the old sportsman s eyes he eagerly turned the silver ticket over God bless my soul he exclaimed Where did you get this Never mind just now replied Spargo You know what it is Certainly I know what it is But Gad I ve not seen one of these things for Lord knows how many years It makes me feel something like a young un again said Crowfoot Quite a young un But what is it asked Spargo Crowfoot turned the ticket over showing the side on which the heraldic device was almost worn away It s one of the original silver stand tickets of the old racecourse at Market Milcaster answered Crowfoot That s what it is One of the old original silver stand tickets There are the arms of Market Milcaster you see nearly worn away by much rubbing There on the obverse is the figure of a running horse Oh yes that s what it is Bless me most interesting Where s Market Milcaster enquired Spargo Don t know it Market Milcaster replied Crowfoot still turning the silver ticket over and over is what the topographers call a decayed town in Elmshire It has steadily decayed since the river that led to it got gradually silted up There used to be a famous race meeting there in June every year It s nearly forty years since that meeting fell through I went to it often when I was a lad often And you say that s a ticket for the stand asked Spargo This is one of fifty silver tickets or passes or whatever you like to call em which were given by the race committee to fifty burgesses of the town answered Crowfoot It was I remember considered a great privilege to possess a silver ticket It admitted its possessor for life mind you to the stand the paddocks the ring anywhere It also gave him a place at the annual race dinner Where on earth did you get this Spargo Spargo took the ticket and carefully re wrapped it this time putting it in his purse I m awfully obliged to you Crowfoot he said The fact is I can t tell you where I got it just now but I ll promise you that I will tell you and all about it too as soon as my tongue s free to do so Some mystery eh suggested Crowfoot Considerable answered Spargo Don t mention to anyone that I showed it to you You shall know everything eventually Oh all right my boy all right said Crowfoot Odd how things turn up isn t it Now I ll wager anything that there aren t half a dozen of these old things outside Market Milcaster itself As I said there were only fifty and they were all in possession of burgesses They were so much thought of that they were taken great care of I ve been in Market Milcaster myself since the races were given up and I ve seen these tickets carefully framed and hung over mantelpieces oh yes Spargo caught at a notion How do you get to Market Milcaster he asked Paddington replied Crowfoot It s a goodish way I wonder said Spargo if there s any old sporting man there who could remember things Anything about this ticket for instance Old sporting man exclaimed Crowfoot Egad but no he must be dead anyhow if he isn t dead he must be a veritable patriarch Old Ben Quarterpage he was an auctioneer in the town and a rare sportsman I may go down there said Spargo I ll see if he s alive Then if you do go down suggested Crowfoot go to the old Yellow Dragon in the High Street a fine old place Quarterpage s place of business and his private house were exactly opposite the Dragon But I m afraid you ll find him dead it s five and twenty years since I was in Market Milcaster and he was an old bird then Let s see now If Old Ben Quarterpage is alive Spargo he ll be ninety years of age Well I ve known men of ninety who were spry enough even in my bit of experience said Spargo I know one now my own grandfather Well the best of thanks Crowfoot and I ll tell you all about it some day Have another drink suggested Crowfoot But Spargo excused himself He was going back to the office he said he still had something to do And he got himself away from the Octoneumenoi in spite of Starkey who wished to start a general debate on the wisest way of expending the club s ready money balance and went back to the Watchman and there he sought the presence of the editor and in spite of the fact that it was the busiest hour of the night saw him and remained closeted with him for the extraordinary space of ten minutes And after that Spargo went home and fell into bed But next morning bright and early he was on the departure platform at Paddington suit case in hand and ticket in pocket for Market Milcaster and in the course of that afternoon he found himself in an old fashioned bedroom looking out on Market Milcaster High Street And there right opposite him he saw an ancient house old brick ivy covered with an office at its side over the door of which was the name Benjamin Quarterpage CHAPTER SIXTEEN THE YELLOW DRAGON Spargo changing his clothes washing away the dust of his journey in that old fashioned lavender scented bedroom busied his mind in further speculations on his plan of campaign in Market Milcaster He had no particularly clear plan The one thing he was certain of was that in the old leather box which the man whom he knew as John Marbury had deposited with the London and Universal Safe Deposit Company he and Rathbury had discovered one of the old silver tickets of Market Milcaster racecourse and that he Spargo had come to Market Milcaster with the full approval of his editor in an endeavour to trace it How was he going to set about this difficult task The first thing said Spargo to himself as he tied a new tie is to have a look round That ll be no long job For he had already seen as he approached the town and as he drove from the station to the Yellow Dragon Hotel that Market Milcaster was a very small place It chiefly consisted of one long wide thoroughfare the High Street with smaller streets leading from it on either side In the High Street seemed to be everything that the town could show the ancient parish church the town hall the market cross the principal houses and shops the bridge beneath which ran the river whereon ships had once come up to the town before its mouth four miles away became impassably silted up It was a bright clean little town but there were few signs of trade in it and Spargo had been quick to notice that in the Yellow Dragon a big rambling old hostelry reminiscent of the old coaching days there seemed to be little doing He had eaten a bit of lunch in the coffee room immediately on his arrival the coffee room was big enough to accommodate a hundred and fifty people but beyond himself an old gentleman and his daughter evidently tourists two young men talking golf a man who looked like an artist and an unmistakable honeymooning couple there was no one in it There was little traffic in the wide street beneath Spargo s windows little passage of people to and fro on the sidewalks here a countryman drove a lazy cow as lazily along there a farmer in his light cart sat idly chatting with an aproned tradesman who had come out of his shop to talk to him Over everything lay the quiet of the sunlight of the summer afternoon and through the open windows stole a faint sweet scent of the new mown hay lying in the meadows outside the old houses A veritable Sleepy Hollow mused Spargo Let s go down and see if there s anybody to talk to Great Scott to think that I was in the poisonous atmosphere of the Octoneumenoi only sixteen hours ago Spargo after losing himself in various corridors and passages finally landed in the wide stone paved hall of the old hotel and with a sure instinct turned into the bar parlour which he had noticed when he entered the place This was a roomy comfortable bow windowed apartment looking out upon the High Street and was furnished and ornamented with the usual appurtenances of country town hotels There were old chairs and tables and sideboards and cupboards which had certainly been made a century before and seemed likely to endure for a century or two longer there were old prints of the road and the chase and an old oil painting or two of red faced gentlemen in pink coats there were foxes masks on the wall and a monster pike in a glass case on a side table there were ancient candlesticks on the mantelpiece and an antique snuff box set between them Also there was a small old fashioned bar in a corner of the room and a new fashioned young woman seated behind it who was yawning over a piece of fancy needlework and looked at Spargo when he entered as Andromeda may have looked at Perseus when he made arrival at her rock And Spargo treating himself to a suitable drink and choosing a cigar to accompany it noted the look and dropped into the nearest chair This he remarked eyeing the damsel with enquiry appears to me to be a very quiet place Quiet exclaimed the lady Quiet That continued Spargo is precisely what I observed Quiet I see that you agree with me You expressed your agreement with two shades of emphasis the surprised and the scornful We may conclude thus far that the place is undoubtedly quiet The damsel looked at Spargo as if she considered him in the light of a new specimen and picking up her needlework she quitted the bar and coming out into the room took a chair near his own It makes you thankful to see a funeral go by here she remarked It s about all that one ever does see Are there many asked Spargo Do the inhabitants die much of inanition The damsel gave Spargo another critical inspection Oh you re joking she said It s well you can Nothing ever happens here This place is a back number Even the back numbers make pleasant reading at times murmured Spargo And the backwaters of life are refreshing Nothing doing in this town then he added in a louder voice Nothing replied his companion It s fast asleep I came here from Birmingham and I didn t know what I was coming to In Birmingham you see as many people in ten minutes as you see here in ten months Ah said Spargo What you are suffering from is dulness You must have an antidote Dulness exclaimed the damsel That s the right word for Market Milcaster There s just a few regular old customers drop in here of a morning between eleven and one A stray caller looks in perhaps during the afternoon Then at night a lot of old fogies sit round that end of the room and talk about old times Old times indeed what they want in Market Milcaster is new times Spargo pricked up his ears Well but it s rather interesting to hear old fogies talk about old times he said I love it Then you can get as much of it as ever you want here remarked the barmaid Look in tonight any time after eight o clock and if you don t know more about the history of Market Milcaster by ten than you did when you sat down you must be deaf There are some old gentlemen drop in here every night regular as clockwork who seem to feel that they couldn t go to bed unless they ve told each other stories about old days which I should think they ve heard a thousand times already Very old men asked Spargo Methuselahs replied the lady There s old mister Quarterpage across the way there the auctioneer though he doesn t do any business now they say he s ninety though I m sure you wouldn t take him for more than seventy And there s mister Lummis further down the street he s eighty one And mister Skene and mister Kaye they re regular patriarchs I ve sat here and listened to them till I believe I could write a history of Market Milcaster since the year One I can conceive of that as a pleasant and profitable occupation said Spargo He chatted a while longer in a fashion calculated to cheer the barmaid s spirits after which he went out and strolled around the town until seven o clock the Dragon s hour for dinner There were no more people in the big coffee room than there had been at lunch and Spargo was glad when his solitary meal was over to escape to the bar parlour where he took his coffee in a corner near to that sacred part in which the old townsmen had been reported to him to sit And mind you don t sit in one of their chairs said the barmaid warningly They all have their own special chairs and their special pipes there on that rack and I suppose the ceiling would fall in if anybody touched pipe or chair But you re all right there and you ll hear all they ve got to say To Spargo who had never seen anything of the sort before and who twenty four hours previously would have believed the thing impossible the proceedings of that evening in the bar parlour of the Yellow Dragon at Market Milcaster were like a sudden transference to the eighteenth century Precisely as the clock struck eight and a bell began to toll somewhere in the recesses of the High Street an old gentleman walked in and the barmaid catching Spargo s eye gave him a glance which showed that the play was about to begin Good evening mister Kaye said the barmaid You re first tonight Evening said mister Kaye and took a seat scowled around him and became silent He was a tall lank old gentleman clad in rusty black clothes with a pointed collar sticking up on both sides of his fringe of grey whisker and a voluminous black neckcloth folded several times round his neck and by the expression of his countenance was inclined to look on life severely Nobody been in yet asked mister Kaye No but here s mister Lummis and mister Skene replied the barmaid Two more old gentlemen entered the bar parlour Of these one was a little dapper figured man clad in clothes of an eminently sporting cut and of very loud pattern he sported a bright blue necktie a flower in his lapel and a tall white hat which he wore at a rakish angle The other was a big portly bearded man with a Falstaffian swagger and a rakish eye who chaffed the barmaid as he entered and gave her a good humoured chuck under the chin as he passed her These two also sank into chairs which seemed to have been specially designed to meet them and the stout man slapped the arms of his as familiarly as he had greeted the barmaid He looked at his two cronies Well he said Here s three of us And there s a symposium Wait a bit wait a bit said the dapper little man Grandpa ll be here in a minute We ll start fair The barmaid glanced out of the window There s mister Quarterpage coming across the street now she announced Shall I put the things on the table Aye put them on my dear put them on commanded the fat man Have all in readiness The barmaid thereupon placed a round table before the sacred chairs set out upon it a fine old punch bowl and the various ingredients for making punch a box of cigars and an old leaden tobacco box and she had just completed this interesting prelude to the evening s discourse when 
231_127936_000028_000001	train-clean-360	the door opened 
none	none	again and in walked one of the most remarkable old men Spargo had ever seen And by this time knowing that this was the venerable mister Benjamin Quarterpage of whom Crowfoot had told him he took good stock of the newcomer as he took his place amongst his friends who on their part received him with ebullitions of delight which were positively boyish mister Quarterpage was a youthful buck of ninety a middle sized sturdily built man straight as a dart still active of limb clear eyed and strong of voice His clean shaven old countenance was ruddy as a sun warmed pippin his hair was still only silvered his hand was steady as a rock His clothes of buff coloured whipcord were smart and jaunty his neckerchief as gay as if he had been going to a fair It seemed to Spargo that mister Quarterpage had a pretty long lease of life before him even at his age Spargo in his corner sat fascinated while the old gentlemen began their symposium Another making five came in and joined them the five had the end of the bar parlour to themselves mister Quarterpage made the punch with all due solemnity and ceremony when it was ladled out each man lighted his pipe or took a cigar and the tongues began to wag Other folk came and went the old gentlemen were oblivious of anything but their own talk Now and then a young gentleman of the town dropped in to take his modest half pint of bitter beer and to dally in the presence of the barmaid such looked with awe at the patriarchs as for the patriarchs themselves they were lost in the past Spargo began to understand what the damsel behind the bar meant when she said that she believed she could write a history of Market Milcaster since the year One After discussing the weather the local events of the day and various personal matters the old fellows got to reminiscences of the past telling tale after tale recalling incident upon incident of long years before At last they turned to memories of racing days at Market Milcaster And at that Spargo determined on a bold stroke Now was the time to get some information Taking the silver ticket from his purse he laid it the heraldic device uppermost on the palm of his hand and approaching the group with a polite bow said quietly Gentlemen can any of you tell me anything about that CHAPTER SEVENTEEN mister QUARTERPAGE HARKS BACK If Spargo had upset the old gentlemen s bowl of punch the second of the evening or had dropped an infernal machine in their midst he could scarcely have produced a more startling effect than that wrought upon them by his sudden production of the silver ticket Their babble of conversation died out one of them dropped his pipe another took his cigar out of his mouth as if he had suddenly discovered that he was sucking a stick of poison all lifted astonished faces to the interrupter staring from him to the shining object exhibited in his outstretched palm from it back to him And at last mister Quarterpage to whom Spargo had more particularly addressed himself spoke pointing with great empressement to the ticket Young gentleman he said in accents that seemed to Spargo to tremble a little young gentleman where did you get that You know what it is then asked Spargo willing to dally a little with the matter You recognize it Know it Recognize it exclaimed mister Quarterpage Yes and so does every gentleman present And it is just because I see you are a stranger to this town that I ask you where you got it Not I think young gentleman in this town No replied Spargo Certainly not in this town How should I get it in this town if I m a stranger Quite true quite true murmured mister Quarterpage I cannot conceive how any person in the town who is in possession of one of those what shall we call them heirlooms yes heirlooms of antiquity could possibly be base enough to part with it Therefore I ask again Where did you get that young gentleman Before I tell you that answered Spargo who in answer to a silent sign from the fat man had drawn a chair amongst them perhaps you will tell me exactly what this is I see it to be a bit of old polished much worn silver having on the obverse the arms or heraldic bearings of somebody or something on the reverse the figure of a running horse But what is it The five old men all glanced at each other and made simultaneous grunts Then mister Quarterpage spoke It is one of the original fifty burgess tickets of Market Milcaster young sir which gave its holder special and greatly valued privileges in respect to attendance at our once famous race meeting now unfortunately a thing of the past he added Fifty aye forty years ago to be in possession of one of those tickets was was A grand thing said one of the old gentlemen mister Lummis is right said mister Quarterpage It was a grand thing a very grand thing Those tickets sir were treasured are treasured And yet you a stranger show us one You got it sir Spargo saw that it was now necessary to cut matters short I found this ticket under mysterious circumstances in London he answered I want to trace it I want to know who its original owner was That is why I have come to Market Milcaster mister Quarterpage slowly looked round the circle of faces Wonderful he said Wonderful He found this ticket one of our famous fifty in London and under mysterious circumstances He wants to trace it he wants to know to whom it belonged That is why he has come to Market Milcaster Most extraordinary Gentlemen I appeal to you if this is not the most extraordinary event that has happened in Market Milcaster for I don t know how many years There was a general murmur of assent and Spargo found everybody looking at him as if he had just announced that he had come to buy the whole town But why he asked showing great surprise Why Why exclaimed mister Quarterpage Why He asks why Because young gentleman it is the greatest surprise to me and to these friends of mine too every man jack of em to hear that any one of our fifty tickets ever passed out of the possession of any of the fifty families to whom they belonged And unless I am vastly greatly most unexplainably mistaken young sir you are not a member of any Market Milcaster family No I m not admitted Spargo And he was going to add that until the previous evening he had never even heard of Market Milcaster but he wisely refrained No I m certainly not he added mister Quarterpage waved his long pipe I believe he said I believe that if the evening were not drawing to a close it is already within a few minutes of our departure young gentleman I believe I say that if I had time I could from memory give the names of the fifty families who held those tickets when the race meeting came to an end I believe I could I m sure you could asserted the little man in the loud suit Never was such a memory as yours never Especially for anything relating to the old racing matters said the fat man mister Quarterpage is a walking encyclopaedia My memory is good said mister Quarterpage It s the greatest blessing I have in my declining years Yes I am sure I could do that with a little thought And what s more nearly every one of those fifty families is still in the town or if not in the town close by it or if not close by it I know where they are Therefore I cannot make out how this young gentleman from London did you say sir From London answered Spargo This young gentleman from London comes to be in possession of one of our tickets continued mister Quarterpage It is wonderful But I tell you what young gentleman from London if you will do me the honour to breakfast with me in the morning sir I will show you my racing books and papers and we will speedily discover who the original holder of that ticket was My name sir is Quarterpage Benjamin Quarterpage and I reside at the ivy covered house exactly opposite this inn and my breakfast hour is nine o clock sharp and I shall bid you heartily welcome Spargo made his best bow Sir he said I am greatly obliged by your kind invitation and I shall consider it an honour to wait upon you to the moment Accordingly at five minutes to nine next morning Spargo found himself in an old fashioned parlour looking out upon a delightful garden gay with summer flowers and being introduced by mister Quarterpage Senior to mister Quarterpage Junior a pleasant gentleman of sixty always referred to by his father as something quite juvenile and to Miss Quarterpage a young old lady of something a little less elderly than her brother and to a breakfast table bounteously spread with all the choice fare of the season mister Quarterpage Senior was as fresh and rosy as a cherub it was a revelation to Spargo to encounter so old a man who was still in possession of such life and spirits and of such a vigorous and healthy appetite Naturally the talk over the breakfast table ran on Spargo s possession of the old silver ticket upon which subject it was evident mister Quarterpage was still exercising his intellect And Spargo who had judged it well to enlighten his host as to who he was and had exhibited a letter with which the editor of the Watchman had furnished him told how in the exercise of his journalistic duties he had discovered the ticket in the lining of an old box But he made no mention of the Marbury matter being anxious to see first whither mister Quarterpage s revelations would lead him You have no idea mister Spargo said the old gentleman when breakfast over he and Spargo were closeted together in a little library in which were abundant evidences of the host s taste in sporting matters you have no idea of the value which was attached to the possession of one of those silver tickets There is mine as you see securely framed and just as securely fastened to the wall Those fifty silver tickets my dear sir were made when our old race meeting was initiated in the year seventeen eighty one They were made in the town by a local silversmith whose great great grandson still carries on the business The fifty were distributed amongst the fifty leading burgesses of the town to be kept in their families for ever nobody ever anticipated in those days that our race meeting would ever be discontinued The ticket carried great privileges It made its holder and all members of his family male and female free of the stands rings and paddocks It gave the holder himself and his eldest son if of age the right to a seat at our grand race banquet at which I may tell you mister Spargo Royalty itself has been present in the good old days Consequently as you see to be the holder of a silver ticket was to be somebody And when the race meeting fell through asked Spargo What then Then of course the families who held the tickets looked upon them as heirlooms to be taken great care of replied mister Quarterpage They were dealt with as I dealt with mine framed on velvet and hung up or locked away I am sure that anybody who had one took the greatest care of it Now I said last night over there at the Dragon that I could repeat the names of all the families who held these tickets So I can But here the old gentleman drew out a drawer and produced from it a parchment bound book which he handled with great reverence here is a little volume of my own handwriting memoranda relating to Market Milcaster Races in which is a list of the original holders together with another list showing who held the tickets when the races were given up I make bold to say mister Spargo that by going through the second list I could trace every ticket except the one you have in your purse Every one said Spargo in some surprise Every one For as I told you continued mister Quarterpage the families are either in the town we re a conservative people here in Market Milcaster and we don t move far afield or they re just outside the town or they re not far away I can t conceive how the ticket you have and it s genuine enough could ever get out of possession of one of these families and Perhaps suggested Spargo it never has been out of possession I told you it was found in the lining of a box that box belonged to a dead man A dead man exclaimed mister Quarterpage A dead man Who could ah Perhaps perhaps I have an idea Yes an idea I remember something now that I had never thought of The old gentleman unfastened the clasp of his parchment bound book and turned over its pages until he came to one whereon was a list of names He pointed this out to Spargo There is the list of holders of the silver tickets at the time the race meetings came to an end he said If you were acquainted with this town you would know that those are the names of our best known inhabitants all of course burgesses There s mine you see Quarterpage There s Lummis there s Kaye there s Skene there s Templeby the gentlemen you saw last night All good old town names They all are on this list I know every family mentioned The holders of that time are many of them dead but their successors have the tickets Yes and now that I think of it there s only one man who held a ticket when this list was made about whom I don t know anything at least anything recent The ticket mister Spargo which you ve found must have been his But I thought I thought somebody else had it And this man sir Who was he asked Spargo intuitively conscious that he was coming to news Is his name there The old man ran the tip of his finger down the list of names There it is he said John Maitland Spargo bent over the fine writing Yes John Maitland he observed And who was John Maitland mister Quarterpage shook his head He turned to another of the many drawers in an ancient bureau and began to search amongst a mass of old newspapers carefully sorted into small bundles and tied up If you had lived in Market Milcaster one and twenty years ago mister Spargo he said you would have known who John Maitland was For some time sir he was the best known man in the place aye and in this corner of the world But aye here it is the newspaper of October fifth eighteen ninety one Now mister Spargo you ll find in this old newspaper who John Maitland was and all about him Now I ll tell you what to do I ve just got to go into my office for an hour to talk the day s business over with my son you take this newspaper out into the garden there with one of these cigars and read what ll you find in it and when you ve read that we ll have some more talk Spargo carried the old newspaper into the sunlit garden CHAPTER EIGHTEEN AN OLD NEWSPAPER As soon as Spargo unfolded the paper he saw what he wanted on the middle page headed in two lines of big capitals He lighted a cigar and settled down to read MARKET MILCASTER QUARTER SESSIONS TRIAL OF JOHN MAITLAND The Quarter Sessions for the Borough of Market Milcaster were held on Wednesday last October third eighteen ninety one in the Town Hall before the Recorder Henry John Campernowne esquire K C who was accompanied on the bench by the Worshipful the Mayor of Market Milcaster Alderman Pettiford the Vicar of Market Milcaster the reverend P B Clabberton M A R D Alderman Banks J P Alderman Peters J P Sir Gervais Racton J P Colonel Fludgate J P Captain Murrill J P and other magistrates and gentlemen There was a crowded attendance of the public in anticipation of the trial of John Maitland ex manager of the Market Milcaster Bank and the reserved portions of the Court were filled with the elite of the town and neighbourhood including a considerable number of ladies who manifested the greatest interest in the proceedings The Recorder in charging the Grand Jury said he regretted that the very pleasant and gratifying experience which had been his upon the occasion of his last two official visits to Market Milcaster he referred to the fact that on both those occasions his friend the Worshipful Mayor had been able to present him with a pair of white gloves was not to be repeated on the present occasion It would be their sad and regrettable lot to have before them a fellow townsman whose family had for generations occupied a foremost position in the life of the borough That fellow townsman was charged with one of the most serious offences known to a commercial nation like ours the offence of embezzling the moneys of the bank of which he had for many years been the trusted manager and with which he had been connected all his life since his school days He understood that the prisoner who would shortly be put before the court on his trial was about to plead guilty and there would accordingly be no need for him to direct the gentlemen of the Grand Jury on this matter what he had to say respecting the gravity and even enormity of the offence he would reserve The Recorder then addressed himself to the Grand Jury on the merits of two minor cases which came before the court at a later period of the morning after which they retired and having formally returned a true bill against the prisoner and a petty jury chosen from well known burgesses of the town having been duly sworn JOHN MAITLAND aged forty two bank manager of the Bank House High Street Market Milcaster was formally charged with embezzling on April twenty third eighteen ninety one the sum of Lfour thousand eight hundred seventy five ten s six d the moneys of his employers the Market Milcaster Banking Company limited and converting the same to his own use The prisoner who appeared to feel his position most acutely and who looked very pale and much worn was represented by mister Charles Doolittle the well known barrister of Kingshaven mister Stephens K C appeared on behalf of the prosecution Maitland upon being charged pleaded guilty mister Stephens K C addressing the Recorder said that without any desire to unduly press upon the prisoner who he ventured to think had taken a very wise course in pleading guilty to that particular count in the indictment with which he stood charged he felt bound in the interests of justice to set forth to the Court some particulars of the defalcations which had arisen through the prisoner s much lamented dishonesty He proposed to offer a clear and succinct account of the matter The prisoner John Maitland was the last of an old Market Milcaster family he was in fact he believed with the exception of his own infant son the very last of the race His father had been manager of the bank before him Maitland himself had entered the service of the bank at the age of eighteen when he left the local Grammar School he succeeded his father as manager at the age of thirty two he had therefore occupied this highest position of trust for ten years His directors had the fullest confidence in him they relied on his honesty and his honour they gave him discretionary powers such as no bank manager probably ever enjoyed or held before In fact he was so trusted that he was to all intents and purposes the Market Milcaster Banking Company in other words he was allowed full control over everything and given full licence to do what he liked Whether the directors were wise in extending such liberty to even the most trusted servant it was not for him mister Stephens to say it was some consolation under the circumstances to know that the loss would fall upon the directors inasmuch as they themselves held nearly the whole of the shares But he had to speak of the loss of the serious defalcations which Maitland had committed The prisoner had wisely pleaded guilty to the first count of the indictment But there were no less than seventeen counts in the indictment He had pleaded guilty to embezzling a sum of Lfour thousand eight hundred seventy five odd But the total amount of the defalcations comprised in the seventeen counts was no less it seemed a most amazing sum than Ltwo hundred twenty one thousand five hundred seventy three eight s six d There was the fact the banking company had been robbed of over two hundred thousand pounds by the prisoner in the dock before a mere accident the most trifling chance had revealed to the astounded directors that he was robbing them at all And the most serious feature of the whole case was that not one penny of this money had been or ever could be recovered He believed that the prisoner s learned counsel was about to urge upon the Court that the prisoner himself had been tricked and deceived by another man unfortunately not before the Court a man he understood also well known in Market Milcaster who was now dead and therefore could not be called but whether he was so tricked or deceived was no excuse for his clever and wholesale robbing of his employers He had thought it necessary to put these facts which would not be denied before the Court in order that it might be known how heavy the defalcations really had been and that they should be considered in dealing with the prisoner The Recorder asked if there was no possibility of recovering any part of the vast sum concerned mister Stephens replied that they were informed that there was not the remotest chance the money it was said by prisoner and those acting on his behalf had utterly vanished with the death of the man to whom he had just made reference mister Doolittle on behalf of the prisoner craved to address a few words to the Court in mitigation of sentence He thanked mister Stephens for the considerate and eminently dispassionate manner in which he had outlined the main facts of the case He had no desire to minimize the prisoner s guilt But on prisoner s behalf he desired to tell the true story as to how these things came to be Until as recently as three years previously the prisoner had never made the slightest deviation from the straight path of integrity Unfortunately for him and he believed for some others in Market Milcaster there came to the town three years before the present proceedings a man named Chamberlayne who commenced business in the High Street as a stock and share broker A man of good address and the most plausible manners Chamberlayne attracted a good many people amongst them his unfortunate client It was matter of common knowledge that Chamberlayne had induced numerous persons in Market Milcaster to enter into financial transactions with him it was matter of common repute that those transactions had not always turned out well for Chamberlayne s clients Unhappily for himself Maitland had great faith in Chamberlayne He had begun to have transactions with him in a large way they had gone on and on in a large way until he was involved to vast amounts Believing thoroughly in Chamberlayne and his methods he had entrusted him with very large sums of money The Recorder interrupted mister Doolittle at this point to ask if he was to understand that mister Doolittle was referring to the prisoner s own money mister Doolittle replied that he was afraid the large sums he referred to were the property of the bank But the prisoner had such belief in Chamberlayne that he firmly anticipated that all would be well and that these sums would be repaid and that a vast profit would result from their use The Recorder remarked that he supposed the prisoner intended to put the profit into his own pockets mister Doolittle said at any rate the prisoner assured him that of the two hundred and twenty thousand pounds which was in question Chamberlayne had had the immediate handling of at least two hundred thousand and he the prisoner had not the ghost of a notion as to what Chamberlayne had done with it Unfortunately for everybody for the bank for some other people and especially for his unhappy client Chamberlayne died very suddenly just as these proceedings were instituted and so far it had been absolutely impossible to trace anything of the moneys concerned He had died under mysterious circumstances and there was just as much mystery about his affairs The Recorder observed that he was still waiting to hear what mister Doolittle had to urge in mitigation of any sentence he the Recorder might think fit to pass mister Doolittle said that he would trouble the Court with as few remarks as possible All that he could urge on behalf of the unfortunate man in the dock was that until three years ago he had borne a most exemplary character and had never committed a dishonest action It had been his misfortune his folly to allow a plausible man to persuade him to these acts of dishonesty That man had been called to another account and the prisoner was left to bear the consequences of his association with him It seemed as if Chamberlayne had made away with the money for his own purposes and it might be that it would yet be recovered He would only ask the Court to remember the prisoner s antecedents and his previous good conduct and to bear in mind that whatever his near future might be he was in a commercial sense ruined for life The Recorder in passing sentence said that he had not heard a single word of valid excuse for Maitland s conduct Such dishonesty must be punished in the most severe fashion and the prisoner must go to penal servitude for ten years Maitland who heard the sentence unmoved was removed from the town later in the day to the county jail at Saxchester Spargo read all this swiftly then went over it again noting certain points in it At last he folded up the newspaper and turned to the house to see old Quarterpage beckoning to him from the library window CHAPTER NINETEEN THE CHAMBERLAYNE STORY I perceive sir said mister Quarterpage as Spargo entered the library that you have read the account of the Maitland trial Twice replied Spargo And you have come to the conclusion that but what conclusion have you come to asked mister Quarterpage That the silver ticket in my purse was Maitland s property said Spargo who was not going to give all his conclusions at once Just so agreed the old gentleman I think so I can t think anything else But I was under the impression that I could have accounted for that ticket just as I am sure I can account for the other forty nine Yes and how asked Spargo mister Quarterpage turned to a corner cupboard and in silence produced a decanter and two curiously shaped old wine glasses He carefully polished the glasses with a cloth which he took from a drawer and set glasses and decanter on a table in the window motioning Spargo to take a chair in proximity thereto He himself pulled up his own elbow chair We ll take a glass of my old brown sherry he said Though I say it as shouldn t as the saying goes I don t think you could find better brown sherry than that from Land s End to Berwick upon Tweed mister Spargo no nor further north either where they used to have good taste in liquor in my young days Well here s your good health sir and I ll tell you about Maitland I m curious said Spargo And about more than Maitland I want to know about a lot of things arising out of that newspaper report I want to know something about the man referred to so much the stockbroker Chamberlayne Just so observed mister Quarterpage smiling I thought that would touch your sense of the inquisitive But Maitland first Now when Maitland went to prison he left behind him a child a boy just then about two years old The child s mother was dead Her sister a Miss Baylis appeared on the scene Maitland had married his wife from a distance and took possession of the child and of Maitland s personal effects He had been made bankrupt while he was awaiting his trial and all his household goods were sold But this Miss Baylis took some small personal things and I always believed that she took the silver ticket And she may have done for anything I know to the contrary Anyway she took the child away and there was an end of the Maitland family in Market Milcaster Maitland of course was in due procedure of things removed to Dartmoor and there he served his term There were people who were very anxious to get hold of him when he came out the bank people for they believed that he knew more about the disposition of that money than he d ever told and they wanted to induce him to tell what they hoped he knew between ourselves mister Spargo they were going to make it worth his while to tell Spargo tapped the newspaper which he had retained while the old gentleman talked Then they didn t believe what his counsel said that Chamberlayne got all the money he asked mister Quarterpage laughed No nor anybody else he answered There was a strong idea in the town you ll see why afterwards that it was all a put up job and that Maitland cheerfully underwent his punishment knowing that there was a nice fortune waiting for him when he came out And as I say the bank people meant to get hold of him But though they sent a special agent to meet him on his release they never did get hold of him Some mistake arose when Maitland was released he got clear away Nobody s ever heard a word of him from that day to this Unless Miss Baylis has Where does this Miss Baylis live asked Spargo Well I don t know replied mister Quarterpage She did live in Brighton when she took the child away and her address was known and I have it somewhere But when the bank people sought her out after Maitland s release she too had clean disappeared and all efforts to trace her failed In fact according to the folks who lived near her in Brighton she d completely disappeared with the child five years before So there wasn t a clue to Maitland He served his time made a model prisoner they did find that much out earned the maximum remission was released and vanished And for that very reason there s a theory about him in this very town to this very day What asked Spargo This That he s now living comfortably luxuriously abroad on what he got from the bank replied mister Quarterpage They say that the sister in law was in at the game that when she disappeared with the child she went abroad somewhere and made a home ready for Maitland and that he went off to them as soon as he came out Do you see I suppose that was possible said Spargo Quite possible sir But now continued the old gentleman replenishing the glasses now we come on to the Chamberlayne story It s a good deal more to do with the Maitland story than appears at first sight I ll tell it to you and you can form your own conclusions Chamberlayne was a man who came to Market Milcaster I don t know from where in eighteen eighty six five years before the Maitland smash up He was then about Maitland s age a man of thirty seven or eight He came as clerk to old mister Vallas the rope and twine manufacturer Vallas s place is still there at the bottom of the High Street near the river though old Vallas is dead He was a smart cute pushing chap this Chamberlayne he made himself indispensable to old Vallas and old Vallas paid him a rare good salary He settled down in the town and he married a town girl one of the Corkindales the saddlers when he d been here three years Unfortunately she died in childbirth within a year of their marriage It was very soon after that that Chamberlayne threw up his post at Vallas s and started business as a stock and share broker He d been a saving man he d got a nice bit of money with his wife he always let it be known that he had money of his own and he started in a good way He was a man of the most plausible manners he d have coaxed butter out of a dog s throat if he d wanted to The moneyed men of the town believed in him I believed in him myself mister Spargo I d many a transaction with him and I never lost aught by him on the contrary he did very well for me He did well for most of his clients there were of course ups and downs but on the whole he satisfied his clients uncommonly well But naturally nobody ever knew what was going on between him and Maitland I gather from this report said Spargo that everything came out suddenly unexpectedly That was so sir replied mister Quarterpage Sudden Unexpected Aye as a crack of thunder on a fine winter s day Nobody had the ghost of a notion that anything was wrong John Maitland was much respected in the town much thought of by everybody well known to everybody I can assure you mister Spargo that it was no pleasant thing to have to sit on that grand jury as I did I was its foreman sir and hear a man sentenced that you d regarded as a bosom friend But there it was How was the thing discovered asked Spargo anxious to get at facts In this way replied mister Quarterpage The Market Milcaster Bank is in reality almost entirely the property of two old families in the town the Gutchbys and the Hostables Owing to the death of his father a young Hostable fresh from college came into the business He was a shrewd keen young fellow he got some suspicion somehow about Maitland and he insisted on the other partners consenting to a special investigation and on their making it suddenly And Maitland was caught before he had a chance But we re talking about Chamberlayne Yes about Chamberlayne agreed Spargo Well now Maitland was arrested one evening continued mister Quarterpage Of course the news of his arrest ran through the town like wild fire Everybody was astonished he was at that time aye and had been for years a churchwarden at the Parish Church and I don t think there could have been more surprise if we d heard that the Vicar had been arrested for bigamy In a little town like this news is all over the place in a few minutes Of course Chamberlayne would hear that news like everybody else But it was remembered and often remarked upon afterwards that from the moment of Maitland s arrest nobody in Market Milcaster ever had speech with Chamberlayne again After his wife s death he d taken to spending an hour or so of an evening across there at the Dragon where you saw me and my friends last night but on that night he didn t go to the Dragon And next morning he caught the eight o clock train to London He happened to remark to the stationmaster as he got into the train that he expected to be back late that night and that he should have a tiring day of it But Chamberlayne didn t come back that night mister Spargo He didn t come back to Market Milcaster for four days and when he did come back it was in a coffin Dead exclaimed Spargo That was sudden Very sudden agreed mister Quarterpage Yes sir he came back in his coffin did Chamberlayne On the very evening on which he d spoken of being back there came a telegram here to say that he d died very suddenly at the Cosmopolitan Hotel That telegram came to his brother in law Corkindale the saddler you ll find him down the street opposite the Town Hall It was sent to Corkindale by a nephew of Chamberlayne s another Chamberlayne Stephen who lived in London and was understood to be on the Stock Exchange there I saw that telegram mister Spargo and it was a long one It said that Chamberlayne had had a sudden seizure and though a doctor had been got to him he d died shortly afterwards Now as Chamberlayne had his nephew and friends in London his brother in law Tom Corkindale didn t feel that there was any necessity for him to go up to town so he just sent off a wire to Stephen Chamberlayne asking if there was aught he could do And next morning came another wire from Stephen saying that no inquest would be necessary as the doctor had been present and able to certify the cause of death and would Corkindale make all arrangements for the funeral two days later You see Chamberlayne had bought a vault in our cemetery when he buried his wife so naturally they wished to bury him in it with her Spargo nodded He was beginning to imagine all sorts of things and theories he was taking everything in Well continued mister Quarterpage on the second day after that they brought Chamberlayne s body down Three of em came with it Stephen Chamberlayne the doctor who d been called in and a solicitor Everything was done according to proper form and usage As Chamberlayne had been well known in the town a good number of townsfolk met the body at the station and followed it to the cemetery Of course many of us who had been clients of Chamberlayne s were anxious to know how he had come to such a sudden end According to Stephen Chamberlayne s account our Chamberlayne had wired to him and to his solicitor to meet him at the Cosmopolitan to do some business They were awaiting him there when he arrived and they had lunch together After that they got to their business in a private room Towards the end of the afternoon Chamberlayne was taken suddenly ill and though they got a doctor to him at once he died before evening The doctor said he d a diseased heart Anyhow he was able to certify the cause of his death so there was no inquest and they buried him as I have told you The old gentleman paused and taking a sip at his sherry smiled at some reminiscence which occurred to him Well he said presently going on of course on that came all the Maitland revelations and Maitland vowed and declared that Chamberlayne had not only had nearly all the money but that he was absolutely certain that most of it was in his hands in hard cash But Chamberlayne mister Spargo had left practically nothing All that could be traced was about three or four thousand pounds He d left everything to his nephew Stephen There wasn t a trace a clue to the vast sums with which Maitland had entrusted him And then people began to talk and they said what some of them say to this very day What s that asked Spargo mister Quarterpage leaned forward and tapped his guest on the arm That Chamberlayne never did die and that that coffin was weighted with lead he answered CHAPTER TWENTY MAITLAND ALIAS MARBURY This remarkable declaration awoke such a new conception of matters in Spargo s mind aroused such infinitely new possibilities in his imagination that for a full moment he sat silently staring at his informant who chuckled with quiet enjoyment at his visitor s surprise Do you mean to tell me said Spargo at last that there are people in this town who still believe that the coffin in your cemetery which is said to contain Chamberlayne s body contains lead Lots of em my dear sir replied mister Quarterpage Lots of em Go out in the street and asked the first six men you meet and I ll go bail that four out of the six believe it Then why in the sacred name of common sense did no one ever take steps to make certain asked Spargo Why didn t they get an order for exhumation Because it was nobody s particular business to do so answered mister Quarterpage You don t know country town life my dear sir In towns like Market Milcaster folks talk and gossip a great deal but they re always slow to do anything It s a case of who ll start first of initiative And if they see it s going to cost anything then they ll have nothing to do with it But the bank people suggested Spargo mister Quarterpage shook his head They re amongst the lot who believe that Chamberlayne did die he said They re very old fashioned conservative minded people the Gutchbys and the Hostables and they accepted the version of the nephew and the doctor and the solicitor But now I ll tell you something about those three There was a man here in the town a gentleman of your own profession who came to edit that paper you ve got on your knee He got interested in this Chamberlayne case and he began to make enquiries with the idea of getting hold of some good what do you call it I suppose he d call it copy said Spargo Copy that was his term agreed mister Quarterpage Well he took the trouble to go to London to ask some quiet questions of the nephew Stephen That was just twelve months after Chamberlayne had been buried But he found that Stephen Chamberlayne had left England months before Gone they said to one of the colonies but they didn t know which And the solicitor had also gone And the doctor couldn t be traced no sir not even through the Medical Register What do you think of all that mister Spargo I think answered Spargo that Market Milcaster folk are considerably slow I should have had that death and burial enquired into The whole thing looks to me like a conspiracy Well sir it was as I say nobody s business said mister Quarterpage The newspaper gentleman tried to stir up interest in it but it was no good and very soon afterwards he left And there it is mister Quarterpage said Spargo what s your own honest opinion The old gentleman smiled Ah he said I ve often wondered mister Spargo if I really have an opinion on that point I think that what I probably feel about the whole affair is that there was a good deal of mystery attaching to it But we seem sir to have gone a long way from the question of that old silver ticket which you ve got in your purse Now No said Spargo interrupting his host with an accompanying wag of his forefinger No I think we re coming nearer to it Now you ve given me a great deal of your time mister Quarterpage and told me a lot and first of all before I tell you a lot I m going to show you something And Spargo took out of his pocket book a carefully mounted photograph of John Marbury the original of the process picture which he had had made for the Watchman He handed it over Do you recognize that photograph as that of anybody you know he asked Look at it well and closely mister Quarterpage put on a special pair of spectacles and studied the photograph from several points of view No sir he said at last with a shake of the head I don t recognize it at all Can t see in it any resemblance to any man you ve ever known asked Spargo No sir none replied mister Quarterpage None whatever Very well said Spargo laying the photograph on the table between them Now then I want you to tell me what John Maitland was like when you knew him Also I want you to describe Chamberlayne as he was when he died or was supposed to die You remember them of course quite well mister Quarterpage got up and moved to the door I can do better than that he said I can show you photographs of both men as they were just before Maitland s trial I have a photograph of a small group of Market Milcaster notabilities which was taken at a municipal garden party Maitland and Chamberlayne are both in it It s been put away in a cabinet in my drawing room for many a long year and I ve no doubt it s as fresh as when it was taken He left the room and presently returned with a large mounted photograph which he laid on the table before his visitor There you are sir he said Quite fresh you see it must be getting on to twenty years since that was taken out of the drawer that it s been kept in Now that s Maitland And that s Chamberlayne Spargo found himself looking at a group of men who stood against an ivy covered wall in the stiff attitudes in which photographers arrange masses of sitters He fixed his attention on the two figures indicated by mister Quarterpage and saw two medium heighted rather sturdily built men about whom there was nothing very specially noticeable Um he said musingly Both bearded Yes they both wore beards full beards assented mister Quarterpage And you see they weren t so much alike But Maitland was a much darker man than Chamberlayne and he had brown eyes while Chamberlayne s were rather a bright blue The removal of a beard makes a great difference remarked Spargo He looked at the photograph of Maitland in the group comparing it with that of Marbury which he had taken from his pocket And twenty years makes a difference too he added musingly To some people twenty years makes a vast difference sir said the old gentleman To others it makes none I haven t changed much they tell me during the past twenty years But I ve known men change age almost beyond recognition in five years It depends sir on what they go through Spargo suddenly laid aside the photographs put his hands in his pockets and looked steadfastly at mister Quarterpage Look here he said I m going to tell you what I m after mister Quarterpage I m sure you ve heard all about what s known as the Middle Temple Murder the Marbury case Yes I ve read of it replied mister Quarterpage Have you read the accounts of it in my paper the Watchman asked Spargo mister Quarterpage shook his head I ve only read one newspaper sir since I was a young man he replied I take the Times sir we always took it aye even in the days when newspapers were taxed Very good said Spargo But perhaps I can tell you a little more than you ve read for I ve been working up that case ever since the body of the man known as John Marbury was found Now if you ll just give me your attention I ll tell you the whole story from that moment until now And Spargo briefly succinctly re told the story of the Marbury case from the first instant of his own connection with it until the discovery of the silver ticket and mister Quarterpage listened in rapt attention nodding his head from time to time as the younger man made his points And now mister Quarterpage concluded Spargo this is the point I ve come to I believe that the man who came to the Anglo Orient Hotel as John Marbury and who was undoubtedly murdered in Middle Temple Lane that night was John Maitland I haven t a doubt about it after learning what you tell me about the silver ticket I ve found out a great deal that s valuable here and I think I m getting nearer to a solution of the mystery That is of course to find out who murdered John Maitland or Marbury What you have told me about the Chamberlayne affair has led me to think this there may have been people or a person in London who was anxious to get Marbury as we ll call him out of the way and who somehow encountered him that night anxious to silence him I mean because of the Chamberlayne affair And I wondered as there is so much mystery about him and as he won t give any account of himself if this man Aylmore was really Chamberlayne Yes I wondered that But Aylmore s a tall finely built man quite six feet in height and his beard though it s now getting grizzled has been very dark and Chamberlayne you say was a medium sized fair man with blue eyes That s so sir assented mister Quarterpage Yes a middling sized man and fair very fair Deary me mister Spargo this is a revelation And you really think sir that John Maitland and John Marbury are one and the same person I m sure of it now said Spargo I see it in this way Maitland on his release went out to Australia and there he stopped At last he comes back evidently well to do He s murdered the very day of his arrival Aylmore is the only man who knows anything of him Aylmore won t tell all he knows that s flat But Aylmore s admitted that he knew him at some vague date say from twenty one to twenty two or three years ago Now where did Aylmore know him He says in London That s a vague term He won t say where he won t say anything definite he won t even say what he Aylmore himself was in those days Do you recollect anything of anybody like Aylmore coming here to see Maitland mister Quarterpage I don t answered mister Quarterpage Maitland was a very quiet retiring fellow sir he was about the quietest man in the town I never remember that he had visitors certainly I ve no recollection of such a friend of his as this Aylmore from your description of him would be at that time Did Maitland go up to London much in those days asked Spargo mister Quarterpage laughed Well now to show you what a good memory I have he said I ll tell you of something that occurred across there at the Dragon only a few months before the Maitland affair came out There were some of us in there one evening and for a rare thing Maitland came in with Chamberlayne Chamberlayne happened to remark that he was going up to town next day he was always to and fro and we got talking about London And Maitland said in course of conversation that he believed he was about the only man of his age in England and of course he meant of his class and means who d never even seen London And I don t think he ever went there between that time and his trial in fact I m sure he didn t for if he had I should have heard of it Well that s queer remarked Spargo It s very queer For I m certain Maitland and Marbury are one and the same person My theory about that old leather box is that Maitland had that carefully planted before his arrest that he dug it up when he came put of Dartmoor that he took it off to Australia with him that he brought it back with him and that of course the silver ticket and the photograph had been in it all these years Now At that moment the door of the library was opened and a parlourmaid looked in at her master There s the boots from the Dragon at the front door sir she said He s brought two telegrams across from there for mister Spargo thinking he might like to have them at once CHAPTER TWENTY ONE ARRESTED Spargo hurried out to the hall took the two telegrams from the boots of the Dragon and tearing open the envelopes read the messages hastily He went back to mister Quarterpage Here s important news he said as he closed the library door and resumed his seat I ll read these telegrams to you sir and then we can discuss them in the light of what we ve been talking about this morning The first is from our office I told you we sent over to Australia for a full report about Marbury at the place he said he hailed from Coolumbidgee That report s just reached the Watchman and they ve wired it on to me It s from the chief of police at Coolumbidgee to the editor of the Watchman London John Marbury came to Coolumbidgee in the winter of eighteen ninety eight nine He was unaccompanied He appeared to be in possession of fairly considerable means and bought a share in a small sheep farm from its proprietor Andrew Robertson who is still here and who says that Marbury never told him anything about himself except that he had emigrated for health reasons and was a widower He mentioned that he had had a son who was dead and was now without relations He lived a very quiet steady life on the sheep farm never leaving it for many years About six months ago however he paid a visit to Melbourne and on returning told Robertson that he had decided to return to England in consequence of some news he had received and must therefore sell his share in the farm Robertson bought it from him for three thousand pounds and Marbury shortly afterwards left for Melbourne From what we could gather Robertson thinks Marbury was probably in command of five or six thousand when he left Coolumbidgee He told Robertson that he had met a man in Melbourne who had given him news that surprised him but did not say what news He had in his possession when he left Robertson exactly the luggage he brought with him when he came a stout portmanteau and a small square leather box There are no effects of his left behind at Coolumbidgee That s all said Spargo laying the first of the telegrams on the table And it seems to me to signify a good deal But now here s more startling news This is from Rathbury the Scotland Yard detective that I told you of mister Quarterpage he promised you know to keep me posted in what went on in my absence Here s what he says Fresh evidence tending to incriminate Aylmore has come to hand Authorities have decided to arrest him on suspicion You d better hurry back if you want material for to morrow s paper Spargo threw that telegram down too waited while the old gentleman glanced at both of them with evident curiosity and then jumped up Well I shall have to go mister Quarterpage he said I looked the trains out this morning so as to be in readiness I can catch the one point twenty to Paddington that ll get me in before half past four I ve an hour yet Now there s another man I want to see in Market Milcaster That s the photographer or a photographer You remember I told you of the photograph found with the silver ticket Well I m calculating that that photograph was taken here and I want to see the man who took it if he s alive and I can find him mister Quarterpage rose and put on his hat There s only one photographer in this town sir he said and he s been here for a good many years Cooper I ll take you to him it s only a few doors away Spargo wasted no time in letting the photographer know what he wanted He put a direct question to mister Cooper an elderly man Do you remember taking a photograph of the child of John Maitland the bank manager some twenty or twenty one years ago he asked after mister Quarterpage had introduced him as a gentleman from London who wanted to ask a few questions Quite well sir replied mister Cooper As well as if it had been yesterday Do you still happen to have a copy of it asked Spargo But mister Cooper had already turned to a row of file albums He took down one labelled eighteen ninety one and began to search its pages In a minute or two he laid it on his table before his callers There you are sir he said That s the child Spargo gave one glance at the photograph and turned to mister Quarterpage Just as I thought he said That s the same photograph we found in the leather box with the silver ticket I m obliged to you mister Cooper Now there s just one more question I want to ask Did you ever supply any further copies of this photograph to anybody after the Maitland affair that is after the family had left the town Yes replied the photographer I supplied half a dozen copies to Miss Baylis the child s aunt who as a matter of fact brought him here to be photographed And I can give you her address too he continued beginning to turn over another old file I have it somewhere mister Quarterpage nudged Spargo That s something I couldn t have done he remarked As I told you she d disappeared from Brighton when enquiries were made after Maitland s release Here you are said mister Cooper I sent six copies of that photograph to Miss Baylis in April eighteen ninety five Her address was then six Chichester Square Bayswater W Spargo rapidly wrote this address down thanked the photographer for his courtesy and went out with mister Quarterpage In the street he turned to the old gentleman with a smile Well I don t think there s much doubt about that he exclaimed Maitland and Marbury are the same man mister Quarterpage I m as certain of that as that I see your Town Hall there And what will you do next sir enquired mister Quarterpage Thank you as I do for all your kindness and assistance and get off to town by this one point twenty replied Spargo And I shan t fail to let you know how things go on One moment said the old gentleman as Spargo was hurrying away do you think this mister Aylmore really murdered Maitland No answered Spargo with emphasis I don t And I think we ve got a good deal to do before we find out who did Spargo purposely let the Marbury case drop out of his mind during his journey to town He ate a hearty lunch in the train and talked with his neighbours it was a relief to let his mind and attention turn to something else than the theme which had occupied it unceasingly for so many days But at Reading the newspaper boys were shouting the news of the arrest of a Member of Parliament and Spargo glancing out of the window caught sight of a newspaper placard THE MARBURY MURDER CASE ARREST OF mister AYLMORE He snatched a paper from a boy as the train moved out and unfolding it found a mere announcement in the space reserved for stop press news mister Stephen Aylmore M P was arrested at two o clock this afternoon on his way to the House of Commons on a charge of being concerned in the murder of John Marbury in Middle Temple Lane on the night of June twenty first last It is understood he will be brought up at Bow Street at ten o clock tomorrow morning Spargo hurried to New Scotland Yard as soon as he reached Paddington He met Rathbury coming away from his room At sight of him the detective turned back Well so there you are he said I suppose you ve heard the news Spargo nodded as he dropped into a chair What led to it he asked abruptly There must have been something There was something he replied The thing stick bludgeon whatever you like to call it some foreign article with which Marbury was struck down was found last night Well asked Spargo It was proved to be Aylmore s property answered Rathbury It was a South American curio that he had in his rooms in Fountain Court Where was it found asked Spargo Rathbury laughed He was a clumsy fellow who did it whether he was Aylmore or whoever he was he replied Do you know it had been dropped into a sewer trap in Middle Temple Lane actually Perhaps the murderer thought it would be washed out into the Thames and float away But of course it was bound to come to light A sewer man found it yesterday evening and it was quickly recognized by the woman who cleans up for Aylmore as having been in his rooms ever since she knew them What does Aylmore say about it asked Spargo I suppose he s said something Says that the bludgeon is certainly his and that he brought it from South America with him announced Rathbury but that he doesn t remember seeing it in his rooms for some time and thinks that it was stolen from them Um said Spargo musingly But how do you know that was the thing that Marbury was struck down with Rathbury smiled grimly There s some of his hair on it mixed with blood he answered No doubt about that Well anything come of your jaunt westward Yes replied Spargo Lots Good asked Rathbury Extra good I ve found out who Marbury really was No Really No doubt to my mind I m certain of it Rathbury sat down at his desk watching Spargo with rapt attention And who was he he asked John Maitland once of Market Milcaster replied Spargo Ex bank manager Also ex convict Ex convict Ex convict He was sentenced at Market Milcaster Quarter Sessions in autumn eighteen ninety one to ten years penal servitude for embezzling the bank s money to the tune of over two hundred thousand pounds Served his term at Dartmoor Went to Australia as soon or soon after he came out That s who Marbury was Maitland Dead certain Rathbury still stared at his caller Go on he said Tell all about it Spargo Let s hear every detail I ll tell you all I know after But what I know s nothing to that Spargo told him the whole story of his adventures at Market Milcaster and the detective listened with rapt attention Yes he said at the end Yes I don t think there s much doubt about that Well that clears up a lot doesn t it Spargo yawned Yes a whole slate full is wiped off there he said I haven t so much interest in Marbury or Maitland now My interest is all in Aylmore Rathbury nodded Yes he said The thing to find out is who is Aylmore or who was he twenty years ago Your people haven t found anything out then asked Spargo Nothing beyond the irreproachable history of mister Aylmore since he returned to this country a very rich man some ten years since answered Rathbury smiling They ve no previous dates to go on What are you going to do next Spargo Seek out that Miss Baylis replied Spargo You think you could get something there asked Rathbury Look here said Spargo I don t believe for a second Aylmore killed Marbury I believe I shall get at the truth by following up what I call the Maitland trail This Miss Baylis must know something if she s alive Well now I m going to report at the office Keep in touch with me Rathbury He went on then to the Watchman office and as he got out of his taxi cab at its door another cab came up and set down mister Aylmore s daughters CHAPTER TWENTY TWO THE BLANK PAST Jessie Aylmore came forward to meet Spargo with ready confidence the elder girl hung back diffidently May we speak to you said Jessie We have come on purpose to speak to you Evelyn didn t want to come but I made her come Spargo shook hands silently with Evelyn Aylmore and motioned them both to follow him He took them straight upstairs to his room and bestowed them in his easiest chairs before he addressed them I ve only just got back to town he said abruptly I was sorry to hear the news about your father That s what s brought you here of course But I m afraid I can t do much I told you that we had no right to trouble mister Spargo Jessie said Evelyn Aylmore What can he do to help us Jessie shook her head impatiently The Watchman s about the most powerful paper in London isn t it she said And isn t mister Spargo writing all these articles about the Marbury case mister Spargo you must help us Spargo sat down at his desk and began turning over the letters and papers which had accumulated during his absence To be absolutely frank with you he said presently I don t see how anybody s going to help so long as your father keeps up that mystery about the past That said Evelyn quietly is exactly what Ronald says Jessie But we can t make our father speak mister Spargo That he is as innocent as we are of this terrible crime we are certain and we don t know why he wouldn t answer the questions put to him at the inquest And we know no more than you know or anyone knows and though I have begged my father to speak he won t say a word We saw his danger Ronald mister Breton told us and we implored him to tell everything he knew about mister Marbury But so far he has simply laughed at the idea that he had anything to do with the murder or could be arrested for it and now And now he s locked up said Spargo in his usual matter of fact fashion Well there are people who have to be saved from themselves you know Perhaps you ll have to save your father from the consequences of his own shall we say obstinacy Now look here between ourselves how much do you know about your father s past The two sisters looked at each other and then at Spargo Nothing said the elder Absolutely nothing said the younger Answer a few plain questions said Spargo I m not going to print your replies nor make use of them in any way I m only asking the questions with a desire to help you Have you any relations in England None that we know of replied Evelyn Nobody you could go to for information about the past asked Spargo No nobody Spargo drummed his fingers on his blotting pad He was thinking hard How old is your father he asked suddenly He was fifty nine a few weeks ago answered Evelyn And how old are you and how old is your sister demanded Spargo I am twenty and Jessie is nearly nineteen Where were you born Both of us at San Gregorio which is in the San Jose province of Argentina north of Monte Video Your father was in business there He was in business in the export trade mister Spargo There s no secret about that He exported all sorts of things to England and to France skins hides wools dried salts fruit That s how he made his money You don t know how long he d been there when you were born No Was he married when he went out there No he wasn t We do know that He s told us the circumstances of his marriage because they were romantic When he sailed from England to Buenos Ayres he met on the steamer a young lady who he said was like himself relationless and nearly friendless She was going out to Argentina as a governess She and my father fell in love with each other and they were married in Buenos Ayres soon after the steamer arrived And your mother is dead My mother died before we came to England I was eight years old and Jessie six then And you came to England how long after that Two years So that you ve been in England ten years And you know nothing whatever of your father s past beyond what you ve told me Nothing absolutely nothing Never heard him talk of you see according to your account your father was a man of getting on to forty when he went out to Argentina He must have had a career of some sort in this country Have you never heard him speak of his boyhood Did he never talk of old times or that sort of thing I never remember hearing my father speak of any period antecedent to his marriage replied Evelyn I once asked him a question about his childhood said Jessie He answered that his early days had not been very happy ones and that he had done his best to forget them So I never asked him anything again So that it really comes to this remarked Spargo You know nothing whatever about your father his family his fortunes his life beyond what you yourselves have observed since you were able to observe That s about it isn t it I should say that that is exactly it answered Evelyn Just so said Spargo And therefore as I told your sister the other day the public will say that your father has some dark secret behind him and that Marbury had possession of it and that your father killed him in order to silence him That isn t my view I not only believe your father to be absolutely innocent but I believe that he knows no more than a child unborn of Marbury s murder and I m doing my best to find out who that murderer was By the by since you ll see all about it in tomorrow morning s Watchman I may as well tell you that I ve found out who Marbury really was He At this moment Spargo s door was opened and in walked Ronald Breton He shook his head at sight of the two sisters I thought I should find you here he said Jessie said she was coming to see you Spargo I don t know what good you can do I don t see what good the most powerful newspaper in the world can do My God everything s about as black as ever it can be mister Aylmore I ve just come away from him his solicitor Stratton and I have been with him for an hour is obstinate as ever he will not tell more than he has told Whatever good can you do Spargo when he won t speak about that knowledge of Marbury which he must have Oh well said Spargo Perhaps we can give him some information about Marbury mister Aylmore has forgotten that it s not such a difficult thing to rake up the past as he seems to think it is For example as I was just telling these young ladies I myself have discovered who Marbury really was Breton started You have Without doubt he exclaimed Without reasonable doubt Marbury was an ex convict Spargo watched the effect of this sudden announcement The two girls showed no sign of astonishment or of unusual curiosity they received the news with as much unconcern as if Spargo had told them that Marbury was a famous musician But Ronald Breton started and it seemed to Spargo that he saw a sense of suspicion dawn in his eyes Marbury an ex convict he exclaimed You mean that Read your Watchman in the morning said Spargo You ll find the whole story there I m going to write it tonight when you people have gone It ll make good reading Evelyn and Jessie Aylmore took Spargo s hint and went away Spargo seeing them to the door with another assurance of his belief in their father s innocence and his determination to hunt down the real criminal Ronald Breton went down with them to the street and saw them into a cab but in another minute he was back in Spargo s room as Spargo had expected He shut the door carefully behind him and turned to Spargo with an eager face I say Spargo is that really so he asked About Marbury being an ex convict That s so Breton I ve no more doubt about it than I have that I see you Marbury was in reality one John Maitland a bank manager of Market Milcaster who got ten years penal servitude in eighteen ninety one for embezzlement In eighteen ninety one Why that s just about the time that Aylmore says he knew him Exactly And it just strikes me said Spargo sitting down at his desk and making a hurried note it just strikes me didn t Aylmore say he knew Marbury in London Certainly replied Breton In London Um mused Spargo That s queer because Maitland had never been in London up to the time of his going to Dartmoor whatever he may have done when he came out of Dartmoor and of course Aylmore had gone to South America long before that Look here Breton he continued aloud have you access to Aylmore Will you can you see him before he s brought up at Bow Street tomorrow Yes answered Breton I can see him with his solicitor Then listen said Spargo Tomorrow morning you ll find the whole story of how I proved Marbury s identity with Maitland in the Watchman Read it as early as you can get an interview with Aylmore as early as you can make him read it every word before he s brought up Beg him if he values his own safety and his daughters peace of mind to throw away all that foolish reserve and to tell all he knows about Maitland twenty years ago He should have done that at first Why I was asking his daughters some questions before you came in they know absolutely nothing of their father s history previous to the time when they began to understand things Don t you see that Aylmore s career previous to his return to England is a blank past I know I know said Breton Yes although I ve gone there a great deal I never heard Aylmore speak of anything earlier than his Argentine experiences And yet he must have been getting on when he went out there Thirty seven or eight at least remarked Spargo Well Aylmore s more or less of a public man and no public man can keep his life hidden nowadays By the by how did you get to know the Aylmores My guardian mister Elphick and I met them in Switzerland answered Breton We kept up the acquaintance after our return mister Elphick still interesting himself in the Marbury case asked Spargo Very much so And so is old Cardlestone at the foot of whose stairs the thing came off I dined with them last night and they talked of little else said Breton And their theory Oh still the murder for the sake of robbery replied Breton Old Cardlestone is furious that such a thing could have happened at his very door He says that there ought to be a thorough enquiry into every tenant of the Temple Longish business that observed Spargo Well run away now Breton I must write Shall you be at Bow Street tomorrow morning asked Breton as he moved to the door It s to be at ten thirty No I shan t replied Spargo It ll only be a remand and I know already just as much as I should hear there I ve got something much more important to do But you ll remember what I asked of you get Aylmore to read my story in the Watchman and beg him to speak out and tell all he knows all And when Breton had gone Spargo again murmured those last words All he knows all CHAPTER TWENTY THREE MISS BAYLIS Next day a little before noon Spargo found himself in one of those pretentious yet dismal Bayswater squares which are almost entirely given up to the trade calling or occupation of the lodging and boarding house keeper They are very pretentious those squares with their many storied houses their stuccoed frontages and their pilastered and balconied doorways innocent country folk coming into them from the neighbouring station of Paddington take them to be the residences of the dukes and earls who of course live nowhere else but in London They are further encouraged in this belief by the fact that young male persons in evening dress are often seen at the doorways in more or less elegant attitudes These of course are taken by the country folk to be young lords enjoying the air of Bayswater but others more knowing are aware that they are Swiss or German waiters whose linen might be cleaner Spargo gauged the character of the house at which he called as soon as the door was opened to him There was the usual smell of eggs and bacon of fish and chops the usual mixed and ancient collection of overcoats wraps and sticks in the hall the usual sort of parlourmaid to answer the bell And presently in answer to his enquiries there was the usual type of landlady confronting him a more than middle aged person who desired to look younger and made attempts in the way of false hair teeth and a little rouge and who wore that somewhat air and smile which in its wearer under these circumstances always means that she is considering whether you will be able to cheat her or whether she will be able to see you You wish to see Miss Baylis said this person examining Spargo closely Miss Baylis does not often see anybody I hope said Spargo politely that Miss Baylis is not an invalid No she s not an invalid replied the landlady but she s not as young as she was and she s an objection to strangers Is it anything I can tell her No said Spargo But you can if you please take her a message from me Will you kindly give her my card and tell her that I wish to ask her a question about John Maitland of Market Milcaster and that I should be much obliged if she would give me a few minutes Perhaps you will sit down said the landlady She led Spargo into a room which opened out upon a garden in it two or three old ladies evidently inmates were sitting The landlady left Spargo to sit with them and to amuse himself by watching them knit or sew or read the papers and he wondered if they always did these things every day and if they would go on doing them until a day would come when they would do them no more and he was beginning to feel very dreary when the door opened and a woman entered whom Spargo after one sharp glance at her decided to be a person who was undoubtedly out of the common And as she slowly walked across the room towards him he let his first glance lengthen into a look of steady inspection The woman whom Spargo thus narrowly inspected was of very remarkable appearance She was almost masculine she stood nearly six feet in height she was of a masculine gait and tread and spare muscular and athletic What at once struck Spargo about her face was the strange contrast between her dark eyes and her white hair the hair worn in abundant coils round a well shaped head was of the most snowy whiteness the eyes of a real coal blackness as were also the eyebrows above them The features were well cut and of a striking firmness the jaw square and determined And Spargo s first thought on taking all this in was that Miss Baylis seemed to have been fitted by Nature to be a prison wardress or the matron of a hospital or the governess of an unruly girl and he began to wonder if he would ever manage to extract anything out of those firmly locked lips Miss Baylis on her part looked Spargo over as if she was half minded to order him to instant execution And Spargo was so impressed by her that he made a profound bow and found a difficulty in finding his tongue mister Spargo she said in a deep voice which seemed peculiarly suited to her Of I see the Watchman You wish to speak to me Spargo again bowed in silence She signed him to the window near which they were standing Open the casement if you please she commanded him We will walk in the garden This is not private Spargo obediently obeyed her orders she swept through the opened window and he followed her It was not until they had reached the bottom of the garden that she spoke again I understand that you desire to ask me some question about John Maitland of Market Milcaster she said Before you put it I must ask you a question Do you wish any reply I may give you for publication Not without your permission replied Spargo I should not think of publishing anything you may tell me except with your express permission She looked at him gloomily seemed to gather an impression of his good faith and nodded her head In that case she said what do you want to ask I have lately had reason for making certain enquiries about John Maitland answered Spargo I suppose you read the newspapers and possibly the Watchman Miss Baylis But Miss Baylis shook her head I read no newspapers she said I have no interest in the affairs of the world I have work which occupies all my time I give my whole devotion to it Then you have not recently heard of what is known as the Marbury case a case of a man who was found murdered asked Spargo I have not she answered I am not likely to hear such things Spargo suddenly realized that the power of the Press is not quite as great nor as far reaching as very young journalists hold it to be and that there actually are even in London people who can live quite cheerfully without a newspaper He concealed his astonishment and went on Well he said I believe that the murdered man known to the police as John Marbury was in reality your brother in law John Maitland In fact Miss Baylis I m absolutely certain of it He made this declaration with some emphasis and looked at his stern companion to see how she was impressed But Miss Baylis showed no sign of being impressed I can quite believe that mister Spargo she said coldly It is no surprise to me that John Maitland should come to such an end He was a thoroughly bad and unprincipled man who brought the most terrible disgrace on those who were unfortunately connected with him He was likely to die a bad man s death I may ask you a few questions about him suggested Spargo in his most insinuating manner You may so long as you do not drag my name into the papers she replied But pray how do you know that I have the sad shame of being John Maitland s sister in law I found that out at Market Milcaster said Spargo The photographer told me Cooper Ah she exclaimed The questions I want to ask are very simple said Spargo But your answers may materially help me You remember Maitland going to prison of course Miss Baylis laughed a laugh of scorn Could I ever forget it she exclaimed Did you ever visit him in prison asked Spargo Visit him in prison she said indignantly Visits in prison are to be paid to those who deserve them who are repentant not to scoundrels who are hardened in their sin All right Did you ever see him after he left prison I saw him for he forced himself upon me I could not help myself He was in my presence before I was aware that he had even been released What did he come for asked Spargo To ask for his son who had been in my charge she replied That s a thing I want to know about said Spargo Do you know what a certain lot of people in Market Milcaster say to this day Miss Baylis they say that you were in at the game with Maitland that you had a lot of the money placed in your charge that when Maitland went to prison you took the child away first to Brighton then abroad disappeared with him and that you made a home ready for Maitland when he came out That s what s said by some people in Market Milcaster Miss Baylis s stern lips curled People in Market Milcaster she exclaimed All the people I ever knew in Market Milcaster had about as many brains between them as that cat on the wall there As for making a home for John Maitland I would have seen him die in the gutter of absolute want before I would have given him a crust of dry bread You appear to have a terrible dislike of this man observed Spargo astonished at her vehemence I had and I have she answered He tricked my sister into a marriage with him when he knew that she would rather have married an honest man who worshipped her he treated her with quiet infernal cruelty he robbed her and me of the small fortunes our father left us Ah said Spargo Well so you say Maitland came to you when he came out of prison to ask for his boy Did he take the boy No the boy was dead Dead eh Then I suppose Maitland did not stop long with you Miss Baylis laughed her scornful laugh I showed him the door she said Well did he tell you that he was going to Australia enquired Spargo I should not have listened to anything that he told me mister Spargo she answered Then in short said Spargo you never heard of him again I never heard of him again she declared passionately and I only hope that what you tell me is true and that Marbury really was Maitland CHAPTER TWENTY FOUR MOTHER GUTCH Spargo having exhausted the list of questions which he had thought out on his way to Bayswater was about to take his leave of Miss Baylis when a new idea suddenly occurred to him and he turned back to that formidable lady I ve just thought of something else he said I told you that I m certain Marbury was Maitland and that he came to a sad end murdered And I ve told you she replied scornfully that in my opinion no end could be too bad for him Just so I understand you said Spargo But I didn t tell you that he was not only murdered but robbed robbed of probably a good deal There s good reason to believe that he had securities bank notes loose diamonds and other things on him to the value of a large amount He d several thousand pounds when he left Coolumbidgee in New South Wales where he d lived quietly for some years Miss Baylis smiled sourly What s all this to me she asked Possibly nothing But you see that money those securities may be recovered And as the boy you speak of is dead there surely must be somebody who s entitled to the lot It s worth having Miss Baylis and there s strong belief on the part of the police that it will turn up This was a bit of ingenious bluff on the part of Spargo he watched its effect with keen eyes But Miss Baylis was adamant and she looked as scornful as ever I say again what s all that to me she exclaimed Well but hadn t the dead boy any relatives on his father s side asked Spargo I know you re his aunt on the mother s side and as you re indifferent perhaps I can find some on the other side It s very easy to find all these things out you know Miss Baylis who had begun to stalk back to the house in gloomy and majestic fashion and had let Spargo see plainly that this part of the interview was distasteful to her suddenly paused in her stride and glared at the young journalist Easy to find all these things out she repeated Spargo caught or fancied he caught a note of anxiety in her tone He was quick to turn his fancy to practical purpose Oh easy enough he said I could find out all about Maitland s family through that boy Quite quite easily Miss Baylis had stopped now and stood glaring at him How she demanded I ll tell you said Spargo with cheerful alacrity It is of course the easiest thing in the world to trace all about his short life I suppose I can find the register of his birth at Market Milcaster and you of course will tell me where he died By the by when did he die Miss Baylis But Miss Baylis was going on again to the house I shall tell you nothing more she said angrily I ve told you too much already and I believe all you re here for is to get some news for your paper But I will at any rate tell you this when Maitland went to prison his child would have been defenceless but for me he d have had to go to the workhouse but for me he hadn t a single relation in the world but me on either father s or mother s side And even at my age old woman as I am I d rather beg my bread in the street I d rather starve and die than touch a penny piece that had come from John Maitland That s all Then without further word without offering to show Spargo the way out she marched in at the open window and disappeared And Spargo knowing no other way was about to follow her when he heard a sudden rustling sound in the shadow by which they had stood and the next moment a queer cracked horrible voice suggesting all sorts of things said distinctly and yet in a whisper Young man Spargo turned and stared at the privet hedge behind him It was thick and bushy and in its full summer green but it seemed to him that he saw a nondescript shape behind Who s there he demanded Somebody listening There was a curious cackle of laughter from behind the hedge then the cracked husky voice spoke again Young man don t you move or look as if you were talking to anybody Do you know where the King of Madagascar public house is in this quarter of the town young man No answered Spargo Certainly not Well anybody ll tell you when you get outside young man continued the queer voice of the unseen person Go there and wait at the corner by the King of Madagascar and I ll come there to you at the end of half an hour Then I ll tell you something young man I ll tell you something Now run away young man run away to the King of Madagascar I m coming The voice ended in low horrible cachinnation which made Spargo feel queer But he was young enough to be in love with adventure and he immediately turned on his heel without so much as a glance at the privet hedge and went across the garden and through the house and let himself out at the door And at the next corner of the square he met a policeman and asked him if he knew where the King of Madagascar was First to the right second to the left answered the policeman tersely You can t miss it anywhere round there it s a landmark And Spargo found the landmark a great square built tavern easily and he waited at a corner of it wondering what he was going to see and intensely curious about the owner of the queer voice with all its suggestions of he knew not what And suddenly there came up to him an old woman and leered at him in a fashion that made him suddenly realize how dreadful old age may be Spargo had never seen such an old woman as this in his life She was dressed respectably better than respectably Her gown was good her bonnet was smart her smaller fittings were good But her face was evil it showed unmistakable signs of a long devotion to the bottle the old eyes leered and ogled the old lips were wicked Spargo felt a sense of disgust almost amounting to nausea but he was going to hear what the old harridan had to say and he tried not to look what he felt Well he said almost roughly Well Well young man there you are said his new acquaintance Let us go inside young man there s a quiet little place where a lady can sit and take her drop of gin I ll show you And if you re good to me I ll tell you something about that cat that you were talking to just now But you ll give me a little matter to put in my pocket young man Old ladies like me have a right to buy little comforts you know little comforts Spargo followed this extraordinary person into a small parlour within the attendant who came in response to a ring showed no astonishment at her presence he also seemed to know exactly what she required which was a certain brand of gin sweetened and warm And Spargo watched her curiously as with shaking hand she pushed up the veil which hid little of her wicked old face and lifted the glass to her mouth with a zest which was not thirst but pure greed of liquor Almost instantly he saw a new light steal into her eyes and she laughed in a voice that grew clearer with every sound she made Ah young man she said with a confidential nudge of the elbow that made Spargo long to get up and fly I wanted that It s done me good When I ve finished that you ll pay for another for me and perhaps another They ll do me still more good And you ll give me a little matter of money won t you young man Not till I know what I m giving it for replied Spargo You ll be giving it because I m going to tell you that if it s made worth my while I can tell you or somebody that sent you more about Jane Baylis than anybody in the world I m not going to tell you that now young man I m sure you don t carry in your pocket what I shall want for my secret not you by the look of you I m only going to show you that I have the secret Eh Who are you asked Spargo The woman leered and chuckled What are you going to give me young man she asked Spargo put his fingers in his pocket and pulled out two half sovereigns Look here he said showing his companion the coins if you can tell me anything of importance you shall have these But no trifling now And no wasting of time If you have anything to tell out with it The woman stretched out a trembling claw like hand But let me hold one of those young man she implored Let me hold one of the beautiful bits of gold I shall tell you all the better if I hold one of them Let me there s a good young gentleman Spargo gave her one of the coins and resigned himself to his fate whatever it might be You won t get the other unless you tell something he said Who are you anyway The woman who had begun mumbling and chuckling over the half sovereign grinned horribly At the boarding house yonder young man they call me Mother Gutch she answered but my proper name is missus Sabina Gutch and once upon a time I was a good looking young woman And when my husband died I went to Jane Baylis as housekeeper and when she retired from that and came to live in that boarding house where we live now she was forced to bring me with her and to keep me Why had she to do that young man Heaven knows answered Spargo Because I ve got a hold on her young man I ve got a secret of hers continued Mother Gutch She d be scared to death if she knew I d been behind that hedge and had heard what she said to you and she d be more than scared if she knew that you and I were here talking But she s grown hard and near with me and she won t give me a penny to get a drop of anything with and an old woman like me has a right to her little comforts and if you ll buy the secret young man I ll split on her there and then when you pay the money Before I talk about buying any secret said Spargo you ll have to prove to me that you ve a secret to sell that s worth my buying And I will prove it said Mother Gutch with sudden fierceness Touch the bell and let me have another glass and then I ll tell you Now she went on more quietly Spargo noticed that the more she drank the more rational she became and that her nerves seemed to gain strength and her whole appearance to be improved now you came to her to find out about her brother in law Maitland that went to prison didn t you Well demanded Spargo And about that boy of his she continued You heard all that was said answered Spargo I m waiting to hear what you have to say But Mother Gutch was resolute in having her own way She continued her questions And she told you that Maitland came and asked for the boy and that she told him the boy was dead didn t she she went on Well said Spargo despairingly She did What then Mother Gutch took an appreciative pull at her glass and smiled knowingly What then she chuckled All lies young man the boy isn t dead any more than I am And my secret is Well demanded Spargo impatiently What is it This answered Mother Gutch digging her companion in the ribs I know what she did with him CHAPTER TWENTY FIVE REVELATIONS Spargo turned on his disreputable and dissolute companion with all his journalistic energies and instincts roused He had not been sure since entering the King of Madagascar that he was going to hear anything material to the Middle Temple Murder he had more than once feared that this old gin drinking harridan was deceiving him for the purpose of extracting drink and money from him But now at the mere prospect of getting important information from her he forgot all about Mother Gutch s unfortunate propensities evil eyes and sodden face he only saw in her somebody who could tell him something He turned on her eagerly You say that John Maitland s son didn t die he exclaimed The boy did not die replied Mother Gutch And that you know where he is asked Spargo Mother Gutch shook her head I didn t say that I know where he is young man she replied I said I knew what she did with him What then demanded Spargo Mother Gutch drew herself up in a vast assumption of dignity and favoured Spargo with a look That s the secret young man she said I m willing to sell that secret but not for two half sovereigns and two or three drops of cold gin If Maitland left all that money you told Jane Baylis of when I was listening to you from behind the hedge my secret s worth something Spargo suddenly remembered his bit of bluff to Miss Baylis Here was an unexpected result of it Nobody but me can help you to trace Maitland s boy continued Mother Gutch and I shall expect to be paid accordingly That s plain language young man Spargo considered the situation in silence for a minute or two Could this wretched bibulous old woman really be in possession of a secret which would lead to the solving of the mystery of the Middle Temple Murder Well it would be a fine thing for the Watchman if the clearing up of everything came through one of its men And the Watchman was noted for being generous even to extravagance in laying out money on all sorts of objects it had spent money like water on much less serious matters than this How much do you want for your secret he suddenly asked turning to his companion Mother Gutch began to smooth out a pleat in her gown It was really wonderful to Spargo to find how very sober and normal this old harridan had become he did not understand that her nerves had been all a quiver and on edge when he first met her and that a resort to her favourite form of alcohol in liberal quantity had calmed and quickened them secretly he was regarding her with astonishment as the most extraordinary old person he had ever met and he was almost afraid of her as he waited for her decision At last Mother Gutch spoke Well young man she said having considered matters and having a right to look well to myself I think that what I should prefer to have would be one of those annuities A nice comfortable annuity paid weekly none of your monthlies or quarterlies but regular and punctual every Saturday morning Or Monday morning as was convenient to the parties concerned but punctual and regular I know a good many ladies in my sphere of life as enjoys annuities and it s a great comfort to have em paid weekly It occurred to Spargo that missus Gutch would probably get rid of her weekly dole on the day it was paid whether that day happened to be Monday or Saturday but that after all was no concern of his so he came back to first principles Even now you haven t said how much he remarked Three pound a week replied Mother Gutch And cheap too Spargo thought hard for two minutes The secret might might lead to something big This wretched old woman would probably drink herself to death within a year or two Anyhow a few hundreds of pounds was nothing to the Watchman He glanced at his watch At that hour for the next hour the great man of the Watchman would be at the office He jumped to his feet suddenly resolved and alert Here I ll take you to see my principals he said We ll run along in a taxi cab With all the pleasure in the world young man replied Mother Gutch when you ve given me that other half sovereign As for principals I d far rather talk business with masters than with men though I mean no disrespect to you Spargo feeling that he was in for it handed over the second half sovereign and busied himself in ordering a taxi cab But when that came round he had to wait while missus Gutch consumed a third glass of gin and purchased a flask of the same beverage to put in her pocket At last he got her off and in due course to the Watchman office where the hall porter and the messenger boys stared at her in amazement well used as they were to seeing strange folk and he got her to his own room and locked her in and then he sought the presence of the mighty What Spargo said to his editor and to the great man who controlled the fortunes and workings of the Watchman he never knew It was probably fortunate for him that they were both thoroughly conversant with the facts of the Middle Temple Murder and saw that there might be an advantage in securing the revelations of which Spargo had got the conditional promise At any rate they accompanied Spargo to his room intent on seeing hearing and bargaining with the lady he had locked up there Spargo s room smelt heavily of unsweetened gin but Mother Gutch was soberer than ever She insisted upon being introduced to proprietor and editor in due and proper form and in discussing terms with them before going into any further particulars The editor was all for temporizing with her until something could be done to find out what likelihood of truth there was in her but the proprietor after sizing her up in his own shrewd fashion took his two companions out of the room We ll hear what the old woman has to say on her own terms he said She may have something to tell that is really of the greatest importance in this case she certainly has something to tell And as Spargo says she ll probably drink herself to death in about as short a time as possible Come back let s hear her story So they returned to the gin scented atmosphere and a formal document was drawn out by which the proprietor of the Watchman bound himself to pay missus Gutch the sum of three pounds a week for life missus Gutch insisting on the insertion of the words every Saturday morning punctual and regular and then missus Gutch was invited to tell her tale And missus Gutch settled herself to do so and Spargo prepared to take it down word for word Which the story as that young man called it is not so long as a monkey s tail nor so short as a Manx cat s gentlemen said missus Gutch but full of meat as an egg Now you see when that Maitland affair at Market Milcaster came off I was housekeeper to Miss Jane Baylis at Brighton She kept a boarding house there in Kemp Town and close to the sea front and a very good thing she made out of it and had saved a nice bit and having like her sister missus Maitland had a little fortune left her by her father as was at one time a publican here in London she had a good lump of money And all that money was in this here Maitland s hands every penny I very well remember the day when the news came about that affair of Maitland robbing the bank Miss Baylis she was like a mad thing when she saw it in the paper and before she d seen it an hour she was off to Market Milcaster I went up to the station with her and she told me then before she got in the train that Maitland had all her fortune and her savings and her sister s his wife s too and that she feared all would be lost missus Maitland was then dead observed Spargo without looking up from his writing block She was young man and a good thing too continued missus Gutch Well away went Miss Baylis and no more did I hear or see for nearly a week and then back she comes and brings a little boy with her which was Maitland s And she told me that night that she d lost every penny she had in the world and that her sister s money what ought to have been the child s was gone too and she said her say about Maitland However she saw well to that child nobody could have seen better And very soon after when Maitland was sent to prison for ten years her and me talked about things What s the use says I to her of your letting yourself get so fond of that child and looking after it as you do and educating it and so on I says Why not says she Tisn t yours I says you haven t no right to it I says As soon as ever its father comes out says I he ll come and claim it and you can t do nothing to stop him Well gentlemen if you ll believe me never did I see a woman look as she did when I says all that And she up and swore that Maitland should never see or touch the child again not under no circumstances whatever missus Gutch paused to take a little refreshment from her pocket flask with an apologetic remark as to the state of her heart She resumed presently apparently refreshed Well gentlemen that notion about Maitland s taking the child away from her seemed to get on her mind and she used to talk to me at times about it always saying the same thing that Maitland should never have him And one day she told me she was going to London to see lawyers about it and she went and she came back seeming more satisfied and a day or two afterwards there came a gentleman who looked like a lawyer and he stopped a day or two and he came again and again until one day she came to me and she says You don t know who that gentleman is that s come so much lately she says Not I I says unless he s after you After me she says tossing her head That s the gentleman that ought to have married my poor sister if that scoundrel Maitland hadn t tricked her into throwing him over You don t say so I says Then by rights he ought to have been the child s pa He s going to be a father to the boy she says He s going to take him and educate him in the highest fashion and make a gentleman of him she says for his mother s sake Mercy on us says I What ll Maitland say when he comes for him Maitland ll never come for him she says for I m going to leave here and the boy ll be gone before then This is all being done she says so that the child ll never know his father s shame he ll never know who his father was And true enough the boy was taken away but Maitland came before she d gone and she told him the child was dead and I never see a man so cut up However it wasn t no concern of mine And so there s so much of the secret gentlemen and I would like to know if I ain t giving good value Very good said the proprietor Go on But Spargo intervened Did you ever hear the name of the gentleman who took the boy away he asked Yes I did replied missus Gutch Of course I did Which it was Elphick CHAPTER TWENTY SIX STILL SILENT Spargo dropped his pen on the desk before him with a sharp clatter that made missus Gutch jump A steady devotion to the bottle had made her nerves to be none of the strongest and she looked at the startler of them with angry malevolence Don t do that again young man she exclaimed sharply I can t a bear to be jumped out of my skin and it s bad manners I observed that the gentleman s name was Elphick Spargo contrived to get in a glance at his proprietor and his editor a glance which came near to being a wink Just so Elphick he said A law gentleman I think you said missus Gutch I said answered missus Gutch as how he looked like a lawyer gentleman And since you re so particular young man though I wasn t addressing you but your principals he was a lawyer gentleman One of the sort that wears wigs and gowns ain t I seen his picture in Jane Baylis s room at the boarding house where you saw her this morning Elderly man asked Spargo Elderly he will be now replied the informant but when he took the boy away he was a middle aged man About his age she added pointing to the editor in a fashion which made that worthy man wince and the proprietor desire to laugh unconsumedly and not so very unlike him neither being one as had no hair on his face Ah said Spargo And where did this mister Elphick take the boy missus Gutch But missus Gutch shook her head Ain t no idea she said He took him Then as I told you Maitland came and Jane Baylis told him that the boy was dead And after that she never even told me anything about the boy She kept a tight tongue Once or twice I asked her and she says Never you mind she says he s all right for life if he lives to be as old as Methusalem And she never said more and I never said more But continued missus Gutch whose pocket flask was empty and who began to wipe tears away she s treated me hard has Jane Baylis never allowing me a little comfort such as a lady of my age should have and when I hears the two of you a talking this morning the other side of that privet hedge thinks I Now s the time to have my knife into you my fine madam And I hope I done it Spargo looked at the editor and the proprietor nodding his head slightly He meant them to understand that he had got all he wanted from Mother Gutch What are you going to do missus Gutch when you leave here he asked You shall be driven straight back to Bayswater if you like Which I shall be obliged for young man said missus Gutch and likewise for the first week of the annuity and will call every Saturday for the same at eleven punctual or can be posted to me on a Friday whichever is agreeable to you gentlemen And having my first week in my purse and being driven to Bayswater I shall take my boxes and go to a friend of mine where I shall be hearty welcome shaking the dust of my feet off against Jane Baylis and where I ve been living with her Yes but missus Gutch said Spargo with some anxiety if you go back there tonight you ll be very careful not to tell Miss Baylis that you ve been here and told us all this missus Gutch rose dignified and composed Young man she said you mean well but you ain t used to dealing with ladies I can keep my tongue as still as anybody when I like I wouldn t tell Jane Baylis my affairs my new affairs gentlemen thanks to you not for two annuities paid twice a week Take missus Gutch downstairs Spargo and see her all right and then come to my room said the editor And don t you forget missus Gutch keep a quiet tongue in your head no more talk or there ll be no annuities on Saturday mornings So Spargo took Mother Gutch to the cashier s department and paid her her first week s money and he got her a taxi cab and paid for it and saw her depart and then he went to the editor s room strangely thoughtful The editor and the proprietor were talking but they stopped when Spargo entered and looked at him eagerly I think we ve done it said Spargo quietly What precisely have we found out asked the editor A great deal more than I d anticipated answered Spargo and I don t know what fields it doesn t open out If you look back you ll remember that the only thing found on Marbury s body was a scrap of grey paper on which was a name and address Ronald Breton King s Bench Walk Well Breton is a young barrister Also he writes a bit I have accepted two or three articles of his for our literary page Well Further he is engaged to Miss Aylmore the eldest daughter of Aylmore the Member of Parliament who has been charged at Bow Street today with the murder of Marbury I know Well what then Spargo But the most important matter continued Spargo speaking very deliberately is this that is taking that old woman s statement to be true as I personally believe it is that Breton as he has told me himself I have seen a good deal of him was brought up by a guardian That guardian is mister Septimus Elphick the barrister The proprietor and the editor looked at each other Their faces wore the expression of men thinking on the same lines and arriving at the same conclusion And the proprietor suddenly turned on Spargo with a sharp interrogation You think then Spargo nodded I think that mister Septimus Elphick is the Elphick and that Breton is the young Maitland of whom missus Gutch has been talking he answered The editor got up thrust his hands in his pockets and began to pace the room If that s so he said if that s so the mystery deepens What do you propose to do Spargo I think said Spargo slowly I think that without telling him anything of what we have learnt I should like to see young Breton and get an introduction from him to mister Elphick I can make a good excuse for wanting an interview with him If you will leave it in my hands Yes yes said the proprietor waving a hand Leave it entirely in Spargo s hands Keep me informed said the editor Do what you think It strikes me you re on the track Spargo left their presence and going back to his own room still faintly redolent of the personality of missus Gutch got hold of the reporter who had been present at Bow Street when Aylmore was brought up that morning There was nothing new the authorities had merely asked for another remand So far as the reporter knew Aylmore had said nothing fresh to anybody Spargo went round to the Temple and up to Ronald Breton s chambers He found the young barrister just preparing to leave and looking unusually grave and thoughtful At sight of Spargo he turned back from his outer door beckoned the journalist to follow him and led him into an inner room I say Spargo he said as he motioned his visitor to take a chair This is becoming something more than serious You know what you told me to do yesterday as regards Aylmore To get him to tell all Yes said Spargo Breton shook his head Stratton his solicitor you know and I saw him this morning before the police court proceedings he continued I told him of my talk with you I even went as far as to tell him that his daughters had been to the Watchman office Stratton and I both begged him to take your advice and tell all everything no matter at what cost to his private feelings We pointed out to him the serious nature of the evidence against him how he had damaged himself by not telling the whole truth at once how he had certainly done a great deal to excite suspicion against himself how as the evidence stands at present any jury could scarcely do less than convict him And it was all no good Spargo He won t say anything He ll say no more He was adamant I told the entire truth in respect to my dealings with Marbury on the night he met his death at the inquest he said over and over again and I shall say nothing further on any consideration If the law likes to hang an innocent man on such evidence as that let it And he persisted in that until we left him Spargo I don t know what s to be done And nothing happened at the police court Nothing another remand Stratton and I saw Aylmore again before he was removed He left us with a sort of sardonic remark If you all want to prove me innocent he said find the guilty man Well there was a tremendous lot of common sense in that said Spargo Yes of course but how how how is it going to be done exclaimed Breton Are you any nearer is Rathbury any nearer Is there the slightest clue that will fasten the guilt on anybody else Spargo gave no answer to these questions He remained silent a while apparently thinking Was Rathbury in court he suddenly asked He was replied Breton He was there with two or three other men who I suppose were detectives and seemed to be greatly interested in Aylmore If I don t see Rathbury tonight I ll see him in the morning said Spargo He rose as if to go but after lingering a moment sat down again Look here he continued I don t know how this thing stands in law but would it be a very weak case against Aylmore if the prosecution couldn t show some motive for his killing Marbury Breton smiled There s no necessity to prove motive in murder he said But I ll tell you what Spargo if the prosecution can show that Aylmore had a motive for getting rid of Marbury if they could prove that it was to Aylmore s advantage to silence him why then I don t think he s a chance I see But so far no motive no reason for his killing Marbury has been shown I know of none Spargo rose and moved to the door Well I m off he said Then as if he suddenly recollected something he turned back Oh by the by he said isn t your guardian mister Elphick a big authority on philately One of the biggest Awful enthusiast Do you think he d tell me a bit about those Australian stamps which Marbury showed to Criedir the dealer Certain he would delighted Here and Breton scribbled a few words on a card there s his address and a word from me I ll tell you when you can always find him in five nights out of seven at nine o clock after he s dined I d go with you tonight but I must go to Aylmore s The two girls are in terrible trouble Give them a message from me said Spargo as they went out together Tell them to keep up their hearts and their courage CHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN mister ELPHICK S CHAMBERS 
956-127929-0000	train-other-500	Spargo went round again to the Temple that night at nine o clock asking himself over and over again two questions the first how much does Elphick know the second how much shall I tell him
956-127929-0001	train-other-500	The old house in the Temple to which he repaired and in which many a generation of old fogies had lived since the days of Queen Anne was full of stairs and passages and as Spargo had forgotten to get the exact number
956-127929-0002	train-other-500	of the set of chambers he wanted he was obliged to wander about in what was a deserted building So wandering he suddenly heard steps firm decisive steps coming up a staircase which he himself had just climbed
956-127929-0003	train-other-500	He looked over the banisters down into the hollow beneath And there marching up resolutely
none	none	 was the figure of a tall veiled woman 
956-127929-0004	train-other-500	and Spargo suddenly realized with a sharp quickening of his pulses
none	none	 that for the second time that day he was beneath one roof with Miss Baylis 
956-127929-0005	train-other-500	Spargo s mind acted quickly Knowing what he now knew from his extraordinary dealings with Mother Gutch he had no doubt whatever that Miss Baylis had come to see mister Elphick come of course to tell mister Elphick that he Spargo had visited her that morning
956-127929-0006	train-other-500	and that he was on the track of the Maitland secret history He had never thought of it before for he had been busily engaged since the departure of Mother Gutch but naturally Miss Baylis and mister Elphick would keep in communication with each other
956-127929-0007	train-other-500	At any rate here she was and her destination was surely Elphick s chambers And the question for him Spargo was what to do What Spargo did was to remain in absolute silence motionless tense
956-127929-0008	train-other-500	where he was on the stair and to trust to the chance that the woman did not look up But Miss Baylis neither looked up nor down she reached a landing turned along a corridor with decision and marched forward
none	none	 A moment later Spargo heard a 
956-127929-0009	train-other-500	sharp double knock on a door a moment after that he heard a door heavily shut he knew then that Miss Baylis had sought and gained admittance somewhere
956-127929-0010	train-other-500	To find out precisely where that somewhere was drew Spargo down to the landing which Miss Baylis had just left There was no one about he had not in fact seen a soul since he entered the building
956-127929-0011	train-other-500	Accordingly he went along the corridor into which he had seen Miss Baylis turn He knew that all the doors in that house were double ones and that the outer oak in each was solid and substantial enough to be sound proof Yet
956-127929-0012	train-other-500	as men will under such circumstances he walked softly he said to himself smiling at the thought that he would be sure to start if somebody suddenly opened a door on him
none	none	 But no hand opened any door and at last he came to the end of the corridor and found himself confronting a small board 
956-127929-0013	train-other-500	on which was painted in white letters on a black ground mister Elphick s Chambers Having satisfied himself as to his exact whereabouts Spargo drew back as quietly as he had come
956-127929-0014	train-other-500	There was a window half way along the corridor from which he had noticed as he came along one could catch a glimpse of the Embankment and the Thames to this he withdrew and leaning on the sill looked out and considered matters Should he go
956-127929-0015	train-other-500	and if he could gain admittance beard these two conspirators Should he wait until the woman came out and let her see that he was on the track Should he hide again until she went and then see Elphick alone
956-127929-0016	train-other-500	In the end Spargo did none of these things immediately He let things slide for the moment
none	none	 He lighted a cigarette and stared at the river and the brown sails 
956-127929-0017	train-other-500	and the buildings across on the Surrey side Ten minutes went by twenty minutes nothing happened Then as half past nine struck from all the neighbouring clocks Spargo flung away a second cigarette
956-127929-0018	train-other-500	marched straight down the corridor and knocked boldly at mister Elphick s door Greatly to Spargo s surprise the door was opened before there was any necessity to knock again And there calmly confronting him
956-127929-0019	train-other-500	a benevolent yet somewhat deprecating expression on his spectacled and placid face stood mister Elphick a smoking cap on his head
none	none	 a tasseled smoking jacket over his dress shirt 
956-127929-0020	train-other-500	and a short pipe in his hand Spargo was taken aback mister Elphick apparently was not He held the door well open and motioned the journalist to enter Come in mister Spargo he said I was expecting you
956-127929-0021	train-other-500	Walk forward into my sitting room Spargo much astonished at this reception passed through an ante room into a handsomely furnished apartment full of books and pictures
956-127929-0022	train-other-500	In spite of the fact that it was still very little past midsummer there was a cheery fire in the grate and on a table set near a roomy arm chair was set such creature comforts as a spirit case a syphon a tumbler and a novel
none	none	 from which things Spargo argued that mister Elphick had been taking his ease since his dinner 
956-127929-0023	train-other-500	But in another armchair on the opposite side of the hearth was the forbidding figure of Miss Baylis blacker gloomier more mysterious than ever She neither spoke nor moved when Spargo entered she did not even look at him
956-127929-0024	train-other-500	And Spargo stood staring at her until mister Elphick having closed his doors touched him on the elbow and motioned him courteously to a seat Yes I was expecting you mister Spargo he said as he resumed his own chair
956-127929-0025	train-other-500	I have been expecting you at any time ever since you took up your investigation of the Marbury affair in some of the earlier stages of which you saw me you will remember at the mortuary
none	none	 But since Miss Baylis told me twenty minutes ago that you had been to her this morning 
956-127929-0026	train-other-500	I felt sure that it would not be more than a few hours before you would come to me Why mister Elphick should you suppose that I should come to you at all asked Spargo now in full possession of his wits
956-127929-0027	train-other-500	Because I felt sure that you would leave no stone unturned no corner unexplored replied mister Elphick The curiosity of the modern pressman is insatiable Spargo stiffened
956-127929-0028	train-other-500	I have no curiosity mister Elphick he said I am charged by my paper to investigate the circumstances of the death of the man who was found in Middle Temple Lane and if possible to track his murderer and
956-127929-0029	train-other-500	mister Elphick laughed slightly and waved his hand My good young gentleman he said You exaggerate your own importance
none	none	 I don t approve of modern journalism nor of its methods 
956-127929-0030	train-other-500	In your own case you have got hold of some absurd notion that the man John Marbury was in reality one John Maitland once of Market Milcaster
none	none	 and you have been trying to frighten Miss Baylis here into 
956-127929-0031	train-other-500	Spargo suddenly rose from his chair There was a certain temper in him which when once roused led him to straight hitting and it was roused now He looked the old barrister full in the face mister Elphick he said
956-127929-0032	train-other-500	you are evidently unaware of all that I know So I will tell you what I will do I will go back to my office and I will write down what I do know and give the true and absolute proofs of what I know
956-127929-0033	train-other-500	and if you will trouble yourself to read the Watchman tomorrow morning then you too will know Dear me dear me said mister Elphick banteringly
none	none	 We are so used to ultra sensational stories from the Watchman that 
956-127929-0034	train-other-500	but I am a curious and inquisitive old man my good young sir so perhaps you will tell me in a word what it is you do know eh Spargo reflected for a second
956-127929-0035	train-other-500	Then he bent forward across the table and looked the old barrister straight in the face Yes he said quietly I will tell you what I know beyond doubt
956-127929-0036	train-other-500	I know that the man murdered under the name of John Marbury was without doubt John Maitland of Market Milcaster and that Ronald Breton is his son whom you took from that woman
956-127929-0037	train-other-500	If Spargo had desired a complete revenge for the cavalier fashion in which mister Elphick had treated it he could not have been afforded a more ample one than that offered to him by the old barrister s reception of this news
956-127929-0038	train-other-500	mister Elphick s face not only fell but changed his expression of almost sneering contempt was transformed to one clearly resembling abject terror he dropped his pipe fell back in his chair
956-127929-0039	train-other-500	recovered himself gripped the chair s arms and stared at Spargo as if the young man had suddenly announced to him that in another minute he must be led to instant execution And Spargo quick to see his advantage followed it up
956-127929-0040	train-other-500	That is what I know mister Elphick and if I choose all the world shall know it tomorrow morning he said firmly
956-127929-0041	train-other-500	Ronald Breton is the son of the murdered man and Ronald Breton is engaged to be married to the daughter of the man charged with the murder Do you hear that
none	none	 It is not matter of suspicion or of idea or of conjecture 
956-127929-0042	train-other-500	it is fact fact mister Elphick slowly turned his face to Miss Baylis He gasped out a few words
none	none	 You did not tell me this Then Spargo turning to the woman saw that she too was white to the lips and as frightened as the man I didn t know she muttered 
956-127929-0043	train-other-500	He didn t tell me He only told me this morning what what I ve told you Spargo picked up his hat Good night mister Elphick he said But before he could reach the door the old barrister had leapt from his chair and seized him with trembling hands
956-127929-0044	train-other-500	Spargo turned and looked at him
none	none	 He knew then that for some reason or other he had given mister Septimus Elphick a thoroughly bad fright 
956-127929-0045	train-other-500	Well he growled My dear young gentleman implored mister Elphick Don t go I ll I ll do anything for you if
none	none	 you 
956-127929-0046	train-other-500	won t go away to print that I ll I ll give you a thousand pounds Spargo shook him off That s enough he snarled Now I am off What you d try to bribe me
956-127929-0047	train-other-500	mister Elphick wrung his hands
none	none	 I didn t mean that indeed I didn t he almost wailed 
956-127929-0048	train-other-500	I I don t know what I meant Stay young gentleman stay a little and let us let us talk Let me have a word with you as many words as you please I implore you Spargo made a fine pretence of hesitation
956-127929-0049	train-other-500	If I stay he said at last it will only be on the strict condition that you answer and answer truly whatever questions I like to ask you Otherwise
956-127929-0050	train-other-500	He made another move to the door and again mister Elphick laid beseeching hands on him Stay he said
none	none	 I ll answer anything you like CHAPTER TWENTY EIGHT OF PROVED IDENTITY 
774-127930-0000	train-other-500	Spargo sat down again in the chair which he had just left and looked at the two people upon whom his startling announcement had produced such a curious effect And he recognized as he looked at them that while they were both frightened they were frightened in different ways
774-127930-0001	train-other-500	Miss Baylis had already recovered her composure she now sat sombre and stern as ever returning Spargo s look with something of indifferent defiance he thought he could see that in her mind a certain fear was battling with a certain amount of wonder that he had discovered the secret
none	none	 It seemed to him that so far as she was concerned 
774-127930-0002	train-other-500	the secret had come to an end it was as if she said in so many words that now the secret was out he might do his worst But upon mister Septimus Elphick the effect was very different He was still trembling from excitement
774-127930-0003	train-other-500	he groaned as he sank into his chair and the hand with which he poured out a glass of spirits shook the glass rattled against his teeth when he raised it to his lips
none	none	 The half contemptuous fashion of his reception of Spargo had now wholly disappeared 
774-127930-0004	train-other-500	he was a man who had received a shock and a bad one
none	none	 And Spargo watching him keenly said to himself 
774-127930-0005	train-other-500	This man knows a great deal more than a great deal beyond the mere fact that Marbury was Maitland and that Ronald Breton is in reality Maitland s son
none	none	 he knows something which he never wanted anybody to know which he firmly believed it impossible anybody ever could know 
774-127930-0006	train-other-500	It was as if he had buried something deep deep down in the lowest depths
none	none	 and was as astounded as he was frightened to find that it had been at last flung up to the broad light of day 
774-127930-0007	train-other-500	I shall wait suddenly said Spargo until you are composed mister Elphick I have no wish to distress you
none	none	 But I see of course that the truths which I have told you are of a sort that cause you considerable 
774-127930-0008	train-other-500	shall we say fear Elphick took another stiff pull at his liquor His hand had grown steadier and the colour was coming back to his face If you will let me explain he said
none	none	 If you will hear what was done for the boy s sake eh 
774-127930-0009	train-other-500	That answered Spargo is precisely what I wish I can tell you this I am the last man in the world to wish harm of any sort to mister Breton Miss Baylis relieved her feelings with a scornful sniff
none	none	 He says that she exclaimed addressing the ceiling 
774-127930-0010	train-other-500	He says that knowing that he means to tell the world in his rag of a paper that Ronald Breton on whom every care has been lavished is the son of a scoundrel an ex convict a Elphick lifted his hand Hush hush he said imploringly
774-127930-0011	train-other-500	mister Spargo means well I am sure I am convinced
none	none	 If mister Spargo will hear me 
774-127930-0012	train-other-500	But before Spargo could reply a loud insistent knocking came at the outer door Elphick started nervously but presently he moved across the room walking as if he had received a blow and opened the door A boy s voice penetrated into the sitting room
774-127930-0013	train-other-500	If you please sir is mister Spargo of the Watchman here He left this address in case he was wanted Spargo recognized the voice as that of one of the office messenger boys and jumping up went to the door What is it Rawlins he asked
none	none	 Will you please come back to the office sir at once There s mister Rathbury there and says he must see you instantly All right answered Spargo I m coming just now 
774-127930-0015	train-other-500	He motioned the lad away and turned to Elphick I shall have to go he said I may be kept Now mister Elphick can I come to see you tomorrow morning Yes yes tomorrow morning replied Elphick eagerly Tomorrow morning certainly
774-127930-0016	train-other-500	At eleven eleven o clock That will do
none	none	 I shall be here at eleven 
774-127930-0017	train-other-500	said Spargo Eleven sharp He was moving away when Elphick caught him by the sleeve A word just a word he said You you have not told the the boy Ronald of what you know You haven t I haven t replied Spargo
774-127930-0018	train-other-500	Elphick tightened his grip on Spargo s sleeve He looked into his face beseechingly
none	none	 Promise me promise me mister Spargo that you won t tell him until you have seen me in the morning 
774-127930-0019	train-other-500	he implored I beg you to promise me this Spargo hesitated considering matters Very well I promise he said And you won t print it continued Elphick still clinging to him Say you won t print it tonight
774-127930-0020	train-other-500	I shall not print it tonight answered Spargo That s certain Elphick released his grip on the young man s arm Come at eleven tomorrow morning he said and drew back and closed the door
774-127930-0021	train-other-500	Spargo ran quickly to the office and hurried up to his own room And there calmly seated in an easy chair
none	none	 smoking a cigar and reading an evening newspaper was Rathbury unconcerned and outwardly as imperturbable as ever 
774-127930-0022	train-other-500	He greeted Spargo with a careless nod and a smile Well he said how s things Spargo half breathless dropped into his desk chair
none	none	 You didn t come here to tell me that he said 
774-127930-0023	train-other-500	Rathbury laughed No he said throwing the newspaper aside I didn t I came to tell you my latest You re at full liberty to stick it into your paper tonight it may just as well be known Well said Spargo
774-127930-0024	train-other-500	Rathbury took his cigar out of his lips and yawned
none	none	 Aylmore s identified he said lazily 
774-127930-0025	train-other-500	Spargo sat up sharply Identified Identified my son Beyond doubt But as whom as what exclaimed Spargo Rathbury laughed He s an old lag an ex convict Served his time partly at Dartmoor
774-127930-0026	train-other-500	That of course is where he met Maitland or Marbury D ye see Clear as noontide now Spargo Spargo sat drumming his fingers on the desk before him His eyes were fixed on a map of London that hung on the opposite wall
774-127930-0027	train-other-500	his ears heard the throbbing of the printing machines far below But what he really saw
none	none	 was the faces of the two girls what he really heard 
774-127930-0028	train-other-500	was the voices of two girls Clear as noontide as noontide repeated Rathbury with great cheerfulness Spargo came back to the earth of plain and brutal fact What s clear as noontide
774-127930-0029	train-other-500	he asked sharply What Why the whole thing Motive everything answered Rathbury Don t you see Maitland and Aylmore his real name is Ainsworth by the by
none	none	 meet at Dartmoor probably or rather certainly just before Aylmore s release Aylmore goes abroad makes money in time comes back starts new career gets into Parliament becomes big man 
774-127930-0030	train-other-500	In time Maitland who after his time has also gone abroad also comes back The two meet Maitland probably tries to blackmail Aylmore or threatens to let folk know that the flourishing mister Aylmore M P is an ex convict Result
231_127936_000043_000002	train-clean-360	 blackmail 
none	none	Aylmore or threatens to let folk know that the flourishing mister Aylmore M P is an ex convict Result Aylmore lures him to the Temple and quiets him 
774-127930-0031	train-other-500	Pooh the whole thing s clear as noontide as I say As noontide Spargo drummed his fingers again How he asked quietly How came Aylmore to be identified
774-127930-0032	train-other-500	My work said Rathbury proudly My work my son You see I thought a lot And especially after we d found out that Marbury was Maitland You mean after I d found out remarked Spargo Rathbury waved his cigar
774-127930-0033	train-other-500	Well well it s all the same he said
none	none	 You help me and I help you eh 
774-127930-0034	train-other-500	Well as I say I thought a considerable lot
none	none	 I thought now where did Maitland or Marbury know or meet Aylmore twenty or twenty two years ago Not in London because we knew Maitland never was in London 
774-127930-0035	train-other-500	at any rate before his trial and we haven t the least proof that he was in London after And why won t Aylmore tell Clearly because it must have been in some undesirable place And then all of a sudden it flashed on me in a moment of
none	none	 what do you writing fellows call those moments Spargo 
774-127930-0036	train-other-500	Inspiration I should think said Spargo Direct inspiration That s it In a moment of direct inspiration it flashed on me why twenty years ago Maitland was in Dartmoor they must have met there
none	none	 And so we got some old warders who d been there at that time to come to town and we gave em opportunities to see Aylmore and to study him 
774-127930-0037	train-other-500	Of course he s twenty years older and he s grown a beard but they began to recall him
none	none	 and then one man remembered that if he was the man they thought he d a certain birth mark And he has Does Aylmore know that he s been identified 
774-127930-0038	train-other-500	asked Spargo Rathbury pitched his cigar into the fireplace and laughed Know he said scornfully Know He s admitted it What was the use of standing out against proof like that He admitted it tonight in my presence Oh he knows all right
774-127930-0039	train-other-500	And what did he say Rathbury laughed contemptuously Say Oh not much Pretty much what he said about this affair that when he was convicted the time before he was an innocent man
none	none	 He s certainly a good hand at playing the innocent game 
774-127930-0040	train-other-500	And of what was he convicted Oh of course we know all about it now As soon as we found out who he really was we had all the particulars turned up Aylmore or Ainsworth Stephen Ainsworth his name really is
774-127930-0041	train-other-500	was a man who ran a sort of what they call a Mutual Benefit Society in a town right away up in the North Cloudhampton some thirty years ago
none	none	 He was nominally secretary but it was really his own affair It was patronized by the working classes 
774-127930-0042	train-other-500	Cloudhampton s a purely artisan population and they stuck a lot of their brass as they call it in it Then suddenly it came to smash and there was nothing He Ainsworth or Aylmore pleaded that he was robbed and duped by another man but the court didn t believe him and he got seven years
none	none	 Plain story you see Spargo when it all comes out eh 
774-127930-0043	train-other-500	All stories are quite plain when they come out
none	none	 observed Spargo And he kept silence now I suppose because he didn t want his daughters to know about his past 
774-127930-0044	train-other-500	Just so agreed Rathbury And I don t know that I blame him He thought of course that he d go scot free over this Marbury affair
none	none	 But he made his mistake in the initial stages my boy oh yes 
774-127930-0045	train-other-500	Spargo got up from his desk and walked around his room for a few minutes Rathbury meanwhile finding and lighting another cigar At last Spargo came back and clapped a hand on the detective s shoulder Look here Rathbury
774-127930-0046	train-other-500	he said It s very evident that you re now going on the lines that Aylmore did murder Marbury Eh Rathbury looked up His face showed astonishment After evidence like that he exclaimed Why of course There s the motive my son the motive
774-127930-0047	train-other-500	Spargo laughed Rathbury he said Aylmore no more murdered Marbury than you did The detective got up and put on his hat Oh he said Perhaps you know who did then I shall know in a few days answered Spargo
774-127930-0048	train-other-500	Rathbury stared wonderingly at him Then he suddenly walked to the door Good night
none	none	 he said gruffly Good night Rathbury replied Spargo and sat down at his desk But that night Spargo wrote nothing for the Watchman All he wrote was a short telegram addressed to Aylmore s daughters There were only three words on it Have no fear CHAPTER TWENTY NINE THE CLOSED DOORS Alone of all the London morning newspapers the Watchman appeared next day destitute of sensationalism in respect to the Middle Temple Murder The other daily journals published more or less vivid accounts of the identification of mister Stephen Aylmore M P for the Brookminster Division as the ci devant Stephen Ainsworth ex convict once upon a time founder and secretary of the Hearth and Home Mutual Benefit Society the headquarters of which had been at Cloudhampton in Daleshire the fall of which had involved thousands of honest working folk in terrible distress if not in absolute ruin Most of them had raked up Ainsworth s past to considerable journalistic purpose it had been an easy matter to turn up old files to recount the fall of the Hearth and Home to tell anew the story of the privations of the humble investors whose small hoards had gone in the crash it had been easy too to set out again the history of Ainsworth s arrest trial and fate There was plenty of romance in the story it was that of a man who by his financial ability had built up a great industrial insurance society had as was alleged converted the large sums entrusted to him to his own purposes had been detected and punished had disappeared after his punishment so effectually that no one knew where he had gone had come back comparatively a few years later under another name a very rich man and had entered Parliament and been in a modest way a public character without any of those who knew him in his new career suspecting that he had once worn a dress liberally ornamented with the broad arrow Fine copy excellent copy some of the morning newspapers made a couple of columns of it But the Watchman up to then easily ahead of all its contemporaries in keeping the public informed of all the latest news in connection with the Marbury affair contented itself with a brief announcement For after Rathbury had left him Spargo had sought his proprietor and his editor and had sat long in consultation with them and the result of their talk had been that all the Watchman thought fit to tell its readers next morning was contained in a curt paragraph We understand that mister Stephen Aylmore M P who is charged with the murder of John Marbury or Maitland in the Temple on June twenty first last was yesterday afternoon identified by certain officials as Stephen Ainsworth who was sentenced to a term of penal servitude in connection with the Hearth and Home Mutual Benefit Society funds nearly thirty years ago Coming down to Fleet Street that morning Spargo strolling jauntily along the front of the Law Courts encountered a fellow journalist a man on an opposition newspaper who grinned at him in a fashion which indicated derision Left behind a bit that rag of yours this morning Spargo my boy he remarked elegantly Why you ve missed one of the finest opportunities I ever heard of in connection with that Aylmore affair A miserable paragraph why I worked off a column and a half in ours What were you doing last night old man Sleeping said Spargo and went by with a nod Sleeping He left the other staring at him and crossed the road to Middle Temple Lane It was just on the stroke of eleven as he walked up the stairs to mister Elphick s chambers precisely eleven as he knocked at the outer door It is seldom that outer doors are closed in the Temple at that hour but Elphick s door was closed fast enough The night before it had been promptly opened but there was no response to Spargo s first knock nor to his second nor to his third And half unconsciously he murmured aloud Elphick s door is closed It never occurred to Spargo to knock again instinct told him that Elphick s door was closed because Elphick was not there closed because Elphick was not going to keep the appointment He turned and walked slowly back along the corridor And just as he reached the head of the stairs Ronald Breton pale and anxious came running up them and at sight of Spargo paused staring questioningly at him As if with a mutual sympathy the two young men shook hands I m glad you didn t print more than those two or three lines in the Watchman this morning said Breton It was considerate As for the other papers Aylmore assured me last night Spargo that though he did serve that term at Dartmoor he was innocent enough He was scapegoat for another man who disappeared Then as Spargo merely nodded he added awkwardly And I m obliged to you too old chap for sending that wire to the two girls last night it was good of you They want all the comfort they can get poor things But what are you doing here Spargo Spargo leant against the head of the stairs and folded his hands I came here he said to keep an appointment with mister Elphick an appointment which he made when I called on him as you suggested at nine o clock The appointment a most important one was for eleven o clock Breton glanced at his watch Come on then he said It s well past that now and my guardian s a very martinet in the matter of punctuality But Spargo did not move Instead he shook his head regarding Breton with troubled eyes So am I he answered I was trained to it Your guardian isn t there Breton Not there If he made an appointment for eleven Nonsense I never knew him miss an appointment I knocked three times three separate times answered Spargo You should have knocked half a dozen times he may have overslept himself He sits up late he and old Cardlestone often sit up half the night talking stamps or playing piquet said Breton Come on you ll see Spargo shook his head again He s not there Breton he said He s gone Breton stared at the journalist as if he had just announced that he had seen mister Septimus Elphick riding down Fleet Street on a dromedary He seized Spargo s elbow Come on he said I have a key to mister Elphick s door so that I can go in and out as I like I ll soon show you whether he s gone or not Spargo followed the young barrister down the corridor All the same he said meditatively as Breton fitted a key to the latch he s not there Breton He s off Good heavens man I don t know what you re talking about exclaimed Breton opening the door and walking into the lobby Off Where on earth should he be off to when he s made an appointment with you for eleven and Hullo He had opened the door of the room in which Spargo had met Elphick and Miss Baylis the night before and was walking in when he pulled himself up on the threshold with a sharp exclamation Good God he cried What what s all this Spargo quietly looked over Breton s shoulder It needed but one quick glance to show him that much had happened in that quiet room since he had quitted it the night before There stood the easy chair in which he had left Elphick there close by it but pushed aside as if by a hurried hand was the little table with its spirit case its syphon its glass in which stale liquid still stood there was the novel turned face downwards there upon the novel was Elphick s pipe But the rest of the room was in dire confusion The drawers of a bureau had been pulled open and never put back papers of all descriptions old legal looking documents old letters littered the centre table and the floor in one corner of the room a black japanned box had been opened its contents strewn about and the lid left yawning And in the grate and all over the fender there were masses of burned and charred paper it was only too evident that the occupant of the chambers wherever he might have disappeared to had spent some time before his disappearance in destroying a considerable heap of documents and papers and in such haste that he had not troubled to put matters straight before he went Breton stared at this scene for a moment in utter consternation Then he made one step towards an inner door and Spargo followed him Together they entered an inner room a sleeping apartment There was no one in it but there were evidences that Elphick had just as hastily packed a bag as he had destroyed his papers The clothes which Spargo had seen him wearing the previous evening were flung here there everywhere the gorgeous smoking jacket was tossed unceremoniously in one corner a dress shirt in the bosom of which valuable studs still glistened in another One or two suitcases lay about as if they had been examined and discarded in favour of something more portable here too drawers revealing stocks of linen and underclothing had been torn open and left open open too swung the door of a wardrobe revealing a quantity of expensive clothing And Spargo looking around him seemed to see all that had happened the hasty almost frantic search for and tearing up and burning of papers the hurried change of clothing of packing necessaries into a bag that could be carried and then the flight the getting away the What on earth does all this mean exclaimed Breton What is it Spargo I mean exactly what I told you answered Spargo He s off Off Off But why off What my guardian as quiet an old gentleman as there is in the Temple off cried Breton For what reason eh It isn t good God Spargo it isn t because of anything you said to him last night I should say it is precisely because of something that I said to him last night replied Spargo I was a fool ever to let him out of my sight Breton turned on his companion and gasped Out of your sight he exclaimed Why why you don t mean to say that mister Elphick has anything to do with this Marbury affair For God s sake Spargo Spargo laid a hand on the young barrister s shoulder I m afraid you ll have to hear a good deal Breton he said I was going to talk to you today in any case You see Before Spargo could say more a woman bearing the implements which denote the charwoman s profession entered the room and immediately cried out at what she saw Breton turned on her almost savagely Here you he said Have you seen anything of mister Elphick this morning The charwoman rolled her eyes and lifted her hands Me sir Not a sign of him sir Which I never comes here much before half past eleven sir mister Elphick being then gone out to his breakfast I see him yesterday morning sir which he was then in his usual state of good health sir if any thing s the matter with him now No sir I ain t seen nothing of him Breton let out another exclamation of impatience You d better leave all this he said mister Elphick s evidently gone away in a hurry and you mustn t touch anything here until he comes back I m going to lock up the chambers if you ve a key of them give it to me The charwoman handed over a key gave another astonished look at the rooms and vanished muttering and Breton turned to Spargo What do you say he demanded I must hear a good deal Out with it then man for Heaven s sake But Spargo shook his head Not now Breton he answered Presently I tell you for Miss Aylmore s sake and your own the first thing to do is to get on your guardian s track We must must I say and at once Breton stood staring at Spargo for a moment as if he could not credit his own senses Then he suddenly motioned Spargo out of the room Come on he said I know who ll know where he is if anybody does Who then asked Spargo as they hurried out Cardlestone answered Breton grimly Cardlestone CHAPTER THIRTY REVELATION There was as much bright sunshine that morning in Middle Temple Lane as ever manages to get into it and some of it was shining in the entry into which Spargo and Breton presently hurried Full of haste as he was Breton paused at the foot of the stair He looked down at the floor and at the wall at its side Wasn t it there he said in a low voice pointing at the place he looked at Wasn t it there Spargo just there that Marbury or rather Maitland was found It was just there answered Spargo You saw him I saw him Soon afterwards Immediately after he was found You know all that Breton Why do you ask now Breton who was still staring at the place on which he had fixed his eyes on walking into the entry shook his head Don t know he answered I but come on let s see if old Cardlestone can tell us anything 
956-127932-0000	train-other-500	There was another charwoman armed with pails and buckets outside Cardlestone s door into which she was just fitting a key It was evident to Spargo that she knew Breton for she smiled at him as she opened the door
956-127932-0001	train-other-500	I don t think mister Cardlestone ll be in sir she said He s generally gone out to breakfast at this time him and mister Elphick goes together
none	none	 Just see said Breton I want to see him if he is in The charwoman entered the chambers and immediately screamed Quite so remarked Spargo That s what I expected to hear Cardlestone you see Breton is also off Breton made no reply He rushed after the charwoman with Spargo in close attendance Good God another 
956-127932-0002	train-other-500	groaned Breton If the confusion in Elphick s rooms had been bad
none	none	 that in Cardlestone s chambers was worse Here again all the features of the previous scene were repeated drawers had been torn open papers thrown about the hearth was choked with light ashes everything was at sixes and sevens An open door leading into an inner room showed that Cardlestone like Elphick had hastily packed a bag like Elphick had changed his clothes and had thrown his discarded garments anywhere into any corner Spargo began to realize what had taken place Elphick having made his own preparations for flight had come to Cardlestone and had expedited him and they had fled together But why The charwoman sat down in the nearest chair and began to moan and sob Breton strode forward across the heaps of papers and miscellaneous objects tossed aside in that hurried search and clearing up into the inner room And Spargo looking about him suddenly caught sight of something lying on the floor at which he made a sharp clutch He had just secured it and hurried it into his pocket when Breton came back I don t know what all this means Spargo he said almost wearily I suppose you do Look here he went on turning to the charwoman stop that row that ll do no good you know I suppose mister Cardlestone s gone away in a hurry You d better 
956-127932-0003	train-other-500	what had she better do Spargo Leave things exactly as they are lock up the chambers and as you re a friend of mister Cardlestone s give you the
none	none	 key answered Spargo with a significant glance 
956-127932-0004	train-other-500	Do that now and let s go I ve something to do Once outside with the startled charwoman gone away Spargo turned to Breton I ll tell you all I know presently Breton he said
956-127932-0005	train-other-500	In the meantime I want to find out if the lodge porter saw mister Elphick or mister Cardlestone leave
none	none	 I must know where they ve gone if I can only find out I don t suppose they went on foot 
956-127932-0006	train-other-500	All right responded Breton gloomily We ll go and ask But this is all beyond me You don t mean to say
none	none	 Wait a while answered Spargo One thing at once he continued as they walked up Middle Temple Lane This is the first thing You ask the porter if he s seen anything of either of them 
956-127932-0007	train-other-500	he knows you The porter duly interrogated responded with alacrity
none	none	 Anything of mister Elphick this morning mister Breton he answered Certainly sir I got a taxi for mister Elphick and mister Cardlestone early this morning 
956-127932-0008	train-other-500	soon after seven mister Elphick said they were going to Paris and they d breakfast at Charing Cross before the train left Say when they d be back asked Breton with an assumption of entire carelessness No sir mister Elphick didn t answered the porter
none	none	 But I should say they wouldn t be long because they d only got small suit cases with them such as they d put a day or two s things in sir 
956-127932-0009	train-other-500	All right said Breton He turned away towards Spargo who had already moved off What next he asked Charing Cross I suppose Spargo smiled and shook his head No he answered I ve no use for Charing Cross
956-127932-0010	train-other-500	They haven t gone to Paris That was all a blind For the present let s go back to your chambers Then I ll talk to you Once within Breton s inner room with the door closed upon them
none	none	 Spargo dropped into an easy chair and looked at the young barrister with earnest attention 
956-127932-0011	train-other-500	Breton he said I believe we re coming in sight of land You want to save your prospective father in law don t you Of course growled Breton That goes without saying But
none	none	 But you may have to make some sacrifices in order to do it said Spargo You see Sacrifices exclaimed Breton What You may have to sacrifice some ideas you may find that you ll not be able to think as well of some people in the future as you have thought of them in the past 
956-127932-0012	train-other-500	For instance mister Elphick Breton s face grew dark Speak plainly Spargo he said It s best with
none	none	 me Very well 
956-127932-0013	train-other-500	replied Spargo mister Elphick then is in some way connected with this affair You mean the murder I mean the murder So is Cardlestone Of that I m now dead certain And that s why they re off I startled Elphick last night
956-127932-0014	train-other-500	It s evident that he immediately communicated with Cardlestone and that they made a rapid exit Why Why That s what I m asking you Why Why Why Because they re afraid of something coming out
956-127932-0015	train-other-500	And being afraid their first instinct is to run They ve run at the first alarm Foolish but instinctive Breton who had flung himself into the elbow chair at his desk
none	none	 jumped to his feet and thumped his blotting pad Spargo he exclaimed 
956-127932-0016	train-other-500	Are you telling me that you accuse my guardian and his friend mister Cardlestone of being murderers
none	none	 Nothing of the sort I am accusing mister Elphick and mister Cardlestone of knowing more about the murder than they care to tell or want to tell I am also accusing them and especially your guardian of knowing all about Maitland alias Marbury 
956-127932-0017	train-other-500	I made him confess last night that he knew this dead man to be John Maitland You did I did And now Breton since it s got to come out
none	none	 well have the truth Pull yourself together get your nerves ready for you ll have to stand a shock or two But I know what I m talking about I can prove every word I m going to say to you 
956-127932-0018	train-other-500	And first let me ask you a few questions Do you know anything about your parentage
none	none	 Nothing beyond what mister Elphick has told me 
956-127932-0019	train-other-500	And what was that That my parents were old friends of his who died young leaving me unprovided for and that he took me up and looked after me
956-127932-0020	train-other-500	And he s never given you any documentary evidence of any sort to prove the truth of that story Never I never questioned his statement Why should I You never remember anything of your childhood
956-127932-0021	train-other-500	I mean of any person who was particularly near you in your childhood I remember the people who brought me up from the time I was three years old
none	none	 And I have just a faint shadowy recollection of some woman a tall dark woman I think before that Miss Baylis said Spargo to himself 
956-127932-0022	train-other-500	All right Breton he went on aloud I m going to tell you the truth I ll tell it to you straight out and give you all the explanations afterwards Your real name is not Breton at all
none	none	 Your real name is Maitland and you re the only child of the man who was found murdered at the foot of Cardlestone s staircase Spargo had been wondering how Breton would take this and he gazed at him with some anxiety as he got out the last words 
956-127932-0023	train-other-500	What would he do what would he say what Breton sat down quietly at his desk and looked Spargo hard between the eyes Prove that to me Spargo he said in hard matter of fact tones
none	none	 Prove it to me 
956-127932-0024	train-other-500	every word Every word Spargo Spargo nodded
none	none	 I will every word he answered It s the right thing 
956-127932-0025	train-other-500	Listen then It was a quarter to twelve Spargo noticed throwing a glance at the clock outside as he began his story it was past one when he brought it to an end And all that time Breton listened with the keenest attention only asking a question now and then
956-127932-0026	train-other-500	now and then making a brief note on a sheet of paper which he had drawn to him That s all said Spargo at last It s plenty observed Breton laconically He sat staring at his notes for a moment then he looked up at Spargo
none	none	 What do you really think he asked About what 
956-127932-0027	train-other-500	said Spargo This flight of Elphick s and Cardlestone s I think as I said that they knew something which they think may be forced upon them
none	none	 I never saw a man in a greater fright than that I saw Elphick in last night 
956-127932-0028	train-other-500	And it s evident that Cardlestone shares in that fright or they wouldn t have gone off in this way together Do you think they know anything of the actual murder
none	none	 Spargo shook his head I don t know Probably They know something And look here Spargo put his hand in his breast pocket and drew something out which he handed to Breton who gazed at it curiously What s this he demanded Stamps That from the description of Criedir the stamp dealer is a sheet of those rare Australian stamps which Maitland had on him carried on him I picked it up just now in Cardlestone s room when you were looking into his bedroom But that after all proves nothing Those mayn t be the identical stamps And whether they are or not What are the probabilities interrupted Spargo sharply I believe that those are the stamps which Maitland your father had on him and I want to know how they came to be in Cardlestone s rooms And I will know Breton handed the stamps back But the general thing Spargo he said If they didn t murder I can t realize the thing yet my father If they didn t murder your father they know who did exclaimed Spargo Now then it s time for more action Let Elphick and Cardlestone alone for the moment they ll be tracked easily enough I want to tackle something else for the moment How do you get an authority from the Government to open a grave Order from the Home Secretary which will have to be obtained by showing the very strongest reasons why it should be made Good We ll give the reasons I want to have a grave opened A grave opened Whose grave The grave of the man Chamberlayne at Market Milcaster replied Spargo Breton started His In Heaven s name why he demanded Spargo laughed as he got up Because I believe it s empty he answered Because I believe that Chamberlayne is alive and that his other name is Cardlestone 
921-127933-0000	train-other-500	CHAPTER THIRTY ONE THE PENITENT WINDOW CLEANER That afternoon Spargo had another of his momentous interviews with his proprietor and his editor The first result
921-127933-0001	train-other-500	was that all three drove to the offices of the legal gentleman who catered for the Watchman when it wanted any law and that things were put in shape for an immediate application to the Home Office
921-127933-0002	train-other-500	for permission to open the Chamberlayne grave at Market Milcaster the second was that on the following morning there appeared in the Watchman
921-127933-0003	train-other-500	a notice which set half the mouths of London a watering That notice penned by Spargo ran as follows ONE THOUSAND POUNDS REWARD
921-127933-0004	train-other-500	WHEREAS on some date within the past twelve months there was stolen abstracted or taken from the chambers in Fountain Court Temple
921-127933-0005	train-other-500	occupied by mister Stephen Aylmore M P under the name of mister Anderson a walking stick or stout staff of foreign make and of curious workmanship
921-127933-0006	train-other-500	which stick was probably used in the murder of John Marbury or Maitland in Middle Temple Lane
none	none	 on the night of June twenty one twenty two last 
921-127933-0007	train-other-500	and is now in the hands of the police This is to give notice that the Proprietor of the Watchman newspaper will pay the above mentioned reward
921-127933-0008	train-other-500	ONE THOUSAND POUNDS STERLING at once and in cash to whosoever will prove that he or she stole abstracted or took away the said stick from the said chambers
921-127933-0009	train-other-500	and will further give full information as to his or her disposal of the same and the Proprietor of the Watchman moreover engages
921-127933-0010	train-other-500	to treat any revelation affecting the said stick in the most strictly private and confidential manner and to abstain from using it in any way detrimental to the informant
921-127933-0011	train-other-500	who should call at the Watchman office and ask for mister Frank Spargo at any time between eleven and one o clock midday and seven and eleven o clock in the evening
921-127933-0012	train-other-500	And you really expect to get some information through that asked Breton who came into Spargo s room about noon on the day on which the promising announcement came out You really do
none	none	 Before today is out 
921-127933-0013	train-other-500	said Spargo confidently There is more magic in a thousand pound reward than you fancy Breton I ll have the history of that stick before midnight How are you to tell
921-127933-0014	train-other-500	that you won t be imposed upon suggested Breton Anybody can say that he or she stole the stick Whoever comes here with any tale of a stick
none	none	 will have to prove to me how he or she got the stick 
921-127933-0015	train-other-500	and what was done with the stick said Spargo I haven t the least doubt that that stick was stolen or taken away from Aylmore s rooms in Fountain Court
921-127933-0016	train-other-500	and that it got into the hands of Yes of whom That s what I want to know in some fashion I ve an idea already But I can afford to wait for definite information
921-127933-0017	train-other-500	I know one thing when I get that information as I shall we shall be a long way on the road towards establishing Aylmore s innocence Breton made no remark upon this
none	none	 He was looking at Spargo with a meditative expression 
921-127933-0018	train-other-500	Spargo he said suddenly do you think you ll get that order for the opening of the grave at Market Milcaster
none	none	 I was talking to the solicitors over the phone just now 
921-127933-0019	train-other-500	answered Spargo They ve every confidence about it In fact it s possible it may be made this afternoon In that case the opening will be made early tomorrow morning
921-127933-0020	train-other-500	Shall you go asked Breton Certainly And you can go with me if you like Better keep in touch with us all day in case we hear You ought to be there you re concerned I should like to go
none	none	 I will go said Breton And if that grave proves to be 
921-127933-0021	train-other-500	empty I ll I ll tell you something Spargo looked up with sharp instinct You ll tell me something Something What Never mind
921-127933-0022	train-other-500	wait until we see if that coffin contains a dead body or lead and sawdust If there s no body there At that moment one of the senior messenger boys came in and approached Spargo
921-127933-0023	train-other-500	His countenance usually subdued to an official stolidity showed signs of something very like excitement
none	none	 There s a man downstairs asking for you mister Spargo he said He s been hanging about a bit sir seems very shy about coming up He won t say what he wants 
921-127933-0024	train-other-500	and he won t fill up a form sir Says all he wants is a word or two with you Bring him up at once commanded Spargo He turned to Breton
none	none	 when the boy had gone There he said 
921-127933-0025	train-other-500	laughing This is the man about the stick you see if it isn t You re such a cock sure chap Spargo
none	none	 said Breton 
921-127933-0026	train-other-500	You re always going on a straight line Trying to you mean retorted Spargo Well stop here and hear what this chap has to say it ll no doubt be amusing The messenger boy
921-127933-0027	train-other-500	deeply conscious that he was ushering into Spargo s room an individual who might shortly carry away a thousand pounds of good Watchman money in his pocket opened the door and introduced a shy and self conscious young man
921-127933-0028	train-other-500	whose nervousness was painfully apparent to everybody and deeply felt by himself He halted on the threshold looking round the comfortably furnished room and at the two well dressed young men
921-127933-0029	train-other-500	which it framed as if he feared to enter on a scene of such grandeur Come in come in said Spargo rising and pointing to an easy chair at the side of his desk Take a seat
921-127933-0030	train-other-500	You ve called about that reward of course The man in the chair eyed the two of them cautiously and not without suspicion
none	none	 He cleared his throat with a palpable effort Of course 
921-127933-0031	train-other-500	he said It s all on the strict private Name of Edward Mollison sir And where do you live and what do you do asked Spargo You might put it down Rowton House Whitechapel
921-127933-0032	train-other-500	answered Edward Mollison Leastways that s where I generally hang out when I can afford it And window cleaner Leastways I was window cleaning when
921-127933-0033	train-other-500	when When you came in contact with the stick we ve been advertising about suggested Spargo Just so Well Mollison what about the stick
none	none	 Mollison looked round at the door 
921-127933-0034	train-other-500	and then at the windows and then at Breton
none	none	 There ain t no danger of me being got into trouble along of that stick 
921-127933-0035	train-other-500	he asked Cause if there is I ain t a going to say a word no not for no thousand pounds Me never having been in no trouble of any sort guv nor
none	none	 though a poor man 
921-127933-0036	train-other-500	Not the slightest danger in the world Mollison replied Spargo Not the least
none	none	 All you ve got to do is to tell the truth 
921-127933-0037	train-other-500	and prove that it is the truth
none	none	 So it was you who took that queer looking stick out of mister Aylmore s rooms in Fountain Court 
921-127933-0038	train-other-500	was it Mollison appeared to find this direct question soothing to his feelings He smiled weakly It was cert nly me as took it sir he said Not that I meant to pinch
921-127933-0039	train-other-500	it not me And as you might say I didn t take it when all s said and done It was put on me Put on you was it said Spargo
921-127933-0040	train-other-500	That s interesting And how was it put on you Mollison grinned again and rubbed his chin It was this here way he answered You see I was working at that time
921-127933-0041	train-other-500	near on to nine months since it is for the Universal Daylight Window Cleaning Company and I used to clean a many windows here and there in the Temple
921-127933-0042	train-other-500	and them windows at mister Aylmore s only I knew them as mister Anderson s among em And I was there one morning early it was
none	none	 when the charwoman she says to me 
921-127933-0043	train-other-500	I wish you d take these two or three hearthrugs she says and give em a good beating she says And me being always a ready one to oblige
921-127933-0044	train-other-500	All right I says and takes em Here s something to wallop em with she says and pulls that there old stick out of a lot that was in a stand in a corner of the lobby
921-127933-0045	train-other-500	And that s how I came to handle it sir I see said Spargo A good explanation
none	none	 And when you had beaten the hearthrugs 
921-127933-0046	train-other-500	what then Mollison smiled his weak smile again Well sir I looked at that there stick and I see it was something uncommon he answered And I thinks
none	none	 Well this mister Anderson 
921-127933-0047	train-other-500	he s got a bundle of sticks and walking canes up there hell never miss this old thing I thinks And so I left it in a corner when I d done beating the rugs and when I went away with my things
921-127933-0048	train-other-500	I took it with me You took it with you said Spargo Just so To keep as a curiosity I suppose Mollison s weak smile turned to one of cunning
921-127933-0049	train-other-500	He was obviously losing his nervousness the sound of his own voice and the reception of his news was imparting confidence to him Not half he answered You see guv nor
none	none	 there was an old cove as I knew in the Temple there as is 
921-127933-0050	train-other-500	or was cause I ain t been there since a collector of antikities like and I d sold him a queer old thing time and again And of course I had him in my eye
921-127933-0051	train-other-500	when I took the stick away see I see And you took the stick to him I took it there and then replied Mollison Pitched him a tale I did
none	none	 about it having been brought from foreign parts 
921-127933-0052	train-other-500	by Uncle Simon which I never had no Uncle Simon Made out it was a rare curiosity
none	none	 which it might ha been one for all I know 
921-127933-0053	train-other-500	Exactly And the old cove took a fancy to it eh Bought it there and then answered Mollison with something very like a wink
none	none	 Ah 
921-127933-0054	train-other-500	Bought it there and then And how much did he give you for it asked Spargo Something handsome I hope Couple o quid replied Mollison
921-127933-0055	train-other-500	Me not wishing to part with a family heirloom for less Just so
none	none	 And do you happen to be able to tell me the old cove s name and his address Mollison asked Spargo I do sir 
921-127933-0056	train-other-500	Which they ve painted on his entry the fifth or sixth as you go down Middle Temple Lane answered Mollison mister Nicholas Cardlestone first floor up the staircase
921-127933-0057	train-other-500	Spargo rose from his seat without as much as a look at Breton
none	none	 Come this way Mollison he said 
921-127933-0058	train-other-500	We ll go and see about your little reward Excuse me Breton Breton kicked his heels in solitude for half an hour Then Spargo came back There
none	none	 that s one matter settled Breton he said Now for the next 
921-127933-0059	train-other-500	The Home Secretary s made the order for the opening of the grave at Market Milcaster I m going down there at once and I suppose you re coming And remember if that grave s empty
921-127933-0060	train-other-500	If that grave s empty said Breton
none	none	 I ll tell you a good deal CHAPTER THIRTY TWO THE CONTENTS OF THE COFFIN There travelled down together to Market Milcaster late that afternoon Spargo Breton the officials from the Home Office entrusted with the order for the opening of the Chamberlayne grave and a solicitor acting on behalf of the proprietor of the Watchman 
567-127934-0000	train-other-500	It was late in the evening when they reached the little town but Spargo having looked in at the parlour of the Yellow Dragon and ascertained that mister Quarterpage had only just gone home took Breton across the street
none	none	 to the old gentleman s house mister Quarterpage himself came to the door and recognized Spargo immediately 
567-127934-0001	train-other-500	Nothing would satisfy him but that the two should go in his family he said had just retired but he himself was going to take a final nightcap and a cigar and they must share it For a few minutes only then mister Quarterpage said Spargo as they followed the old man into his dining room
567-127934-0002	train-other-500	We have to be up at daybreak And possibly you too would like to be up just as early mister Quarterpage looked an enquiry over the top of a decanter which he was handling At daybreak he exclaimed The fact is said Spargo that grave of Chamberlayne s is going to be opened at daybreak
none	none	 We have managed to get an order from the Home Secretary for the exhumation of Chamberlayne s body 
567-127934-0003	train-other-500	the officials in charge of it have come down in the same train with us we re all staying across there at the Dragon The officials have gone to make the proper arrangements with your authorities
none	none	 It will be at daybreak or as near it as can conveniently be managed 
567-127934-0004	train-other-500	And I suppose now that you know of it you ll be there God bless me exclaimed mister Quarterpage You ve really done that Well well so we shall know the truth at last after all these years
none	none	 You re a very wonderful young man mister Spargo upon my word 
567-127934-0005	train-other-500	And this other young gentleman Spargo looked at Breton who had already given him permission to speak mister Quarterpage he said this young gentleman is without doubt John Maitland s son He s the young barrister mister Ronald Breton that I told you of but
none	none	 there s no doubt about his parentage And I m sure you ll shake hands with him and wish him well mister Quarterpage set down 
567-127934-0006	train-other-500	decanter and glass and hastened to give Breton his hand My dear young sir he exclaimed That I will indeed And as to wishing you well
none	none	 ah I never wished anything 
567-127934-0007	train-other-500	but well to your poor father He was led away sir led away by Chamberlayne God bless me what a night of surprises Why mister Spargo supposing that coffin is found empty what then Then answered Spargo then I think we shall
567-127934-0008	train-other-500	be able to put our hands on the man who is supposed to be in it You think my father was worked upon by this man Chamberlayne sir observed Breton a few minutes later when they had all sat down round mister Quarterpage s hospitable hearth
none	none	 You think he was unduly influenced by him mister Quarterpage shook his head sadly 
567-127934-0009	train-other-500	Chamberlayne my dear young sir he answered
none	none	 Chamberlayne was a plausible and a clever fellow 
567-127934-0010	train-other-500	Nobody knew anything about him until he came to this town and yet before he had been here very long he had contrived to ingratiate himself with everybody of course to his own advantage
none	none	 I firmly believe that he twisted your father round his little finger As I told mister Spargo there when he was making his enquiries of me a short while back 
567-127934-0011	train-other-500	it would never have been any surprise to me to hear definitely I mean young gentlemen that all this money that was in question went into Chamberlayne s pockets
none	none	 Dear me dear me 
567-127934-0012	train-other-500	and you really believe that Chamberlayne is actually alive mister Spargo Spargo pulled out his watch We shall all know whether he was buried in that grave before another six hours are over mister Quarterpage he said He might well have spoken of four hours instead of six for it was
none	none	 then nearly midnight and before three o clock Spargo and Breton with the other men who had accompanied them from London were out of the Yellow Dragon and on their way to the cemetery just outside the little town Over the hills to the eastward the grey dawn was slowly breaking the long stretch of marshland which lies between 
567-127934-0013	train-other-500	Market Milcaster and the sea was white with fog
none	none	 on the cypresses and acacias of the cemetery hung veils and webs of gossamer 
567-127934-0014	train-other-500	everything around them was quiet as the dead folk who lay beneath their feet
none	none	 And the people actively concerned went quietly to work and those who could do nothing but watch stood around in silence In all my long life of over ninety years whispered old Quarterpage who had met them at the cemetery gates looking fresh and brisk in spite of his shortened rest I have never seen this done before It seems a strange strange thing to interfere with a dead man s last resting place 
567-127934-0015	train-other-500	a dreadful thing If there is a dead man there said Spargo
none	none	 He himself was mainly curious about the details of this exhumation he had no scruples sentimental or otherwise about the breaking 
567-127934-0016	train-other-500	in upon the dead He watched all that was done The men employed by the local authorities instructed over night had fenced in the grave with canvas the proceedings were accordingly conducted in strict privacy a man was posted to keep away
none	none	 any very early passersby who might be attracted by the unusual proceedings 
567-127934-0017	train-other-500	At first there was nothing to do but wait and Spargo occupied himself by reflecting that every spadeful of earth thrown out of that grave was bringing him nearer to the truth he had an unconquerable intuition that the truth
none	none	 of at any rate one phase of the Marbury case was going to be revealed to them If the coffin to which they were digging down contained a body 
567-127934-0018	train-other-500	and that the body of the stockbroker Chamberlayne then a good deal of his Spargo s latest theory would be dissolved to nothingness But if that coffin contained no body at all then They re down to it whispered Breton Presently they all went and looked down into the grave
none	none	 The workmen had uncovered the coffin preparatory to lifting it to the surface 
567-127934-0019	train-other-500	one of them was brushing the earth away from the name plate
none	none	 And in the now strong light 
567-127934-0020	train-other-500	they could all read the lettering on it JAMES CARTWRIGHT CHAMBERLAYNE Born eighteen fifty two Died eighteen ninety one Spargo turned away as the men began to lift the coffin out of the grave We shall know now he whispered to Breton And yet
567-127934-0021	train-other-500	what is it we shall know if If what said Breton If what But Spargo shook his head
none	none	 This was one of the great moments he had lately been working for 
567-127934-0022	train-other-500	and the issues were tremendous Now for it said the Watchman s solicitor in an undertone
none	none	 Come mister Spargo now we shall see They all gathered round the coffin set on low trestles at the graveside as the workmen silently went to work on the screws The screws were rusted in their sockets they grated as the men slowly 
567-127934-0023	train-other-500	worked them out It seemed to Spargo that each man grew slower and slower in his movements he felt that he himself was getting fidgety Then he heard a voice of authority Lift the lid off A man at the head of the coffin a man at the foot suddenly and swiftly raised the lid
567-127934-0024	train-other-500	the men gathered round craned their necks with a quick movement Sawdust The coffin was packed to the brim with sawdust tightly pressed down The surface lay smooth undisturbed levelled as some hand had levelled it long years before
none	none	 They were not in the presence of death but of deceit Somebody laughed faintly The sound of the laughter broke the spell The chief official present looked round 
567-127934-0025	train-other-500	him with a smile It is evident that there were good grounds for suspicion he remarked Here is no dead body gentlemen See if anything lies beneath the sawdust he added turning to the workmen Turn it out The workmen began to scoop out the sawdust with their hands
567-127934-0026	train-other-500	one of them evidently desirous of making sure that no body was in the coffin thrust down his fingers at various places along its length He too laughed The coffin s weighted with lead he remarked See And tearing the sawdust aside he showed those around him that
none	none	 at three intervals bars of lead had been tightly wedged into the coffin where the head the middle and the feet of a corpse would have rested 
567-127934-0027	train-other-500	Done it cleverly he remarked looking round You see how these weights have been adjusted When a body s laid out in a coffin you know all the weight s in the end where the head and trunk rest Here you see the heaviest bar of lead is in the middle the lightest at the feet Clever
none	none	 Clear out all the sawdust said some one 
567-127934-0028	train-other-500	Let s see if there s anything else There was something else At the bottom of the coffin
none	none	 two bundles of papers tied up with pink tape The legal gentlemen present immediately manifested great interest in these So did Spargo who pulling Breton along with him 
567-127934-0029	train-other-500	forced his way to where the officials from the Home Office and the solicitor sent by the Watchman were hastily examining their discoveries The first bundle of papers opened evidently related to transactions at Market Milcaster
567-127934-0030	train-other-500	Spargo caught glimpses of names that were familiar to him mister Quarterpage s amongst them
none	none	 He was not at all astonished to see these things But he was something more than astonished when on the second parcel being opened 
567-127934-0031	train-other-500	a quantity of papers relating to Cloudhampton and the Hearth and Home Mutual Benefit Society were revealed He gave a hasty glance at these and drew Breton aside
567-127934-0032	train-other-500	It strikes me we ve found a good deal more than we ever bargained for he exclaimed Didn t Aylmore say that the real culprit at Cloudhampton was another man his clerk or something of that sort He did agreed Breton He insists on it Then this fellow Chamberlayne must have been the man said Spargo He came to Market Milcaster from the north
none	none	 What ll be done with those papers he asked turning to the officials We are going to seal them up at once and take them to London replied the principal person in authority They will be quite safe mister Spargo have no fear We don t know 
567-127934-0033	train-other-500	what they may reveal You don t indeed said Spargo But I may as well tell you that I have a strong belief that they ll reveal a good deal that nobody dreams of so take the greatest care of them Then without waiting for further talk with any one Spargo hurried Breton out of the cemetery At the gate he seized him by the arm
none	none	 Now then Breton he commanded Out with it With what You promised to tell me something 
567-127934-0034	train-other-500	a great deal you said if we found that coffin empty It is empty Come on quick All right I believe I know where Elphick and Cardlestone can be found That s all All It s enough
none	none	 Where then in heaven s name Elphick has a queer little place where he and Cardlestone sometimes go fishing 
567-127934-0035	train-other-500	right away up in one of the wildest parts of the Yorkshire moors I expect they ve gone there Nobody knows even their names there
none	none	 they could go and lie quiet there for ages Do you know the way to it I do I ve been there Spargo motioned him to hurry Come on then he said We re going there by the very first train out of this I know the train too we ve just time to snatch a mouthful of breakfast and to send a wire to the Watchman and then we ll be off Yorkshire Gad Breton that s over three hundred miles away CHAPTER THIRTY THREE FORESTALLED Travelling all that long summer day first from the south west of England to the Midlands then from the Midlands to the north Spargo and Breton came late at night to Hawes Junction on the border of Yorkshire and Westmoreland and saw rising all around them in the half darkness the mighty bulks of the great fells which rise amongst that wild and lonely stretch of land At that hour of the night and amidst that weird silence broken only by the murmur of some adjacent waterfall the scene was impressive and suggestive it seemed to Spargo as if London were a million miles away and the rush and bustle of human life a thing of another planet Here and there in the valleys he saw a light but such lights were few and far between even as he looked some of them twinkled and went out It was evident that he and Breton were presently to be alone with the night How far he asked Breton as they walked away from the station We d better discuss matters answered Breton The place is in a narrow valley called Fossdale some six or seven miles away across these fells and as wild a walk as any lover of such things could wish for It s half past nine now Spargo I reckon it will take us a good two and a half hours if not more to do it Now the question is Do we go straight there or do we put up for the night There s an inn here at this junction there s the Moor Cock Inn a mile or so along the road which we must take before we turn off to the moorland and the fells It s going to be a black night look at those masses of black cloud gathering there and possibly a wet one and we ve no waterproofs But it s for you to say I m game for whatever you like Do you know the way asked Spargo I ve been the way In the daytime I could go straight ahead I remember all the landmarks Even in the darkness I believe I can find my way But it s rough walking We ll go straight there said Spargo Every minute s precious But can we get a mouthful of bread and cheese and a glass of ale first Good idea We ll call in at the Moor Cock Now then while we re on this firm road step it out lively The Moor Cock was almost deserted at that hour there was scarcely a soul in it when the two travellers turned in to its dimly lighted parlour The landlord bringing the desired refreshment looked hard at Breton Come our way again then sir he remarked with a sudden grin of recognition Ah you remember me said Breton I call in mind when you came here with the two old gents last year replied the landlord I hear they re here again Tom Summers was coming across that way this morning and said he d seen em at the little cottage Going to join em I reckon sir Breton kicked Spargo under the table Yes we re going to have a day or two with them he answered Just to get a breath of your moorland air Well you ll have a roughish walk over there tonight gentlemen said the landlord There s going to be a storm And it s a stiffish way to make out at this time o night Oh we ll manage said Breton nonchalantly I know the way and we re not afraid of a wet skin The landlord laughed and sitting down on his long settle folded his arms and scratched his elbows There was a gentleman London gentleman by his tongue came in here this afternoon and asked the way to Fossdale he observed He ll be there long since he d have daylight for his walk Happen he s one of your party he asked where the old gentlemen s little cottage was Again Spargo felt his shin kicked and made no sign One of their friends perhaps answered Breton What was he like The landlord ruminated He was not good at description and was conscious of the fact Well a darkish serious faced gentleman he said Stranger hereabouts at all events Wore a grey suit something like your friend s there Yes he took some bread and cheese with him when he heard what a long way it was Wise man remarked Breton He hastily finished his own bread and cheese and drank off the rest of his pint of ale Come on he said let s be stepping Outside in the almost tangible darkness Breton clutched Spargo s arm Who s the man he said Can you think Spargo Can t answered Spargo I was trying to while that chap was talking But it s somebody that s got in before us Not Rathbury anyhow he s not serious faced Heavens Breton however are you going to find your way in this darkness You ll see presently We follow the road a little Then we turn up the fell side there On the top if the night clears a bit we ought to see Great Shunnor Fell and Lovely Seat they re both well over two thousand feet and they stand up well We want to make for a point clear between them But I warn you Spargo it s stiff going Go ahead said Spargo It s the first time in my life I ever did anything of this sort but we re going on if it takes us all night I couldn t sleep in any bed now that I ve heard there s somebody ahead of us Go first old chap and I ll follow Breton went steadily forward along the road That was easy work but when he turned off and began to thread his way up the fell side by what was obviously no more than a sheep track Spargo s troubles began It seemed to him that he was walking as in a nightmare all that he saw was magnified and heightened the darkening sky above the faint outlines of the towering hills the gaunt spectres of fir and pine the figure of Breton forging stolidly and surely ahead Now the ground was soft and spongy under his feet now it was stony and rugged more than once he caught an ankle in the wire like heather and tripped bruising his knees And in the end he resigned himself to keeping his eye on Breton outlined against the sky and following doggedly in his footsteps Was there no other way than this he asked after a long interval of silence Do you mean to say those two Elphick and Cardlestone would take this way There is another way down the valley by Thwaite Bridge and Hardraw answered Breton but it s miles and miles round This is a straight cut across country and in daylight it s a delightful walk But at night Gad here s the rain Spargo The rain came down as it does in that part of the world with a suddenness that was as fierce as it was heavy The whole of the grey night was blotted out Spargo was only conscious that he stood in a vast solitude and was being gradually drowned But Breton whose sight was keener and who had more knowledge of the situation dragged his companion into the shelter of a group of rocks He laughed a little as they huddled closely together This is a different sort of thing to pursuing detective work in Fleet Street Spargo he said You would come on you know I m going on if we go through cataracts and floods answered Spargo I might have been induced to stop at the Moor Cock overnight if we hadn t heard of that chap in front If he s after those two he s somebody who knows something What I can t make out is who he can be Nor I said Breton I can t think of anybody who knows of this retreat But has it ever struck you Spargo that somebody beside yourself may have been investigating Possible replied Spargo One never knows I only wish we d been a few hours earlier For I wanted to have the first word with those two The rain ceased as suddenly as it had come Just as suddenly the heavens cleared And going forward to the top of the ridge which they were then crossing Breton pointed an arm to something shining far away below them You see that he said That s a sheet of water lying between us and Cotterdale We leave that on our right hand climb the fell beyond it drop down into Cotterdale cross two more ranges of fell and come down into Fossdale under Lovely Seat There s a good two hours and a half stiff pull yet Spargo Think you can stick it Spargo set his teeth Go on he said Up hill down dale now up to his ankles in peaty ground now tearing his shins now bruising his knees Spargo yearning for the London lights the well paved London streets the convenient taxi cab even the humble omnibus plodded forward after his guide It seemed to him that they had walked for ages and had traversed a whole continent of mountains and valley when at last Breton halting on the summit of a wind swept ridge laid one hand on his companion s shoulder and pointed downward with the other There he said There Spargo looked ahead into the night Far away at what seemed to him to be a considerable distance he saw the faint very faint glimmer of a light a mere spark of a light That s the cottage said Breton Late as it is you see they re up And here s the roughest bit of the journey It ll take me all my time to find the track across this moor Spargo so step carefully after me there are bogs and holes hereabouts Another hour had gone by ere the two came to the cottage Sometimes the guiding light had vanished blotted out by intervening rises in the ground always when they saw it again they were slowly drawing nearer to it And now when they were at last close to it Spargo realized that he found himself in one of the loneliest places he had ever been capable of imagining so lonely and desolate a spot he had certainly never seen In the dim light he could see a narrow crawling stream making its way down over rocks and stones from the high ground of Great Shunnor Fell Opposite to the place at which they stood on the edge of the moorland a horseshoe like formation of ground was backed by a ring of fir and pine beneath this protecting fringe of trees stood a small building of grey stone which looked as if it had been originally built by some shepherd as a pen for the moorland sheep It was of no more than one storey in height but of some length a considerable part of it was hidden by shrubs and brushwood And from one uncurtained blindless window the light of a lamp shone boldly into the fading darkness without Breton pulled up on the edge of the crawling stream We ve got to get across there Spargo he said But as we re already soaked to the knee it doesn t matter about getting another wetting Have you any idea how long we ve been walking Hours days years replied Spargo I should say quite four hours said Breton In that case it s well past two o clock and the light will be breaking in another hour or so Now once across this stream what shall we do What have we come to do Go to the cottage of course Wait a bit No need to startle them By the fact they ve got a light I take it that they re up Look there As he spoke a figure crossed the window passing between it and the light That s not Elphick nor yet Cardlestone said Spargo They re medium heighted men That s a tallish man Then it s the man the landlord of the Moor Cock told us about said Breton Now look here I know every inch of this place When we re across let me go up to the cottage and I ll take an observation through that window and see who s inside Come on He led Spargo across the stream at a place where a succession of boulders made a natural bridge and bidding him keep quiet went up the bank to the cottage Spargo watching him saw him make his way past the shrubs and undergrowth until he came to a great bush which stood between the lighted window and the projecting porch of the cottage He lingered in the shadow of this bush but for a short moment then came swiftly and noiselessly back to his companion His hand fell on Spargo s arm with a clutch of nervous excitement Spargo he whispered Who on earth do you think the other man is CHAPTER THIRTY FOUR THE WHIP HAND 
231_127936_000002_000000	train-clean-360	Spargo almost irritable from desire to get at close grips with the objects of his long journey shook off Breton s hand with a growl of resentment 
231_127936_000003_000000	train-clean-360	 And how on earth can I waste time guessing he exclaimed 
none	none	Who is he 
231_127936_000004_000000	train-clean-360	Breton laughed softly 
231_127936_000032_000001	train-clean-360	Breton laughed softly 
231_127936_000005_000000	train-clean-360	 Steady Spargo steady he said 
231_127936_000005_000001	train-clean-360	 It s Myerst the Safe Deposit man Myerst 
231_127936_000006_000000	train-clean-360	Spargo started as if something had bitten him 
231_127936_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 Myerst he almost shouted 
none	none	Myerst 
231_127936_000007_000002	train-clean-360	Good Lord why did I never think of him 
none	none	Myerst Then
231_127936_000008_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t know why you should have thought of him said Breton But he s there 
231_127936_000009_000000	train-clean-360	Spargo took a step towards the cottage Breton pulled him back 
231_127936_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 Wait he said 
231_127936_000010_000001	train-clean-360	 We ve got to discuss this 
231_127936_000010_000002	train-clean-360	I d better tell you what they re doing 
none	none	What are they doing then demanded Spargo impatiently
231_127936_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 Well answered Breton 
231_127936_000012_000001	train-clean-360	 They re going through a quantity of papers The two old gentlemen look very ill and very miserable 
none	none	Myerst is evidently laying down the law to them in some fashion or other I ve formed a notion Spargo
231_127936_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 What notion 
231_127936_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 Myerst is in possession of whatever secret they have and he s followed them down here to blackmail them 
231_127936_000014_000001	train-clean-360	That s my notion 
231_127936_000015_000000	train-clean-360	Spargo thought awhile pacing up and down the river bank 
231_127936_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 I daresay you re right he said 
231_127936_000016_000001	train-clean-360	 Now what s to be done 
231_127936_000017_000000	train-clean-360	Breton too considered matters 
231_127936_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 I wish he said at last I wish we could get in there and overhear what s going on 
231_127936_000018_000001	train-clean-360	But that s impossible I know that cottage 
231_127936_000018_000002	train-clean-360	The only thing we can do is this we must catch Myerst unawares 
231_127936_000018_000003	train-clean-360	He s here for no good 
none	none	Look here And reaching round to his hip pocket Breton drew out a Browning revolver and wagged it in his hand with a smile
231_127936_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 That s a useful thing to have Spargo he remarked 
none	none	I slipped it into my pocket the other day wondering why on earth I did it 
231_127936_000020_000002	train-clean-360	Now it ll come in handy 
231_127936_000020_000003	train-clean-360	For anything we know Myerst may be armed 
none	none	Well said Spargo
231_127936_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 Come up to the cottage 
231_127936_000022_000001	train-clean-360	If things turn out as I think they will Myerst when he s got what he wants will be off 
none	none	Now you shall get where I did just now behind that bush and I ll station myself in the doorway 
231_127936_000022_000003	train-clean-360	You can report to me and when Myerst comes out I ll cover him 
231_127936_000022_000004	train-clean-360	Come on Spargo it s beginning to get light already 
none	none	Breton cautiously led the way along the river bank making use of such cover as the willows and alders afforded 
231_127936_000023_000001	train-clean-360	Together he and Spargo made their way to the front of the cottage 
231_127936_000023_000002	train-clean-360	Arrived at the door Breton posted himself in the porch motioning to Spargo to creep in behind the bushes and to look through the window 
231_127936_000023_000003	train-clean-360	And Spargo noiselessly followed his directions and slightly parting the branches which concealed him looked in through the uncurtained glass 
231_127936_000024_000000	train-clean-360	The interior into which he looked was rough and comfortless in the extreme 
none	none	There were the bare accessories of a moorland cottage rough chairs and tables plastered walls a fishing rod or two piled in a corner some food set out on a side table 
231_127936_000024_000002	train-clean-360	At the table in the middle of the floor the three men sat 
231_127936_000024_000003	train-clean-360	Cardlestone s face was in the shadow Myerst had his back to the window old Elphick bending over the table was laboriously writing with shaking fingers 
231_127936_000024_000004	train-clean-360	And Spargo twisted his head round to his companion 
231_127936_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 Elphick he said is writing a cheque 
231_127936_000025_000001	train-clean-360	Myerst has another cheque in his hand 
231_127936_000025_000002	train-clean-360	Be ready when he gets that second cheque I guess he ll be off 
231_127936_000026_000000	train-clean-360	Breton smiled grimly and nodded 
231_127936_000026_000001	train-clean-360	A moment later Spargo whispered again 
231_127936_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 Look out Breton 
231_127936_000027_000001	train-clean-360	He s coming 
231_127936_000028_000000	train-clean-360	Breton drew back into the angle of the porch Spargo quitted his protecting bush and took the other angle 
none	none	The door opened 
231_127936_000028_000002	train-clean-360	And they heard Myerst s voice threatening commanding in tone 
none	none	Now remember all I ve said And don t you forget I ve the whip hand of both of you the whip hand Then Myerst turned and stepped out into the grey light to find himself confronted by an athletic young man who held the muzzle of an ugly revolver within two inches of the bridge of his nose and in a remarkably firm and steady grip Another glance showed him the figure of a second business like looking young man at his side whose attitude showed a desire to grapple with him
231_127936_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 Good morning mister Myerst said Breton with cold and ironic politeness 
231_127936_000031_000001	train-clean-360	 We are glad to meet you so unexpectedly 
231_127936_000031_000002	train-clean-360	And I must trouble you to put up your hands 
none	none	Quick 
231_127936_000032_000000	train-clean-360	Myerst made one hurried movement of his right hand towards his hip but a sudden growl from Breton made him shift it just as quickly above his head whither the left followed it 
none	none	Breton laughed softly That s wise mister Myerst he said keeping his revolver steadily pointed at his prisoner s nose Discretion will certainly be the better part of your valour on this occasion 
231_127936_000033_000002	train-clean-360	Spargo may I trouble you to see what mister Myerst carries in his pockets 
231_127936_000033_000003	train-clean-360	Go through them carefully 
231_127936_000033_000004	train-clean-360	Not for papers or documents just now 
231_127936_000033_000005	train-clean-360	We can leave that matter we ve plenty of time 
231_127936_000033_000006	train-clean-360	See if he s got a weapon of any sort on him Spargo that s the important thing 
none	none	Considering that Spargo had never gone through the experience of searching a man before he made sharp and creditable work of seeing what the prisoner carried 
231_127936_000034_000001	train-clean-360	And he forthwith drew out and exhibited a revolver while Myerst finding his tongue cursed them both heartily and with profusion 
231_127936_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 Excellent said Breton laughing again 
231_127936_000035_000001	train-clean-360	 Sure he s got nothing else on him that s dangerous Spargo 
none	none	All right 
231_127936_000035_000003	train-clean-360	Now mister Myerst right about face 
none	none	Walk into the cottage hands up and remember there are two revolvers behind your back 
231_127936_000035_000005	train-clean-360	March 
231_127936_000036_000000	train-clean-360	Myerst obeyed this peremptory order with more curses 
231_127936_000036_000001	train-clean-360	The three walked into the cottage 
231_127936_000036_000002	train-clean-360	Breton kept his eye on his captive Spargo gave a glance at the two old men 
231_127936_000036_000003	train-clean-360	Cardlestone white and shaking was lying back in his chair Elphick scarcely less alarmed had risen and was coming forward with trembling limbs 
231_127936_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 Wait a moment said Breton soothingly 
231_127936_000037_000001	train-clean-360	 Don t alarm yourself 
231_127936_000037_000002	train-clean-360	We ll deal with mister Myerst here first 
231_127936_000037_000003	train-clean-360	Now Myerst my man sit down in that chair it s the heaviest the place affords 
231_127936_000037_000004	train-clean-360	Into it now 
231_127936_000037_000005	train-clean-360	Spargo you see that coil of rope there 
231_127936_000037_000006	train-clean-360	Tie Myerst up hand and foot to that chair 
none	none	And tie him well 
231_127936_000037_000008	train-clean-360	All the knots to be double Spargo and behind him 
231_127936_000038_000000	train-clean-360	Myerst suddenly laughed 
231_127936_000038_000001	train-clean-360	 You damned young bully he exclaimed 
none	none	If you put a rope round me you re only putting ropes round the necks of these two old villains 
231_127936_000038_000003	train-clean-360	Mark that my fine fellows 
231_127936_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 We ll see about that later answered Breton 
231_127936_000039_000001	train-clean-360	He kept Myerst covered while Spargo made play with the rope 
231_127936_000039_000002	train-clean-360	 Don t be afraid of hurting him Spargo he said 
231_127936_000039_000003	train-clean-360	 Tie him well and strong 
231_127936_000039_000004	train-clean-360	He won t shift that chair in a hurry 
231_127936_000040_000000	train-clean-360	Spargo spliced his man to the chair in a fashion that would have done credit to a sailor 
none	none	He left Myerst literally unable to move either hand or foot and Myerst cursed him from crown to heel for his pains That ll do said Breton at last 
231_127936_000040_000002	train-clean-360	He dropped his revolver into his pocket and turned to the two old men 
none	none	Elphick averted his eyes and sank into a chair in the darkest corner of the room old Cardlestone shook as with palsy and muttered words which the two young men could not catch
231_127936_000040_000004	train-clean-360	 Guardian continued Breton don t be frightened 
231_127936_000040_000005	train-clean-360	And don t you be frightened either mister Cardlestone 
231_127936_000040_000006	train-clean-360	There s nothing to be afraid of just yet whatever there may be later on 
231_127936_000040_000007	train-clean-360	It seems to me that mister Spargo and I came just in time 
231_127936_000040_000008	train-clean-360	Now guardian what was this fellow after 
231_127936_000041_000000	train-clean-360	Old Elphick lifted his head and shook it he was plainly on the verge of tears as for Cardlestone it was evident that his nerve was completely gone 
231_127936_000041_000001	train-clean-360	And Breton pointed Spargo to an old corner cupboard 
231_127936_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 Spargo he said I m pretty sure you ll find whisky in there 
231_127936_000042_000001	train-clean-360	Give them both a stiff dose they ve broken up 
231_127936_000042_000002	train-clean-360	Now guardian he continued when Spargo had carried out this order what was he after Shall I suggest it 
231_127936_000042_000003	train-clean-360	Was it blackmail 
231_127936_000043_000000	train-clean-360	Cardlestone began to whimper Elphick nodded his head 
231_127936_000043_000001	train-clean-360	 Yes yes he muttered 
none	none	Blackmail 
231_127936_000043_000003	train-clean-360	That was it blackmail 
231_127936_000043_000004	train-clean-360	He he got money papers from us 
none	none	They re on him 
231_127936_000044_000000	train-clean-360	Breton turned on the captive with a look of contempt 
231_127936_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 I thought as much mister Myerst he said 
231_127936_000045_000001	train-clean-360	 Spargo let s see what he has on him 
231_127936_000046_000000	train-clean-360	Spargo began to search the prisoner s pockets 
none	none	He laid out everything on the table as he found it It was plain that Myerst had contemplated some sort of flight or a long long journey There was a quantity of loose gold a number of bank notes of the more easily negotiated denominations various foreign securities realizable in Paris 
231_127936_000046_000004	train-clean-360	And there was an open cheque signed by Cardlestone for ten thousand pounds and another with Elphick s name at the foot also open for half that amount 
none	none	Breton examined all these matters as Spargo handed them out 
231_127936_000046_000006	train-clean-360	He turned to old Elphick 
none	none	Guardian he said why have you or mister Cardlestone given this man these cheques and securities 
231_127936_000047_000001	train-clean-360	What hold has he on you 
231_127936_000048_000000	train-clean-360	Old Cardlestone began to whimper afresh Elphick turned a troubled face on his ward 
none	none	He he threatened to accuse us of the murder of Marbury he faltered We we didn t see that we had a chance What does he know of the murder of Marbury and of you in connection with it demanded Breton
231_127936_000050_000001	train-clean-360	 Come tell me the truth now 
231_127936_000051_000000	train-clean-360	 He s been investigating so he says answered Elphick 
none	none	He lives in that house in Middle Temple Lane you know in the top floor rooms above Cardlestone s 
231_127936_000051_000002	train-clean-360	And and he says he s the fullest evidence against Cardlestone and against me as an accessory after the fact 
231_127936_000052_000000	train-clean-360	 And it s a lie asked Breton 
231_127936_000053_000000	train-clean-360	 A lie answered Elphick 
none	none	Of course it s a lie 
231_127936_000053_000002	train-clean-360	But he s so clever that that 
none	none	That you don t know how you could prove it otherwise said Breton Ah And so this fellow lives over mister Cardlestone there does he 
231_127936_000054_000002	train-clean-360	That may account for a good many things 
231_127936_000054_000003	train-clean-360	Now we must have the police here He sat down at the table and drew the writing materials to him 
231_127936_000054_000004	train-clean-360	 Look here Spargo he continued 
231_127936_000054_000005	train-clean-360	 I m going to write a note to the superintendent of police at Hawes there s a farm half a mile from here where I can get a man to ride down to Hawes with the note 
none	none	Now if you want to send a wire to the Watchman draft it out and he ll take it with him 
231_127936_000055_000000	train-clean-360	Elphick began to move in his corner 
231_127936_000056_000000	train-clean-360	 Must the police come he said 
none	none	Must
231_127936_000057_000000	train-clean-360	 The police must come answered Breton firmly 
231_127936_000057_000001	train-clean-360	 Go ahead with your wire Spargo while I write this note 
none	none	Three quarters of an hour later when Breton came back from the farm he sat down at Elphick s side and laid his hand on the old man s Now guardian he said quietly you ve got to tell us the truth 
921-127937-0000	train-other-500	CHAPTER THIRTY FIVE MYERST EXPLAINS It had been apparent to Spargo from the moment of his entering the cottage that the two old men were suffering badly from shock
921-127937-0001	train-other-500	and fright Cardlestone still sat in his corner shivering and trembling he looked incapable of explaining anything Elphick was scarcely more fitted to speak
921-127937-0002	train-other-500	And when Breton issued his peremptory invitation to his guardian to tell the truth Spargo intervened Far better leave him alone Breton he said in a low voice
921-127937-0003	train-other-500	Don t you see the old chap s done up They re both done up We don t know what they ve gone through with this fellow before we came and it s certain they ve had no sleep Leave it all till later
921-127937-0004	train-other-500	after all we ve found them and we ve found him He jerked his thumb over his shoulder in Myerst s direction and Breton involuntarily followed the movement
921-127937-0005	train-other-500	He caught the prisoner s eye and Myerst laughed I daresay you two young men think yourselves very clever he said sneeringly Don t you now
921-127937-0006	train-other-500	We ve been clever enough to catch you anyway retorted Breton And now we ve got you we ll keep you till the police can relieve us of you Oh
921-127937-0007	train-other-500	said Myerst with another sneering laugh And on what charge do you propose to hand me over to the police It strikes me you ll have some difficulty in formulating one mister Breton Well see about that later
921-127937-0008	train-other-500	said Breton You ve extorted money by menaces from these gentlemen at any rate Have I How do you know they didn t entrust me with these cheques as their agent
921-127937-0009	train-other-500	exclaimed Myerst Answer me that Or rather let them answer if they dare Here you Cardlestone you Elphick
none	none	 didn t you give me these cheques as your agent 
921-127937-0010	train-other-500	Speak up now and quick Spargo watching the two old men saw them both quiver at the sound of Myerst s voice Cardlestone indeed began to whimper softly
921-127937-0011	train-other-500	Look here Breton he said whispering
none	none	 this scoundrel s got some hold on these two old chaps they re frightened to death of him 
921-127937-0012	train-other-500	Leave them alone it would be best for them if they could get some rest Hold your tongue you he added aloud turning to Myerst When we want you to speak we ll tell you
921-127937-0013	train-other-500	But Myerst laughed again All very high and mighty mister Spargo of the Watchman he sneered You re another of the cock sure lot And you re very clever
921-127937-0014	train-other-500	but not clever enough Now look here Supposing Spargo turned his back on him He went over to old Cardlestone and felt his hands And he turned to Breton
921-127937-0015	train-other-500	with a look of concern I say he exclaimed He s more than frightened he s ill What s to be done I asked the police to bring a doctor along with them answered Breton
921-127937-0016	train-other-500	In the meantime let s put him to bed there are beds in that inner room We ll get him to bed and give him something hot to drink that s all I can think of for the present Between them they managed to get
none	none	 Cardlestone to his bed 
921-127937-0017	train-other-500	and Spargo with a happy thought boiled water on the rusty stove and put hot bottles to his feet When that was done they persuaded Elphick to lie down in the inner room Presently
921-127937-0018	train-other-500	both old men fell asleep
none	none	 and then Breton and Spargo suddenly realized that they themselves were hungry and wet and weary There ought to be food in the cupboard 
921-127937-0019	train-other-500	said Breton beginning to rummage They ve generally had a good stock of tinned things Here we are Spargo these are tongues and sardines
921-127937-0020	train-other-500	Make some hot coffee while I open one of these tins The prisoner watched the preparations for a rough and ready breakfast with eyes that eventually began to glisten
921-127937-0021	train-other-500	I may remind you that I m hungry too he said as Spargo set the coffee on the table And you ve no right to starve me even if you ve the physical ability to keep me tied up
921-127937-0022	train-other-500	Give me something to eat if you please You shan t starve said Breton carelessly He cut an ample supply of bread and meat filled a cup with coffee and placed cup and plate before Myerst
921-127937-0023	train-other-500	Untie his right arm Spargo he continued I think we can give him that liberty We ve got his revolver anyhow For a while the three men ate and drank in silence
none	none	 At last Myerst pushed his plate away 
921-127937-0024	train-other-500	He looked scrutinizingly at his two captors Look here he said You think you know a lot about all this affair Spargo but there s only one person who knows all about it That s me
921-127937-0025	train-other-500	We re taking that for granted said Spargo We guessed as much when we found you here You ll have ample opportunity for explanation you know later on
921-127937-0026	train-other-500	I ll explain now if you care to hear said Myerst with another of his cynical laughs And if I do I ll tell you the truth I know you ve got an idea in your heads that isn t favourable to me but you re utterly wrong
921-127937-0027	train-other-500	whatever you may think Look here I ll make you a fair offer There are some cigars in my case there give me one and mix me a drink of that whisky a good un and I ll tell you what I know about this matter Come on
921-127937-0028	train-other-500	anything s better than sitting here doing nothing
none	none	 The two young men looked at each other 
921-127937-0029	train-other-500	Then Breton nodded Let him talk if he likes he said We re not bound to believe him And we may hear something that s true
none	none	 Give him his cigar and his drink 
921-127937-0030	train-other-500	Myerst took a stiff pull at the contents of the tumbler
921-127937-0031	train-other-500	which Spargo presently set before him He laughed as he inhaled the first fumes of his cigar As it happens you ll hear nothing but the truth he observed Now that things are as they are
921-127937-0032	train-other-500	there s no reason why I shouldn t tell the truth The fact is I ve nothing to fear You can t give me in charge for it so happens that I ve got a power of attorney
none	none	 from these two 
921-127937-0033	train-other-500	old chaps inside there to act for them in regard to the money they entrusted me with It s in an inside pocket of that letter case
921-127937-0034	train-other-500	and if you look at it Breton you ll see it s in order
none	none	 I m not even going to dare you to interfere with or destroy it 
921-127937-0035	train-other-500	you re a barrister and you ll respect the law But that s a fact and if anybody s got a case against anybody I have against you two for assault and illegal detention But I m not a vindictive man and
921-127937-0036	train-other-500	Breton took up Myerst s letter case and examined its contents And presently he turned to Spargo He s right he whispered
none	none	 This is quite in order 
921-127937-0037	train-other-500	He turned to Myerst All the same he said addressing him we shan t release you because we believe you re concerned in the murder of John Marbury We re justified in holding you on that account
none	none	 All right my young friend 
921-127937-0038	train-other-500	said Myerst Have your own stupid way But I said I d tell you the plain truth Well
none	none	 the plain truth is that I know no more of the absolute murder of your father 
921-127937-0039	train-other-500	than I know of what is going on in
none	none	 Timbuctoo at this moment 
921-127937-0040	train-other-500	I do not know who killed John Maitland That s a fact It may have been the old man in there who s already at his own last gasp or it mayn t
921-127937-0041	train-other-500	I tell you I don t know though like you Spargo I ve tried hard to find out That s the truth I do not know You expect us to believe that
921-127937-0042	train-other-500	exclaimed Breton incredulously Believe it or not as you like it s the truth answered Myerst Now look here
921-127937-0043	train-other-500	I said nobody knew as much of this affair as I know and that s true also And here s the truth of what I know
none	none	 The old man in that room 
921-127937-0044	train-other-500	whom you know as Nicholas Cardlestone is in reality Chamberlayne the stockbroker of Market Milcaster whose name was so freely mentioned when your father was tried there
921-127937-0045	train-other-500	That s another fact How asked Breton sternly can you prove it How do you know it Because replied Myerst with a cunning grin
921-127937-0046	train-other-500	I helped to carry out his mock death and burial I was a solicitor in those days and my name was something else There were three of us at it Chamberlayne s nephew
921-127937-0047	train-other-500	a doctor of no reputation and myself We carried it out very cleverly and Chamberlayne gave us five thousand pounds apiece for our trouble It was not the first time that I had helped him
921-127937-0048	train-other-500	and been well paid for my help The first time was in connection with the Cloudhampton Hearth and Home Mutual Benefit Society affair Aylmore or Ainsworth was as innocent
921-127937-0049	train-other-500	as a child in that Chamberlayne was the man at the back But unfortunately Chamberlayne didn t profit he lost all he got by it pretty quick
none	none	 That was why be transferred his abilities to Market Milcaster 
921-127937-0050	train-other-500	You can prove all this I suppose remarked Spargo Every word every letter But about the Market Milcaster affair Your father
921-127937-0051	train-other-500	Breton was right in what he said about Chamberlayne having all the money that was got from the bank He had and he engineered that mock death and funeral so that he could disappear
921-127937-0052	train-other-500	and he paid us who helped him generously as I ve told you The thing couldn t have been better done When it was done the nephew disappeared the doctor disappeared
921-127937-0053	train-other-500	Chamberlayne disappeared I had bad luck to tell you the truth I was struck off the rolls for a technical offence
none	none	 So I changed my name and became mister Myerst 
921-127937-0054	train-other-500	and eventually what I am now And it was not until three years ago that I found Chamberlayne I found him in this way
921-127937-0055	train-other-500	After I became secretary to the Safe Deposit Company I took chambers in the Temple above Cardlestone s And I speedily found out who he was
921-127937-0056	train-other-500	Instead of going abroad the old fox though he was a comparatively young un then had shaved off his beard settled down in the Temple and given himself up to his two hobbies collecting curiosities and stamps
none	none	 There he d lived quietly all these years 
921-127937-0057	train-other-500	and nobody had ever recognized or suspected him Indeed
none	none	 I don t see how they could 
921-127937-0058	train-other-500	he lived such a quiet secluded life with his collections his old port and his little whims and fads But I knew him
none	none	 And you doubtless profited by your recognition suggested Breton I certainly did He was glad to pay me a nice sum every quarter to hold my tongue 
921-127937-0059	train-other-500	replied Myerst and I was glad to take it and naturally I gained a considerable knowledge of him He had only one friend mister Elphick in there Now
921-127937-0060	train-other-500	I ll you about him
none	none	 Only if you are going to speak respectfully 
921-127937-0061	train-other-500	of him said Breton sternly I ve no reason to do otherwise Elphick is the man who ought to have married your mother When things turned out as they did Elphick took you and brought you
none	none	 up as he has done 
921-127937-0062	train-other-500	so that you should never know of your father s disgrace Elphick never knew until last night that Cardlestone is Chamberlayne Even the biggest scoundrels have friends Elphick s very fond of
none	none	 Cardlestone 
921-127937-0063	train-other-500	He Spargo turned sharply on Myerst You say Elphick didn t know until last night he exclaimed Why then this running away What were they running from
921-127937-0064	train-other-500	I have no more notion than you have Spargo replied Myerst
none	none	 I tell you one or other of them knows something that I don t 
921-127937-0065	train-other-500	Elphick I gather took fright from you and went to Cardlestone then they both vanished It may be that Cardlestone did kill Maitland I don t know
921-127937-0066	train-other-500	But I ll tell you what I know about the actual murder for I do know a good deal about it though
none	none	 as I say I don t know who killed Maitland 
921-127937-0067	train-other-500	Now first
none	none	 you know all that about 
921-127937-0068	train-other-500	Maitland s having papers and valuables and gold on him Very well I ve got all that The whole lot is locked up safely
none	none	 and I m willing to hand it over to you Breton 
921-127937-0069	train-other-500	when we go back to town and the necessary proof is given as it will be that you re Maitland s son Myerst paused to see the effect of this announcement
921-127937-0070	train-other-500	and laughed when he saw the blank astonishment which stole over his hearers faces
none	none	 And still more he continued 
921-127937-0071	train-other-500	I ve got all the contents of that leather box which Maitland deposited with me that s safely locked up too and at your disposal I took possession
921-127937-0072	train-other-500	of that the day after the murder Then for purposes of my own I went to Scotland Yard as Spargo there is aware You see I was playing a game and it required some ingenuity
921-127937-0073	train-other-500	A game exclaimed Breton Good heavens what game I never knew until I had possession of all these things that Marbury was Maitland of Market Milcaster
921-127937-0074	train-other-500	answered Myerst When I did know then I began to put things together and to pursue my own line independent of everybody I tell you I had all Maitland s papers and possessions
921-127937-0075	train-other-500	by that time except one thing That packet of Australian stamps And I found out that those stamps were in the hands of
none	none	 Cardlestone CHAPTER THIRTY SIX THE FINAL TELEGRAM Myerst paused to take a pull at his glass and to look at the two amazed listeners with a smile of conscious triumph In the hands of Cardlestone he repeated Now what did I argue from that Why of course that Maitland had been to Cardlestone s rooms that night Wasn t he found lying dead at the foot of Cardlestone s stairs Aye but who found him Not the porter not the police not you Master Spargo with all your cleverness The man who found Maitland lying dead there that night was I In the silence that followed Spargo who had been making notes of what Myerst said suddenly dropped his pencil and thrusting his hands in his pockets sat bolt upright with a look which Breton who was watching him seriously could not make out It was the look of a man whose ideas and conceptions are being rudely upset And Myerst too saw it and he laughed more sneeringly than ever That s one for you Spargo he said That surprises you that makes you think Now what do you think if one may ask I think said Spargo that you are either a consummate liar or that this mystery is bigger than before I can lie when it s necessary retorted Myerst Just now it isn t necessary I m telling you the plain truth there s no reason why I shouldn t As I ve said before although you two young bullies have tied me up in this fashion you can t do anything against me I ve a power of attorney from those two old men in there and that s enough to satisfy anybody as to my possession of their cheques and securities I ve the whip hand of you my sons in all ways And that s why I m telling you the truth to amuse myself during this period of waiting The plain truth my sons In pursuance of which observed Breton drily I think you mentioned that you were the first person to find my father lying dead I was That is as far as I can gather I ll tell you all about it As I said I live over Cardlestone That night I came home very late it was well past one o clock There was nobody about as a matter of fact no one has residential chambers in that building but Cardlestone and myself I found the body of a man lying in the entry I struck a match and immediately recognized my visitor of the afternoon John Marbury Now although I was so late in going home I was as sober as a man can be and I think pretty quickly at all times I thought at double extra speed just then And the first thing I did was to strip the body of every article it had on it money papers everything All these things are safely locked up they ve never been tracked Next day using my facilities as secretary to the Safe Deposit Company I secured the things in that box Then I found out who the dead man really was And then I deliberately set to work to throw dust in the eyes of the police and of the newspapers and particularly in the eyes of young Master Spargo there I had an object What asked Breton What Knowing all I did I firmly believed that Marbury or rather Maitland had been murdered by either Cardlestone or Elphick I put it to myself in this way and my opinion was strengthened as you Spargo inserted news in your paper Maitland finding himself in the vicinity of Cardlestone after leaving Aylmore s rooms that night turned into our building perhaps just to see where Cardlestone lived He met Cardlestone accidentally or he perhaps met Cardlestone and Elphick together they recognized each other Maitland probably threatened to expose Cardlestone or rather Chamberlayne nobody of course could know what happened but my theory was that Chamberlayne killed him There at any rate was the fact that Maitland was found murdered at Chamberlayne s very threshold And in the course of a few days I proved to my own positive satisfaction by getting access to Chamberlayne s rooms in his absence that Maitland had been there had been in those rooms For I found there in Chamberlayne s desk the rare Australian stamps of which Criedir told at the inquest That was proof positive Spargo looked at Breton They knew what Myerst did not know that the stamps of which he spoke were lying in Spargo s breast pocket where they had lain since he had picked them up from the litter and confusion of Chamberlayne s floor Why asked Breton after a pause why did you never accuse Cardlestone or Chamberlayne of the murder I did I have accused him a score of times and Elphick too replied Myerst with emphasis Not at first mind you I never let Chamberlayne know that I ever suspected him for some time I had my own game to play But at last not so many days ago I did I accused them both That s how I got the whip hand of them They began to be afraid by that time Elphick had got to know all about Cardlestone s past as Chamberlayne And as I tell you Elphick s fond of Cardlestone It s queer but he is He wants to shield him What did they say when you accused them asked Breton Let s keep to that point never mind their feelings for one another Just so but that feeling s a lot more to do with this mystery than you think my young friend said Myerst What did they say you ask Why they strenuously denied it Cardlestone swore solemnly to me that he had no part or lot in the murder of Maitland So did Elphick But they know something about the murder If those two old men can t tell you definitely who actually struck John Maitland down I m certain that they have a very clear idea in their minds as to who really did They A sudden sharp cry from the inner room interrupted Myerst Breton and Spargo started to their feet and made for the door But before they could reach it Elphick came out white and shaking He s gone he exclaimed in quavering accents My old friend s gone he s dead I was asleep I woke suddenly and looked at him He Spargo forced the old man into a chair and gave him some whisky Breton passed quickly into the inner room only to come back shaking his head He s dead he said He evidently died in his sleep Then his secret s gone with him remarked Myerst calmly And now we shall never know if he did kill John Maitland or if he didn t So that s done with Old Elphick suddenly sat up in his chair pushing Spargo fiercely away from his side He didn t kill John Maitland he cried angrily attempting to shake his fist at Myerst Whoever says he killed Maitland lies He was as innocent as I am You ve tortured and tormented him to his death with that charge as you re torturing me among you I tell you he d nothing to do with John Maitland s death nothing Myerst laughed Who had then he said Hold your tongue commanded Breton turning angrily on him He sat down by Elphick s side and laid his hand soothingly on the old man s arm Guardian he said why don t you tell what you know Don t be afraid of that fellow there he s safe enough Tell Spargo and me what you know of the matter Remember nothing can hurt Cardlestone or Chamberlayne or whoever he is or was now Elphick sat for a moment shaking his head He allowed Spargo to give him another drink he lifted his head and looked at the two young men with something of an appeal I m badly shaken he said I ve suffered much lately I ve learnt things that I didn t know Perhaps I ought to have spoken before but I was afraid for for him He was a good friend Cardlestone whatever else he may have been a good friend And I don t know any more than what happened that night Tell us what happened that night said Breton Well that night I went round as I often did to play piquet with Cardlestone That was about ten o clock About eleven Jane Baylis came to Cardlestone s she d been to my rooms to find me wanted to see me particularly and she d come on there knowing where I should be Cardlestone would make her have a glass of wine and a biscuit she sat down and we all talked Then about I should think a quarter to twelve a knock came at Cardlestone s door his outer door was open and of course anybody outside could see lights within Cardlestone went to the door we heard a man s voice enquire for him by name then the voice added that Criedir the stamp dealer had advised him to call on mister Cardlestone to show him some rare Australian stamps and that seeing a light under his door he had knocked Cardlestone asked him in he came in That was the man we saw next day at the mortuary Upon my honour we didn t know him either that night or next day What happened when he came in asked Breton Cardlestone asked him to sit down he offered and gave him a drink The man said Criedir had given him Cardlestone s address and that he d been with a friend at some rooms in Fountain Court and as he was passing our building he d just looked to make sure where Cardlestone lived and as he d noticed a light he d made bold to knock He and Cardlestone began to examine the stamps Jane Baylis said good night and she and I left Cardlestone and the man together No one had recognized him said Breton No one Remember I only once or twice saw Maitland in all my life The others certainly did not recognize him At least I never knew that they did if they did Tell us said Spargo joining in for the first time tell us what you and Miss Baylis did At the foot of the stairs Jane Baylis suddenly said she d forgotten something in Cardlestone s lobby As she was going out in to Fleet Street and I was going down Middle Temple Lane to turn off to my own rooms we said good night She went back upstairs And I went home And upon my soul and honour that s all I know Spargo suddenly leapt to his feet He snatched at his cap a sodden and bedraggled headgear which he had thrown down when they entered the cottage That s enough he almost shouted I ve got it at last Breton where s the nearest telegraph office Hawes Straight down this valley Then here s for it Look after things till I m back or when the police come join me there I shall catch the first train to town anyhow after wiring But what are you after Spargo exclaimed Breton Stop What on earth But Spargo had closed the door and was running for all he was worth down the valley Three quarters of an hour later he startled a quiet and peaceful telegraphist by darting breathless and dirty into a sleepy country post office snatching a telegraph form and scribbling down a message in shaky handwriting Rathbury New Scotland Yard London Arrest Jane Baylis at once for murder of John Maitland Coming straight to town with full evidence Frank Spargo Then Spargo dropped on the office bench and while the wondering operator set the wires ticking strove to get his breath utterly spent in his mad race across the heather And when it was got he set out again to find the station Some days later Spargo having seen Stephen Aylmore walk out of the Bow Street dock cleared of the charge against him and in a fair way of being cleared of the affair of twenty years before found himself in a very quiet corner of the Court holding the hand of Jessie Aylmore who he discovered was saying things to him which he scarcely comprehended There was nobody near them and the girl spoke freely and warmly But you will come you will come today and be properly thanked she said You will won t you Spargo allowed himself to retain possession of the hand Also he took a straight look into Jessie Aylmore s eyes I don t want thanks he said It was all a lot of luck And if I come today it will be to see just you Jessie Aylmore looked down at the two hands I think she whispered I think that is what I really meant THE END End of Project Gutenberg s The Middle Temple Murder by J S Fletcher END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE MIDDLE TEMPLE MURDER This file should

Gutenberg tm electronic works Professor Michael S Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone For thirty years he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support Project Gutenberg tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U S unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook s eBook number often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII compressed zipped HTML and others Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over the old filename and etext number The replaced older file is renamed VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving new filenames and etext numbers Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility http www gutenberg net This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg tm including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation how to help produce our new eBooks and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks EBooks posted prior to November two thousand three with eBook numbers BELOW
