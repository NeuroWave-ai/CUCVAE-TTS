4406_16882_000005_000005	train-clean-100	See now that I even I am he and there is no god with me I kill and I make alive I wound and I heal neither is there any can deliver out of my hand 
none	none	On the tenth of February sixteen seventy five came the Indians with great numbers upon Lancaster their first coming was about sunrising hearing the noise of some guns we looked out several houses were burning and the smoke ascending to heaven 
4406_16882_000006_000001	train-clean-100	There were five persons taken in one house the father and the mother and a sucking child they knocked on the head the other two they took and carried away alive 
none	none	There were two others who being out of their garrison upon some occasion were set upon one was knocked on the head the other escaped another there was who running along was shot and wounded and fell down he begged of them his life promising them money as they told me but they would not hearken to him but knocked him in head and stripped him naked and split open his bowels 
4406_16882_000006_000003	train-clean-100	Another seeing many of the Indians about his barn ventured and went out but was quickly shot down 
none	none	There were three others belonging to the same garrison who were killed the Indians getting up upon the roof of the barn had advantage to shoot down upon them over their fortification Thus these murderous wretches went on burning and destroying before them At length they came and beset our own house and quickly it was the dolefulest day that ever mine eyes saw The house stood upon the edge of a hill some of the Indians got behind the hill others into the barn and others behind anything that could shelter them from all which places they shot against the house so that the bullets seemed to fly like hail and quickly they wounded one man among us then another and then a third About two hours according to my observation in that amazing time they had been about the house before they prevailed to fire it which they did with flax and hemp which they brought out of the barn and there being no defense about the house only two flankers at two opposite corners and one of them not finished they fired it once and one ventured out and quenched it but they quickly fired it again and that took Now is the dreadful hour come that I have often heard of in time of war as it was the case of others but now mine eyes see it 
4406_16882_000007_000004	train-clean-100	Some in our house were fighting for their lives others wallowing in their blood the house on fire over our heads and the bloody heathen ready to knock us on the head if we stirred out 
none	none	Now might we hear mothers and children crying out for themselves and one another Lord what shall we do Then I took my children and one of my sisters hers to go forth and leave the house but as soon as we came to the door and appeared the Indians shot so thick that the bullets rattled against the house as if one had taken an handful of stones and threw them so that we were fain to give back We had six stout dogs belonging to our garrison but none of them would stir though another time if any Indian had come to the door they were ready to fly upon him and tear him down The Lord hereby would make us the more acknowledge His hand and to see that our help is always in Him But out we must go the fire increasing and coming along behind us roaring and the Indians gaping before us with their guns spears and hatchets to devour us 
4406_16882_000007_000008	train-clean-100	No sooner were we out of the house but my brother in law being before wounded in defending the house in or near the throat fell down dead whereat the Indians scornfully shouted and hallowed and were presently upon him stripping off his clothes the bullets flying thick one went through my side and the same as would seem through the bowels and hand of my dear child in my arms 
4406_16882_000007_000009	train-clean-100	One of my elder sisters children named William had then his leg broken which the Indians perceiving they knocked him on his head 
none	none	Thus were we butchered by those merciless heathen standing amazed with the blood running down to our heels My eldest sister being yet in the house and seeing those woeful sights the infidels hauling mothers one way and children another and some wallowing in their blood and her elder son telling her that her son William was dead and myself was wounded she said And Lord let me die with them which was no sooner said but she was struck with a bullet and fell down dead over the threshold 
4406_16882_000007_000012	train-clean-100	I hope she is reaping the fruit of her good labors being faithful to the service of God in her place 
none	none	In her younger years she lay under much trouble upon spiritual accounts till it pleased God to make that precious scripture take hold of her heart And he said unto me my Grace is sufficient for thee two Corinthians twelve point nine 
4406_16882_000007_000014	train-clean-100	More than twenty years after I have heard her tell how sweet and comfortable that place was to her 
4406_16882_000007_000015	train-clean-100	But to return the Indians laid hold of us pulling me one way and the children another and said Come go along with us I told them they would kill me they answered if I were willing to go along with them they would not hurt me 
4406_16882_000008_000000	train-clean-100	Oh the doleful sight that now was to behold at this house 
none	none	Come behold the works of the Lord what desolations he has made in the earth Of thirty seven persons who were in this one house none escaped either present death or a bitter captivity save only one who might say as he And I only am escaped alone to tell the News Job one point fifteen 
4406_16882_000008_000002	train-clean-100	There were twelve killed some shot some stabbed with their spears some knocked down with their hatchets 
4406_16882_000008_000003	train-clean-100	When we are in prosperity Oh the little that we think of such dreadful sights and to see our dear friends and relations lie bleeding out their heart blood upon the ground 
4406_16882_000008_000004	train-clean-100	There was one who was chopped into the head with a hatchet and stripped naked and yet was crawling up and down 
none	none	It is a solemn sight to see so many Christians lying in their blood some here and some there like a company of sheep torn by wolves all of them stripped naked by a company of hell hounds roaring singing ranting and insulting as if they would have torn our very hearts out yet the Lord by His almighty power preserved a number of us from death for there were twenty four of us taken alive and carried captive I had often before this said that if the Indians should come I should choose rather to be killed by them than taken alive but when it came to the trial my mind changed their glittering weapons so daunted my spirit that I chose rather to go along with those as I may say ravenous beasts than that moment to end my days and that I may the better declare what happened to me during that grievous captivity I shall particularly speak of the several removes we had up and down the wilderness THE FIRST REMOVE 
4406_16882_000011_000000	train-clean-100	Now away we must go with those barbarous creatures with our bodies wounded and bleeding and our hearts no less than our bodies 
none	none	About a mile we went that night up upon a hill within sight of the town where they intended to lodge 
4406_16882_000011_000002	train-clean-100	There was hard by a vacant house deserted by the English before for fear of the Indians 
4406_16882_000011_000003	train-clean-100	I asked them whether I might not lodge in the house that night to which they answered What will you love English men still 
none	none	This was the dolefulest night that ever my eyes saw Oh the roaring and singing and dancing and yelling of those black creatures in the night which made the place a lively resemblance of hell And as miserable was the waste that was there made of horses cattle sheep swine calves lambs roasting pigs and fowl which they had plundered in the town some roasting some lying and burning and some boiling to feed our merciless enemies who were joyful enough though we were disconsolate To add to the dolefulness of the former day and the dismalness of the present night my thoughts ran upon my losses and sad bereaved condition All was gone my husband gone at least separated from me he being in the Bay and to add to my grief the Indians told me they would kill him as he came homeward my children gone my relations and friends gone our house and home and all our comforts within door and without all was gone except my life and I knew not but the next moment that might go too 
4406_16882_000011_000009	train-clean-100	There remained nothing to me but one poor wounded babe and it seemed at present worse than death that it was in such a pitiful condition bespeaking compassion and I had no refreshing for it nor suitable things to revive it 
none	none	Little do many think what is the savageness and brutishness of this barbarous enemy Ay even those that seem to profess more than others among them when the English have fallen into their hands Those seven that were killed at Lancaster the summer before upon a Sabbath day and the one that was afterward killed upon a weekday were slain and mangled in a barbarous manner by one eyed John and Marlborough s Praying Indians which captain Mosely brought to Boston as the Indians told me THE SECOND REMOVE But now the next morning I must turn my back upon the town and travel with them into the vast and desolate wilderness I knew not whither It is not my tongue or pen can express the sorrows of my heart and bitterness of my spirit that I had at this departure but God was with me in a wonderful manner carrying me along and bearing up my spirit that it did not quite fail 
4406_16882_000014_000001	train-clean-100	One of the Indians carried my poor wounded babe upon a horse it went moaning all along I shall die I shall die I went on foot after it with sorrow that cannot be expressed At length I took it off the horse and carried it in my arms till my strength failed and I fell down with it 
4406_16882_000014_000002	train-clean-100	Then they set me upon a horse with my wounded child in my lap and there being no furniture upon the horse s back as we were going down a steep hill we both fell over the horse s head at which they like inhumane creatures laughed and rejoiced to see it though I thought we should there have ended our days as overcome with so many difficulties 
none	none	But the Lord renewed my strength still and carried me along that I might see more of His power yea so much that I could never have thought of had I not experienced it After this it quickly began to snow and when night came on they stopped and now down I must sit in the snow by a little fire and a few boughs behind me with my sick child in my lap and calling much for water being now through the wound fallen into a violent fever My own wound also growing so stiff that I could scarce sit down or rise up yet so it must be that I must sit all this cold winter night upon the cold snowy ground with my sick child in my arms looking that every hour would be the last of its life and having no Christian friend near me either to comfort or help me 
4406_16882_000015_000002	train-clean-100	Oh I may see the wonderful power of God that my Spirit did not utterly sink under my affliction still the Lord upheld me with His gracious and merciful spirit and we were both alive to see the light of the next morning 
4406_16882_000016_000000	train-clean-100	THE THIRD REMOVE
none	none	 The morning being come they prepared to go on their way 
4406_16882_000017_000001	train-clean-100	One of the Indians got up upon a horse and they set me up behind him with my poor sick babe in my lap 
none	none	A very wearisome and tedious day I had of it what with my own wound and my child s being so exceeding sick and in a lamentable condition with her wound It may be easily judged what a poor feeble condition we were in there being not the least crumb of refreshing that came within either of our mouths from Wednesday night to Saturday night except only a little cold water This day in the afternoon about an hour by sun we came to the place where they intended viz an Indian town called Wenimesset northward of Quabaug When we were come Oh the number of pagans now merciless enemies that there came about me that I may say as David I had fainted unless I had believed et cetera Psalm twenty seven point thirteen 
4406_16882_000017_000005	train-clean-100	The next day was the Sabbath 
4406_16882_000017_000006	train-clean-100	I then remembered how careless I had been of God s holy time how many Sabbaths I had lost and misspent and how evilly I had walked in God s sight which lay so close unto my spirit that it was easy for me to see how righteous it was with God to cut off the thread of my life and cast me out of His presence forever 
4406_16882_000017_000007	train-clean-100	Yet the Lord still showed mercy to me and upheld me and as He wounded me with one hand so he healed me with the other 
none	none	This day there came to me one Robert Pepper a man belonging to Roxbury who was taken in Captain Beers s fight and had been now a considerable time with the Indians and up with them almost as far as Albany to see King Philip as he told me and was now very lately come into these parts 
4406_16882_000017_000009	train-clean-100	Hearing I say that I was in this Indian town he obtained leave to come and see me 
4406_16882_000017_000010	train-clean-100	He told me he himself was wounded in the leg at Captain Beer s fight and was not able some time to go but as they carried him and as he took oaken leaves and laid to his wound and through the blessing of God he was able to travel again 
none	none	Then I took oaken leaves and laid to my side and with the blessing of God it cured me also yet before the cure was wrought I may say as it is in Psalm thirty eight point five six My wounds stink and are corrupt I am troubled I am bowed down greatly I go mourning all the day long I sat much alone with a poor wounded child in my lap which moaned night and day having nothing to revive the body or cheer the spirits of her but instead of that sometimes one Indian would come and tell me one hour that your master will knock your child in the head and then a second and then a third your master will quickly knock your child in the head This was the comfort I had from them miserable comforters are ye all as he said Thus nine days I sat upon my knees with my babe in my lap till my flesh was raw again my child being even ready to depart this sorrowful world they bade me carry it out to another wigwam I suppose because they would not be troubled with such spectacles whither I went with a very heavy heart and down I sat with the picture of death in my lap 
4406_16882_000018_000002	train-clean-100	About two hours in the night my sweet babe like a lamb departed this life on Feb eighteen sixteen seventy five 
4406_16882_000018_000003	train-clean-100	It being about six years and five months old 
4406_16882_000018_000004	train-clean-100	It was nine days from the first wounding in this miserable condition without any refreshing of one nature or other except a little cold water 
none	none	I cannot but take notice how at another time I could not bear to be in the room where any dead person was but now the case is changed I must and could lie down by my dead babe side by side all the night after I have thought since of the wonderful goodness of God to me in preserving me in the use of my reason and senses in that distressed time that I did not use wicked and violent means to end my own miserable life In the morning when they understood that my child was dead they sent for me home to my master s wigwam by my master in this writing must be understood Quinnapin who was a Sagamore and married King Philip s wife s sister not that he first took me but I was sold to him by another Narragansett Indian who took me when first I came out of the garrison 
4406_16882_000018_000008	train-clean-100	I went to take up my dead child in my arms to carry it with me but they bid me let it alone there was no resisting but go I must and leave it 
none	none	When I had been at my master s wigwam I took the first opportunity I could get to go look after my dead child When I came I asked them what they had done with it then they told me it was upon the hill Then they went and showed me where it was where I saw the ground was newly digged and there they told me they had buried it There I left that child in the wilderness and must commit it and myself also in this wilderness condition to Him who is above all 
4406_16882_000018_000012	train-clean-100	God having taken away this dear child I went to see my daughter Mary who was at this same Indian town at a wigwam not very far off though we had little liberty or opportunity to see one another 
none	none	She was about ten years old and taken from the door at first by a Praying Ind and afterward sold for a gun When I came in sight she would fall aweeping at which they were provoked and would not let me come near her but bade me be gone which was a heart cutting word to me 
4406_16882_000018_000015	train-clean-100	I had one child dead another in the wilderness I knew not where the third they would not let me come near to Me as he said have ye bereaved of my Children Joseph is not and Simeon is not and ye will take Benjamin also all these things are against me I could not sit still in this condition but kept walking from one place to another 
4406_16882_000018_000016	train-clean-100	And as I was going along my heart was even overwhelmed with the thoughts of my condition and that I should have children and a nation which I knew not ruled over them 
none	none	Whereupon I earnestly entreated the Lord that He would consider my low estate and show me a token for good and if it were His blessed will some sign and hope of some relief And indeed quickly the Lord answered in some measure my poor prayers for as I was going up and down mourning and lamenting my condition my son came to me and asked me how I did 
4406_16882_000018_000019	train-clean-100	I had not seen him before since the destruction of the town and I knew not where he was till I was informed by himself that he was amongst a smaller parcel of Indians whose place was about six miles off 
4406_16882_000018_000020	train-clean-100	With tears in his eyes he asked me whether his sister Sarah was dead and told me he had seen his sister Mary and prayed me that I would not be troubled in reference to himself 
none	none	The occasion of his coming to see me at this time was this there was as I said about six miles from us a small plantation of Indians where it seems he had been during his captivity and at this time there were some forces of the Ind gathered out of our company and some also from them among whom was my son s master to go to assault and burn Medfield 
4406_16882_000018_000022	train-clean-100	In this time of the absence of his master his dame brought him to see me 
4406_16882_000018_000023	train-clean-100	I took this to be some gracious answer to my earnest and unfeigned desire 
none	none	The next day viz to this the Indians returned from Medfield all the company for those that belonged to the other small company came through the town that now we were at But before they came to us Oh the outrageous roaring and hooping that there was 
4406_16882_000018_000025	train-clean-100	They began their din about a mile before they came to us By their noise and hooping they signified how many they had destroyed which was at that time twenty three 
none	none	Those that were with us at home were gathered together as soon as they heard the hooping and every time that the other went over their number these at home gave a shout that the very earth rung again And thus they continued till those that had been upon the expedition were come up to the Sagamore s wigwam and then Oh the hideous insulting and triumphing that there was over some Englishmen s scalps that they had taken as their manner is and brought with them 
4406_16882_000018_000028	train-clean-100	I cannot but take notice of the wonderful mercy of God to me in those afflictions in sending me a Bible 
none	none	One of the Indians that came from Medfield fight had brought some plunder came to me and asked me if I would have a Bible he had got one in his basket 
4406_16882_000018_000030	train-clean-100	I was glad of it and asked him whether he thought the Indians would let me read 
none	none	He answered yes So I took the Bible and in that melancholy time it came into my mind to read first the twenty eighth chapter of Deuteronomy which I did and when I had read it my dark heart wrought on this manner that there was no mercy for me that the blessings were gone and the curses come in their room and that I had lost my opportunity But the Lord helped me still to go on reading till I came to Chap thirty the seven first verses where I found there was mercy promised again if we would return to Him by repentance and though we were scattered from one end of the earth to the other yet the Lord would gather us together and turn all those curses upon our enemies 
4406_16882_000018_000034	train-clean-100	I do not desire to live to forget this Scripture and what comfort it was to me 
none	none	Now the Ind began to talk of removing from this place some one way and some another 
4406_16882_000019_000001	train-clean-100	There were now besides myself nine English captives in this place all of them children except one woman 
none	none	I got an opportunity to go and take my leave of them 
4406_16882_000019_000003	train-clean-100	They being to go one way and I another I asked them whether they were earnest with God for deliverance 
4406_16882_000019_000004	train-clean-100	They told me they did as they were able and it was some comfort to me that the Lord stirred up children to look to Him 
none	none	The woman viz goodwife Joslin told me she should never see me again and that she could find in her heart to run away I wished her not to run away by any means for we were near thirty miles from any English town and she very big with child and had but one week to reckon and another child in her arms two years old and bad rivers there were to go over and we were feeble with our poor and coarse entertainment 
4406_16882_000019_000007	train-clean-100	I had my Bible with me I pulled it out and asked her whether she would read 
none	none	We opened the Bible and lighted on Psalm twenty seven in which Psalm we especially took notice of that ver ult Wait on the Lord Be of good courage and he shall strengthen thine Heart wait I say on the Lord 
4406_16882_000020_000000	train-clean-100	THE FOURTH REMOVE
4406_16882_000021_000000	train-clean-100	And now I must part with that little company I had 
4406_16882_000021_000001	train-clean-100	Here I parted from my daughter Mary whom I never saw again till I saw her in Dorchester returned from captivity and from four little cousins and neighbors some of which I never saw afterward the Lord only knows the end of them 
none	none	Amongst them also was that poor woman before mentioned who came to a sad end as some of the company told me in my travel she having much grief upon her spirit about her miserable condition being so near her time she would be often asking the Indians to let her go home they not being willing to that and yet vexed with her importunity gathered a great company together about her and stripped her naked and set her in the midst of them and when they had sung and danced about her in their hellish manner as long as they pleased they knocked her on head and the child in her arms with her When they had done that they made a fire and put them both into it and told the other children that were with them that if they attempted to go home they would serve them in like manner The children said she did not shed one tear but prayed all the while But to return to my own journey we traveled about half a day or little more and came to a desolate place in the wilderness where there were no wigwams or inhabitants before we came about the middle of the afternoon to this place cold and wet and snowy and hungry and weary and no refreshing for man but the cold ground to sit on and our poor Indian cheer 
4406_16882_000022_000000	train-clean-100	Heart aching thoughts here I had about my poor children who were scattered up and down among the wild beasts of the forest 
none	none	My head was light and dizzy either through hunger or hard lodging or trouble or all together my knees feeble my body raw by sitting double night and day that I cannot express to man the affliction that lay upon my spirit but the Lord helped me at that time to express it to Himself I opened my Bible to read and the Lord brought that precious Scripture to me Thus saith the Lord refrain thy voice from weeping and thine eyes from tears for thy work shall be rewarded and they shall come again from the land of the enemy Jeremiah thirty one point sixteen This was a sweet cordial to me when I was ready to faint many and many a time have I sat down and wept sweetly over this Scripture 
4406_16882_000022_000005	train-clean-100	At this place we continued about four days 
none	none	THE FIFTH REMOVE 
4406_16882_000024_000000	train-clean-100	The occasion as I thought of their moving at this time was the English army it being near and following them 
none	none	For they went as if they had gone for their lives for some considerable way and then they made a stop and chose some of their stoutest men and sent them back to hold the English army in play whilst the rest escaped And then like Jehu they marched on furiously with their old and with their young some carried their old decrepit mothers some carried one and some another Four of them carried a great Indian upon a bier but going through a thick wood with him they were hindered and could make no haste whereupon they took him upon their backs and carried him one at a time till they came to Banquaug river 
4406_16882_000024_000003	train-clean-100	Upon a Friday a little after noon we came to this river 
none	none	When all the company was come up and were gathered together I thought to count the number of them but they were so many and being somewhat in motion it was beyond my skill 
4406_16882_000024_000005	train-clean-100	In this travel because of my wound I was somewhat favored in my load I carried only my knitting work and two quarts of parched meal 
4406_16882_000024_000006	train-clean-100	Being very faint I asked my mistress to give me one spoonful of the meal but she would not give me a taste 
4406_16882_000024_000007	train-clean-100	They quickly fell to cutting dry trees to make rafts to carry them over the river and soon my turn came to go over 
4406_16882_000024_000008	train-clean-100	By the advantage of some brush which they had laid upon the raft to sit upon I did not wet my foot which many of themselves at the other end were mid leg deep which cannot but be acknowledged as a favor of God to my weakened body it being a very cold time 
4406_16882_000024_000009	train-clean-100	I was not before acquainted with such kind of doings or dangers 
none	none	When thou passeth through the waters I will be with thee and through the rivers they shall not overflow thee Isaiah forty three point two 
4406_16882_000024_000011	train-clean-100	A certain number of us got over the river that night but it was the night after the Sabbath before all the company was got over 
4406_16882_000024_000012	train-clean-100	On the Saturday they boiled an old horse s leg which they had got and so we drank of the broth as soon as they thought it was ready and when it was almost all gone they filled it up again 
none	none	The first week of my being among them I hardly ate any thing the second week I found my stomach grow very faint for want of something and yet it was very hard to get down their filthy trash but the third week though I could think how formerly my stomach would turn against this or that and I could starve and die before I could eat such things yet they were sweet and savory to my taste 
4406_16882_000025_000001	train-clean-100	I was at this time knitting a pair of white cotton stockings for my mistress and had not yet wrought upon a Sabbath day 
none	none	When the Sabbath came they bade me go to work 
4406_16882_000025_000003	train-clean-100	I told them it was the Sabbath day and desired them to let me rest and told them I would do as much more tomorrow to which they answered me they would break my face 
none	none	And here I cannot but take notice of the strange providence of God in preserving the heathen They were many hundreds old and young some sick and some lame many had papooses at their backs 
4406_16882_000025_000006	train-clean-100	The greatest number at this time with us were squaws and they traveled with all they had bag and baggage and yet they got over this river aforesaid and on Monday they set their wigwams on fire and away they went 
none	none	On that very day came the English army after them to this river and saw the smoke of their wigwams and yet this river put a stop to them 
4406_16882_000025_000008	train-clean-100	God did not give them courage or activity to go over after us 
none	none	We were not ready for so great a mercy as victory and deliverance If we had been God would have found out a way for the English to have passed this river as well as for the Indians with their squaws and children and all their luggage Oh that my people had hearkened to me and Israel had walked in my ways I should soon have subdued their enemies and turned my hand against their adversaries Psalm eighty one point thirteen fourteen 
4406_16882_000026_000000	train-clean-100	THE SIXTH REMOVE
4406_16882_000027_000000	train-clean-100	On Monday as I said they set their wigwams on fire and went away 
4406_16882_000027_000001	train-clean-100	It was a cold morning and before us there was a great brook with ice on it some waded through it up to the knees and higher but others went till they came to a beaver dam and I amongst them where through the good providence of God I did not wet my foot 
none	none	I went along that day mourning and lamenting leaving farther my own country and traveling into a vast and howling wilderness and I understood something of Lot s wife s temptation when she looked back 
4406_16882_000027_000003	train-clean-100	We came that day to a great swamp by the side of which we took up our lodging that night 
4406_16882_000027_000004	train-clean-100	When I came to the brow of the hill that looked toward the swamp I thought we had been come to a great Indian town though there were none but our own company 
4406_16882_000027_000005	train-clean-100	The Indians were as thick as the trees it seemed as if there had been a thousand hatchets going at once 
none	none	If one looked before one there was nothing but Indians and behind one nothing but Indians and so on either hand I myself in the midst and no Christian soul near me and yet how hath the Lord preserved me in safety 
4406_16882_000027_000007	train-clean-100	Oh the experience that I have had of the goodness of God to me and mine 
none	none	THE SEVENTH REMOVE After a restless and hungry night there we had a wearisome time of it the next day 
4406_16882_000029_000001	train-clean-100	The swamp by which we lay was as it were a deep dungeon and an exceeding high and steep hill before it 
4406_16882_000029_000002	train-clean-100	Before I got to the top of the hill I thought my heart and legs and all would have broken and failed me 
4406_16882_000029_000003	train-clean-100	What through faintness and soreness of body it was a grievous day of travel to me 
4406_16882_000029_000004	train-clean-100	As we went along I saw a place where English cattle had been 
4406_16882_000029_000005	train-clean-100	That was comfort to me such as it was 
none	none	Quickly after that we came to an English path which so took with me that I thought I could have freely lyen down and died 
4406_16882_000029_000007	train-clean-100	That day a little after noon we came to Squakeag where the Indians quickly spread themselves over the deserted English fields gleaning what they could find 
none	none	Some picked up ears of wheat that were crickled down some found ears of Indian corn some found ground nuts and others sheaves of wheat that were frozen together in the shock and went to threshing of them out Myself got two ears of Indian corn and whilst I did but turn my back one of them was stolen from me which much troubled me 
4406_16882_000029_000009	train-clean-100	There came an Indian to them at that time with a basket of horse liver 
4406_16882_000029_000010	train-clean-100	I asked him to give me a piece 
none	none	What says he can you eat horse liver I told him I would try if he would give a piece which he did and I laid it on the coals to roast But before it was half ready they got half of it away from me so that I was fain to take the rest and eat it as it was with the blood about my mouth and yet a savory bit it was to me For to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet A solemn sight methought it was to see fields of wheat and Indian corn forsaken and spoiled and the remainders of them to be food for our merciless enemies That night we had a mess of wheat for our supper 
4406_16883_000000_000000	train-clean-100	THE EIGHTH REMOVE
4406_16883_000001_000000	train-clean-100	On the morrow morning we must go over the river i e 
4406_16883_000001_000001	train-clean-100	Connecticut to meet with King Philip 
4406_16883_000001_000002	train-clean-100	Two canoes full they had carried over the next turn I myself was to go 
4406_16883_000001_000003	train-clean-100	But as my foot was upon the canoe to step in there was a sudden outcry among them and I must step back and instead of going over the river I must go four or five miles up the river farther northward 
none	none	Some of the Indians ran one way and some another The cause of this rout was as I thought their espying some English scouts who were thereabout In this travel up the river about noon the company made a stop and sat down some to eat and others to rest them As I sat amongst them musing of things past my son Joseph unexpectedly came to me We asked of each other s welfare bemoaning our doleful condition and the change that had come upon us 
4406_16883_000001_000007	train-clean-100	We had husband and father and children and sisters and friends and relations and house and home and many comforts of this life but now we may say as Job Naked came I out of my mother s womb and naked shall I return the Lord gave the Lord hath taken away blessed be the name of the Lord I asked him whether he would read 
none	none	He told me he earnestly desired it I gave him my Bible and he lighted upon that comfortable Scripture I shall not die but live and declare the works of the Lord the Lord hath chastened me sore yet he hath not given me over to death Psalm one hundred eighteen point seventeen eighteen Look here mother says he did you read this And here I may take occasion to mention one principal ground of my setting forth these lines even as the psalmist says to declare the works of the Lord and His wonderful power in carrying us along preserving us in the wilderness while under the enemy s hand and returning of us in safety again 
4406_16883_000001_000010	train-clean-100	And His goodness in bringing to my hand so many comfortable and suitable scriptures in my distress 
none	none	But to return we traveled on till night and in the morning we must go over the river to Philip s crew When I was in the canoe I could not but be amazed at the numerous crew of pagans that were on the bank on the other side 
4406_16883_000001_000013	train-clean-100	When I came ashore they gathered all about me I sitting alone in the midst 
none	none	I observed they asked one another questions and laughed and rejoiced over their gains and victories Then my heart began to fail and I fell aweeping which was the first time to my remembrance that I wept before them 
4406_16883_000001_000016	train-clean-100	Although I had met with so much affliction and my heart was many times ready to break yet could I not shed one tear in their sight but rather had been all this while in a maze and like one astonished 
none	none	But now I may say as Psalm one hundred thirty seven point one By the Rivers of Babylon there we sate down yea we wept when we remembered Zion There one of them asked me why I wept 
4406_16883_000001_000018	train-clean-100	I could hardly tell what to say Yet I answered they would kill me 
none	none	No said he none will hurt you Then came one of them and gave me two spoonfuls of meal to comfort me and another gave me half a pint of peas which was more worth than many bushels at another time 
4406_16883_000001_000020	train-clean-100	Then I went to see King Philip 
4406_16883_000001_000021	train-clean-100	He bade me come in and sit down and asked me whether I would smoke it a usual compliment nowadays amongst saints and sinners but this no way suited me 
4406_16883_000001_000022	train-clean-100	For though I had formerly used tobacco yet I had left it ever since I was first taken 
4406_16883_000001_000023	train-clean-100	It seems to be a bait the devil lays to make men lose their precious time 
none	none	I remember with shame how formerly when I had taken two or three pipes I was presently ready for another such a bewitching thing it is 
4406_16883_000001_000025	train-clean-100	But I thank God He has now given me power over it surely there are many who may be better employed than to lie sucking a stinking tobacco pipe 
none	none	Now the Indians gather their forces to go against Northampton Over night one went about yelling and hooting to give notice of the design Whereupon they fell to boiling of ground nuts and parching of corn as many as had it for their provision and in the morning away they went During my abode in this place Philip spake to me to make a shirt for his boy which I did for which he gave me a shilling 
4406_16883_000002_000002	train-clean-100	I offered the money to my master but he bade me keep it and with it I bought a piece of horse flesh 
4406_16883_000002_000003	train-clean-100	Afterwards he asked me to make a cap for his boy for which he invited me to dinner 
4406_16883_000002_000004	train-clean-100	I went and he gave me a pancake about as big as two fingers 
4406_16883_000002_000005	train-clean-100	It was made of parched wheat beaten and fried in bear s grease but I thought I never tasted pleasanter meat in my life 
none	none	There was a squaw who spake to me to make a shirt for her sannup for which she gave me a piece of bear 
4406_16883_000002_000007	train-clean-100	Another asked me to knit a pair of stockings for which she gave me a quart of peas 
none	none	I boiled my peas and bear together and invited my master and mistress to dinner but the proud gossip because I served them both in one dish would eat nothing except one bit that he gave her upon the point of his knife 
4406_16883_000002_000009	train-clean-100	Hearing that my son was come to this place I went to see him and found him lying flat upon the ground 
none	none	I asked him how he could sleep so 
4406_16883_000002_000011	train-clean-100	He answered me that he was not asleep but at prayer and lay so that they might not observe what he was doing 
none	none	I pray God he may remember these things now he is returned in safety At this place the sun now getting higher what with the beams and heat of the sun and the smoke of the wigwams I thought I should have been blind 
4406_16883_000002_000014	train-clean-100	I could scarce discern one wigwam from another 
4406_16883_000002_000015	train-clean-100	There was here one Mary Thurston of Medfield who seeing how it was with me lent me a hat to wear but as soon as I was gone the squaw who owned that Mary Thurston came running after me and got it away again 
none	none	Here was the squaw that gave me one spoonful of meal 
4406_16883_000002_000017	train-clean-100	I put it in my pocket to keep it safe 
none	none	Yet notwithstanding somebody stole it but put five Indian corns in the room of it which corns were the greatest provisions I had in my travel for one day The Indians returning from Northampton brought with them some horses and sheep and other things which they had taken I desired them that they would carry me to Albany upon one of those horses and sell me for powder for so they had sometimes discoursed 
4406_16883_000003_000001	train-clean-100	I was utterly hopeless of getting home on foot the way that I came 
4406_16883_000003_000002	train-clean-100	I could hardly bear to think of the many weary steps I had taken to come to this place 
4406_16883_000004_000000	train-clean-100	THE NINTH REMOVE
4406_16883_000005_000000	train-clean-100	But instead of going either to Albany or homeward we must go five miles up the river and then go over it 
none	none	Here we abode a while Here lived a sorry Indian who spoke to me to make him a shirt 
4406_16883_000005_000003	train-clean-100	When I had done it he would pay me nothing 
none	none	But he living by the riverside where I often went to fetch water I would often be putting of him in mind and calling for my pay At last he told me if I would make another shirt for a papoose not yet born he would give me a knife which he did when I had done it I carried the knife in and my master asked me to give it him and I was not a little glad that I had anything that they would accept of and be pleased with 
4406_16883_000005_000006	train-clean-100	When we were at this place my master s maid came home she had been gone three weeks into the Narragansett country to fetch corn where they had stored up some in the ground 
none	none	She brought home about a peck and half of corn 
4406_16883_000005_000008	train-clean-100	This was about the time that their great captain Naananto was killed in the Narragansett country My son being now about a mile from me I asked liberty to go and see him they bade me go and away I went but quickly lost myself traveling over hills and through swamps and could not find the way to him 
none	none	And I cannot but admire at the wonderful power and goodness of God to me in that though I was gone from home and met with all sorts of Indians and those I had no knowledge of and there being no Christian soul near me yet not one of them offered the least imaginable miscarriage to me I turned homeward again and met with my master 
4406_16883_000005_000011	train-clean-100	He showed me the way to my son 
none	none	When I came to him I found him not well and withall he had a boil on his side which much troubled him 
4406_16883_000005_000013	train-clean-100	We bemoaned one another a while as the Lord helped us and then I returned again 
4406_16883_000005_000014	train-clean-100	When I was returned I found myself as unsatisfied as I was before 
none	none	I went up and down mourning and lamenting and my spirit was ready to sink with the thoughts of my poor children 
4406_16883_000005_000016	train-clean-100	My son was ill and I could not but think of his mournful looks and no Christian friend was near him to do any office of love for him either for soul or body And my poor girl I knew not where she was nor whether she was sick or well or alive or dead 
none	none	I repaired under these thoughts to my Bible my great comfort in that time and that Scripture came to my hand Cast thy burden upon the Lord and He shall sustain thee Psalm fifty five point twenty two But I was fain to go and look after something to satisfy my hunger and going among the wigwams I went into one and there found a squaw who showed herself very kind to me and gave me a piece of bear I put it into my pocket and came home but could not find an opportunity to broil it for fear they would get it from me and there it lay all that day and night in my stinking pocket In the morning I went to the same squaw who had a kettle of ground nuts boiling I asked her to let me boil my piece of bear in her kettle which she did and gave me some ground nuts to eat with it and I cannot but think how pleasant it was to me 
4406_16883_000006_000004	train-clean-100	I have sometime seen bear baked very handsomely among the English and some like it but the thought that it was bear made me tremble 
4406_16883_000006_000005	train-clean-100	But now that was savory to me that one would think was enough to turn the stomach of a brute creature 
none	none	One bitter cold day I could find no room to sit down before the fire I went out and could not tell what to do but I went in to another wigwam where they were also sitting round the fire but the squaw laid a skin for me and bid me sit down and gave me some ground nuts and bade me come again and told me they would buy me if they were able and yet these were strangers to me that I never saw before 
4406_16883_000008_000000	train-clean-100	THE TENTH REMOVE
none	none	 That day a small part of the company removed about three quarters of a mile intending further the next day 
4406_16883_000009_000001	train-clean-100	When they came to the place where they intended to lodge and had pitched their wigwams being hungry I went again back to the place we were before at to get something to eat being encouraged by the squaw s kindness who bade me come again 
4406_16883_000009_000002	train-clean-100	When I was there there came an Indian to look after me who when he had found me kicked me all along 
4406_16883_000009_000003	train-clean-100	I went home and found venison roasting that night but they would not give me one bit of it 
4406_16883_000009_000004	train-clean-100	Sometimes I met with favor and sometimes with nothing but frowns 
none	none	THE ELEVENTH REMOVE 
4406_16883_000011_000000	train-clean-100	The next day in the morning they took their travel intending a day s journey up the river 
4406_16883_000011_000001	train-clean-100	I took my load at my back and quickly we came to wade over the river and passed over tiresome and wearisome hills 
4406_16883_000011_000002	train-clean-100	One hill was so steep that I was fain to creep up upon my knees and to hold by the twigs and bushes to keep myself from falling backward 
none	none	My head also was so light that I usually reeled as I went but I hope all these wearisome steps that I have taken are but a forewarning to me of the heavenly rest I know O Lord that thy judgments are right and that thou in faithfulness hast afflicted me Psalm one hundred nineteen point seventy five 
4406_16883_000012_000000	train-clean-100	THE TWELFTH REMOVE
none	none	 It was upon a Sabbath day morning that they prepared for their travel This morning I asked my master whether he would sell me to my husband He answered me Nux which did much rejoice my spirit My mistress before we went was gone to the burial of a papoose and returning she found me sitting and reading in my Bible she snatched it hastily out of my hand and threw it out of doors 
4406_16883_000013_000002	train-clean-100	I ran out and catched it up and put it into my pocket and never let her see it afterward 
4406_16883_000013_000003	train-clean-100	Then they packed up their things to be gone and gave me my load 
4406_16883_000013_000004	train-clean-100	I complained it was too heavy whereupon she gave me a slap in the face and bade me go I lifted up my heart to God hoping the redemption was not far off and the rather because their insolency grew worse and worse 
none	none	But the thoughts of my going homeward for so we bent our course much cheered my spirit and made my burden seem light and almost nothing at all But to my amazement and great perplexity the scale was soon turned for when we had gone a little way on a sudden my mistress gives out she would go no further but turn back again and said I must go back again with her and she called her sannup and would have had him gone back also but he would not but said he would go on and come to us again in three days 
4406_16883_000014_000002	train-clean-100	My spirit was upon this I confess very impatient and almost outrageous 
none	none	I thought I could as well have died as went back I cannot declare the trouble that I was in about it but yet back again I must go As soon as I had the opportunity I took my Bible to read and that quieting Scripture came to my hand Be still and know that I am God Psalm forty six point ten 
4406_16883_000014_000005	train-clean-100	Which stilled my spirit for the present 
4406_16883_000014_000006	train-clean-100	But a sore time of trial I concluded I had to go through my master being gone who seemed to me the best friend that I had of an Indian both in cold and hunger and quickly so it proved 
none	none	Down I sat with my heart as full as it could hold and yet so hungry that I could not sit neither but going out to see what I could find and walking among the trees I found six acorns and two chestnuts which were some refreshment to me Towards night I gathered some sticks for my own comfort that I might not lie a cold but when we came to lie down they bade me to go out and lie somewhere else for they had company they said come in more than their own 
4406_16883_000014_000009	train-clean-100	I told them I could not tell where to go they bade me go look I told them if I went to another wigwam they would be angry and send me home again 
none	none	Then one of the company drew his sword and told me he would run me through if I did not go presently 
4406_16883_000014_000011	train-clean-100	Then was I fain to stoop to this rude fellow and to go out in the night I knew not whither 
none	none	Mine eyes have seen that fellow afterwards walking up and down Boston under the appearance of a Friend Indian and several others of the like cut 
4406_16883_000014_000013	train-clean-100	I went to one wigwam and they told me they had no room 
4406_16883_000014_000014	train-clean-100	Then I went to another and they said the same at last an old Indian bade me to come to him and his squaw gave me some ground nuts she gave me also something to lay under my head and a good fire we had and through the good providence of God I had a comfortable lodging that night 
none	none	In the morning another Indian bade me come at night and he would give me six ground nuts which I did We were at this place and time about two miles from the Connecticut river 
4406_16883_000014_000017	train-clean-100	We went in the morning to gather ground nuts to the river and went back again that night 
none	none	I went with a good load at my back for they when they went though but a little way would carry all their trumpery with them 
4406_16883_000014_000019	train-clean-100	I told them the skin was off my back but I had no other comforting answer from them than this that it would be no matter if my head were off too 
4406_16883_000015_000000	train-clean-100	THE THIRTEENTH REMOVE
none	none	 Instead of going toward the Bay which was that I desired I must go with them five or six miles down the river into a mighty thicket of brush where we abode almost a fortnight Here one asked me to make a shirt for her papoose for which she gave me a mess of broth which was thickened with meal made of the bark of a tree and to make it the better she had put into it about a handful of peas and a few roasted ground nuts I had not seen my son a pretty while and here was an Indian of whom I made inquiry after him and asked him when he saw him He answered me that such a time his master roasted him and that himself did eat a piece of him as big as his two fingers and that he was very good meat But the Lord upheld my Spirit under this discouragement and I considered their horrible addictedness to lying and that there is not one of them that makes the least conscience of speaking of truth In this place on a cold night as I lay by the fire I removed a stick that kept the heat from me 
4406_16883_000016_000004	train-clean-100	A squaw moved it down again at which I looked up and she threw a handful of ashes in mine eyes 
none	none	I thought I should have been quite blinded and have never seen more but lying down the water run out of my eyes and carried the dirt with it that by the morning I recovered my sight again Yet upon this and the like occasions I hope it is not too much to say with Job Have pity upon me O ye my Friends for the Hand of the Lord has touched me And here I cannot but remember how many times sitting in their wigwams and musing on things past I should suddenly leap up and run out as if I had been at home forgetting where I was and what my condition was but when I was without and saw nothing but wilderness and woods and a company of barbarous heathens my mind quickly returned to me which made me think of that spoken concerning Sampson who said I will go out and shake myself as at other times but he wist not that the Lord was departed from him About this time I began to think that all my hopes of restoration would come to nothing 
4406_16883_000016_000007	train-clean-100	I thought of the English army and hoped for their coming and being taken by them but that failed 
4406_16883_000016_000008	train-clean-100	I hoped to be carried to Albany as the Indians had discoursed before but that failed also 
4406_16883_000016_000009	train-clean-100	I thought of being sold to my husband as my master spake but instead of that my master himself was gone and I left behind so that my spirit was now quite ready to sink 
none	none	I asked them to let me go out and pick up some sticks that I might get alone and pour out my heart unto the Lord Then also I took my Bible to read but I found no comfort here neither which many times I was wont to find 
4406_16883_000016_000012	train-clean-100	So easy a thing it is with God to dry up the streams of Scripture comfort from us 
4406_16883_000016_000013	train-clean-100	Yet I can say that in all my sorrows and afflictions God did not leave me to have my impatience work towards Himself as if His ways were unrighteous 
none	none	But I knew that He laid upon me less than I deserved Afterward before this doleful time ended with me I was turning the leaves of my Bible and the Lord brought to me some Scriptures which did a little revive me as that in Isaiah fifty five point eight For my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways saith the Lord And also that in Psalm thirty seven point five Commit thy way unto the Lord trust also in him and he shall bring it to pass About this time they came yelping from Hadley where they had killed three Englishmen and brought one captive with them viz 
4406_16883_000016_000015	train-clean-100	Thomas Read

4406_16883_000016_000020	train-clean-100	He told me he saw him such a time in the Bay and he was well but very melancholy 
none	none	By which I certainly understood though I suspected it before that whatsoever the Indians told me respecting him was vanity and lies Some of them told me he was dead and they had killed him some said he was married again and that the Governor wished him to marry and told him he should have his choice and that all persuaded I was dead

4406_16883_000017_000005	train-clean-100	But I stepped out and she struck the stick into the mat of the wigwam 
4406_16883_000017_000006	train-clean-100	But while she was pulling of it out I ran to the maid and gave her all my apron and so that storm went over

4406_16883_000018_000001	train-clean-100	He told me he was as much grieved for his father as for himself 
none	none	I wondered at his speech for I thought I had enough upon my spirit in reference to myself to make me mindless of my husband and everyone else they being safe among their friends He told me also that awhile before his master together with other Indians were going to the French for powder but by the way the Mohawks met with them and killed four of their company which made the rest turn back again for it might have been worse with him had he been sold to the French than it proved to be in his remaining with the Indians I went to see an English youth in this place one John Gilbert of Springfield I found him lying without doors upon the ground I asked him how he did 
4406_16883_000019_000003	train-clean-100	He told me he was very sick of a flux with eating so much blood 
none	none	They had turned him out of the wigwam and with him an Indian papoose almost dead whose parents had been killed in a bitter cold day without fire or clothes The young man himself had nothing on but his shirt and waistcoat This sight was enough to melt a heart of flint There they lay quivering in the cold the youth round like a dog the papoose stretched out with his eyes and nose and mouth full of dirt and yet alive and groaning I advised John to go and get to some fire He told me he could not stand but I persuaded him still lest he should lie there and die And with much ado I got him to a fire and went myself home As soon as I was got home his master s daughter came after me to know what I had done with the Englishman 
4406_16883_000019_000011	train-clean-100	I told her I had got him to a fire in such a place

4406_16883_000019_000013	train-clean-100	For her satisfaction I went along with her and brought her to him but before I got home again it was noised about that I was running away and getting the English youth along with me that as soon as I came in they began to rant and domineer asking me where I had been and what I had been doing and saying they would knock him on the head 
none	none	I told them I had been seeing the English youth and that I would not run away 
4406_16883_000019_000015	train-clean-100	They told me I lied and taking up a hatchet they came to me and said they would knock me down if I stirred out again and so confined me to the wigwam

4406_16883_000019_000020	train-clean-100	Then came an Indian to me with a pair of stockings that were too big for him and he would have me ravel them out and knit them fit for him 
4406_16883_000019_000021	train-clean-100	I showed myself willing and bid him ask my mistress if I might go along with him a little way she said yes I might but I was not a little refreshed with that news that I had my liberty again 
none	none	Then I went along with him and he gave me some roasted ground nuts which did again revive my feeble stomach Being got out of her sight I had time and liberty again to look into my Bible which was my guide by day and my pillow by night Now that comfortable Scripture presented itself to me For a small moment have I forsaken thee but with great mercies will I gather thee Isaiah fifty four point seven Thus the Lord carried me along from one time to another and made good to me this precious promise and many others Then my son came to see me and I asked his master to let him stay awhile with me that I might comb his head and look over him for he was almost overcome with lice He told me when I had done that he was very hungry but I had nothing to relieve him but bid him go into the wigwams as he went along and see if he could get any thing among them 
4406_16883_000020_000003	train-clean-100	Which he did and it seems tarried a little too long for his master was angry with him and beat him and then sold him 
4406_16883_000020_000004	train-clean-100	Then he came running to tell me he had a new master and that he had given him some ground nuts already

4406_16883_000021_000002	train-clean-100	I went to a wigwam and they bade me come in and gave me a skin to lie upon and a mess of venison and ground nuts which was a choice dish among them 
4406_16883_000021_000003	train-clean-100	On the morrow they buried the papoose and afterward both morning and evening there came a company to mourn and howl with her though I confess I could not much condole with them

none	none	 Now must we pack up and be gone from this thicket bending our course toward the Baytowns I having nothing to eat by the way this day but a few crumbs of cake that an Indian gave my girl the same day we were taken She gave it me and I put it in my pocket there it lay till it was so moldy for want of good baking that one could not tell what it was made of it fell all to crumbs and grew so dry and hard that it was like little flints and this refreshed me many times when I was ready to faint It was in my thoughts when I put it into my mouth that if ever I returned I would tell the world what a blessing the Lord gave to such mean food As we went along they killed a deer with a young one in her they gave me a piece of the fawn and it was so young and tender that one might eat the bones as well as the flesh and yet I thought it very good When night came on we sat down it rained but they quickly got up a bark wigwam where I lay dry that night I looked out in the morning and many of them had lain in the rain all night I saw by their reeking

4406_16883_000027_000000	train-clean-100	We began this remove with wading over Banquang river the water was up to the knees and the stream very swift and so cold that I thought it would have cut me in sunder 
none	none	I was so weak and feeble that I reeled as I went along and thought there I must end my days at last after my bearing and getting through so many difficulties The Indians stood laughing to see me staggering along but in my distress the Lord gave me experience of the truth and goodness of that promise When thou passest through the waters I will be with thee and through the rivers they shall not overflow thee Isaiah forty three point two Then I sat down to put on my stockings and shoes with the tears running down mine eyes and sorrowful thoughts in my heart but I got up to go along with them Quickly there came up to us an Indian who informed them that I must go to Wachusett to my master for there was a letter come from the council to the Sagamores about redeeming the captives and that there would be another in fourteen days and that I must be there ready My heart was so heavy before that I could scarce speak or go in the path and yet now so light that I could run My strength seemed to come again and recruit my feeble knees and aching heart Yet it pleased them to go but one mile that night and there we stayed two days 
4406_16883_000027_000007	train-clean-100	In that time came a company of Indians to us near thirty all on horseback 
none	none	My heart skipped within me thinking they had been Englishmen at the first sight of them for they were dressed in English apparel with hats white neckcloths and sashes about their waists and ribbons upon their shoulders but when they came near there was a vast difference between the lovely faces of Christians and foul looks of those heathens which much damped my spirit again

4406_16883_000031_000003	train-clean-100	I went to see how she did and she was well considering her captive condition 
4406_16883_000031_000004	train-clean-100	I would have tarried that night with her but they that owned her would not suffer it

4406_16883_000031_000010	train-clean-100	Then I went home to my mistress s wigwam and they told me I disgraced my master with begging and if I did so any more they would knock me in the head 
none	none	I told them they had as good knock me in head as starve me to death THE NINETEENTH REMOVE They said when we went out that we must travel to Wachusett this day But a bitter weary day I had of it traveling now three days together without resting any day between At last after many weary steps I saw Wachusett hills but many miles off Then we came to a great swamp through which we traveled up to the knees in mud and water which was heavy going to one tired before Being almost spent I thought I should have sunk down at last and never got out but I may say as in Psalm ninety four point eighteen When my foot slipped thy mercy O Lord held me up Going along having indeed my life but little spirit Philip who was in the company came up and took me by the hand and said two weeks more and you shall be mistress again I asked him if he spake true He answered Yes and quickly you shall come to your master again who had been gone from us three weeks After many weary steps we came to Wachusett where he was and glad I was to see him He asked me when I washed me I told him not this month Then he fetched me some water himself and bid me wash and gave me the glass to see how I looked and bid his squaw give me something to eat So she gave me a mess of beans and meat and a little ground nut cake I was wonderfully revived with this favor showed me He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captives Psalm one hundred six point forty six My master had three squaws living sometimes with one and sometimes with another one this old squaw at whose wigwam I was and with whom my master had been those three weeks Another was Wattimore Weetamoo with whom I had lived and served all this while A severe and proud dame she was bestowing every day in dressing herself neat as much time as any of the gentry of the land powdering her hair and painting her face going with necklaces with jewels in her ears and bracelets upon her hands When she had dressed herself her work was to make girdles of wampum and beads The third squaw was a younger one by whom he had two papooses By the time I was refreshed by the old squaw with whom my master was Weetamoo s maid came to call me home at which I fell aweeping Then the old squaw told me to encourage me that if I wanted victuals I should come to her and that I should lie there in her wigwam Then I went with the maid and quickly came again and lodged there The squaw laid a mat under me and a good rug over me the first time I had any such kindness showed me I understood that Weetamoo thought that if she should let me go and serve with the old squaw she would be in danger to lose not only my service but the redemption pay also And I was not a little glad to hear this being by it raised in my hopes that in God s due time there would be an end of this sorrowful hour Then came an Indian and asked me to knit him three pair of stockings for which I had a hat and a silk handkerchief Then another asked me to make her a shift for which she gave me an apron Then came Tom and Peter with the second letter from the council about the captives Though they were Indians I got them by the hand and burst out into tears My heart was so full that I could not speak to them but recovering myself I asked them how my husband did and all my friends and acquaintance They said They are all very well but melancholy They brought me two biscuits and a pound of tobacco The tobacco I quickly gave away When it was all gone one asked me to give him a pipe of tobacco I told him it was all gone Then began he to rant and threaten I told him when my husband came I would give him some Hang him rogue says he I will knock out his brains if he comes here And then again in the same breath they would say that if there should come an hundred without guns they would do them no hurt So unstable and like madmen they were So that fearing the worst I durst not send to my husband though there were some thoughts of his coming to redeem and fetch me not knowing what might follow For there was little more trust to them than to the master they served When the letter was come the Sagamores met to consult about the captives and called me to them to inquire how much my husband would give to redeem me When I came I sat down among them as I was wont to do as their manner is Then they bade me stand up and said they were the General Court They bid me speak what I thought he would give Now knowing that all we had was destroyed by the Indians I was in a great strait I thought if I should speak of but a little it would be slighted and hinder the matter if of a great sum I knew not where it would be procured Yet at a venture I said Twenty pounds yet desired them to take less But they would not hear of that but sent that message to Boston that for twenty pounds I should be redeemed It was a Praying Indian that wrote their letter for them There was another Praying Indian who told me that he had a brother that would not eat horse his conscience was so tender and scrupulous though as large as hell for the destruction of poor Christians Then he said he read that Scripture to him There was a famine in Samaria and behold they besieged it until an ass s head was sold for four score pieces of silver and the fourth part of a cab of dove s dung for five pieces of silver two Kings six point twenty five He expounded this place to his brother and showed him that it was lawful to eat that in a famine which is not at another time And now says he he will eat horse with any Indian of them all There was another Praying Indian who when he had done all the mischief that he could betrayed his own father into the English hands thereby to purchase his own life Another Praying Indian was at Sudbury fight though as he deserved he was afterward hanged for it There was another Praying Indian so wicked and cruel as to wear a string about his neck strung with Christians fingers Another Praying Indian when they went to Sudbury fight went with them and his squaw also with him with her papoose at her back Before they went to that fight they got a company together to pow wow The manner was as followeth there was one that kneeled upon a deerskin with the company round him in a ring who kneeled and striking upon the ground with their hands and with sticks and muttering or humming with their mouths Besides him who kneeled in the ring there also stood one with a gun in his hand Then he on the deerskin made a speech and all manifested assent to it and so they did many times together Then they bade him with the gun go out of the ring which he did But when he was out they called him in again but he seemed to make a stand then they called the more earnestly till he returned again Then they all sang Then they gave him two guns in either hand one And so he on the deerskin began again and at the end of every sentence in his speaking they all assented humming or muttering with their mouths and striking upon the ground with their hands Then they bade him with the two guns go out of the ring again which he did a little way Then they called him in again but he made a stand So they called him with greater earnestness but he stood reeling and wavering as if he knew not whither he should stand or fall or which way to go Then they called him with exceeding great vehemency all of them one and another After a little while he turned in staggering as he went with his arms stretched out in either hand a gun As soon as he came in they all sang and rejoiced exceedingly a while And then he upon the deerskin made another speech unto which they all assented in a rejoicing manner And so they ended their business and forthwith went to Sudbury fight To my thinking they went without any scruple but that they should prosper and gain the victory And they went out not so rejoicing but they came home with as great a victory For they said they had killed two captains and almost an hundred men One Englishman they brought along with them and he said it was too true for they had made sad work at Sudbury as indeed it proved Yet they came home without that rejoicing and triumphing over their victory which they were wont to show at other times but rather like dogs as they say which have lost their ears Yet I could not perceive that it was for their own loss of men They said they had not lost above five or six and I missed none except in one wigwam When they went they acted as if the devil had told them that they should gain the victory and now they acted as if the devil had told them they should have a fall Whither it were so or no I cannot tell but so it proved for quickly they began to fall and so held on that summer till they came to utter ruin They came home on a Sabbath day and the Powaw that kneeled upon the deer skin came home I may say without abuse as black as the devil When my master came home he came to me and bid me make a shirt for his papoose of a holland laced pillowbere About that time there came an Indian to me and bid me come to his wigwam at night and he would give me some pork and ground nuts Which I did and as I was eating another Indian said to me he seems to be your good friend but he killed two Englishmen at Sudbury and there lie their clothes behind you I looked behind me and there I saw bloody clothes with bullet holes in them Yet the Lord suffered not this wretch to do me any hurt Yea instead of that he many times refreshed me five or six times did he and his squaw refresh my feeble carcass If I went to their wigwam at any time they would always give me something and yet they were strangers that I never saw before Another squaw gave me a piece of fresh pork and a little salt with it and lent me her pan to fry it in and I cannot but remember what a sweet pleasant and delightful relish that bit had to me to this day So little do we prize common mercies when we have them to the full THE TWENTIETH REMOVE It was their usual manner to remove when they had done any mischief lest they should be found out and so they did at this time We went about three or four miles and there they built a great wigwam big enough to hold an hundred Indians which they did in preparation to a great day of dancing They would say now amongst themselves that the governor would be so angry for his loss at Sudbury that he would send no more about the captives which made me grieve and tremble My sister being not far from the place where we now were and hearing that I was here desired her master to let her come and see me and he was willing to it and would go with her but she being ready before him told him she would go before and was come within a mile or two of the place Then he overtook her and began to rant as if he had been mad and made her go back again in the rain so that I never saw her till I saw her in Charlestown But the Lord requited many of their ill doings for this Indian her master was hanged afterward at Boston The Indians now began to come from all quarters against their merry dancing day Among some of them came one goodwife Kettle I told her my heart was so heavy that it was ready to break So is mine too said she but yet said I hope we shall hear some good news shortly I could hear how earnestly my sister desired to see me and I as earnestly desired to see her and yet neither of us could get an opportunity My daughter was also now about a mile off and I had not seen her in nine or ten weeks as I had not seen my sister since our first taking I earnestly desired them to let me go and see them yea I entreated begged and persuaded them but to let me see my daughter and yet so hard hearted were they that they would not suffer it They made use of their tyrannical power whilst they had it but through the Lord s wonderful mercy their time was now but short On a Sabbath day the sun being about an hour high in the afternoon came mister John Hoar the council permitting him and his own foreward spirit inclining him together with the two forementioned Indians Tom and Peter with their third letter from the council When they came near I was abroad Though I saw them not they presently called me in and bade me sit down and not stir Then they catched up their guns and away they ran as if an enemy had been at hand and the guns went off apace I manifested some great trouble and they asked me what was the matter I told them I thought they had killed the Englishman for they had in the meantime informed me that an Englishman was come They said no They shot over his horse and under and before his horse and they pushed him this way and that way at their pleasure showing what they could do Then they let them come to their wigwams I begged of them to let me see the Englishman but they would not But there was I fain to sit their pleasure When they had talked their fill with him they suffered me to go to him We asked each other of our welfare and how my husband did and all my friends He told me they were all well and would be glad to see me Amongst other things which my husband sent me there came a pound of tobacco which I sold for nine shillings in money for many of the Indians for want of tobacco smoked hemlock and ground ivy It was a great mistake in any who thought I sent for tobacco for through the favor of God that desire was overcome I now asked them whether I should go home with mister Hoar They answered no one and another of them and it being night we lay down with that answer In the morning mister Hoar invited the Sagamores to dinner but when we went to get it ready we found that they had stolen the greatest part of the provision mister Hoar had brought out of his bags in the night And we may see the wonderful power of God in that one passage in that when there was such a great number of the Indians together and so greedy of a little good food and no English there but mister Hoar and myself that there they did not knock us in the head and take what we had there being not only some provision but also trading cloth a part of the twenty pounds agreed upon But instead of doing us any mischief they seemed to be ashamed of the fact and said it were some matchit Indian that did it Oh that we could believe that there is nothing too hard for God God showed His power over the heathen in this as He did over the hungry lions when Daniel was cast into the den mister Hoar called them betime to dinner but they ate very little they being so busy in dressing themselves and getting ready for their dance which was carried on by eight of them four men and four squaws My master and mistress being two He was dressed in his holland shirt with great laces sewed at the tail of it he had his silver buttons his white stockings his garters were hung round with shillings and he had girdles of wampum upon his head and shoulders She had a kersey coat and covered with girdles of wampum from the loins upward Her arms from her elbows to her hands were covered with bracelets there were handfuls of necklaces about her neck and several sorts of jewels in her ears She had fine red stockings and white shoes her hair powdered and face painted red that was always before black And all the dancers were after the same manner There were two others singing and knocking on a kettle for their music They kept hopping up and down one after another with a kettle of water in the midst standing warm upon some embers to drink of when they were dry They held on till it was almost night throwing out wampum to the standers by At night I asked them again if I should go home They all as one said no except my husband would come for me When we were lain down my master went out of the wigwam and by and by sent in an Indian called James the Printer who told mister Hoar that my master would let me go home tomorrow if he would let him have one pint of liquors Then mister Hoar called his own Indians Tom and Peter and bid them go and see whether he would promise it before them three and if he would he should have it which he did and he had it Then Philip smelling the business called me to him and asked me what I would give him to tell me some good news and speak a good word for me I told him I could not tell what to give him I would give him anything I had and asked him what he would have He said two coats and twenty shillings in money and half a bushel of seed corn and some tobacco I thanked him for his love but I knew the good news as well as the crafty fox My master after he had had his drink quickly came ranting into the wigwam again and called for mister Hoar drinking to him and saying he was a good man and then again he would say hang him rogue Being almost drunk he would drink to him and yet presently say he should be hanged Then he called for me I trembled to hear him yet I was fain to go to him and he drank to me showing no incivility He was the first Indian I saw drunk all the while that I was amongst them At last his squaw ran out and he after her round the wigwam with his money jingling at his knees But she escaped him But having an old squaw he ran to her and so through the Lord s mercy we were no more troubled that night Yet I had not a comfortable night s rest for I think I can say I did not sleep for three nights together The night before the letter came from the council I could not rest I was so full of fears and troubles God many times leaving us most in the dark when deliverance is nearest Yea at this time I could not rest night nor day The next night I was overjoyed mister Hoar being come and that with such good tidings The third night I was even swallowed up with the thoughts of things viz that ever I should go home again and that I must go leaving my children behind me in the wilderness so that sleep was now almost departed from mine eyes On Tuesday morning they called their general court as they call it to consult and determine whether I should go home or no And they all as one man did seemingly consent to it that I should go home except Philip who would not come among them But before I go any further I would take leave to mention a few remarkable passages of providence which I took special notice of in my afflicted time one Of the fair opportunity lost in the long march a little after the fort fight when our English army was so numerous and in pursuit of the enemy and so near as to take several and destroy them and the enemy in such distress for food that our men might track them by their rooting in the earth for ground nuts whilst they were flying for their lives I say that then our army should want provision and be forced to leave their pursuit and return homeward and the very next week the enemy came upon our town like bears bereft of their whelps or so many ravenous wolves rending us and our lambs to death But what shall I say God seemed to leave his People to themselves and order all things for His own holy ends Shall there be evil in the City and the Lord hath not done it They are not grieved for the affliction of Joseph therefore shall they go captive with the first that go captive It is the Lord s doing and it should be marvelous in our eyes two I cannot but remember how the Indians derided the slowness and dullness of the English army in its setting out For after the desolations at Lancaster and Medfield as I went along with them they asked me when I thought the English army would come after them I told them I could not tell It may be they will come in May said they Thus did they scoff at us as if the English would be a quarter of a year getting ready three Which also I have hinted before when the English army with new supplies were sent forth to pursue after the enemy and they understanding it fled before them till they came to Banquang river where they forthwith went over safely that that river should be impassable to the English I can but admire to see the wonderful providence of God in preserving the heathen for further affliction to our poor country They could go in great numbers over but the English must stop God had an over ruling hand in all those things four It was thought if their corn were cut down they would starve and die with hunger and all their corn that could be found was destroyed and they driven from that little they had in store into the woods in the midst of winter and yet how to admiration did the Lord preserve them for His holy ends and the destruction of many still amongst the English strangely did the Lord provide for them that I did not see all the time I was among them one man woman or child die with hunger Though many times they would eat that that a hog or a dog would hardly touch yet by that God strengthened them to be a scourge to His people The chief and commonest food was ground nuts They eat also nuts and acorns artichokes lilly roots ground beans and several other weeds and roots that I know not They would pick up old bones and cut them to pieces at the joints and if they were full of worms and maggots they would scald them over the fire to make the vermine come out and then boil them and drink up the liquor and then beat the great ends of them in a mortar and so eat them They would eat horse s guts and ears and all sorts of wild birds which they could catch also bear venison beaver tortoise frogs squirrels dogs skunks rattlesnakes yea the very bark of trees besides all sorts of creatures and provision which they plundered from the English I can but stand in admiration to see the wonderful power of God in providing for such a vast number of our enemies in the wilderness where there was nothing to be seen but from hand to mouth Many times in a morning the generality of them would eat up all they had and yet have some further supply against they wanted It is said Oh that my People had hearkened to me and Israel had walked in my ways I should soon have subdued their Enemies and turned my hand against their Adversaries Psalm eighty one point thirteen fourteen But now our perverse and evil carriages in the sight of the Lord have so offended Him that instead of turning His hand against them the Lord feeds and nourishes them up to be a scourge to the whole land five Another thing that I would observe is the strange providence of God in turning things about when the Indians was at the highest and the English at the lowest I was with the enemy eleven weeks and five days and not one week passed without the fury of the enemy and some desolation by fire and sword upon one place or other They mourned with their black faces for their own losses yet triumphed and rejoiced in their inhumane and many times devilish cruelty to the English They would boast much of their victories saying that in two hours time they had destroyed such a captain and his company at such a place and boast how many towns they had destroyed and then scoff and say they had done them a good turn to send them to Heaven so soon Again they would say this summer that they would knock all the rogues in the head or drive them into the sea or make them fly the country thinking surely Agag like The bitterness of Death is past Now the heathen begins to think all is their own and the poor Christians hopes to fail as to man and now their eyes are more to God and their hearts sigh heaven ward and to say in good earnest Help Lord or we perish When the Lord had brought His people to this that they saw no help in anything but Himself then He takes the quarrel into His own hand and though they had made a pit in their own imaginations as deep as hell for the Christians that summer yet the Lord hurled themselves into it And the Lord had not so many ways before to preserve them but now He hath as many to destroy them But to return again to my going home where we may see a remarkable change of providence At first they were all against it except my husband would come for me but afterwards they assented to it and seemed much to rejoice in it some asked me to send them some bread others some tobacco others shaking me by the hand offering me a hood and scarfe to ride in not one moving hand or tongue against it Thus hath the Lord answered my poor desire and the many earnest requests of others put up unto God for me In my travels an Indian came to me and told me if I were willing he and his squaw would run away and go home along with me I told him no I was not willing to run away but desired to wait God s time that I might go home quietly and without fear And now God hath granted me my desire O the wonderful power of God that I have seen and the experience that I have had I have been in the midst of those roaring lions and savage bears that feared neither God nor man nor the devil by night and day alone and in company sleeping all sorts together and yet not one of them ever offered me the least abuse of unchastity to me in word or action Though some are ready to say I speak it for my own credit but I speak it in the presence of God and to His Glory God s power is as great now and as sufficient to save as when He preserved Daniel in the lion s den or the three children in the fiery furnace I may well say as his Psalm one hundred seven point twelve Oh give thanks unto the Lord for he is good for his mercy endureth for ever Let the redeemed of the Lord say so whom He hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy especially that I should come away in the midst of so many hundreds of enemies quietly and peaceably and not a dog moving his tongue So I took my leave of them and in coming along my heart melted into tears more than all the while I was with them and I was almost swallowed up with the thoughts that ever I should go home again About the sun going down mister Hoar and myself and the two Indians came to Lancaster and a solemn sight it was to me There had I lived many comfortable years amongst my relations and neighbors and now not one Christian to be seen nor one house left standing We went on to a farmhouse that was yet standing where we lay all night and a comfortable lodging we had though nothing but straw to lie on The Lord preserved us in safety that night and raised us up again in the morning and carried us along that before noon we came to Concord Now was I full of joy and yet not without sorrow joy to see such a lovely sight so many Christians together and some of them my neighbors There I met with my brother and my brother in law who asked me if I knew where his wife was Poor heart he had helped to bury her and knew it not She being shot down by the house was partly burnt so that those who were at Boston at the desolation of the town and came back afterward and buried the dead did not know her Yet I was not without sorrow to think how many were looking and longing and my own children amongst the rest to enjoy that deliverance that I had now received and I did not know whether ever I should see them again Being recruited with food and raiment we went to Boston that day where I met with my dear husband but the thoughts of our dear children one being dead and the other we could not tell where abated our comfort each to other I was not before so much hemmed in with the merciless and cruel heathen but now as much with pitiful tender hearted and compassionate Christians In that poor and distressed and beggarly condition I was received in I was kindly entertained in several houses So much love I received from several some of whom I knew and others I knew not that I am not capable to declare it But the Lord knows them all by name The Lord reward them sevenfold into their bosoms of His spirituals for their temporals The twenty pounds the price of my redemption was raised by some Boston gentlemen and missus Usher whose bounty and religious charity I would not forget to make mention of Then mister Thomas Shepard of Charlestown received us into his house where we continued eleven weeks and a father and mother they were to us And many more tender hearted friends we met with in that place We were now in the midst of love yet not without much and frequent heaviness of heart for our poor children and other relations who were still in affliction The week following after my coming in the governor and council sent forth to the Indians again and that not without success for they brought in my sister and goodwife Kettle Their not knowing where our children were was a sore trial to us still and yet we were not without secret hopes that we should see them again That which was dead lay heavier upon my spirit than those which were alive and amongst the heathen thinking how it suffered with its wounds and I was no way able to relieve it and how it was buried by the heathen in the wilderness from among all Christians We were hurried up and down in our thoughts sometime we should hear a report that they were gone this way and sometimes that and that they were come in in this place or that We kept inquiring and listening to hear concerning them but no certain news as yet About this time the council had ordered a day of public thanksgiving Though I thought I had still cause of mourning and being unsettled in our minds we thought we would ride toward the eastward to see if we could hear anything concerning our children And as we were riding along God is the wise disposer of all things between Ipswich and Rowley we met with mister William Hubbard who told us that our son Joseph was come in to Major Waldron s and another with him which was my sister s son I asked him how he knew it He said the major himself told him so So along we went till we came to Newbury and their minister being absent they desired my husband to preach the thanksgiving for them but he was not willing to stay there that night but would go over to Salisbury to hear further and come again in the morning which he did and preached there that day At night when he had done one came and told him that his daughter was come in at Providence Here was mercy on both hands Now hath God fulfilled that precious Scripture which was such a comfort to me in my distressed condition When my heart was ready to sink into the earth my children being gone I could not tell whither and my knees trembling under me and I was walking through the valley of the shadow of death then the Lord brought and now has fulfilled that reviving word unto me Thus saith the Lord Refrain thy voice from weeping and thine eyes from tears for thy Work shall be rewarded saith the Lord and they shall come again from the Land of the Enemy Now we were between them the one on the east and the other on the west Our son being nearest we went to him first to Portsmouth where we met with him and with the Major also who told us he had done what he could but could not redeem him under seven pounds which the good people thereabouts were pleased to pay The Lord reward the major and all the rest though unknown to me for their labor of Love My sister s son was redeemed for four pounds which the council gave order for the payment of Having now received one of our children we hastened toward the other Going back through Newbury my husband preached there on the Sabbath day for which they rewarded him many fold On Monday we came to Charlestown where we heard that the governor of Rhode Island had sent over for our daughter to take care of her being now within his jurisdiction which should not pass without our acknowledgments But she being nearer Rehoboth than Rhode Island mister Newman went over and took care of her and brought her to his own house And the goodness of God was admirable to us in our low estate in that He raised up passionate friends on every side to us when we had nothing to recompense any for their love The Indians were now gone that way that it was apprehended dangerous to go to her But the carts which carried provision to the English army being guarded brought her with them to Dorchester where we received her safe Blessed be the Lord for it for great is His power and He can do whatsoever seemeth Him good Her coming in was after this manner she was traveling one day with the Indians with her basket at her back the company of Indians were got before her and gone out of sight all except one squaw she followed the squaw till night and then both of them lay down having nothing over them but the heavens and under them but the earth Thus she traveled three days together not knowing whither she was going having nothing to eat or drink but water and green hirtle berries At last they came into Providence where she was kindly entertained by several of that town The Indians often said that I should never have her under twenty pounds But now the Lord hath brought her in upon free cost and given her to me the second time The Lord make us a blessing indeed each to others Now have I seen that Scripture also fulfilled If any of thine be driven out to the outmost parts of heaven from thence will the Lord thy God gather thee and from thence will he fetch thee And the Lord thy God will put all these curses upon thine enemies and on them which hate thee which persecuted thee Deuteronomy thirty point four seven Thus hath the Lord brought me and mine out of that horrible pit and hath set us in the midst of tender hearted and compassionate Christians It is the desire of my soul that we may walk worthy of the mercies received and which we are receiving Our family being now gathered together those of us that were living the South Church in Boston hired an house for us Then we removed from mister Shepard s those cordial friends and went to Boston where we continued about three quarters of a year Still the Lord went along with us and provided graciously for us I thought it somewhat strange to set up house keeping with bare walls but as Solomon says Money answers all things and that we had through the benevolence of Christian friends some in this town and some in that and others and some from England that in a little time we might look and see the house furnished with love The Lord hath been exceeding good to us in our low estate in that when we had neither house nor home nor other necessaries the Lord so moved the hearts of these and those towards us that we wanted neither food nor raiment for ourselves or ours There is a Friend which sticketh closer than a Brother Proverbs eighteen point twenty four And how many such friends have we found and now living amongst And truly such a friend have we found him to be unto us in whose house we lived viz mister James Whitcomb a friend unto us near hand and afar off I can remember the time when I used to sleep quietly without workings in my thoughts whole nights together but now it is other ways with me When all are fast about me and no eye open but His who ever waketh my thoughts are upon things past upon the awful dispensation of the Lord towards us upon His wonderful power and might in carrying of us through so many difficulties in returning us in safety and suffering none to hurt us I remember in the night season how the other day I was in the midst of thousands of enemies and nothing but death before me It is then hard work to persuade myself that ever I should be satisfied with bread again But now we are fed with the finest of the wheat and as I may say with honey out of the rock Instead of the husk we have the fatted calf The thoughts of these things in the particulars of them and of the love and goodness of God towards us make it true of me what David said of himself I watered my Couch with my tears Psalm six point six Oh the wonderful power of God that mine eyes have seen affording matter enough for my thoughts to run in that when others are sleeping mine eyes are weeping I have seen the extreme vanity of this world One hour I have been in health and wealthy wanting nothing But the next hour in sickness and wounds and death having nothing but sorrow and affliction Before I knew what affliction meant I was ready sometimes to wish for it When I lived in prosperity having the comforts of the world about me my relations by me my heart cheerful and taking little care for anything and yet seeing many whom I preferred before myself under many trials and afflictions in sickness weakness poverty losses crosses and cares of the world I should be sometimes jealous least I should have my portion in this life and that Scripture would come to my mind For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth and scourgeth every Son whom he receiveth Hebrews twelve point six But now I see the Lord had His time to scourge and chasten me The portion of some is to have their afflictions by drops now one drop and then another but the dregs of the cup the wine of astonishment like a sweeping rain that leaveth no food did the Lord prepare to be my portion Affliction I wanted and affliction I had full measure I thought pressed down and running over Yet I see when God calls a person to anything and through never so many difficulties yet He is fully able to carry them through and make them see and say they have been gainers thereby And I hope I can say in some measure as David did It is good for me that I have been afflicted The Lord hath showed me the vanity of these outward things That they are the vanity of vanities and vexation of spirit that they are but a shadow a blast a bubble and things of no continuance That we must rely on God Himself and our whole dependance must be upon Him If trouble from smaller matters begin to arise in me I have something at hand to check myself with and say why am I troubled It was but the other day that if I had had the world I would have given it for my freedom or to have been a servant to a Christian I have learned to look beyond present and smaller troubles and to be quieted under them As Moses said
