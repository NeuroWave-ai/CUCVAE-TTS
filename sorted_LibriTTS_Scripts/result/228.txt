haughty Juno s unrelenting hate Expell d and exil d left the Trojan shore Long labors both by sea and land he bore And in the doubtful war before he won The Latian realm and built the destin d town His banish d gods restor d to rites divine And settled sure succession in his line From whence the race of Alban fathers come And the long glories of majestic Rome O Muse the causes and the crimes relate What goddess was provok d and whence her hate For what offense the Queen of Heav n began To persecute so brave so just a man Involv d his anxious life in endless cares Expos d to wants and hurried into wars Can heav nly minds such high resentment show Or exercise their spite in human woe Against the Tiber s mouth but far away An ancient town was seated on the sea A Tyrian colony the people made Stout for the war and studious of their trade Carthage the name belov d by Juno more Than her own Argos or the Samian shore Here stood her chariot here if Heav n were kind The seat of awful empire she design d Yet she had heard an ancient rumor fly Long cited by the people of the sky That times to come should see the Trojan race Her Carthage ruin and her tow rs deface Nor thus confin d the yoke of sov reign sway Should on the necks of all the nations lay She ponder d this and fear d it was in fate Nor could forget the war she wag d of late For conqu ring Greece against the Trojan state Besides long causes working in her mind And secret seeds of envy lay behind Deep graven in her heart the doom remain d Of partial Paris and her form disdain d The grace bestow d on ravish d Ganymed Electra s glories and her injur d bed Each was a cause alone and all combin d To kindle vengeance in her haughty mind For this far distant from the Latian coast She drove the remnants of the Trojan host And sev n long years th unhappy wand ring train Were toss d by storms and scatter d thro the main Such time such toil requir d the Roman name Such length of labor for so vast a frame Now scarce the Trojan fleet with sails and oars Had left behind the fair Sicilian shores Ent ring with cheerful shouts the wat ry reign And plowing frothy furrows in the main When lab ring still with endless discontent The Queen of Heav n did thus her fury vent Then am I vanquish d must I yield said she And must the Trojans reign in Italy So Fate will have it and Jove adds his force Nor can my pow r divert their happy course Could angry Pallas with revengeful spleen The Grecian navy burn and drown the men She for the fault of one offending foe The bolts of Jove himself presum d to throw With whirlwinds from beneath she toss d the ship And bare expos d the bosom of the deep Then as an eagle gripes the trembling game The wretch yet hissing with her father s flame She strongly seiz d and with a burning wound Transfix d and naked on a rock she bound But I who walk in awful state above The majesty of heav n the sister wife of Jove For length of years my fruitless force employ Against the thin remains of ruin d Troy What nations now to Juno s pow r will pray Or off rings on my slighted altars lay Thus rag d the goddess and with fury fraught The restless regions of the storms she sought Where in a spacious cave of living stone The tyrant Aeolus from his airy throne With pow r imperial curbs the struggling winds And sounding tempests in dark prisons binds This way and that th impatient captives tend And pressing for release the mountains rend High in his hall th undaunted monarch stands And shakes his scepter and their rage commands Which did he not their unresisted sway Would sweep the world before them in their way Earth air and seas thro empty space would roll And heav n would fly before the driving soul In fear of this the Father of the Gods Confin d their fury to those dark abodes And lock d em safe within oppress d with mountain loads Impos d a king with arbitrary sway To loose their fetters or their force allay To whom the suppliant queen her pray rs address d And thus the tenor of her suit express d O Aeolus for to thee the King of Heav n The pow r of tempests and of winds has giv n Thy force alone their fury can restrain And smooth the waves or swell the troubled main A race of wand ring slaves abhorr d by me With prosp rous passage cut the Tuscan sea To fruitful Italy their course they steer And for their vanquish d gods design new temples there Raise all thy winds with night involve the skies Sink or disperse my fatal enemies Twice sev n the charming daughters of the main Around my person wait and bear my train Succeed my wish and second my design The fairest Deiopeia shall be thine And make thee father of a happy line To this the god T is yours O queen to will The work which duty binds me to fulfil These airy kingdoms and this wide command Are all the presents of your bounteous hand Yours is my sov reign s grace and as your guest I sit with gods at their celestial feast Raise tempests at your pleasure or subdue Dispose of empire which I hold from you He said and hurl d against the mountain side His quiv ring spear and all the god applied The raging winds rush thro the hollow wound And dance aloft in air and skim along the ground Then settling on the sea the surges sweep Raise liquid mountains and disclose the deep South East and West with mix d confusion roar And roll the foaming billows to the shore The cables crack the sailors fearful cries Ascend and sable night involves the skies And heav n itself is ravish d from their eyes Loud peals of thunder from the poles ensue Then flashing fires the transient light renew The face of things a frightful image bears And present death in various forms appears Struck with unusual fright the Trojan chief With lifted hands and eyes invokes relief And Thrice and four times happy those he cried That under Ilian walls before their parents died Tydides bravest of the Grecian train Why could not I by that strong arm be slain And lie by noble Hector on the plain Or great Sarpedon in those bloody fields Where Simois rolls the bodies and the shields Of heroes whose dismember d hands yet bear The dart aloft and clench the pointed spear Thus while the pious prince his fate bewails Fierce Boreas drove against his flying sails And rent the sheets the raging billows rise And mount the tossing vessels to the skies Nor can the shiv ring oars sustain the blow The galley gives her side and turns her prow While those astern descending down the steep Thro gaping waves behold the boiling deep Three ships were hurried by the southern blast And on the secret shelves with fury cast Those hidden rocks th Ausonian sailors knew They call d them Altars when they rose in view And show d their spacious backs above the flood Three more fierce Eurus in his angry mood Dash d on the shallows of the moving sand And in mid ocean left them moor d aland Orontes bark that bore the Lycian crew A horrid sight ev n in the hero s view From stem to stern by waves was overborne The trembling pilot from his rudder torn Was headlong hurl d thrice round the ship was toss d Then bulg d at once and in the deep was lost And here and there above the waves were seen Arms pictures precious goods and floating men The stoutest vessel to the storm gave way And suck d thro loosen d planks the rushing sea Ilioneus was her chief Alethes old Achates faithful Abas young and bold Endur d not less their ships with gaping seams Admit the deluge of the briny streams Meantime imperial Neptune heard the sound Of raging billows breaking on the ground Displeas d and fearing for his wat ry reign He rear d his awful head above the main Serene in majesty then roll d his eyes Around the space of earth and seas and skies He saw the Trojan fleet dispers d distress d By stormy winds and wintry heav n oppress d Full well the god his sister s envy knew And what her aims and what her arts pursue He summon d Eurus and the western blast And first an angry glance on both he cast Then thus rebuk d Audacious winds from whence This bold attempt this rebel insolence Is it for you to ravage seas and land Unauthoriz d by my supreme command To raise such mountains on the troubled main Whom I but first t is fit the billows to restrain And then you shall be taught obedience to my reign Hence to your lord my royal mandate bear The realms of ocean and the fields of air Are mine not his By fatal lot to me The liquid empire fell and trident of the sea His pow r to hollow caverns is confin d There let him reign the jailer of the wind With hoarse commands his breathing subjects call And boast and bluster in his empty hall He spoke and while he spoke he smooth d the sea Dispell d the darkness and restor d the day Cymothoe Triton and the sea green train Of beauteous nymphs the daughters of the main Clear from the rocks the vessels with their hands The god himself with ready trident stands And opes the deep and spreads the moving sands Then heaves them off the shoals Where er he guides His finny coursers and in triumph rides The waves unruffle and the sea subsides As when in tumults rise th ignoble crowd Mad are their motions and their tongues are loud And stones and brands in rattling volleys fly And all the rustic arms that fury can supply If then some grave and pious man appear They hush their noise and lend a list ning ear He soothes with sober words their angry mood And quenches their innate desire of blood So when the Father of the Flood appears And o er the seas his sov reign trident rears Their fury falls he skims the liquid plains High on his chariot and with loosen d reins Majestic moves along and awful peace maintains The weary Trojans ply their shatter d oars To nearest land and make the Libyan shores Within a long recess there lies a bay An island shades it from the rolling sea And forms a port secure for ships to ride Broke by the jutting land on either side In double streams the briny waters glide Betwixt two rows of rocks a sylvan scene Appears above and groves for ever green A grot is form d beneath with mossy seats To rest the Nereids and exclude the heats Down thro the crannies of the living walls The crystal streams descend in murm ring falls No haulsers need to bind the vessels here Nor bearded anchors for no storms they fear Sev n ships within this happy harbor meet The thin remainders of the scatter d fleet The Trojans worn with toils and spent with woes Leap on the welcome land and seek their wish d repose First good Achates with repeated strokes Of clashing flints their hidden fire provokes Short flame succeeds a bed of wither d leaves The dying sparkles in their fall receives Caught into life in fiery fumes they rise And fed with stronger food invade the skies The Trojans dropping wet or stand around The cheerful blaze or lie along the ground Some dry their corn infected with the brine Then grind with marbles and prepare to dine Aeneas climbs the mountain s airy brow And takes a prospect of the seas below If Capys thence or Antheus he could spy Or see the streamers of Caicus fly No vessels were in view but on the plain Three beamy stags command a lordly train Of branching heads the more ignoble throng Attend their stately steps and slowly graze along He stood and while secure they fed below He took the quiver and the trusty bow Achates us d to bear the leaders first He laid along and then the vulgar pierc d Nor ceas d his arrows till the shady plain Sev n mighty bodies with their blood distain For the sev n ships he made an equal share And to the port return d triumphant from the war The jars of general rous wine Acestes gift When his Trinacrian shores the navy left He set abroach and for the feast prepar d In equal portions with the ven son shar d Thus while he dealt it round the pious chief With cheerful words allay d the common grief Endure and conquer Jove will soon dispose To future good our past and present woes With me the rocks of Scylla you have tried Th inhuman Cyclops and his den defied What greater ills hereafter can you bear Resume your courage and dismiss your care An hour will come with pleasure to relate Your sorrows past as benefits of Fate Thro various hazards and events we move To Latium and the realms foredoom d by Jove Call d to the seat the promise of the skies Where Trojan kingdoms once again may rise Endure the hardships of your present state Live and reserve yourselves for better fate These words he spoke but spoke not from his heart His outward smiles conceal d his inward smart The jolly crew unmindful of the past The quarry share their plenteous dinner haste Some strip the skin some portion out the spoil The limbs yet trembling in the caldrons boil Some on the fire the reeking entrails broil Stretch d on the grassy turf at ease they dine Restore their strength with meat and cheer their souls with wine Their hunger thus appeas d their care attends The doubtful fortune of their absent friends Alternate hopes and fears their minds possess Whether to deem em dead or in distress Above the rest Aeneas mourns the fate Of brave Orontes and th uncertain state Of Gyas Lycus and of Amycus The day but not their sorrows ended thus When from aloft almighty Jove surveys Earth air and shores and navigable seas At length on Libyan realms he fix d his eyes Whom pond ring thus on human miseries When Venus saw she with a lowly look Not free from tears her heav nly sire bespoke O King of Gods and Men whose awful hand Disperses thunder on the seas and land Disposing all with absolute command How could my pious son thy pow r incense Or what alas is vanish d Troy s offense Our hope of Italy not only lost On various seas by various tempests toss d But shut from ev ry shore and barr d from ev ry coast You promis d once a progeny divine Of Romans rising from the Trojan line In after times should hold the world in awe And to the land and ocean give the law How is your doom revers d which eas d my care When Troy was ruin d in that cruel war Then fates to fates I could oppose but now When Fortune still pursues her former blow What can I hope What worse can still succeed What end of labors has your will decreed Antenor from the midst of Grecian hosts Could pass secure and pierce th Illyrian coasts Where rolling down the steep Timavus raves And thro nine channels disembogues his waves At length he founded Padua s happy seat And gave his Trojans a secure retreat There fix d their arms and there renew d their name And there in quiet rules and crown d with fame But we descended from your sacred line Entitled to your heav n and rites divine Are banish d earth and for the wrath of one Remov d from Latium and the promis d throne Are these our scepters these our due rewards And is it thus that Jove his plighted faith regards To whom the Father of th immortal race Smiling with that serene indulgent face With which he drives the clouds and clears the skies First gave a holy kiss then thus replies Daughter dismiss thy fears to thy desire The fates of thine are fix d and stand entire Thou shalt behold thy wish d Lavinian walls And ripe for heav n when fate Aeneas calls Then shalt thou bear him up sublime to me No councils have revers d my firm decree And lest new fears disturb thy happy state Know I have search d the mystic rolls of Fate Thy son nor is th appointed season far In Italy shall wage successful war Shall tame fierce nations in the bloody field And sov reign laws impose and cities build Till after ev ry foe subdued the sun Thrice thro the signs his annual race shall run This is his time prefix d Ascanius then Now call d Iulus shall begin his reign He thirty rolling years the crown shall wear Then from Lavinium shall the seat transfer And with hard labor Alba Longa build The throne with his succession shall be fill d Three hundred circuits more then shall be seen Ilia the fair a priestess and a queen Who full of Mars in time with kindly throes Shall at a birth two goodly boys disclose The royal babes a tawny wolf shall drain Then Romulus his grandsire s throne shall gain Of martial tow rs the founder shall become The people Romans call the city Rome To them no bounds of empire I assign Nor term of years to their immortal line Ev n haughty Juno who with endless broils Earth seas and heav n and Jove himself turmoils At length aton d her friendly pow r shall join To cherish and advance the Trojan line The subject world shall Rome s dominion own And prostrate shall adore the nation of the gown An age is ripening in revolving fate When Troy shall overturn the Grecian state And sweet revenge her conqu ring sons shall call To crush the people that conspir d her fall Then Caesar from the Julian stock shall rise Whose empire ocean and whose fame the skies Alone shall bound whom fraught with eastern spoils Our heav n the just reward of human toils Securely shall repay with rites divine And incense shall ascend before his sacred shrine Then dire debate and impious war shall cease And the stern age be soften d into peace Then banish d Faith shall once again return And Vestal fires in hallow d temples burn And Remus with Quirinus shall sustain The righteous laws and fraud and force restrain Janus himself before his fane shall wait And keep the dreadful issues of his gate With bolts and iron bars within remains Imprison d Fury bound in brazen chains High on a trophy rais d of useless arms He sits and threats the world with vain alarms He said and sent Cyllenius with command To free the ports and ope the Punic land To Trojan guests lest ignorant of fate The queen might force them from her town and state Down from the steep of heav n Cyllenius flies And cleaves with all his wings the yielding skies Soon on the Libyan shore descends the god Performs his message and displays his rod The surly murmurs of the people cease And as the fates requir d they give the peace The queen herself suspends the rigid laws The Trojans pities and protects their cause Meantime in shades of night Aeneas lies Care seiz d his soul and sleep forsook his eyes But when the sun restor d the cheerful day He rose the coast and country to survey Anxious and eager to discover more It look d a wild uncultivated shore But whether humankind or beasts alone Possess d the new found region was unknown Beneath a ledge of rocks his fleet he hides Tall trees surround the mountain s shady sides The bending brow above a safe retreat provides Arm d with two pointed darts he leaves his friends And true Achates on his steps attends Lo in the deep recesses of the wood Before his eyes his goddess mother stood A huntress in her habit and her mien Her dress a maid her air confess d a queen Bare were her knees and knots her garments bind Loose was her hair and wanton d in the wind Her hand sustain d a bow her quiver hung behind She seem d a virgin of the Spartan blood With such array Harpalyce bestrode Her Thracian courser and outstripp d the rapid flood Ho strangers have you lately seen she said One of my sisters like myself array d Who cross d the lawn or in the forest stray d A painted quiver at her back she bore Varied with spots a lynx s hide she wore And at full cry pursued the tusky boar Thus Venus thus her son replied again None of your sisters have we heard or seen O virgin or what other name you

courage and his fear expell d For while expecting there the queen he rais d His wond ring eyes and round the temple gaz d Admir d the fortune of the rising town The striving artists and their arts renown He saw in order painted on the wall Whatever did unhappy Troy befall The wars that fame around the world had blown All to the life and ev ry leader known There Agamemnon Priam here he spies And fierce Achilles who both kings defies He stopp d and weeping said O friend ev n here The monuments of Trojan woes appear Our known disasters fill ev n foreign lands See there where old unhappy Priam stands Ev n the mute walls relate the warrior s fame And Trojan griefs the Tyrians pity claim He said his tears a ready passage find Devouring what he saw so well design d And with an empty picture fed his mind For there he saw the fainting Grecians yield And here the trembling Trojans quit the field Pursued by fierce Achilles thro the plain On his high chariot driving o er the slain The tents of Rhesus next his grief renew By their white sails betray d to nightly view And wakeful Diomede whose cruel sword The sentries slew nor spar d their slumb ring lord Then took the fiery steeds ere yet the food Of Troy they taste or drink the Xanthian flood Elsewhere he saw where Troilus defied Achilles and unequal combat tried Then where the boy disarm d with loosen d reins Was by his horses hurried o er the plains Hung by the neck and hair and dragg d around The hostile spear yet sticking in his wound With tracks of blood inscrib d the dusty ground Meantime the Trojan dames oppress d with woe To Pallas fane in long procession go In hopes to reconcile their heav nly foe They weep they beat their breasts they rend their hair And rich embroider d vests for presents bear But the stern goddess stands unmov d with pray r Thrice round the Trojan walls Achilles drew The corpse of Hector whom in fight he slew Here Priam sues and there for sums of gold The lifeless body of his son is sold So sad an object and so well express d Drew sighs and groans from the griev d hero s breast To see the figure of his lifeless friend And his old sire his helpless hand extend Himself he saw amidst the Grecian train Mix d in the bloody battle on the plain And swarthy Memnon in his arms he knew His pompous ensigns and his Indian crew Penthisilea there with haughty grace Leads to the wars an Amazonian race In their right hands a pointed dart they wield The left for ward sustains the lunar shield Athwart her breast a golden belt she throws Amidst the press alone provokes a thousand foes And dares her maiden arms to manly force oppose Thus while the Trojan prince employs his eyes Fix d on the walls with wonder and surprise The beauteous Dido with a num rous train And pomp of guards ascends the sacred fane Such on Eurotas banks or Cynthus height Diana seems and so she charms the sight When in the dance the graceful goddess leads The choir of nymphs and overtops their heads Known by her quiver and her lofty mien She walks majestic and she looks their queen Latona sees her shine above the rest And feeds with secret joy her silent breast Such Dido was with such becoming state Amidst the crowd she walks serenely great Their labor to her future sway she speeds And passing with a gracious glance proceeds Then mounts the throne high plac d before the shrine In crowds around the swarming people join She takes petitions and dispenses laws Hears and determines ev ry private cause Their tasks in equal portions she divides And where unequal there by lots decides Another way by chance Aeneas bends His eyes and unexpected sees his friends Antheus Sergestus grave Cloanthus strong And at their backs a mighty Trojan throng Whom late the tempest on the billows toss d And widely scatter d on another coast The prince unseen surpris d with wonder stands And longs with joyful haste to join their hands But doubtful of the wish d event he stays And from the hollow cloud his friends surveys Impatient till they told their present state And where they left their ships and what their fate And why they came and what was their request For these were sent commission d by the rest To sue for leave to land their sickly men And gain admission to the gracious queen Ent ring with cries they fill d the holy fane Then thus with lowly voice Ilioneus began O queen indulg d by favor of the gods To found an empire in these new abodes To build a town with statutes to restrain The wild inhabitants beneath thy reign We wretched Trojans toss d on ev ry shore From sea to sea thy clemency implore Forbid the fires our shipping to deface Receive th unhappy fugitives to grace And spare the remnant of a pious race We come not with design of wasteful prey To drive the country force the swains away Nor such our strength nor such is our desire The vanquish d dare not to such thoughts aspire A land there is Hesperia nam d of old The soil is fruitful and the men are bold Th Oenotrians held it once by common fame Now call d Italia from the leader s name To that sweet region was our voyage bent When winds and ev ry warring element Disturb d our course and far from sight of land Cast our torn vessels on the moving sand The sea came on the South with mighty roar Dispers d and dash d the rest upon the rocky shore Those few you see escap d the Storm and fear Unless you interpose a shipwreck here What men what monsters what inhuman race What laws what barb rous customs of the place Shut up a desart shore to drowning men And drive us to the cruel seas again If our hard fortune no compassion draws Nor hospitable rights nor human laws The gods are just and will revenge our cause Aeneas was our prince a juster lord Or nobler warrior never drew a sword Observant of the right religious of his word If yet he lives and draws this vital air Nor we his friends of safety shall despair Nor you great queen these offices repent Which he will equal and perhaps augment We want not cities nor Sicilian coasts Where King Acestes Trojan lineage boasts Permit our ships a shelter on your shores Refitted from your woods with planks and oars That if our prince be safe we may renew Our destin d course and Italy pursue But if O best of men the Fates ordain That thou art swallow d in the Libyan main And if our young Iulus be no more Dismiss our navy from your friendly shore That we to good Acestes may return And with our friends our common losses mourn Thus spoke Ilioneus the Trojan crew With cries and clamors his request renew The modest queen a while with downcast eyes Ponder d the speech then briefly thus replies Trojans dismiss your fears my cruel fate And doubts attending an unsettled state Force me to guard my coast from foreign foes Who has not heard the story of your woes The name and fortune of your native place The fame and valor of the Phrygian race We Tyrians are not so devoid of sense Nor so remote from Phoebus influence Whether to Latian shores your course is bent Or driv n by tempests from your first intent You seek the good Acestes government Your men shall be receiv d your fleet repair d And sail with ships of convoy for your guard Or would you stay and join your friendly pow rs To raise and to defend the Tyrian tow rs My wealth my city and myself are yours And would to Heav n the Storm you felt would bring On Carthaginian coasts your wand ring king My people shall by my command explore The ports and creeks of ev ry winding shore And towns and wilds and shady woods in quest Of so renown d and so desir d a guest Rais d in his mind the Trojan hero stood And long d to break from out his ambient cloud Achates found it and thus urg d his way From whence O goddess born this long delay What more can you desire your welcome sure Your fleet in safety and your friends secure One only wants and him we saw in vain Oppose the Storm and swallow d in the main Orontes in his fate our forfeit paid The rest agrees with what your mother said Scarce had he spoken when the cloud gave way The mists flew upward and dissolv d in day The Trojan chief appear d in open sight August in visage and serenely bright His mother goddess with her hands divine Had form d his curling locks and made his temples shine And giv n his rolling eyes a sparkling grace And breath d a youthful vigor on his face Like polish d ivory beauteous to behold Or Parian marble when enchas d in gold Thus radiant from the circling cloud he broke And thus with manly modesty he spoke He whom you seek am I by tempests toss d And sav d from shipwreck on your Libyan coast Presenting gracious queen before your throne A prince that owes his life to you alone Fair majesty the refuge and redress Of those whom fate pursues and wants oppress You who your pious offices employ To save the relics of abandon d Troy Receive the shipwreck d on your friendly shore With hospitable rites relieve the poor Associate in your town a wand ring train And strangers in your palace entertain What thanks can wretched fugitives return Who scatter d thro the world in exile mourn The gods if gods to goodness are inclin d If acts of mercy touch their heav nly mind And more than all the gods your general rous heart Conscious of worth requite its own desert In you this age is happy and this earth And parents more than mortal gave you birth While rolling rivers into seas shall run And round the space of heav n the radiant sun While trees the mountain tops with shades supply Your honor name and praise shall never die Whate er abode my fortune has assign d Your image shall be present in my mind Thus having said he turn d with pious haste And joyful his expecting friends embrac d With his right hand Ilioneus was grac d Serestus with his left then to his breast Cloanthus and the noble Gyas press d And so by turns descended to the rest The Tyrian queen stood fix d upon his face Pleas d with his motions ravish d with his grace Admir d his fortunes more admir d the man Then recollected stood and thus began What fate O goddess born what angry pow rs Have cast you shipwrack d on our barren shores Are you the great Aeneas known to fame Who from celestial seed your lineage claim The same Aeneas whom fair Venus bore To fam d Anchises on th Idaean shore It calls into my mind tho then a child When Teucer came from Salamis exil d And sought my father s aid to be restor d My father Belus then with fire and sword Invaded Cyprus made the region bare And conqu ring finish d the successful war From him the Trojan siege I understood The Grecian chiefs and your illustrious blood Your foe himself the Dardan valor prais d And his own ancestry from Trojans rais d Enter my noble guest and you shall find If not a costly welcome yet a kind For I myself like you have been distress d Till Heav n afforded me this place of rest Like you an alien in a land unknown I learn to pity woes so like my own She said and to the palace led her guest Then offer d incense and proclaim d a feast Nor yet less careful for her absent friends Twice ten fat oxen to the ships she sends Besides a hundred boars a hundred lambs With bleating cries attend their milky dams And jars of general rous wine and spacious bowls She gives to cheer the sailors drooping souls Now purple hangings clothe the palace walls And sumptuous feasts are made in splendid halls On Tyrian carpets richly wrought they dine With loads of massy plate the sideboards shine And antique vases all of gold emboss d The gold itself inferior to the cost Of curious work where on the sides were seen The fights and figures of illustrious men From their first founder to the present queen The good Aeneas paternal care Iulus absence could no longer bear Dispatch d Achates to the ships in haste To give a glad relation of the past And fraught with precious gifts to bring the boy Snatch d from the ruins of unhappy Troy A robe of tissue stiff with golden wire An upper vest once Helen s rich attire From Argos by the fam d adultress brought With golden flow rs and winding foliage wrought Her mother Leda s present when she came To ruin Troy and set the world on flame The scepter Priam s eldest daughter bore Her orient necklace and the crown she wore Of double texture glorious to behold One order set with gems and one with gold Instructed thus the wise Achates goes And in his diligence his duty shows But Venus anxious for her son s affairs New counsels tries and new designs prepares That Cupid should assume the shape and face Of sweet Ascanius and the sprightly grace Should bring the presents in her nephew s stead And in Eliza s veins the gentle poison shed For much she fear d the Tyrians double tongued And knew the town to Juno s care belong d These thoughts by night her golden slumbers broke And thus alarm d to winged Love she spoke My son my strength whose mighty pow r alone Controls the Thund rer on his awful throne To thee thy much afflicted mother flies And on thy succor and thy faith relies Thou know saint my son how Jove s revengeful wife By force and fraud attempts thy brother s life And often hast thou mourn d with me his pains Him Dido now with blandishment detains But I suspect the town where Juno reigns For this t is needful to prevent her art And fire with love the proud Phoenician s heart A love so violent so strong so sure As neither age can change nor art can cure How this may be perform d now take my mind Ascanius by his father is design d To come with presents laden from the port To gratify the queen and gain the court I mean to plunge the boy in pleasing sleep And ravish d in Idalian bow rs to keep Or high Cythera that the sweet deceit May pass unseen and none prevent the cheat Take thou his form and shape I beg the grace But only for a night s revolving space Thyself a boy assume a boy s dissembled face That when amidst the fervor of the feast The Tyrian hugs and fonds thee on her breast And with sweet kisses in her arms constrains Thou may saint infuse thy venom in her veins The God of Love obeys and sets aside His bow and quiver and his plumy pride He walks Iulus in his mother s sight And in the sweet resemblance takes delight The goddess then to young Ascanius flies And in a pleasing slumber seals his eyes Lull d in her lap amidst a train of Loves She gently bears him to her blissful groves Then with a wreath of myrtle crowns his head And softly lays him on a flow ry bed Cupid meantime assum d his form and face Foll wing Achates with a shorter pace And brought the gifts The queen already sate Amidst the Trojan lords in shining state High on a golden bed her princely guest Was next her side in order sate the rest Then canisters with bread are heap d on high Th attendants water for their hands supply And having wash d with silken towels dry Next fifty handmaids in long order bore The censers and with fumes the gods adore Then youths and virgins twice as many join To place the dishes and to serve the wine The Tyrian train admitted to the feast Approach and on the painted couches rest All on the Trojan gifts with wonder gaze But view the beauteous boy with more amaze His rosy color d cheeks his radiant eyes His motions voice and shape and all the god s disguise Nor pass unprais d the vest and veil divine Which wand ring foliage and rich flow rs entwine But far above the rest the royal dame Already doom d to love s disastrous flame With eyes insatiate and tumultuous joy Beholds the presents and admires the boy The guileful god about the hero long With children s play and false embraces hung Then sought the queen she took him to her arms With greedy pleasure and devour d his charms Unhappy Dido little thought what guest How dire a god she drew so near her breast But he not mindless of his mother s pray r Works in the pliant bosom of the fair And molds her heart anew and blots her former care The dead is to the living love resign d And all Aeneas enters in her mind Now when the rage of hunger was appeas d The meat remov d and ev ry guest was pleas d The golden bowls with sparkling wine are crown d And thro the palace cheerful cries resound From gilded roofs depending lamps display Nocturnal beams that emulate the day A golden bowl that shone with gems divine The queen commanded to be crown d with wine The bowl that Belus us d and all the Tyrian line Then silence thro the hall proclaim d she spoke O hospitable Jove we thus invoke With solemn rites thy sacred name and pow r Bless to both nations this auspicious hour So may the Trojan and the Tyrian line In lasting concord from this day combine Thou Bacchus god of joys and friendly cheer And gracious Juno both be present here And you my lords of Tyre your vows address To Heav n with mine to ratify the peace The goblet then she took with nectar crown d Sprinkling the first libations on the ground And rais d it to her mouth with sober grace Then sipping offer d to the next in place T was Bitias whom she call d a thirsty soul He took challenge and embrac d the bowl With pleasure swill d the gold nor ceas d to draw Till he the bottom of the brimmer saw The goblet goes around Iopas brought His golden lyre and sung what ancient Atlas taught The various labors of the wand ring moon And whence proceed th eclipses of the sun Th original of men and beasts and whence The rains arise and fires their warmth dispense And fix d and erring stars dispose their influence What shakes the solid earth what cause delays The summer nights and shortens winter days With peals of shouts the Tyrians praise the song Those peals are echo d by the Trojan throng Th unhappy queen with talk prolong d the night And drank large draughts of love with vast delight Of Priam much enquir d of Hector more Then ask d what arms the swarthy Memnon wore What troops he landed on the Trojan shore The steeds of Diomede varied the discourse And fierce Achilles with his matchless force At length as fate and her ill stars requir d To hear the series of the war desir d Relate at large my godlike guest she said The Grecian stratagems the town betray d The fatal issue of so long a war Your flight your wand rings and your woes declare For since on ev ry sea on ev ry coast Your men have been distress d your navy toss d Sev n times the sun has either tropic view d The winter banish d and the spring renew d BOOK II All were attentive to the godlike man When from his lofty couch he thus began Great queen what you command me to relate Renews the sad remembrance of our fate An empire from its old foundations rent And ev ry woe the Trojans underwent A peopled city made a desart place All that I saw and part of which I was Not ev n the hardest of our foes could hear Nor stern Ulysses tell without a tear And now the latter watch of wasting night And setting stars to kindly rest invite But since you take such int rest in our woe And Troy s disastrous end desire to know I will restrain my tears and briefly tell What in our last and fatal night befell By destiny compell d and in despair The Greeks grew weary of the tedious war And by Minerva s aid a fabric rear d Which like a steed of monstrous height appear d The sides were plank d with pine they feign d it made For their return and this the vow they paid Thus they pretend but in the hollow side Selected numbers of their soldiers hide With inward arms the dire machine they load And iron bowels stuff the dark abode In sight of Troy lies Tenedos an isle While Fortune did on Priam s empire smile Renown d for wealth but since a faithless bay Where ships expos d to wind and weather lay There was their fleet conceal d We thought for Greece Their sails were hoisted and our fears release The Trojans coop d within their walls so long Unbar their gates and issue in a throng Like swarming bees and with delight survey The camp deserted where the Grecians lay The quarters of the sev ral chiefs they show d Here Phoenix here Achilles made abode Here join d the battles there the navy rode Part on the pile their wond ring eyes employ The pile by Pallas rais d to ruin Troy Thymoetes first t is doubtful whether hir d Or so the Trojan destiny requir d Mov d that the ramparts might be broken down To lodge the monster fabric in the town But Capys and the rest of sounder mind The fatal present to the flames designed Or to the wat ry deep at least to bore The hollow sides and hidden frauds explore The giddy vulgar as their fancies guide With noise say nothing and in parts divide Laocoon follow d by a num rous crowd Ran from the fort and cried from far aloud O wretched countrymen what fury reigns What more than madness has possess d your brains Think you the Grecians from your coasts are gone And are Ulysses arts no better known This hollow fabric either must inclose Within its blind recess our secret foes Or t is an engine rais d above the town T o erlook the walls and then to batter down Somewhat is sure design d by fraud or force Trust not their presents nor admit the horse Thus having said against the steed he threw His forceful spear which hissing as flew Pierc d thro the yielding planks of jointed wood And trembling in the hollow belly stood The sides transpierc d return a rattling sound And groans of Greeks inclos d come issuing thro the wound And had not Heav n the fall of Troy design d Or had not men been fated to be blind Enough was said and done t inspire a better mind Then had our lances pierc d the treach rous wood And Ilian tow rs and Priam s empire stood Meantime with shouts the Trojan shepherds bring A captive Greek in bands before the king Taken to take who made himself their prey T impose on their belief and Troy betray Fix d on his aim and obstinately bent To die undaunted or to circumvent About the captive tides of Trojans flow All press to see and some insult the foe Now hear how well the Greeks their wiles disguis d Behold a nation in a man compris d Trembling the miscreant stood unarm d and bound He star d and roll d his haggard eyes around Then said Alas what earth remains what sea Is open to receive unhappy me What fate a wretched fugitive attends Scorn d by my foes abandon d by my friends He said and sigh d and cast a rueful eye Our pity kindles and our passions die We cheer youth to make his own defense And freely tell us what he was and whence What news he could impart we long to know And what to credit from a captive foe His fear at length dismiss d he said Whate er My fate ordains my words shall be sincere I neither can nor dare my birth disclaim Greece is my country Sinon is my name Tho plung d by Fortune s pow r in misery T is not in Fortune s pow r to make me lie If any chance has hither brought the name Of Palamedes not unknown to fame Who suffer d from the malice of the times Accus d and sentenc d for pretended crimes Because these fatal wars he would prevent Whose death the wretched Greeks too late lament Me then a boy my father poor and bare Of other means committed to his care His kinsman and companion in the war While Fortune favor d while his arms support The cause and rul d the counsels of the court I made some figure there nor was my name Obscure nor I without my share of fame But when Ulysses with fallacious arts Had made impression in the people s hearts And forg d a treason in my patron s name I speak of things too far divulg d by fame My kinsman fell Then I without support In private mourn d his loss and left the court Mad as I was I could not bear his fate With silent grief but loudly blam d the state And curs d the direful author of my woes T was told again and hence my ruin rose I threaten d if indulgent Heav n once more Would land me safely on my native shore His death with double vengeance to restore This mov d the murderer s hate and soon ensued Th effects of malice from a man so proud Ambiguous rumors thro the camp he spread And sought by treason my devoted head New crimes invented left unturn d no stone To make my guilt appear and hide his own Till Calchas was by force and threat ning wrought But why why dwell I on that anxious thought If on my nation just revenge you seek And t is t appear a foe t appear a Greek Already you my name and country know Assuage your thirst of blood and strike the blow My death will both the kingly brothers please And set insatiate Ithacus at ease This fair unfinish d tale these broken starts Rais d expectations in our longing hearts Unknowing as we were in Grecian arts His former trembling once again renew d With acted fear the villain thus pursued Long had the Grecians tir d with fruitless care And wearied with an unsuccessful war Resolv d to raise the siege and leave the town And had the gods permitted they had gone But oft the wintry seas and southern winds Withstood their passage home and chang d their minds Portents and prodigies their souls amaz d But most when this stupendous pile was rais d Then flaming meteors hung in air were seen And thunders rattled thro a sky serene Dismay d and fearful of some dire event Eurypylus t enquire their fate was sent He from the gods this dreadful answer brought O Grecians when the Trojan shores you sought Your passage with a virgin s blood was bought So must your safe return be bought again And Grecian blood once more atone the main The spreading rumor round the people ran All fear d and each believ d himself the man Ulysses took th advantage of their fright Call d Calchas and produc d in open sight Then bade him name the wretch ordain d by fate The public victim to redeem the state Already some presag d the dire event And saw what sacrifice Ulysses meant For twice five days the good old seer withstood Th intended treason and was dumb to blood Till tir d with endless clamors and pursuit Of Ithacus he stood no longer mute But as it was agreed pronounc d that I Was destin d by the wrathful gods to die All prais d the sentence pleas d the storm should fall On one alone whose fury threaten d all The dismal day was come the priests prepare Their leaven d cakes and fillets for my hair I follow d nature s laws and must avow I broke my bonds and fled the fatal blow Hid in a weedy lake all night I lay Secure of safety when they sail d away But now what further hopes for me remain To see my friends or native soil again My tender infants or my careful sire Whom they returning will to death require Will perpetrate on them their first design And take the forfeit of their heads for mine Which O if pity mortal minds can move If there be faith below or gods above If innocence and truth can claim desert Ye Trojans from an injur d wretch avert False tears true pity move the king commands To loose his fetters and unbind his hands Then adds these friendly words Dismiss thy fears Forget the Greeks be mine as thou wert theirs But truly tell was it for force or guile Or some religious end you rais d the pile Thus said the king He full of fraudful arts This well invented tale for truth imparts Ye lamps of heav n he said and lifted high His hands now free thou venerable sky Inviolable pow rs ador d with dread Ye fatal fillets that once bound this head Ye sacred altars from whose flames I fled Be all of you adjur d and grant I may Without a crime th ungrateful Greeks betray Reveal the secrets of the guilty state And justly punish whom I justly hate But you O king preserve the faith you gave If I to save myself your empire save The Grecian hopes and all th attempts they made Were only founded on Minerva s aid But from the time when impious Diomede And false Ulysses that inventive head Her fatal image from the temple drew The sleeping guardians of the castle slew Her virgin statue with their bloody hands Polluted and profan d her holy bands From thence the tide of fortune left their shore And ebb d much faster than it flow d before Their courage languish d as their hopes decay d And Pallas now averse refus d her aid Nor did the goddess doubtfully declare Her alter d mind and alienated care When first her fatal image touch d the ground She sternly cast her glaring eyes around That sparkled as they roll d and seem d to threat Her heav nly limbs distill d a briny sweat Thrice from the ground she leap d was seen to wield Her brandish d lance and shake her horrid shield Then Calchas bade our host for flight And hope no conquest from the tedious war Till first they sail d for Greece with pray rs besought Her injur d pow r and better omens brought And now their navy plows the wat ry main Yet soon expect it on your shores again With Pallas pleas d as Calchas did ordain But first to reconcile the blue ey d maid For her stol n statue and her tow r betray d Warn d by the seer to her offended name We rais d and dedicate this wondrous frame So lofty lest thro your forbidden gates It pass and intercept our better fates For once admitted there our hopes are lost And Troy may then a new Palladium boast For so religion and the gods ordain That if you violate with hands profane Minerva s gift your town in flames shall burn Which omen O ye gods on Graecia turn But if it climb with your assisting hands The Trojan walls and in the city stands Then Troy shall Argos and Mycenae burn And the reverse of fate on us return With such deceits he gain d their easy hearts Too prone to credit his perfidious arts What Diomede nor Thetis greater son A thousand ships nor ten years siege had done False tears and fawning words the city won A greater omen and of worse portent Did our unwary minds with fear torment Concurring to produce the dire event Laocoon Neptune s priest by lot that year With solemn pomp then sacrific d a steer When dreadful to behold from sea we spied Two serpents rank d abreast the seas divide And smoothly sweep along the swelling tide Their flaming crests above the waves they show Their bellies seem to burn the seas below Their speckled tails advance to steer their course And on the sounding shore the flying billows force And now the strand and now the plain they held Their ardent eyes with bloody streaks were fill d Their nimble tongues they brandish d as they came And lick d their hissing jaws that sputter d flame We fled amaz d their destin d way they take And to Laocoon and his children make And first around the tender boys they wind Then with their sharpen d fangs their limbs and bodies grind The wretched father running to their aid With pious haste but vain they next invade Twice round his waist their winding volumes roll d And twice about his gasping throat they fold The priest thus doubly chok d their crests divide And tow ring o er his head in triumph ride With both his hands he labors at the knots His holy fillets the blue venom blots His roaring fills the flitting air around Thus when an ox receives a glancing wound He breaks his bands the fatal altar flies And with loud bellowings breaks the yielding skies Their tasks perform d the serpents quit their prey And to the tow r of Pallas make their way Couch d at her feet they lie protected there By her large buckler and protended spear Amazement seizes all the general ral cry Proclaims Laocoon justly doom d to die Whose hand the will of Pallas had withstood And dared to violate the sacred wood All vote t admit the steed that vows be paid And incense offer d to th offended maid A spacious breach is made the town lies bare Some hoisting levers some the wheels prepare And fasten to the horse s feet the rest With cables haul along th unwieldly beast Each on his fellow for assistance calls At length the fatal fabric mounts the walls Big with destruction Boys with chaplets crown d And choirs of virgins sing and dance around Thus rais d aloft and then descending down It enters o er our heads and threats the town O sacred city built by hands divine O valiant heroes of the Trojan line Four times he struck as oft the clashing sound Of arms was heard and inward groans rebound Yet mad with zeal and blinded with our fate We haul along the horse in solemn state Then place the dire portent within the tow r Cassandra cried and curs d th unhappy hour Foretold our fate but by the god s decree All heard and none believ d the prophecy With branches we the fanes adorn and waste In jollity the day ordain d to be the last Meantime the rapid heav ns roll d down the light And on the shaded ocean rush d the night Our men secure nor guards nor sentries held But easy sleep their weary limbs compell d The Grecians had embark d their naval pow rs From Tenedos and sought our well known shores Safe under covert of the silent night And guided by th imperial galley s light When Sinon favor d by the partial gods Unlock d the horse and op d his dark abodes Restor d to vital air our hidden foes Who joyful from their long confinement rose Tysander bold and Sthenelus their guide And dire Ulysses down the cable slide Then Thoas Athamas and Pyrrhus haste Nor was the Podalirian hero last Nor injur d Menelaus nor the fam d Epeus who the fatal engine fram d A nameless crowd succeed their forces join T invade the town oppress d with sleep and wine Those few they find awake first meet their fate Then to their fellows they unbar the gate T was in the dead of night when sleep repairs Our bodies worn with toils our minds with cares When Hector s ghost before my sight appears A bloody shroud he seem d and bath d in tears Such as he was when by Pelides slain Thessalian coursers dragg d him o er the plain Swoln were his feet as when the thongs were thrust Thro the bor d holes his body black with dust Unlike that Hector who return d from toils Of war triumphant in Aeacian spoils Or him who made the fainting Greeks retire And launch d against their navy Phrygian fire His hair and beard stood stiffen d with his gore And all the wounds he for his country bore Now stream d afresh and with new purple ran I wept to see the visionary man And while my trance continued thus began O light of Trojans and support of Troy Thy father s champion and thy country s joy O long expected by thy friends from whence Art thou so late return d for our defense Do we behold thee wearied as we are With length of labors and with toils of war After so many fun rals of thy own Art thou restor d to thy declining town But say what wounds are these What new disgrace Deforms the manly features of thy face To this the specter no reply did frame But answer d to the cause for which he came And groaning from the bottom of his breast This warning in these mournful words express d O goddess born escape by timely flight The flames and horrors of this fatal night The foes already have possess d the wall Troy nods from high and totters to her fall Enough is paid to Priam s royal name More than enough to duty and to fame If by a mortal hand my father s throne Could be defended t was by mine alone Now Troy to thee commends her future state And gives her gods companions of thy fate From their assistance walls expect Which wand ring long at last thou shalt erect He said and brought me from their blest abodes The venerable statues of the gods With ancient Vesta from the sacred choir The wreaths and relics of th immortal fire Now peals of shouts come thund ring from afar Cries threats and loud laments and mingled war The noise approaches tho our palace stood Aloof from streets encompass d with a wood Louder and yet more loud I hear th alarms Of human cries distinct and clashing arms Fear broke my slumbers I no longer stay But mount the terrace thence the town survey And hearken what the frightful sounds convey Thus when a flood of fire by wind is borne Crackling it rolls and mows the standing corn Or deluges descending on the plains Sweep o er the yellow year destroy the pains Of lab ring oxen and the peasant s gains Unroot the forest oaks and bear away Flocks folds and trees and undistinguish d prey The shepherd climbs the cliff and sees from far The wasteful ravage of the wat ry war Then Hector s faith was manifestly clear d And Grecian frauds in open light appear d The palace of Deiphobus ascends In smoky flames and catches on his friends Ucalegon burns next the seas are bright With splendor not their own and shine with Trojan light New clamors and new clangors now arise The sound of trumpets mix d with fighting cries With frenzy seiz d I run to meet th alarms Resolv d on death resolv d to die in arms But first to gather friends with them t oppose If fortune favor d and repel the foes Spurr d by my courage by my country fir d With sense of honor and revenge inspir d Pantheus Apollo s priest a sacred name Had scap d the Grecian swords and pass d the flame With relics loaden to my doors he fled And by the hand his tender grandson led What hope O Pantheus whither can we run Where make a stand and what may yet be done Scarce had I said when Pantheus with a groan Troy is no more and Ilium was a town The fatal day th appointed hour is come When wrathful Jove s irrevocable doom Transfers the Trojan state to Grecian hands The fire consumes the town the foe commands And armed hosts an unexpected force Break from the bowels of the fatal horse Within the gates proud Sinon throws about The flames and foes for entrance press without With thousand others whom I fear to name More than from Argos or Mycenae came To sev ral posts their parties they divide Some block the narrow streets some scour the wide The bold they kill th unwary they surprise Who fights finds death and death finds him who flies The warders of the gate but scarce maintain Th unequal combat and resist in vain I heard and Heav n that well born souls inspires Prompts me thro lifted swords and rising fires To run where clashing arms and clamor calls And rush undaunted to defend the walls Ripheus and Iph itus by my side engage For valor one renown d and one for age Dymas and Hypanis by moonlight knew My motions and my mien and to my party drew With young Coroebus who by love was led To win renown and fair Cassandra s bed And lately brought his troops to Priam s aid Forewarn d in vain by the prophetic maid Whom when I saw resolv d in arms to fall And that one spirit animated all Brave souls said I but brave alas in vain Come finish what our cruel fates ordain You see the desp rate state of our affairs And heav n s protecting pow rs are deaf to pray rs The passive gods behold the Greeks defile Their temples and abandon to the spoil Their own abodes we feeble few conspire To save a sinking town involv d in fire Then let us fall but fall amidst our foes Despair of life the means of living shows So bold a speech incourag d their desire Of death and added fuel to their fire As hungry wolves with raging appetite Scour thro the fields nor fear the stormy night Their whelps at home expect the promis d food And long to temper their dry chaps in blood So rush d we forth at once resolv d to die Resolv d in death the last extremes to try We leave the narrow lanes behind and dare Th unequal combat in the public square Night was our friend our leader was despair What tongue can tell the slaughter of that night What eyes can weep the sorrows and affright An ancient and imperial city falls The streets are fill d with frequent funerals Houses and holy temples float in blood And hostile nations make a common flood Not only Trojans fall but in their turn The vanquish d triumph and the victors mourn Ours take new courage from despair and night Confus d the fortune is confus d the fight All parts resound with tumults plaints and fears And grisly Death in sundry shapes appears Androgeos fell among us with his band Who thought us Grecians newly come to land From whence said he my friends this long delay You loiter while the spoils are borne away Our ships are laden with the Trojan store And you like truants come too late ashore He said but soon corrected his mistake Found by the doubtful answers which we make Amaz d he would have shunn d th unequal fight But we more num rous intercept his flight As when some peasant in a bushy brake Has with unwary footing press d a snake He starts aside astonish d when he spies His rising crest blue neck and rolling eyes So from our arms surpris d Androgeos flies In vain for him and his we compass d round Possess d with fear unknowing of the ground And of their lives an easy conquest found Thus Fortune on our first endeavor smil d Coroebus then with youthful hopes beguil d Swoln with success and a daring mind This new invention fatally design d My friends said he since Fortune shows the way T is fit we should th auspicious guide obey For what has she these Grecian arms bestow d But their destruction and the Trojans good Then change we shields and their devices bear Let fraud supply the want of force in war They find us arms This said himself he dress d In dead Androgeos spoils his upper vest His painted buckler and his plumy crest Thus Ripheus Dymas all the Trojan train Lay down their own attire and strip the slain Mix d with the Greeks we go with ill presage Flatter d with hopes to glut our greedy rage Unknown assaulting whom we blindly meet And strew with Grecian carcasses the street Thus while their straggling parties we defeat Some to the shore and safer ships retreat And some oppress d with more ignoble fear Remount the hollow horse and pant in secret there But ah what use of valor can be made When heav n s propitious pow rs refuse their aid Behold the royal prophetess the fair Cassandra dragg d by her dishevel d hair Whom not Minerva s shrine nor sacred bands In safety could protect from sacrilegious

Who thought us Grecians as we seem d in show They aim at the mistaken crests from high And ours beneath the pond rous ruin lie Then mov d with anger and disdain to see Their troops dispers d the royal

rival winds their quarrel try Contending for the kingdom of the sky South east and west on airy coursers borne The whirlwind gathers and the woods are torn Then Nereus strikes the deep the billows rise And mix d with ooze and sand pollute the skies The troops we squander d first again appear From several quarters and enclose the rear They first observe and to the rest betray Our diff rent

What I perform d and what I suffer d there No sword avoiding in the fatal strife Expos d to death and prodigal of life Witness ye heavens I live not by my fault I strove to have deserv d the death I sought But when I could not fight and would have died Borne off to distance by the growing tide Old Iphitus and I were hurried thence With Pelias wounded and without defense New clamors from th invested palace ring We run to die or disengage the king So hot th assault so high the tumult rose While ours defend and while the Greeks oppose As all the Dardan and Argolic race Had been contracted in that narrow space Or as all Ilium else were void of fear And tumult war and slaughter only there Their targets in a tortoise cast the foes Secure advancing to the turrets rose Some mount the scaling ladders some more bold Swerve upwards and by posts and pillars hold Their left hand gripes their bucklers in th ascent While with their right they seize the battlement From their demolish d tow rs the Trojans throw Huge heaps of stones that falling crush the foe And heavy beams and rafters from the sides Such arms their last necessity provides And gilded roofs come tumbling from on high The marks of state and ancient royalty The guards below fix d in the pass attend The charge undaunted and the gate defend Renew d in courage with recover d breath A second time we ran to tempt our

known To Hector s wife while Priam held the throne Thro which she brought Astyanax unseen To cheer his grandsire and his grandsire s queen Thro this we pass and mount the tow r from whence With unavailing arms the Trojans make defense From this the trembling king had oft descried The Grecian camp and saw their navy ride Beams from its lofty height with swords we hew Then wrenching with our hands th assault renew And where the rafters on the columns meet We push them headlong with our arms and feet The lightning flies not swifter than the fall Nor thunder louder than the ruin d wall Down goes the top at once the Greeks beneath Are piecemeal torn or pounded into death Yet more succeed and more to death are sent We cease not from above nor they below relent Before the gate stood Pyrrhus threat ning loud With glitt ring arms conspicuous in the crowd So shines renew d in youth the crested snake Who slept the winter in a thorny brake And casting off his slough when spring returns Now looks aloft and with new glory burns Restor d with poisonous herbs his ardent sides Reflect the sun and rais d on spires he rides High o er the grass hissing he rolls along And brandishes by fits his forky tongue Proud Periphas and fierce Automedon His father s charioteer together run To force the gate the Scyrian infantry Rush on in crowds and the barr d passage free Ent ring the court with shouts the skies they rend And flaming firebrands to the roofs ascend Himself among the foremost deals his blows And with his ax repeated strokes bestows On the strong doors then all their shoulders ply Till from the posts the brazen hinges fly He hews apace the double bars at length Yield to his ax and unresisted strength A mighty breach is made the rooms conceal d Appear and all the palace is reveal d The halls of audience and of public state And where the lonely queen in secret sate Arm d soldiers now by trembling maids are seen With not a door and scarce a space between The house is fill d with loud laments and cries And shrieks of women rend the vaulted skies The fearful matrons run from place to place And kiss the thresholds and the posts embrace The fatal work inhuman Pyrrhus plies And all his father sparkles in his eyes Nor bars nor fighting guards his force sustain The bars are broken and the guards are slain In rush the Greeks and all the apartments fill Those few defendants whom they find they kill Not with so fierce a rage the foaming flood Roars when he finds his rapid course withstood Bears down the dams with unresisted sway And sweeps the cattle and the cots away These eyes beheld him when he march d between The brother kings I saw th unhappy queen The hundred wives and where old Priam stood To stain his hallow d altar with his brood The fifty nuptial beds such hopes had he So large a promise of a progeny The posts of plated gold and hung with spoils Fell the reward of the proud victor s toils Where er the raging fire had left a space The Grecians enter and possess the place Perhaps you may of Priam s fate enquire He when he saw his regal town on fire His ruin d palace and his ent ring foes On ev ry side inevitable woes In arms disus d invests his limbs decay d Like them with age a late and useless aid His feeble shoulders scarce the weight sustain Loaded not arm d he creeps along with pain Despairing of success ambitious to be slain Uncover d but by heav n there stood in view An altar near the hearth a laurel grew Dodder d with age whose boughs encompass round The household gods and shade the holy ground Here Hecuba with all her helpless train Of dames for shelter sought but sought in vain Driv n like a flock of doves along the sky Their images they hug and to their altars fly The Queen when she beheld her trembling lord And hanging by his side a heavy sword What rage she cried has seiz d my husband s mind What arms are these and to what use design d These times want other aids Were Hector here Ev n Hector now in vain like Priam would appear With us one common shelter thou shalt find Or in one common fate with us be join d She said and with a last salute embrac d The poor old man and by the laurel plac d Behold Polites one of Priam s sons Pursued by Pyrrhus there for safety runs Thro swords and foes amaz d and hurt he flies Thro empty courts and open galleries Him Pyrrhus urging with his lance pursues And often reaches and his thrusts renews The youth transfix d with lamentable cries Expires before his wretched parent s eyes Whom gasping at his feet when Priam saw The fear of death gave place to nature s law And shaking more with anger than with age The gods said he requite thy brutal rage As sure they will barbarian sure they must If there be gods in heav n and gods be just Who tak saint in wrongs an insolent delight With a son s death t infect a father s sight Not he whom thou and lying fame conspire To call thee his not he thy vaunted sire Thus us d my wretched age the gods he fear d The laws of nature and of nations heard He cheer d my sorrows and for sums of gold The bloodless carcass of my Hector sold Pitied the woes a parent underwent And sent me back in safety from his tent This said his feeble hand a javelin threw Which flutt ring seem d to loiter as it flew Just and but barely to the mark it held And faintly tinkled on the brazen shield Then Pyrrhus thus Go thou from me to fate And to my father my foul deeds relate Now die With that he dragg d the trembling sire Slidd ring thro clotter d blood and holy mire The mingled paste his murder d son had made Haul d from beneath the violated shade And on the sacred pile the royal victim laid His right hand held his bloody falchion bare His left he twisted in his hoary hair Then with a speeding thrust his heart he found The lukewarm blood came rushing thro the wound And sanguine streams distain d the sacred ground Thus Priam fell and shar d one common fate With Troy in ashes and his ruin d state He who the scepter of all Asia sway d Whom monarchs like domestic slaves obey d On the bleak shore now lies th abandon d king A headless carcass and a nameless thing Then not before I felt my cruddled blood Congeal with fear my hair with horror stood My father s image fill d my pious mind Lest equal years might equal fortune find Again I thought on my forsaken wife And trembled for my son s abandon d life I look d about but found myself alone Deserted at my need My friends were gone Some spent with toil some with despair oppress d Leap d headlong from the heights the flames consum d the rest Thus wand ring in my way without a guide The graceless Helen in the porch I spied Of Vesta s temple there she lurk d alone Muffled she sate and what she could unknown But by the flames that cast their blaze around That common bane of Greece and Troy I found For Ilium burnt she dreads the Trojan sword More dreads the vengeance of her injur d lord Ev n by those gods who refug d her abhorr d Trembling with rage the strumpet I regard Resolv d to give her guilt the due reward Shall she triumphant sail before the wind And leave in flames unhappy Troy behind Shall she her kingdom and her friends review In state attended with a captive crew While unreveng d the good old Priam falls And Grecian fires consume the Trojan walls For this the Phrygian fields and Xanthian flood Were swell d with bodies and were drunk with blood T is true a soldier can small honor gain And boast no conquest from a woman slain Yet shall the fact not pass without applause Of vengeance taken in so just a cause The punish d crime shall set my soul at ease And murm ring manes of my friends appease Thus while I rave a gleam of pleasing light Spread o er the place and shining heav nly bright My mother stood reveal d before my sight Never so radiant did her eyes appear Not her own star confess d a light so clear Great in her charms as when on gods above She looks and breathes herself into their love She held my hand the destin d blow to break Then from her rosy lips began to speak My son from whence this madness this neglect Of my commands and those whom I protect Why this unmanly rage Recall to mind Whom you forsake what pledges leave behind Look if your helpless father yet survive Or if Ascanius or Creusa live Around your house the greedy Grecians err And these had perish d in the nightly war But for my presence and protecting care Not Helen s face nor Paris was in fault But by the gods was this destruction brought Now cast your eyes around while I dissolve The mists and films that mortal eyes involve Purge from your sight the dross and make you see The shape of each avenging deity Enlighten d thus my just commands fulfil Nor fear obedience to your mother s will Where yon disorder d heap of ruin lies Stones rent from stones where clouds of dust arise Amid that smother Neptune holds his place Below the wall s foundation drives his mace And heaves the building from the solid base Look where in arms imperial Juno stands Full in the Scaean gate with loud commands Urging on shore the tardy Grecian bands See Pallas of her snaky buckler proud Bestrides the tow r refulgent thro the cloud See Jove new courage to the foe supplies And arms against the town the partial deities Haste hence my son this fruitless labor end Haste where your trembling spouse and sire attend Haste and a mother s care your passage shall befriend She said and swiftly vanish d from my sight Obscure in clouds and gloomy shades of night I look d I listen d dreadful sounds I hear And the dire forms of hostile gods appear Troy sunk in flames I saw nor could prevent And Ilium from its old foundations rent Rent like a mountain ash which dar d the winds And stood the sturdy strokes of lab ring hinds About the roots the cruel ax resounds The stumps are pierc d with oft repeated wounds The war is felt on high the nodding crown Now threats a fall and throws the leafy honors down To their united force it yields tho late And mourns with mortal groans th approaching fate The roots no more their upper load sustain But down she falls and spreads a ruin thro the plain Descending thence I scape thro foes and fire Before the goddess foes and flames retire Arriv d at home he for whose only sake Or most for his such toils I undertake The good Anchises whom by timely flight I purpos d to secure on Ida s height Refus d the journey resolute to die And add his fun rals to the fate of Troy Rather than exile and old age sustain Go you whose blood runs warm in ev ry vein Had Heav n decreed that I should life enjoy Heav n had decreed to save unhappy Troy T is sure enough if not too much for one Twice to have seen our Ilium overthrown Make haste to save the poor remaining crew And give this useless corpse a long adieu These weak old hands suffice to stop my breath At least the pitying foes will aid my death To take my spoils and leave my body bare As for my sepulcher let Heav n take care T is long since I for my celestial wife Loath d by the gods have dragg d a ling ring life Since ev ry hour and moment I expire Blasted from heav n by Jove s avenging fire This oft repeated he stood fix d to die Myself my wife my son my family Intreat pray beg and raise a doleful cry What will he still persist on death resolve And in his ruin all his house involve He still persists his reasons to maintain Our pray rs our tears our loud laments are vain Urg d by despair again I go to try The fate of arms resolv d in fight to die What hope remains but what my death must give Can I without so dear a father live You term it prudence what I baseness call Could such a word from such a parent fall If Fortune please and so the gods ordain That nothing should of ruin d Troy remain And you conspire with Fortune to be slain The way to death is wide th approaches near For soon relentless Pyrrhus will appear Reeking with Priam s blood the wretch who slew The son inhuman in the father s view And then the sire himself to the dire altar drew O goddess mother give me back to Fate Your gift was undesir d and came too late Did you for this unhappy me convey Thro foes and fires to see my house a prey Shall I my father wife and son behold Welt ring in blood each other s arms infold Haste gird my sword tho spent and overcome T is the last summons to receive our doom I hear thee Fate and I obey thy call Not unreveng d the foe shall see my fall Restore me to the yet unfinish d fight My death is wanting to conclude the night Arm d once again my glitt ring sword I wield While th other hand sustains my weighty shield And forth I rush to seek th abandon d field I went but sad Creusa stopp d my way And cross the threshold in my passage lay Embrac d my knees and when I would have gone Shew d me my feeble sire and tender son If death be your design at least said she Take us along to share your destiny If any farther hopes in arms remain This place these pledges of your love maintain To whom do you expose your father s life Your son s and mine your now forgotten wife While thus she fills the house with clam rous cries Our hearing is diverted by our eyes For while I held my son in the short space Betwixt our kisses and our last embrace Strange to relate from young Iulus head A lambent flame arose which gently spread Around his brows and on his temples fed Amaz d with running water we prepare To quench the sacred fire and slake his hair But old Anchises vers d in omens rear d His hands to heav n and this request preferr d If any vows almighty Jove can bend Thy will if piety can pray rs commend Confirm the glad presage which thou art pleas d to send Scarce had he said when on our left we hear A peal of rattling thunder roll in air There shot a streaming lamp along the sky Which on the winged lightning seem d to fly From o er the roof the blaze began to move And trailing vanish d in th Idaean grove It swept a path in heav n and shone a guide Then in a steaming stench of sulphur died The good old man with suppliant hands implor d The gods protection and their star ador d Now now said he my son no more delay I yield I follow where Heav n shews the way Keep O my country gods our dwelling place And guard this relic of the Trojan race This tender child These omens are your own And you can yet restore the ruin d town At least accomplish what your signs foreshow I stand resign d and am prepar d to go He said The crackling flames appear on high And driving sparkles dance along the sky With Vulcan s rage the rising winds conspire And near our palace roll the flood of fire Haste my dear father t is no time to wait And load my shoulders with a willing freight Whate er befalls your life shall be my care One death or one deliv rance we will share My hand shall lead our little son and you My faithful consort shall our steps pursue Next you my servants heed my strict commands Without the walls a ruin d temple stands To Ceres hallow d once a cypress nigh Shoots up her venerable head on high By long religion kept there bend your feet And in divided parties let us meet Our country gods the relics and the bands Hold you my father in your guiltless hands In me t is impious holy things to bear Red as I am with slaughter new from war Till in some living stream I cleanse the guilt Of dire debate and blood in battle spilt Thus ord ring all that prudence could provide I clothe my shoulders with a lion s hide And yellow spoils then on my bending back The welcome load of my dear father take While on my better hand Ascanius hung And with unequal paces tripp d along Creusa kept behind by choice we stray Thro ev ry dark and ev ry devious way I who so bold and dauntless just before The Grecian darts and shock of lances bore At ev ry shadow now am seiz d with fear Not for myself but for the charge I bear Till near the ruin d gate arriv d at last Secure and deeming all the danger past A frightful noise of trampling feet we hear My father looking thro the shades with fear Cried out Haste haste my son the foes are nigh Their swords and shining armor I descry Some hostile god for some unknown offense Had sure bereft my mind of better sense For while thro winding ways I took my flight And sought the shelter of the gloomy night Alas I lost Creusa hard to tell If by her fatal destiny she fell Or weary sate or wander d with affright But she was lost for ever to my sight I knew not or reflected till I meet My friends at Ceres now deserted seat We met not one was wanting only she Deceiv d her friends her son and wretched me What mad expressions did my tongue refuse Whom did I not of gods or men accuse This was the fatal blow that pain d me more Than all I felt from ruin d Troy before Stung with my loss and raving with despair Abandoning my now forgotten care Of counsel comfort and of hope bereft My sire my son my country gods I left In shining armor once again I sheathe My limbs not feeling wounds nor fearing death Then headlong to the burning walls I run And seek the danger I was forc d to shun I tread my former tracks thro night explore Each passage ev ry street I cross d before All things were full of horror and affright And dreadful ev n the silence of the night Then to my father s house I make repair With some small glimpse of hope to find her there Instead of her the cruel Greeks I met The house was fill d with foes with flames beset Driv n on the wings of winds whole sheets of fire Thro air transported to the roofs aspire From thence to Priam s palace I resort And search the citadel and desart court Then unobserv d I pass by Juno s church A guard of Grecians had possess d the porch There Phoenix and Ulysses watch prey And thither all the wealth of Troy convey The spoils which they from ransack d houses brought And golden bowls from burning altars caught The tables of the gods the purple vests The people s treasure and the pomp of priests A rank of wretched youths with pinion d hands And captive matrons in long order stands Then with ungovern d madness I proclaim Thro all the silent street Creusa s name Creusa still I call at length she hears And sudden thro the shades of night appears Appears no more Creusa nor my wife But a pale specter larger than the life Aghast astonish d and struck dumb with fear I stood like bristles rose my stiffen d hair Then thus the ghost began to soothe my grief Nor tears nor cries can give the dead relief Desist my much lov d lord t indulge your pain You bear no more than what the gods ordain My fates permit me not from hence to fly Nor he the great controller of the sky Long wand ring ways for you the pow rs decree On land hard labors and a length of sea Then after many painful years are past On Latium s happy shore you shall be cast Where gentle Tiber from his bed beholds The flow ry meadows and the feeding folds There end your toils and there your fates provide A quiet kingdom and a royal bride There fortune shall the Trojan line restore And you for lost Creusa weep no more Fear not that I shall watch with servile shame Th imperious looks of some proud Grecian dame Or stooping to the victor s lust disgrace My goddess mother or my royal race And now farewell The parent of the gods Restrains my fleeting soul in her abodes I trust our common issue to your care She said and gliding pass d unseen in air I strove to speak but horror tied my tongue And thrice about her neck my arms I flung And thrice deceiv d on vain embraces hung Light as an empty dream at break of day Or as a blast of wind she rush d away Thus having pass d the night in fruitless pain I to my longing friends return again Amaz d th augmented number to behold Of men and matrons mix d of young and old A wretched exil d crew together brought With arms appointed and with treasure fraught Resolv d and willing under my command To run all hazards both of sea and land The Morn began from Ida to display Her rosy cheeks and Phosphor led the day Before the gates the Grecians took their post And all pretense of late relief was lost I yield to Fate unwillingly retire And loaded up the hill convey my sire BOOK III When Heav n had overturn d the Trojan state And Priam s throne by too severe a fate When ruin d Troy became the Grecians prey And Ilium s lofty tow rs in ashes lay Warn d by celestial omens we retreat To seek in foreign lands a happier seat Near old Antandros and at Ida s foot The timber of the sacred groves we cut And build our fleet uncertain yet to find What place the gods for our repose assign d Friends daily flock and scarce the kindly spring Began to clothe the ground and birds to sing When old Anchises summon d all to sea The crew my father and the Fates obey With sighs and tears I leave my native shore And empty fields where Ilium stood before My sire my son our less and greater gods All sail at once and cleave the briny floods Against our coast appears a spacious land Which once the fierce Lycurgus did command Thracia the name the people bold in war Vast are their fields and tillage is their care A hospitable realm while Fate was kind With Troy in friendship and religion join d I land with luckless omens then adore Their gods and draw a line along the shore I lay the deep foundations of a wall And Aenos nam d from me the city call To Dionaean Venus vows are paid And all the pow rs that rising labors aid A bull on Jove s imperial altar laid Not far a rising hillock stood in view Sharp myrtles on the sides and cornels grew There while I went to crop the sylvan scenes And shade our altar with their leafy greens I pull d a plant with horror I relate A prodigy so strange and full of fate The rooted fibers rose and from the wound Black bloody drops distill d upon the ground Mute and amaz d my hair with terror stood Fear shrunk my sinews and congeal d my blood Mann d once again another plant I try That other gush d with the same sanguine dye Then fearing guilt for some offense unknown With pray rs and vows the Dryads I atone With all the sisters of the woods and most The God of Arms who rules the Thracian coast That they or he these omens would avert Release our fears and better signs impart Clear d as I thought and fully fix d at length To learn the cause I tugged with all my strength I bent my knees against the ground once more The violated myrtle ran with gore Scarce dare I tell the sequel from the womb Of wounded earth and caverns of the tomb A groan as of a troubled ghost renew d My fright and then these dreadful words ensued Why dost thou thus my buried body rend O spare the corpse of thy unhappy friend Spare to pollute thy pious hands with blood The tears distil not from the wounded wood But ev ry drop this living tree contains Is kindred blood and ran in Trojan veins O fly from this unhospitable shore Warn d by my fate for I am Polydore Here loads of lances in my blood embrued Again shoot upward by my blood renew d My falt ring tongue and shiv ring limbs declare My horror and in bristles rose my hair When Troy with Grecian arms was closely pent Old Priam fearful of the war s event This hapless Polydore to Thracia sent Loaded with gold he sent his darling far From noise and tumults and destructive war Committed to the faithless tyrant s care Who when he saw the pow r of Troy decline Forsook the weaker with the strong to join Broke ev ry bond of nature and of truth And murder d for his wealth the royal youth O sacred hunger of pernicious gold What bands of faith can impious lucre hold Now when my soul had shaken off her fears I call my father and the Trojan peers Relate the prodigies of Heav n require What he commands and their advice desire All vote to leave that execrable shore Polluted with the blood of Polydore But ere we sail his fun ral rites prepare Then to his ghost a tomb and altars rear In mournful pomp the matrons walk the round With baleful cypress and blue fillets crown d With eyes dejected and with hair unbound Then bowls of tepid milk and blood we pour And thrice invoke the soul of Polydore Now when the raging storms no longer reign But southern gales invite us to the main We launch our vessels with a prosp rous wind And leave the cities and the shores behind An island in th Aegaean main appears Neptune and wat ry Doris claim it theirs It floated once till Phoebus fix d the sides To rooted earth and now it braves the tides Here borne by friendly winds we come ashore With needful ease our weary limbs restore And the Sun s temple and his town adore Anius the priest and king with laurel crown d His hoary locks with purple fillets bound Who saw my sire the Delian shore ascend Came forth with eager haste to meet his friend Invites him to his palace and in sign Of ancient love their plighted hands they join Then to the temple of the god I went And thus before the shrine my vows present Give O Thymbraeus give a resting place To the sad relics of the Trojan race A seat secure a region of their own A lasting empire and a happier town Where shall we fix where shall our labors end Whom shall we follow and what fate attend Let not my pray rs a doubtful answer find But in clear auguries unveil thy mind Scarce had I said he shook the holy ground The laurels and the lofty hills around And from the tripos rush d a bellowing sound Prostrate we fell confess d the present god Who gave this answer from his dark abode Undaunted youths go seek that mother earth From which your ancestors derive their birth The soil that sent you forth her ancient race In her old bosom shall again embrace Thro the wide world th Aeneian house shall reign And children s children shall the crown sustain Thus Phoebus did our future fates disclose A mighty tumult mix d with joy arose All are concern d to know what place the god Assign d and where determin d our abode My father long revolving in his mind The race and lineage of the Trojan kind Thus answer d their demands Ye princes hear Your pleasing fortune and dispel your fear The fruitful isle of Crete well known to fame Sacred of old to Jove s imperial name In the mid ocean lies with large command And on its plains a hundred cities stand Another Ida rises there and we From thence derive our Trojan ancestry From thence as t is divulg d by certain fame To the Rhoetean shores old Teucrus came There fix d and there the seat of empire chose Ere Ilium and the Trojan tow rs arose In humble vales they built their soft abodes Till Cybele the mother of the gods With tinkling cymbals charm d th Idaean woods She secret rites and ceremonies taught And to the yoke the savage lions brought Let us the land which Heav n appoints explore Appease the winds and seek the Gnossian shore If Jove assists the passage of our fleet The third propitious dawn discovers Crete Thus having said the sacrifices laid On smoking altars to the gods he paid A bull to Neptune an oblation due Another bull to bright Apollo slew A milk white ewe the western winds to please And one coal black to calm the stormy seas Ere this a flying rumor had been spread That fierce Idomeneus from Crete was fled Expell d and exil d that the coast was free From foreign or domestic enemy We leave the Delian ports and put to sea By Naxos fam d for vintage make our way Then green Donysa pass and sail in sight Of Paros isle with marble quarries white We pass the scatter d isles of Cyclades That scarce distinguish d seem to stud the seas The shouts of sailors double near the shores They stretch their canvas and they ply their oars All hands aloft for Crete for Crete they cry And swiftly thro the foamy billows fly Full on the promis d land at length we bore With joy descending on the Cretan shore With eager haste a rising town I frame Which from the Trojan Pergamus I name The name itself was grateful I exhort To found their houses and erect a fort Our ships are haul d upon the yellow strand The youth begin to till the labor d land And I myself new marriages promote Give laws and dwellings I divide by lot When rising vapors choke the wholesome air And blasts of noisome winds corrupt the year The trees devouring caterpillars burn Parch d was the grass and blighted was the corn Nor scape the beasts for Sirius from on high With pestilential heat infects the sky My men some fall the rest in fevers fry Again my father bids me seek the shore Of sacred Delos and the god implore To learn what end of woes we might expect And to what clime our weary course direct T was night when ev ry creature void of cares The common gift of balmy slumber shares The statues of my gods for such they seem d Those gods whom I from flaming Troy redeem d Before me stood majestically bright Full in the beams of Phoebe s ent ring light Then thus they spoke and eas d my troubled mind What from the Delian god thou go saint to find He tells thee here and sends us to relate Those pow rs are we companions of thy fate Who from the burning town by thee were brought Thy fortune follow d and thy safety wrought Thro seas and lands as we thy steps attend So shall our care thy glorious race befriend An ample realm for thee thy fates ordain A town that o er the conquer d world shall reign Thou mighty walls for mighty nations build Nor let thy weary mind to labors yield But change thy seat for not the Delian god Nor we have giv n thee Crete for our abode A land there is Hesperia call d of old The soil is fruitful and the natives bold Th Oenotrians held it once by later fame Now call d Italia from the leader s name lasius there and Dardanus were born From thence we came and thither must return Rise and thy sire with these glad tidings greet Search Italy for Jove denies thee Crete Astonish d at their voices and their sight Nor were they dreams but visions of the night I saw I knew their faces and descried In perfect view their hair with fillets tied I started from my couch a clammy sweat On all my limbs and shiv ring body sate To heav n I lift my hands with pious haste And sacred incense in the flames I cast Thus to the gods their perfect honors done More cheerful to my good old sire I run And tell the pleasing news In little space He found his error of the double race Not as before he deem d deriv d from Crete No more deluded by the doubtful seat Then said O son turmoil d in Trojan fate Such things as these Cassandra did relate This day revives within my mind what she Foretold of Troy renew d in Italy And Latian lands but who could then have thought That Phrygian gods to Latium should be brought Or who believ d what mad Cassandra taught Now let us go where Phoebus leads the way He said and we with glad consent obey Forsake the seat and leaving few behind We spread our sails before the willing wind Now from the sight of land our galleys move With only seas around and skies above When o er our heads descends a burst of rain And night with sable clouds involves the main The ruffling winds the foamy billows raise The scatter d fleet is forc d to sev ral ways The face of heav n is ravish d from our eyes And in redoubled peals the roaring thunder flies Cast from our course we wander in the dark No stars to guide no point of land to mark Ev n Palinurus no distinction found Betwixt the night and day such darkness reign d around Three starless nights the doubtful navy strays Without distinction and three sunless days The fourth renews the light and from our shrouds We view a rising land like distant clouds The mountain tops confirm the pleasing sight And curling smoke ascending from their height The canvas falls their oars the sailors ply From the rude strokes the whirling waters fly At length I land upon the Strophades Safe from the danger of the stormy seas Those isles are compass d by th Ionian main The dire abode where the foul Harpies reign Forc d by the winged warriors to repair To their old homes and leave their costly fare Monsters more fierce offended Heav n ne er sent From hell s abyss for human punishment With virgin faces but with wombs obscene Foul paunches and with ordure still unclean With claws for hands and looks for ever lean We landed at the port and soon beheld Fat herds of oxen graze the flow ry field And wanton goats without a keeper stray d With weapons we the welcome prey invade Then call the gods for partners of our feast And Jove himself the chief invited guest We spread the tables on the greensward ground We feed with hunger and the bowls go round When from the mountain tops with hideous cry And clatt ring wings the hungry Harpies fly They snatch the meat defiling all they find And parting leave a loathsome stench behind Close by a hollow rock again we sit New dress the dinner and the beds refit Secure from sight beneath a pleasing shade Where tufted trees a native arbor made Again the holy fires on altars burn And once again the rav nous birds return Or from the dark recesses where they lie Or from another quarter of the sky With filthy claws their odious meal repeat And mix their loathsome ordures with their meat I bid my friends for vengeance then prepare And with the hellish nation wage the war They as commanded for the fight provide And in the grass their glitt ring weapons hide Then when along the crooked shore we hear Their clatt ring wings and saw the foes appear Misenus sounds a charge we take th alarm And our strong hands with swords and bucklers arm In this new kind of combat all employ Their utmost force the monsters to destroy In vain the fated skin is proof to wounds And from their plumes the shining sword rebounds At length rebuff d they leave their mangled prey And their stretch d pinions to the skies display Yet one remain d the messenger of Fate High on a craggy cliff Celaeno sate And thus her dismal errand did relate What not contented with our oxen slain Dare you with Heav n an

fulfill d Fierce famine is your lot for this misdeed Reduc d to grind the plates on which you feed She said and to the neighb ring forest flew Our courage fails us and our fears renew Hopeless to win by war to pray rs we fall And on th offended Harpies humbly call And whether gods or birds obscene they were Our vows for pardon and for peace prefer But old Anchises off ring sacrifice And lifting up to heav n his hands and eyes Ador d the greater gods Avert said he These omens render vain this prophecy And from th impending curse a pious people free Thus having said he bids us put to sea We loose from shore our haulsers and obey And soon with swelling sails pursue the wat ry way Amidst our course Zacynthian woods appear And next by rocky Neritos we steer We fly from Ithaca s detested shore And curse the land which dire Ulysses bore At length Leucate s cloudy top appears And the Sun s temple which the sailor fears Resolv d to breathe a while from labor past Our crooked anchors from the prow we cast And joyful to the little city haste Here safe beyond our hopes our vows we pay To Jove the guide and patron of our way The customs of our country we pursue And Trojan games on Actian shores renew Our youth their naked limbs besmear with oil And exercise the wrastlers noble toil Pleas d to have sail d so long before the wind And left so many Grecian towns behind The sun had now fulfill d his annual course And Boreas on the seas display d his force I fix d upon the temple s lofty door The brazen shield which vanquish d Abas bore The verse beneath my name and action speaks These arms Aeneas took from conqu ring Greeks Then I command to weigh the seamen ply Their sweeping oars the smoking billows fly The sight of high Phaeacia soon we lost And skimm d along Epirus rocky coast Then to Chaonia s port our course we bend And landed to Buthrotus heights ascend Here wondrous things were loudly blaz d fame How Helenus reviv d the Trojan name And reign d in Greece that Priam s captive son Succeeded Pyrrhus in his bed and throne And fair Andromache restor d by fate Once more was happy in a Trojan mate I leave my galleys riding in the port And long to see the new Dardanian court By chance the mournful queen before the gate Then solemniz d her former husband s fate Green altars rais d of turf with gifts she crown d And sacred priests in order stand around And thrice the name of hapless Hector sound The grove itself resembles Ida s wood And Simois seem d the well dissembled flood But when at nearer distance she beheld My shining armor and my Trojan shield Astonish d at the sight the vital heat Forsakes her limbs her veins no longer beat She faints she falls and scarce recov ring strength Thus with a falt ring tongue she speaks at length Are you alive O goddess born she said Or if a ghost then where is Hector s shade At this she cast a loud and frightful cry With broken words I made this brief reply All of me that remains appears in sight I live if living be to loathe the light No phantom but I drag a wretched life My fate resembling that of Hector s wife What have you suffer d since you lost your lord By what strange blessing are you now restor d Still are you Hector s or is Hector fled And his remembrance lost in Pyrrhus bed With eyes dejected in a lowly tone After a modest pause she thus begun O only happy maid of Priam s race Whom death deliver d from the foes embrace Commanded on Achilles tomb to die Not forc d like us to hard captivity Or in a haughty master s arms to lie In Grecian ships unhappy we were borne Endur d the victor s lust sustain d the scorn Thus I submitted to the lawless pride Of Pyrrhus more a handmaid than a bride Cloy d with possession he forsook my bed And Helen s lovely daughter sought to wed Then me to Trojan Helenus resign d And his two slaves in equal marriage join d Till young Orestes pierc d with deep despair And longing to redeem the promis d fair Before Apollo s altar slew the ravisher By Pyrrhus death the kingdom we regain d At least one half with Helenus remain d Our part from Chaon he Chaonia calls And names from Pergamus his rising walls But you what fates have landed on our coast What gods have sent you or what storms have toss d Does young Ascanius life and health enjoy Sav d from the ruins of unhappy Troy O tell me how his mother s loss he bears What hopes are promis d from his blooming years How much of Hector in his face appears She spoke and mix d her speech with mournful cries And fruitless tears came trickling from her eyes At length her lord descends upon the plain In pomp attended with a num rous train Receives his friends and to the city leads And tears of joy amidst his welcome sheds Proceeding on another Troy I see Or in less compass Troy s epitome A riv let by the name of Xanthus ran And I embrace the Scaean gate again My friends in porticoes were entertain d And feasts and pleasures thro the city reign d The tables fill d the spacious hall around And golden bowls with sparkling wine were crown d Two days we pass d in mirth till friendly gales Blown from the south supplied our swelling sails Then to the royal seer I thus began O thou who know saint beyond the reach of man The laws of heav n and what the stars decree Whom Phoebus taught unerring prophecy From his own tripod and his holy tree Skill d in the wing d inhabitants of air What auspices their notes and flights declare O say for all religious rites portend A happy voyage and a prosp rous end And ev ry power and omen of the sky Direct my course for destin d Italy But only dire Celaeno from the gods A dismal famine fatally forebodes O say what dangers I am first to shun What toils vanquish and what course to run The prophet first with sacrifice adores The greater gods their pardon then implores Unbinds the fillet from his holy head To Phoebus next my trembling steps he led Full of religious doubts and awful dread Then with his god possess d before the shrine These words proceeded from his mouth divine O goddess born for Heav n s appointed will With greater auspices of good than ill Foreshows thy voyage and thy course directs Thy fates conspire and Jove himself protects Of many things some few I shall explain Teach thee to shun the dangers of the main And how at length the promis d shore to gain The rest the fates from Helenus conceal And Juno s angry pow r forbids to tell First then that happy shore that seems so nigh Will far from your deluded wishes fly Long tracts of seas divide your hopes from Italy For you must cruise along Sicilian shores And stem the currents with your struggling oars Then round th Italian coast your navy steer And after this to Circe s island veer And last before your new foundations rise Must pass the Stygian lake and view the nether skies Now mark the signs of future ease and rest And bear them safely treasur d in thy breast When in the shady shelter of a wood And near the margin of a gentle flood Thou shalt behold a sow upon the ground With thirty sucking young encompass d round The dam and offspring white as falling snow These on thy city shall their name bestow And there shall end thy labors and thy woe Nor let the threaten d famine fright thy mind For Phoebus will assist and Fate the way will find Let not thy course to that ill coast be bent Which fronts from far th Epirian continent Those parts are all by Grecian foes possess d The salvage Locrians here the shores infest There fierce Idomeneus his city builds And guards with arms the Salentinian fields And on the mountain s brow Petilia stands Which Philoctetes with his troops commands Ev n when thy fleet is landed on the shore And priests with holy vows the gods adore Then with a purple veil involve your eyes Lest hostile faces blast the sacrifice These rites and customs to the rest commend That to your pious race they may descend When parted hence the wind that ready waits For Sicily shall bear you to the straits Where proud Pelorus opes a wider way Tack to the larboard and stand off to sea Veer starboard sea and land Th Italian shore And fair Sicilia s coast were one before An earthquake caus d the flaw the roaring tides The passage broke that land from land divides And where the lands retir d the rushing ocean rides Distinguish d by the straits on either hand Now rising cities in long order stand And fruitful fields so much can time invade The mold ring work that beauteous Nature made Far on the right her dogs foul Scylla hides Charybdis roaring on the left presides And in her greedy whirlpool sucks the tides Then spouts them from below with fury driv n The waves mount up and wash the face of heav n But Scylla from her den with open jaws The sinking vessel in her eddy draws Then dashes on the rocks A human face And virgin bosom hides her tail s disgrace Her parts obscene below the waves descend With dogs inclos d and in a dolphin end T is safer then to bear aloof to sea And coast Pachynus tho with more delay Than once to view misshapen Scylla near And the loud yell of wat ry wolves to hear Besides if faith to Helenus be due And if prophetic Phoebus tell me true Do not this precept of your friend forget Which therefore more than once I must repeat Above the rest great Juno s name adore Pay vows to Juno Juno s aid implore Let gifts be to the mighty queen design d And mollify with pray rs her haughty mind Thus at the length your passage shall be free And you shall safe descend on Italy Arriv d at Cumae when you view the flood Of black Avernus and the sounding wood The mad prophetic Sibyl you shall find Dark in a cave and on a rock reclin d She sings the fates and in her frantic fits The notes and names inscrib d to leafs commits What she commits to leafs in order laid Before the cavern s entrance are display d Unmov d they lie but if a blast of wind Without or vapors issue from behind The leafs are borne aloft in liquid air And she resumes no more her museful care Nor gathers from the rocks her scatter d verse Nor sets in order what the winds disperse Thus many not succeeding most upbraid The madness of the visionary maid And with loud curses leave the mystic shade Think it not loss of time a while to stay Tho thy companions chide thy long delay Tho summon d to the seas tho pleasing gales Invite thy course and stretch thy swelling sails But beg the sacred priestess to relate With willing words and not to write thy fate The fierce Italian people she will show And all thy wars and all thy future woe And what thou may saint avoid and what must undergo She shall direct thy course instruct thy mind And teach thee how the happy shores to find This is what Heav n allows me to relate Now part in peace pursue thy better fate And raise by strength of arms the Trojan state This when the priest with friendly voice declar d He gave me license and rich gifts prepar d Bounteous of treasure he supplied my want With heavy gold and polish d elephant Then Dodonaean caldrons put

and waving crest Nor was my sire forgotten nor my friends And large recruits he to my navy sends Men horses captains arms and warlike stores Supplies new pilots and new sweeping oars Meantime my sire commands to hoist our sails Lest we should lose the first auspicious gales The prophet bless d the parting crew and last With words like these his ancient friend embrac d Old happy man the care of

For I with useless words prolong your stay When southern gales have summon d you away Nor less the queen our parting thence deplor d Nor was less bounteous than her Trojan lord A noble present to my son she brought A robe with flow rs on golden tissue wrought A phrygian vest and loads with gifts beside Of precious texture and of Asian pride Accept she said these monuments of love Which in my youth with happier hands I wove Regard these trifles for the giver s sake T is the last present Hector s wife can make Thou call saint my lost Astyanax to mind In thee his features and his form I find His eyes so sparkled with a lively flame Such were his motions such was all his frame And ah had Heav n so pleas d his years had been the same With tears I took my last adieu and said Your fortune happy pair already made Leaves you no farther wish My diff rent state Avoiding one incurs another fate To you a quiet seat the gods allow You have no shores to search no seas to plow Nor fields of flying Italy to chase Deluding visions and a vain embrace You see another Simois and enjoy The labor of your hands another Troy With better auspice than her ancient tow rs And less obnoxious to the Grecian pow rs If e er the gods whom I with vows adore Conduct my steps to Tiber s happy shore If ever I ascend the Latian throne And build a city I may call my own As both of us our birth from Troy derive So let our kindred lines in concord live And both in acts of equal friendship strive Our fortunes good or bad shall be the same The double Troy shall differ but in name That what we now begin may never end But long to late posterity descend Near the Ceraunian rocks our course we bore The shortest passage to th Italian shore Now had the sun withdrawn his radiant light And hills were hid in dusky shades of night We land and on the bosom Of the ground A safe retreat and a bare lodging found Close by the shore we lay the sailors keep Their watches and the rest securely sleep The night proceeding on with silent pace Stood in her noon and view d with equal face Her steepy rise and her declining race Then wakeful Palinurus rose to spy The face of heav n and the nocturnal sky And listen d ev ry breath of air to try Observes the stars and notes their sliding course The Pleiads Hyads and their wat ry force And both the Bears is careful to behold And bright Orion arm d with burnish d gold Then when he saw no threat ning tempest nigh But a sure promise of a settled sky He gave the sign to weigh we break our sleep Forsake the pleasing shore and plow the deep And now the rising morn with rosy light Adorns the skies and puts the stars to flight When we from far like bluish mists descry The hills and then the plains of Italy Achates first pronounc d the joyful sound Then Italy the cheerful crew rebound My sire Anchises crown d a cup with wine And off ring thus implor d the pow rs divine Ye gods presiding over lands and seas And you who raging winds and waves appease Breathe on our swelling sails a prosp rous wind And smooth our passage to the port assign d The gentle gales their flagging force renew And now the happy harbor is in view Minerva s temple then salutes our sight Plac d as a landmark on the mountain s height We furl our sails and turn the prows to shore The curling waters round the galleys roar The land lies open to the raging east Then bending like a bow with rocks compress d Shuts out the storms the winds and waves complain And vent their malice on the cliffs in vain The port lies hid within on either side Two tow ring rocks the narrow mouth divide The temple which aloft we view d before To distance flies and seems to shun the shore Scarce landed the first omens I beheld Were four white steeds that cropp d the flow ry field War war is threaten d from this foreign ground My father cried where warlike steeds are found Yet since reclaim d to chariots they submit And bend to stubborn yokes and champ the bit Peace may succeed to war Our way we bend To Pallas and the sacred hill ascend There prostrate to the fierce virago pray Whose temple was the landmark of our way Each with a Phrygian mantle veil d his head And all commands of Helenus obey d And pious rites to Grecian Juno paid These dues perform d we stretch our sails and stand To sea forsaking that suspected land From hence Tarentum s bay appears in view For Hercules renown d if fame be true Just opposite Lacinian Juno stands Caulonian tow rs and Scylacaean strands For shipwrecks fear d Mount Aetna thence we spy Known by the smoky flames which cloud the sky Far off we hear the waves with surly sound Invade the rocks the rocks their groans rebound The billows break upon the sounding strand And roll the rising tide impure with sand Then thus Anchises in experience old T is that Charybdis which the seer foretold And those the promis d rocks Bear off to sea With haste the frighted mariners obey First Palinurus to the larboard veer d Then all the fleet by his example steer d To heav n aloft on ridgy waves we ride Then down to hell descend when they divide And thrice our galleys knock d the stony ground And thrice the hollow rocks return d the sound And thrice we saw the stars that stood with dews around The flagging winds forsook us with the sun And wearied on Cyclopian shores we run The port capacious and secure from wind Is to the foot of thund ring Aetna join d By turns a pitchy cloud she rolls on high By turns hot embers from her entrails fly And flakes of mounting flames that lick the sky Oft from her bowels massy rocks are thrown And shiver d by the force come piecemeal down Oft liquid lakes of burning sulphur flow Fed from the fiery springs that boil below Enceladus they say transfix d by Jove With blasted limbs came tumbling from above And where he fell th avenging father drew This flaming hill and on his body threw As often as he turns his weary sides He shakes the solid isle and smoke the heavens hides In shady woods we pass the tedious night Where bellowing sounds and groans our souls affright Of which no cause is offer d to the sight For not one star was kindled in the sky Nor could the moon her borrow d light supply For misty clouds involv d the firmament The stars were muffled and the moon was pent Scarce had the rising sun the day reveal d Scarce had his heat the pearly dews dispell d When from the woods there bolts before our sight Somewhat betwixt a mortal and a sprite So thin so ghastly meager and so wan So bare of flesh he scarce resembled man This thing all tatter d seem d from far t implore Our pious aid and pointed to the shore We look behind then view his shaggy beard His clothes were tagg d with thorns and filth his limbs besmear d The rest in mien in habit and in face Appear d a Greek and such indeed he was He cast on us from far a frightful view Whom soon for Trojans and for foes he knew Stood still and paus d then all at once began To stretch his limbs and trembled as he ran Soon as approach d upon his knees he falls And thus with tears and sighs for pity calls Now by the pow rs above and what we share From Nature s common gift this vital air O Trojans take me hence I beg no more But bear me far from this unhappy shore T is true I am a Greek and farther own Among your foes besieg d th imperial town For such demerits if my death be due No more for this abandon d life I sue This only favor let my tears obtain To throw me headlong in the rapid main Since nothing more than death my crime demands I die content to die by human hands He said and on his knees my knees embrac d I bade him boldly tell his fortune past His present state his lineage and his name Th occasion of his fears and whence he came The good Anchises rais d him with his hand Who thus encourag d answer d our demand From Ithaca my native soil I came To Troy and Achaemenides my name Me my poor father with Ulysses sent O had I stay d with poverty content But fearful for themselves my countrymen Left me forsaken in the Cyclops den The cave tho large was dark the dismal floor Was pav d with mangled limbs and putrid gore Our monstrous host of more than human size Erects his head and stares within the skies Bellowing his voice and horrid is his hue Ye gods remove this plague from mortal view The joints of slaughter d wretches are his food And for his wine he quaffs the streaming blood These eyes beheld when with his spacious hand He seiz d two captives of our Grecian band Stretch d on his back he dash d against the stones Their broken bodies and their crackling bones With spouting blood the purple pavement swims While the dire glutton grinds the trembling limbs Not unreveng d Ulysses bore their fate Nor thoughtless of his own unhappy state For gorg d with flesh and drunk with human wine While fast asleep the giant lay supine Snoring aloud and belching from his maw His indigested foam and morsels raw We pray we cast the lots and then surround The monstrous body stretch d along the ground Each as he could approach him lends a hand To bore his eyeball with a flaming brand Beneath his frowning forehead lay his eye For only one did the vast frame supply But that a globe so large his front it fill d Like the sun s disk or like a Grecian shield The stroke succeeds and down the pupil bends This vengeance follow d for our slaughter d friends But haste unhappy wretches haste to fly Your cables cut and on your oars rely Such and so vast as Polypheme appears A hundred more this hated island bears Like him in caves they shut their woolly sheep Like him their herds on tops of mountains keep Like him with mighty strides they stalk from steep to steep And now three moons their sharpen d horns renew Since thus in woods and wilds obscure from view I drag my loathsome days with mortal fright And in deserted caverns lodge by night Oft from the rocks a dreadful prospect see Of the huge Cyclops like a walking tree From far I hear his thund ring voice resound And trampling feet that shake the solid ground Cornels and salvage berries of the wood And roots and herbs have been my meager food While all around my longing eyes I cast I saw your happy ships appear at last On those I fix d my hopes to these I run T is all I ask this cruel race to shun What other death you please yourselves bestow Scarce had he said when on the mountain s brow We saw the giant shepherd stalk before His following flock and leading to the shore A monstrous bulk deform d depriv d of sight His staff a trunk of pine to guide his steps aright His pond rous whistle from his neck descends His woolly care their pensive lord attends This only solace his hard fortune sends Soon as he reach d the shore and touch d the waves From his bor d eye the gutt ring blood he laves He gnash d his teeth and groan d thro seas he strides And scarce the topmost billows touch d his sides Seiz d with a sudden fear we run to sea The cables cut and silent haste away The well deserving stranger entertain Then buckling to the work our oars divide the main The giant harken d to the dashing sound But when our vessels out of reach he found He strided onward and in vain essay d Th Ionian deep and durst no farther wade With that he roar d aloud the dreadful cry Shakes earth and air and seas the billows fly Before the bellowing noise to distant Italy The neigh ring Aetna trembling all around The winding caverns echo to the sound His brother Cyclops hear the yelling roar And rushing down the mountains crowd the shore We saw their stern distorted looks from far And one eyed glance that vainly threaten d war A dreadful council with their heads on high The misty clouds about their foreheads fly Not yielding to the tow ring tree of Jove Or tallest cypress of Diana s grove New pangs of mortal fear our minds assail We tug at ev ry oar and hoist up ev ry sail And take th advantage of the friendly gale Forewarn d by Helenus we strive to shun Charybdis gulf nor dare to Scylla run An equal fate on either side appears We tacking to the left are free from fears For from Pelorus point the North arose And drove us back where swift Pantagias flows His rocky mouth we pass and make our way By Thapsus and Megara s winding bay This passage Achaemenides had shown Tracing the course which he before had run Right o er against Plemmyrium s wat ry strand There lies an isle once call d th Ortygian land Alpheus as old fame reports has found From Greece a secret passage under ground By love to beauteous Arethusa led And mingling here they roll in the same sacred bed As Helenus enjoin d we next adore Diana s name protectress of the shore With prosp rous gales we pass the quiet sounds Of still Elorus and his fruitful bounds Then doubling Cape Pachynus we survey The rocky shore extended to the sea The town of Camarine from far we see And fenny lake undrain d by fate s decree In sight of the Geloan fields we pass And the large walls where mighty Gela was Then Agragas with lofty summits crown d Long for the race of warlike steeds renown d We pass d Selinus and the palmy land And widely shun the Lilybaean strand Unsafe for secret rocks and moving sand At length on shore the weary fleet arriv d Which Drepanum s unhappy port receiv d Here after endless labors often toss d By raging storms and driv n on ev ry coast My dear dear father spent with age I lost Ease of my cares and solace of my pain Sav d thro a thousand toils but sav d in vain The prophet who my future woes reveal d Yet this the greatest and the worst conceal d And dire Celaeno whose foreboding skill Denounc d all else was silent of the ill This my last labor was Some friendly god From thence convey d us to your blest abode Thus to the list ning queen the royal guest His wand ring course and all his toils express d And here concluding he retir d to rest BOOK IV But anxious cares already seiz d the queen She fed within her veins a flame unseen The hero s valor acts and birth inspire Her soul with love and fan the secret fire His words his looks imprinted in her heart Improve the passion and increase the smart Now when the purple morn had chas d away The dewy shadows and restor d the day Her sister first with early care she sought And thus in mournful accents eas d her thought My dearest Anna what new dreams affright My lab ring soul what visions of the night Disturb my quiet and distract my breast With strange ideas of our Trojan guest His worth his actions and majestic air A man descended from the gods declare Fear ever argues a degenerate kind His birth is well asserted by his mind Then what he suffer d when by Fate betray d What brave attempts for falling Troy he made Such were his looks so gracefully he spoke That were I not resolv d against the yoke Of hapless marriage never to be curst With second love so fatal was my first To this one error I might yield again For since Sichaeus was untimely slain This only man is able to subvert The fix d foundations of my stubborn heart And to confess my frailty to my shame Somewhat I find within if not the same Too like the sparkles of my former flame But first let yawning earth a passage rend And let me thro the dark abyss descend First let avenging Jove with flames from high Drive down this body to the nether sky Condemn d with ghosts in endless night to lie Before I break the plighted faith I gave No he who had my vows shall ever have For whom I lov d on earth I worship in the grave She said the tears ran gushing from her eyes And stopp d her speech Her sister thus replies O dearer than the vital air I breathe Will you to grief your blooming years bequeath Condemn d to waste in woes your lonely life Without the joys of mother or of wife Think you these tears this pompous train of woe Are known or valued by the ghosts below I grant that while your sorrows yet were green It well became a woman and a queen The vows of Tyrian princes to neglect To scorn Hyarbas and his love reject With all the Libyan lords of mighty name But will you fight against a pleasing flame This little spot of land which Heav n bestows On ev ry side is hemm d with warlike foes Gaetulian cities here are spread around And fierce Numidians there your frontiers bound Here lies a barren waste of thirsty land And there the Syrtes raise the moving sand Barcaean troops besiege the narrow shore And from the sea Pygmalion threatens more Propitious Heav n and gracious Juno lead This wand ring navy to your needful aid How will your empire spread your city rise From such a union and with such allies Implore the favor of the pow rs above And leave the conduct of the rest to love Continue still your hospitable way And still invent occasions of their stay Till storms and winter winds shall cease to threat And planks and oars repair their shatter d fleet These words which from a friend and sister came With ease resolv d the scruples of her fame And added fury to the kindled flame Inspir d with hope the project they pursue On ev ry altar sacrifice renew A chosen ewe of two years old they pay To Ceres Bacchus and the God of Day Preferring Juno s pow r for Juno ties The nuptial knot and makes the marriage joys The beauteous queen before her altar stands And holds the golden goblet in her hands A milk white heifer she with flow rs adorns And pours the ruddy wine betwixt her horns And while the priests with pray r the gods invoke She feeds their altars with Sabaean smoke With hourly care the sacrifice renews And anxiously the panting entrails views What priestly rites alas what pious art What vows avail to cure a bleeding heart A gentle fire she feeds within her veins Where the soft god secure in silence reigns Sick with desire and seeking him she loves From street to street the raving Dido roves So when the watchful shepherd from the blind Wounds with a random shaft the careless hind Distracted with her pain she flies the woods Bounds o er the lawn and seeks the silent floods With fruitless care for still the fatal dart Sticks in her side and rankles in her heart And now she leads the Trojan chief along The lofty walls amidst the busy throng Displays her Tyrian wealth and rising town Which love without his labor makes his own This pomp she shows to tempt her wand ring guest Her falt ring tongue forbids to speak the rest When day declines and feasts renew the night Still on his face she feeds her famish d sight She longs again to hear the prince relate His own adventures and the Trojan fate He tells it o er and o er but still in vain For still she begs to hear it once again The hearer on the speaker s mouth depends And thus the tragic story never ends Then when they part when Phoebe s paler light Withdraws and falling stars to sleep invite She last remains when ev ry guest is gone Sits on the bed he press d and sighs alone Absent her absent hero sees and hears Or in her bosom young Ascanius bears And seeks the father s image in the child If love by likeness might be so beguil d Meantime the rising tow rs are at a stand No labors exercise the youthful band Nor use of arts nor toils of arms they know The mole is left unfinish d to the foe The mounds the works the walls neglected lie Short of their promis d heighth that seem d to threat the sky But when imperial Juno from above Saw Dido fetter d in the chains of love Hot with the venom which her veins inflam d And by no sense of shame to be reclaim d With soothing words to Venus she begun High praises endless honors you have won And mighty trophies with your worthy son Two gods a silly woman have undone Nor am I ignorant you both suspect This rising city which my hands erect But shall celestial discord never cease T is better ended in a lasting peace You stand possess d of all your soul desir d Poor Dido with consuming love is fir d Your Trojan with my Tyrian let us join So Dido shall be yours Aeneas mine One common kingdom one united line Eliza shall a Dardan lord obey And lofty Carthage for a dow r convey Then Venus who her hidden fraud descried Which would the scepter of the world misguide To Libyan shores thus artfully replied Who but a fool would wars with Juno choose And such alliance and such gifts refuse If Fortune with our joint desires comply The doubt is all from Jove and destiny Lest he forbid with absolute command To mix the people in one common land Or will the Trojan and the Tyrian line In lasting leagues and sure succession join But you the partner of his bed and throne May move his mind my wishes are your own Mine said imperial Juno be the care Time urges now to perfect this affair Attend my counsel and the secret share When next the Sun his rising light displays And gilds the world below with purple rays The queen Aeneas and the Tyrian court Shall to the shady woods for sylvan game resort There while the huntsmen pitch their toils around And cheerful horns from side to side resound A pitchy cloud shall cover all the plain With hail and thunder and tempestuous rain The fearful train shall take their speedy flight Dispers d and all involv d in gloomy night One cave a grateful shelter shall afford To the fair princess and the Trojan lord I will myself the bridal bed prepare If you to bless the nuptials will be there So shall their loves be crown d with due delights And Hymen shall be present at the rites The Queen of Love consents and closely smiles At her vain project and discover d wiles The rosy morn was risen from the main And horns and hounds awake the princely train They issue early thro the city gate Where the more wakeful huntsmen ready wait With nets and toils and darts beside the force Of Spartan dogs and swift Massylian horse The Tyrian peers and officers of state For the slow queen in antechambers wait Her lofty courser in the court below Who his majestic rider seems to know Proud of his purple trappings paws the ground And champs the golden bit and spreads the foam around The queen at length appears on either hand The brawny guards in martial order stand A flow r d simar with golden fringe she wore And at her back a golden quiver bore Her flowing hair a golden caul restrains A golden clasp the Tyrian robe sustains Then young Ascanius with a sprightly grace Leads on the Trojan youth to view the chase But far above the rest in beauty shines The great Aeneas the troop he joins Like fair Apollo when he leaves the frost Of wint ry Xanthus and the Lycian coast When to his native Delos he resorts Ordains the dances and renews the sports Where painted Scythians mix d with Cretan bands Before the joyful altars join their hands Himself on Cynthus walking sees below The merry madness of the sacred show Green wreaths of bays his length of hair inclose A golden fillet binds his awful brows His quiver sounds not less the prince is seen In manly presence or in lofty mien Now had they reach d the hills and storm d the seat Of salvage beasts in dens their last retreat The cry pursues the mountain goats they bound From rock to rock and keep the craggy ground Quite otherwise the stags a trembling train In herds unsingled scour the dusty plain And a long chase in open view maintain The glad Ascanius as his courser guides Spurs thro the vale and these and those outrides His horse s flanks and sides are forc d to feel The clanking lash and goring of the steel Impatiently he views the feeble prey Wishing some nobler beast to cross his way And rather would the tusky boar attend Or see the tawny lion downward bend Meantime the gath ring clouds obscure the skies From pole to pole the forky lightning flies The rattling thunders roll and Juno pours A wintry deluge down and sounding show rs The company dispers d to converts ride And seek the homely cots or mountain s hollow side The rapid rains descending from the hills To rolling torrents raise the creeping rills The queen and prince as love or fortune guides One common cavern in her bosom hides Then first the trembling earth the signal gave And flashing fires enlighten all the cave Hell from below and Juno from above And howling nymphs were conscious of their love From this ill omen d hour in time arose Debate and death and all succeeding woes The queen whom sense of honor could not move No longer made a secret of her love But call d it marriage by that specious name To veil the crime and sanctify the shame The loud report thro Libyan cities goes Fame the great ill from small beginnings grows Swift from the first and ev ry moment brings New vigor to her flights new pinions to her wings Soon grows the pigmy to gigantic size Her feet on earth her forehead in the skies Inrag d against the gods revengeful Earth Produc d her last of the Titanian birth Swift is her walk more swift her winged haste A monstrous phantom horrible and vast As many plumes as raise her lofty flight So many piercing eyes inlarge her sight Millions of opening mouths to Fame belong And ev ry mouth is furnish d with a tongue And round with list ning ears the flying plague is hung She fills the peaceful universe with cries No slumbers ever close her wakeful eyes By day from lofty tow rs her head she shews And spreads thro trembling crowds disastrous news With court informers haunts and royal spies Things done relates not done she feigns and mingles truth with lies Talk is her business and her chief delight To tell of prodigies and cause affright She fills the people s ears with Dido s name Who lost to honor and the sense of shame Admits into her throne and nuptial bed A wand ring guest who from his country fled Whole days with him she passes in delights And wastes in luxury long winter nights Forgetful of her fame and royal trust Dissolv d in ease abandon d to her lust The goddess widely spreads the loud report And flies at length to King Hyarba s court When first possess d with this unwelcome news Whom did he not of men and gods accuse This prince from ravish d Garamantis born A hundred temples did with spoils adorn In Ammon s honor his celestial sire A hundred altars fed with wakeful fire And thro his vast dominions priests ordain d Whose watchful care these holy rites maintain d The gates and columns were with garlands crown d And blood of victim beasts enrich d the ground He when he heard a fugitive could move The Tyrian princess who disdain d his love His breast with fury burn d his eyes with fire Mad with despair impatient with desire Then on the sacred altars pouring wine He thus with pray rs implor d his sire divine Great Jove propitious to the Moorish race Who feast on painted beds with off rings grace Thy temples and adore thy pow r divine With blood of victims and with sparkling wine Seest thou not this or do we fear in vain Thy boasted thunder and thy thoughtless reign Do thy broad hands the forky lightnings lance Thine are the bolts or the blind work of chance A wand ring woman builds within our state A little town bought at an easy rate She pays me homage and my grants allow A narrow space of Libyan lands to plow Yet scorning me by passion blindly led Admits a banish d Trojan to her bed And now this other Paris with his train Of conquer d cowards must in Afric reign Whom what they are their looks and garb confess Their locks with oil perfum d their Lydian dress He takes the spoil enjoys the princely dame And I rejected I adore an empty name His vows in haughty terms he thus preferr d And held his altar s horns The mighty Thund rer heard Then cast his eyes on Carthage where he found The lustful pair in lawless pleasure drown d Lost in their loves insensible of shame And both forgetful of their better fame He calls Cyllenius and the god attends By whom his menacing command he sends Go mount the western winds and cleave the sky Then with a swift descent to Carthage fly There find the Trojan chief who wastes his days In slothful riot and inglorious ease Nor minds the future city giv n by fate To him this message from my mouth relate Not so fair Venus hop d when twice she won Thy life with pray rs nor promis d such a son Hers was a hero destin d to command A martial race and rule the Latian land Who should his ancient line from Teucer draw And on the conquer d world impose the law If glory cannot move a mind so mean Nor future praise from fading pleasure wean Yet why should he defraud his son of fame And grudge the Romans their immortal name What are his vain designs what hopes he more From his long ling ring on a hostile shore Regardless to redeem his honor lost And for his race to gain th Ausonian coast Bid him with speed the Tyrian court forsake With this command the slumb ring warrior wake Hermes obeys with golden pinions binds His flying feet and mounts the western winds And whether o er the seas or earth he flies With rapid force they bear him down the skies But first he grasps within his awful hand The mark of sov reign pow r his magic wand With this he draws the ghosts from hollow graves With this he drives them down the Stygian waves With this he seals in sleep the wakeful sight And eyes tho clos d in death restores to light Thus arm d the god begins his airy race And drives the racking clouds along the liquid space Now sees the tops of Atlas as he flies Whose brawny back supports the starry skies Atlas whose head with piny forests crown d Is beaten by the winds with foggy vapors bound Snows hide his shoulders from beneath his chin The founts of rolling streams their race begin A beard of ice on his large breast depends Here pois d upon his wings the god descends Then rested thus he from the tow ring height Plung d downward with precipitated flight Lights on the seas and skims along the flood As waterfowl who seek their fishy food Less and yet less to distant prospect show By turns they dance aloft and dive below Like these the steerage of his wings he plies And near the surface of the water flies Till having pass d the seas and cross d the sands He clos d his wings and stoop d on Libyan lands Where shepherds once were hous d in homely sheds Now tow rs within the clouds advance their heads Arriving there he found the Trojan prince New ramparts raising for the town s defense A purple scarf with gold embroider d o er Queen Dido s gift about his waist he wore A sword with glitt ring gems diversified For ornament not use hung idly by his side Then thus with winged words the god began Resuming his own shape Degenerate man Thou woman s property what mak saint thou here These foreign walls and Tyrian tow rs to rear Forgetful of thy own All pow rful Jove Who sways the world below and heav n above Has sent me down with this severe command What means thy ling ring in the Libyan land If glory cannot move a mind so mean Nor future praise from flitting pleasure wean Regard the fortunes of thy rising heir The promis d crown let young Ascanius wear To whom th Ausonian scepter and the state Of Rome s imperial name is ow d by fate So spoke the god and speaking took his flight Involv d in clouds and vanish d out of sight The pious prince was seiz d with sudden fear Mute was his tongue and upright stood his hair Revolving in his mind the stern command He longs to fly and loathes the charming land What should he say or how should he begin What course alas remains to steer between Th offended lover and the pow rful queen This way and that he turns his anxious mind And all expedients tries and none can find Fix d on the deed but doubtful of the means After long thought to this advice he leans Three chiefs he calls commands them to repair The fleet and ship their men with silent care Some plausible pretense he bids them find To color what in secret he design d Himself meantime the softest hours would choose Before the love sick lady heard the news And move her tender mind by slow degrees To suffer what the sov reign pow r decrees Jove will inspire him when and what to say They hear with pleasure and with haste obey But soon the queen perceives the thin disguise What arts can blind a jealous woman s eyes She was the first to find the secret fraud Before the fatal news was blaz d abroad Love the first motions of the lover hears Quick to presage and ev n in safety fears Nor impious Fame was wanting to report The ships repair d the Trojans thick resort And purpose to forsake the Tyrian court Frantic with fear impatient of the wound And impotent of mind she roves the city round Less wild the Bacchanalian dames appear When from afar their nightly god they hear And howl about the hills and shake the wreathy spear At length she finds the dear perfidious man Prevents his form d excuse and thus began Base and ungrateful could you hope to fly And undiscover d scape a lover s eye Nor could my kindness your compassion move Nor plighted vows nor dearer bands of love Or is the death of a despairing queen Not worth preventing tho too well foreseen Ev n when the wintry winds command your stay You dare the tempests and defy the sea False as you are suppose you were not bound To lands unknown and foreign coasts to sound Were Troy restor d and Priam s happy reign Now durst you tempt for Troy the raging main See whom you fly am I the foe you shun Now by those holy vows so late begun By this right hand since I have nothing more To challenge but the faith you gave before I beg you by these tears too truly shed By the new pleasures of our nuptial bed If ever Dido when you most were kind Were pleasing in your eyes or touch d your mind By these my pray rs if pray rs may yet have place Pity the fortunes of a falling race For you I have provok d a tyrant s hate Incens d the Libyan and the Tyrian state For you alone I suffer in my fame Bereft of honor and expos d to shame Whom have I now to trust ungrateful guest That only name remains of all the rest What have I left or whither can I fly Must I attend Pygmalion s cruelty Or till Hyarba shall in triumph lead A queen that proudly scorn d his proffer d bed Had you deferr d at least your hasty flight And left behind some pledge of our delight Some babe to bless the mother s mournful sight Some young Aeneas to supply your place Whose features might express his father s face I should not then complain to live bereft Of all my husband or be wholly left Here paus d the queen Unmov d he holds his eyes By Jove s command nor suffer d love to rise Tho heaving in his heart and thus at length replies Fair queen you never can enough repeat Your boundless favors or I own my debt Nor can my mind forget Eliza s name While vital breath inspires this mortal frame This only let me speak in my defense I never hop d a secret flight from hence Much less pretended to the lawful claim Of sacred nuptials or a husband s name For if indulgent Heav n would leave me free And not submit my life to fate s decree My choice would lead me to the Trojan shore Those relics to review their dust adore And Priam s ruin d palace to restore But now the Delphian oracle commands And fate invites me to the Latian lands That is the promis d place to which I steer And all my vows are terminated there If you a Tyrian and a stranger born With walls and tow rs a Libyan town adorn Why may not we like you a foreign race Like you seek shelter in a foreign place As often as the night obscures the skies With humid shades or twinkling stars arise Anchises angry ghost in dreams appears Chides my delay and fills my soul with fears And young Ascanius justly may complain Of his defrauded and destin d reign Ev n now the herald of the gods appear d Waking I saw him and his message heard From Jove he came commission d heav nly bright With radiant beams and manifest to sight The sender and the sent I both attest These walls he enter d and those words express d Fair queen oppose not what the gods command Forc d by my fate I leave your happy land Thus while he spoke already she began With sparkling eyes to view the guilty man From head to foot survey d his person o er Nor longer these outrageous threats forebore False as thou art and more than false forsworn Not sprung from noble blood nor goddess born But hewn from harden d entrails of a rock And rough Hyrcanian tigers gave thee suck Why should I fawn what have I worse to fear Did he once look or lent a list ning ear Sigh d when I sobb d or shed one kindly tear All symptoms of a base ungrateful mind So foul that which is worse tis hard to find Of man s injustice why should I complain The gods and Jove himself behold in vain Triumphant treason yet no thunder flies Nor Juno views my wrongs with equal eyes Faithless is earth and faithless are the skies Justice is fled and Truth is now no more I sav d the shipwrack d exile on my shore With needful food his hungry Trojans fed I took the traitor to my throne and bed Fool that I was t is little to repeat The rest I stor d and rigg d his ruin d fleet I rave I rave A god s command he pleads And makes Heav n accessary to his deeds Now Lycian lots and now the Delian god Now Hermes is employ d from Jove s abode To warn him hence as if the peaceful state Of heav nly pow rs were touch d with human fate But go thy flight no longer I detain Go seek thy promis d kingdom thro the main Yet if the heav ns will hear my pious vow The faithless waves not half so false as thou Or secret sands shall sepulchers afford To thy proud vessels and their perjur d lord Then shalt thou call on injur d Dido s name Dido shall come in a black sulph ry flame When death has once dissolv d her mortal frame Shall smile to see the traitor vainly weep Her angry ghost arising from the deep Shall haunt thee waking and disturb thy sleep At least my shade thy punishment shall know And Fame shall spread the pleasing news below Abruptly here she stops then turns away Her loathing eyes and shuns the sight of day Amaz d he stood revolving in his mind What speech to frame and what excuse to find Her fearful maids their fainting mistress led And softly laid her on her ivory bed But good Aeneas tho he much desir d To give that pity which her grief requir d Tho much he mourn d and labor d with his love Resolv d at length obeys the will of Jove Reviews his forces they with early care Unmoor their vessels and for sea prepare The fleet is soon afloat in all its pride And well calk d galleys in the harbor ride Then oaks for oars they fell d or as they stood Of its green arms despoil d the growing wood Studious of flight The beach is cover d o er With Trojan bands that blacken all the shore On ev ry side are seen descending down Thick swarms of soldiers loaden from the town Thus in battalia march embodied ants Fearful of winter and of future wants T invade the corn and to their cells convey The plunder d forage of their yellow prey The sable troops along the narrow tracks Scarce bear the weighty burthen on their backs Some set their shoulders to the pond rous grain Some guard the spoil some lash the lagging train All ply their sev ral tasks and equal toil sustain What pangs the tender breast of Dido tore When from the tow r she saw the cover d shore And heard the shouts of sailors from afar Mix d with the murmurs of the wat ry war All pow rful Love what changes canst thou cause In human hearts subjected to thy laws Once more her haughty soul the tyrant bends To pray rs and mean submissions she descends No female arts or aids she left untried Nor counsels unexplor d before she died Look Anna look the Trojans crowd to sea They spread their canvas and their anchors weigh The shouting crew their ships with garlands bind Invoke the sea gods and invite the wind Could I have thought this threat ning blow so near My tender soul had been forewarn d to bear But do not you my last request deny With yon perfidious man your int rest try And bring me news if I must live or die You are his fav rite you alone can find The dark recesses of his inmost mind In all his trusted secrets you have part And know the soft approaches to his heart Haste then and humbly seek my haughty foe Tell him I did not with the Grecians go Nor did my fleet against his friends employ Nor swore the ruin of unhappy Troy Nor mov d with hands profane his father s dust Why should he then reject a suit so just Whom does he shun and whither would he fly Can he this last this only pray r deny Let him at least his dang rous flight delay Wait better winds and hope a calmer sea The nuptials he disclaims I urge no more Let him pursue the promis d Latian shore A short delay is all I ask him now A pause of grief an interval from woe Till my soft soul be temper d to sustain Accustom d sorrows and inur d to pain If you in pity grant this one request My death shall glut the hatred of his breast This mournful message pious Anna bears And seconds with her own her sister s tears But all her arts are still employ d in vain Again she comes and is refus d again His harden d heart nor pray rs nor threat nings move Fate and the god had stopp d his ears to love As when the winds their airy quarrel try Justling from ev ry quarter of the sky This way and that the mountain oak they bend His boughs they shatter and his branches rend With leaves and falling mast they spread the ground The hollow valleys echo to the sound Unmov d the royal plant their fury mocks Or shaken clings more closely to the rocks Far as he shoots his tow ring head on high So deep in earth his fix d foundations lie No less a storm the Trojan hero bears Thick messages and loud complaints he hears And bandied words still beating on his ears Sighs groans and tears proclaim his inward pains But the firm purpose of his heart remains The wretched queen pursued by cruel fate Begins at length the light of heav n to hate And loathes to live Then dire portents she sees To hasten on the death her soul decrees Strange to relate for when before the shrine She pours in sacrifice the purple wine The purple wine is turn d to putrid blood And the white offer d milk converts to mud This dire presage to her alone reveal d From all and ev n her sister she conceal d A marble temple stood within the grove Sacred to death and to her murther d love That honor d chapel she had hung around With snowy fleeces and with garlands crown d Oft when she visited this lonely dome Strange voices issued from her husband s tomb She thought she heard him summon her away Invite her to his grave and chide her stay Hourly t is heard when with a boding note The solitary screech owl strains her throat And on a chimney s top or turret s height With songs obscene disturbs the silence of the night Besides old prophecies augment her fears And stern Aeneas in her dreams appears Disdainful as by day she seems alone To wander in her sleep thro ways unknown Guideless and dark or in a desart plain To seek her subjects and to seek in vain Like Pentheus when distracted with his fear He saw two suns and double Thebes appear Or mad Orestes when his mother s ghost Full in his face infernal torches toss d And shook her snaky locks he shuns the sight Flies o er the stage surpris d with mortal fright The Furies guard the door and intercept his flight Now sinking underneath a load of grief From death alone she seeks her last relief The time and means resolv d within her breast She to her mournful sister thus address d Dissembling hope her cloudy front she clears And a false vigor in her eyes appears Rejoice she said Instructed from above My lover I shall gain or lose my love Nigh rising Atlas next the falling sun Long tracts of Ethiopian climates run There a Massylian priestess I have found Honor d for age for magic arts renown d Th Hesperian temple was her trusted care T was she supplied the wakeful dragon s fare She poppy seeds in honey taught to steep Reclaim d his rage and sooth d him into sleep She watch d the golden fruit her charms unbind The chains of love or fix them on the mind She stops the torrents leaves the channel dry Repels the stars and backward bears the sky The yawning earth rebellows to her call Pale ghosts ascend and mountain ashes fall Witness ye gods and thou my better part How loth I am to try this impious art Within the secret court with silent

embrac d All relics of the wretch are doom d to fire For so the priestess and her charms require Thus far she said and farther speech forbears A mortal paleness in her face appears Yet the mistrustless Anna could not find The secret fun ral in these rites design d Nor thought so dire a rage possess d her mind Unknowing of a train conceal d so well She fear d no worse than when Sichaeus fell Therefore obeys The fatal pile they rear Within the secret court expos d in air The cloven holms and pines are heap d on high And garlands on the hollow spaces lie Sad cypress vervain yew compose the wreath And ev ry baleful green denoting death The queen determin d to the fatal deed The spoils and sword he left in order spread And the man s image on the nuptial bed And now the sacred altars plac d around The priestess enters with her hair unbound And thrice invokes the pow rs below the ground Night Erebus and Chaos she proclaims And threefold Hecate with her hundred names And three Dianas next she sprinkles round With feign d Avernian drops the hallow d ground Culls hoary simples found by Phoebe s light With brazen sickles reap d at noon of night Then mixes baleful juices in the bowl And cuts the forehead of a newborn foal Robbing the mother s love The destin d queen Observes assisting at the rites obscene A leaven d cake in her devoted hands She holds and next the highest altar stands One tender foot was shod her other bare Girt was her gather d gown and loose her hair Thus dress d she summon d with her dying breath The heav ns and planets conscious of her death And ev ry pow r if any rules above Who minds or who revenges injur d love T was dead of night when weary bodies close Their eyes in balmy sleep and soft repose The winds no longer whisper thro the woods Nor murm ring tides disturb the gentle floods The stars in silent order mov d around And Peace with downy wings was brooding on the ground The flocks and herds and party color d fowl Which haunt the woods or swim the weedy pool Stretch d on the quiet earth securely lay Forgetting the past labors of the day All else of nature s common gift partake Unhappy Dido was alone awake Nor sleep nor ease the furious queen can find Sleep fled her eyes as quiet fled her mind Despair and rage and love divide her heart Despair and rage had some but love the greater part Then thus she said within her secret mind What shall I do what succor can I find Become a suppliant to Hyarba s pride And take my turn to court and be denied Shall I with this ungrateful Trojan go Forsake an empire and attend a foe Himself I refug d and his train reliev d T is true but am I sure to be receiv d Can gratitude in Trojan souls have place Laomedon still lives in all his race Then shall I seek alone the churlish crew Or with my fleet their flying sails pursue What force have I but those whom scarce before I drew reluctant from their native shore Will they again embark at my desire Once more sustain the seas and quit their second Tyre Rather with steel thy guilty breast invade And take the fortune thou thyself hast made Your pity sister first seduc d my mind Or seconded too well what I design d These dear bought pleasures had I never known Had I continued free and still my own Avoiding love I had not found despair But shar d with salvage beasts the common air Like them a lonely life I might have led Not mourn d the living nor disturb d the dead These thoughts she brooded in her anxious breast On board the Trojan found more easy rest Resolv d to sail in sleep he pass d the night And order d all things for his early flight To whom once more the winged god appears His former youthful mien and shape he wears And with this new alarm invades his ears Sleep saint thou O goddess born and canst thou drown Thy needful cares so near a hostile town Beset with foes nor hear saint the western gales Invite thy passage and inspire thy sails She harbors in her heart a furious hate And thou shalt find the dire effects too late Fix d on revenge and obstinate to die Haste swiftly hence while thou hast pow r to fly The sea with ships will soon be cover d o er And blazing firebrands kindle all the shore Prevent her rage while night obscures the skies And sail before the purple morn arise Who knows what hazards thy delay may bring Woman s a various and a changeful thing Thus Hermes in the dream then took his flight Aloft in air unseen and mix d with night Twice warn d by the celestial messenger The pious prince arose with hasty fear Then rous d his drowsy train without delay Haste to your banks your crooked anchors weigh And spread your flying sails and stand to sea A god commands he stood before my sight And urg d us once again to speedy flight O sacred pow r what pow r soe er thou art To thy blest orders I resign my heart Lead thou the way protect thy Trojan bands And prosper the design thy will commands He said and drawing forth his flaming sword His thund ring arm divides the many twisted cord An emulating zeal inspires his train They run they snatch they rush into the main With headlong haste they leave the desert shores And brush the liquid seas with lab ring oars Aurora now had left her saffron bed And beams of early light the heav ns o erspread When from a tow r the queen with wakeful eyes Saw day point upward from the rosy skies She look d to seaward but the sea was void And scarce in ken the sailing ships descried Stung with despite and furious with despair She struck her trembling breast and tore her hair And shall th ungrateful traitor go she said My land forsaken and my love betray d Shall we not arm not rush from ev ry street To follow sink and burn his perjur d fleet Haste haul my galleys out pursue the foe Bring flaming brands set sail and swiftly row What have I said where am I Fury turns My brain and my distemper d bosom burns Then when I gave my person and my throne This hate this rage had been more timely shown See now the promis d faith the vaunted name The pious man who rushing thro the flame Preserv d his gods and to the Phrygian shore The burthen of his feeble father bore I should have torn him piecemeal strow d in floods His scatter d limbs or left expos d in woods Destroy d his friends and son and from the fire Have set the reeking boy before the sire Events are doubtful which on battles wait Yet where s the doubt to souls secure of fate My Tyrians at their injur d queen s command Had toss d their fires amid the Trojan band At once extinguish d all the faithless name And I myself in vengeance of my shame Had fall n upon the pile to mend the fun ral flame Thou Sun who view saint at once the world below Thou Juno guardian of the nuptial vow Thou Hecate hearken from thy dark abodes Ye Furies fiends and violated gods All pow rs invok d with Dido s dying breath Attend her curses and avenge her death If so the Fates ordain Jove commands Th ungrateful wretch should find the Latian lands Yet let a race untam d and haughty foes His peaceful entrance with dire arms oppose Oppress d with numbers in th unequal field His men discourag d and himself expell d Let him for succor sue from place to place Torn from his subjects and his son s embrace First let him see his friends in battle slain And their untimely fate lament in vain And when at length the cruel war shall cease On hard conditions may he buy his peace Nor let him then enjoy supreme command But fall untimely by some hostile hand And lie unburied on the barren sand These are my pray rs and this my dying will And you my Tyrians ev ry curse fulfil Perpetual hate and mortal wars proclaim Against the prince the people and the name These grateful off rings on my grave bestow Nor league nor love the hostile nations know Now and from hence in ev ry future age When rage excites your arms and strength supplies the rage Rise some avenger of our Libyan blood With fire and sword pursue the perjur d brood Our arms our seas our shores oppos d to theirs And the same hate descend on all our heirs This said within her anxious mind she weighs The means of cutting short her odious days Then to Sichaeus nurse she briefly said For when she left her country hers was dead Go Barce call my sister Let her care The solemn rites of sacrifice prepare The sheep and all th atoning off rings bring Sprinkling her body from the crystal spring With living drops then let her come and thou With sacred fillets bind thy hoary brow Thus will I pay my vows to Stygian Jove And end the cares of my disastrous love Then cast the Trojan image on the fire And as that burns my passions shall expire The nurse moves onward with officious care And all the speed her aged limbs can bear But furious Dido with dark thoughts involv d Shook at the mighty mischief she resolv d With livid spots distinguish d was her face Red were her rolling eyes and discompos d her pace Ghastly she gaz d with pain she drew her breath And nature shiver d at approaching death Then swiftly to the fatal place she pass d And mounts the fun ral pile with furious haste Unsheathes the sword the Trojan left behind Not for so dire an enterprise design d But when she view d the garments loosely spread Which once he wore and saw the conscious bed She paus d and with a sigh the robes embrac d Then on the couch her trembling body cast Repress d the ready tears and spoke her last Dear pledges of my love while Heav n so pleas d Receive a soul of mortal anguish eas d My fatal course is finish d and I go A glorious name among the ghosts below A lofty city by my hands is rais d Pygmalion punish d and my lord appeas d What could my fortune have afforded more Had the false Trojan never touch d my shore Then kiss d the couch and Must I die she said And unreveng d T is doubly to be dead Yet ev n this death with pleasure I receive On any terms t is better than to live These flames from far may the false Trojan view These boding omens his base flight pursue She said and struck deep enter d in her side The piercing steel with reeking purple dyed Clogg d in the wound the cruel weapon stands The spouting blood came streaming on her hands Her sad attendants saw the deadly stroke And with loud cries the sounding palace shook Distracted from the fatal sight they fled And thro the town the dismal rumor spread First from the frighted court the yell began Redoubled thence from house to house it ran The groans of men with shrieks laments and cries Of mixing women mount the vaulted skies Not less the clamor than if ancient Tyre Or the new Carthage set by foes on fire The rolling ruin with their lov d abodes Involv d the blazing temples of their gods Her sister hears and furious with despair She beats her breast and rends her yellow hair And calling on Eliza s name aloud Runs breathless to the place and breaks the crowd Was all that pomp of woe for this prepar d These fires this fun ral pile these altars rear d Was all this train of plots contriv d said she All only to deceive unhappy me Which is the worst Didst thou in death pretend To scorn thy sister or delude thy friend Thy summon d sister and thy friend had come One sword had serv d us both one common tomb Was I to raise the pile the pow rs invoke Not to be present at the fatal stroke At once thou hast destroy d thyself and me Thy town thy senate and thy colony Bring water bathe the wound while I in death Lay close my lips to hers and catch the flying breath This said she mounts the pile with eager haste And in her arms the gasping queen embrac d Her temples chaf d and her own garments tore To stanch the streaming blood and cleanse the gore Thrice Dido tried to raise her drooping head And fainting thrice fell grov ling on the bed Thrice op d her heavy eyes and sought the light But having found it sicken d at the sight And clos d her lids at last in endless night Then Juno grieving that she should sustain A death so ling ring and so full of pain Sent Iris down to free her from the strife Of lab ring nature and dissolve her life For since she died not doom d by Heav n s decree Or her own crime but human casualty And rage of love that plung d her in despair The Sisters had not cut the topmost hair Which Proserpine and they can only know Nor made her sacred to the shades below Downward the various goddess took her flight And drew a thousand colors from the light Then stood above the dying lover s head And said I thus devote thee to the dead This off ring to th infernal gods I bear Thus while she spoke she cut the fatal hair The struggling soul was loos d and life

to see The palm usurp d without a victory Reproach d Entellus thus who sate beside And heard and saw unmov d the Trojan s pride Once but in vain a champion of renown So tamely can you bear the ravish d crown A prize in triumph borne before your sight And shun for fear the danger of the fight Where is our Eryx now the boasted name The god who taught your thund ring arm the game Where now your baffled honor Where the spoil That fill d your house and fame that fill d our isle Entellus thus My soul is still the same Unmov d with fear and mov d with martial fame But my chill blood is curdled in my veins And scarce the shadow of a man remains O could I turn to that fair prime again That prime of which this boaster is so vain The brave who this decrepid age defies Should feel my force without the promis d prize He said and rising at the word he threw Two pond rous gauntlets down in open view Gauntlets which Eryx wont in fight to wield And sheathe his hands with in the listed field With fear and wonder seiz d the crowd beholds The gloves of death with sev n distinguish d folds Of tough bull hides the space within is spread With iron or with loads of heavy lead Dares himself was daunted at the sight Renounc d his challenge and refus d to fight Astonish d at their weight the hero stands And pois d the pond rous engines in his hands What had your wonder said Entellus been Had you the gauntlets of Alcides seen Or view d the stern debate on this unhappy green These which I bear your brother Eryx bore Still mark d with batter d brains and mingled gore With these he long sustain d th Herculean arm And these I wielded while my blood was warm This languish d frame while better spirits fed Ere age unstrung my nerves or time o ersnow d my head But if the challenger these arms refuse And cannot wield their weight or dare not use If great Aeneas and Acestes join In his request these gauntlets I resign Let us with equal arms perform the fight And let him leave to fear since I resign my right This said Entellus for the strife prepares Stripp d of his quilted coat his body bares Compos d of mighty bones and brawn he stands A goodly tow ring object on the sands Then just Aeneas equal arms supplied Which round their shoulders to their wrists they tied Both on the tiptoe stand at full extent Their arms aloft their bodies inly bent Their heads from aiming blows they bear afar With clashing gauntlets then provoke the war One on his youth and pliant limbs relies One on his sinews and his giant size The last is stiff with age his motion slow He heaves for breath he staggers to and fro And clouds of issuing smoke his nostrils loudly blow Yet equal in success they ward they strike Their ways are diff rent but their art alike Before behind the blows are dealt around Their hollow sides the rattling thumps resound A storm of strokes well meant with fury flies And errs about their temples ears and eyes Nor always errs for oft the gauntlet draws A sweeping stroke along the crackling jaws Heavy with age Entellus stands his ground But with his warping body wards the wound His hand and watchful eye keep even pace While Dares traverses and shifts his place And like a captain who beleaguers round Some strong built castle on a rising ground Views all th approaches with observing eyes This and that other part in vain he tries And more on industry than force relies With hands on high Entellus threats the foe But Dares watch d the motion from below And slipp d aside and shunn d the long descending blow Entellus wastes his forces on the wind And thus deluded of the stroke design d Headlong and heavy fell his ample breast And weighty limbs his ancient mother press d So falls a hollow pine that long had stood On Ida s height or Erymanthus wood Torn from the roots The diff ring nations rise And shouts and mingled murmurs rend the skies Acestus runs with eager haste to raise The fall n companion of his youthful days Dauntless he rose and to the fight return d With shame his glowing cheeks his eyes with fury burn d Disdain and conscious virtue fir d his breast And with redoubled force his foe he press d He lays on load with either hand amain And headlong drives the Trojan o er the plain Nor stops nor stays nor rest nor breath allows But storms of strokes descend about his brows A rattling tempest and a hail of blows But now the prince who saw the wild increase Of wounds commands the combatants to cease And bounds Entellus wrath and bids the peace First to the Trojan spent with toil he came And sooth d his sorrow for the suffer d shame What fury seiz d my friend The gods said he To him propitious and averse to thee Have giv n his arm superior force to thine T is madness to contend with strength divine The gauntlet fight thus ended from the shore His faithful friends unhappy Dares bore His mouth and nostrils pour d a purple flood And pounded teeth came rushing with his blood Faintly he stagger d thro the hissing throng And hung his head and trail d his legs along The sword and casque are carried by his train But with his foe the palm and ox remain The champion then before Aeneas came Proud of his prize but prouder of his fame O goddess born and you Dardanian host Mark with attention and forgive my boast Learn what I was by what remains and know From what impending fate you sav d my foe Sternly he spoke and then confronts the bull And on his ample forehead aiming full The deadly stroke descending pierc d the skull Down drops the beast nor needs a second wound But sprawls in pangs of death and spurns the ground Then thus In Dares stead I offer this Eryx accept a nobler sacrifice Take the last gift my wither d arms can yield Thy gauntlets I resign and here renounce the field This done Aeneas orders for the close The strife of archers with contending bows The mast Sergesthus shatter d galley bore With his own hands he raises on the shore A flutt ring dove upon the top they tie The living mark at which their arrows fly The rival archers in a line advance Their turn of shooting to receive from chance A helmet holds their names the lots are drawn On the first scroll was read Hippocoon The people shout Upon the next was found Young Mnestheus late with naval honors crown d The third contain d Eurytion s noble name Thy brother Pandarus and next in fame Whom Pallas urg d the treaty to confound And send among the Greeks a feather d wound Acestes in the bottom last remain d Whom not his age from youthful sports restrain d Soon all with vigor bend their trusty bows And from the quiver each his arrow chose Hippocoon s was the first with forceful sway It flew and whizzing cut the liquid way Fix d in the mast the feather d weapon stands The fearful pigeon flutters in her bands And the tree trembled and the shouting cries Of the pleas d people rend the vaulted skies Then Mnestheus to the head his arrow drove With lifted eyes and took his aim above But made a glancing shot and missed the dove Yet miss d so narrow that he cut the cord Which fasten d by the foot the flitting bird The captive thus releas d away she flies And beats with clapping wings the yielding skies His bow already bent Eurytion stood And having first invok d his brother god His winged shaft with eager haste he sped The fatal message reach d her as she fled She leaves her life aloft she strikes the ground And renders back the weapon in the wound Acestes grudging at his lot remains Without a prize to gratify his pains Yet shooting upward sends his shaft to show An archer s art and boast his twanging bow The feather d arrow gave a dire portent And latter augurs judge from this event Chaf d by the speed it fir d and as it flew A trail of following flames ascending drew Kindling they mount and mark the shiny way Across the skies as falling meteors play And vanish into wind or in a blaze decay The Trojans and Sicilians wildly stare And trembling turn their wonder into pray r The Dardan prince put on a smiling face And strain d Acestes with a close embrace Then honorable ring him with gifts above the rest Turn d the bad omen nor his fears confess d The gods said he this miracle have wrought And order d you the prize without the lot Accept this goblet rough with figur d gold Which Thracian Cisseus gave my sire of old This pledge of ancient amity receive Which to my second sire I justly give He said and with the trumpets cheerful sound Proclaim d him victor and with laurel crown d Nor good Eurytion envied him the prize Tho he transfix d the pigeon in the skies Who cut the line with second

childish troop be ready join d On horseback let him grace his grandsire s day And lead his equals arm d in just array He said and calling out the cirque he clears The crowd withdrawn an open plain appears And now the noble youths of form divine Advance before their fathers in a line The riders grace the steeds the steeds with glory shine Thus marching on in military pride Shouts of applause resound from side to side Their casques adorn d with laurel wreaths they wear Each brandishing aloft a cornel spear Some at their backs their gilded quivers bore Their chains of burnish d gold hung down before Three graceful troops they form d upon the green Three graceful leaders at their head were seen Twelve follow d ev ry chief and left a space between The first young Priam led a lovely boy Whose grandsire was th unhappy king of Troy His race in after times was known to fame New honors adding to the Latian name And well the royal boy his Thracian steed became White were the fetlocks of his feet before And on his front a snowy star he bore Then beauteous Atys with Iulus bred Of equal age the second squadron led The last in order but the first in place First in the lovely features of his face Rode fair Ascanius on a fiery steed Queen Dido s gift and of the Tyrian breed Sure coursers for the rest the king ordains With golden bits adorn d and purple reins The pleas d spectators peals of shouts renew And all the parents in the children view Their make their motions and their sprightly grace And hopes and fears alternate in their face Th unfledg d commanders and their martial

parts with three distinguish d guides Again they close and once again disjoin In troop to troop oppos d and line to line They meet they wheel they throw their darts afar With harmless rage and well dissembled war Then in a round the mingled bodies run Flying they follow and pursuing shun Broken they break and rallying they renew In other forms the military shew At last in order undiscern d they join And march together in a friendly line And as the Cretan labyrinth of old With wand ring ways and many a winding fold Involv d the weary feet without redress In a round error which denied recess So fought the Trojan boys in warlike play Turn d and return d and still a diff rent way Thus dolphins in the deep each other chase In circles when they swim around the wat ry race This game these carousels Ascanius taught And building Alba to the Latins brought Shew d what he learn d the Latin sires impart To their succeeding sons the graceful art From these imperial Rome receiv d the game Which Troy the youths the Trojan troop they name Thus far the sacred sports they celebrate But Fortune soon resum d her ancient hate For while they pay the dead his annual dues Those envied rites Saturnian Juno views And sends the goddess of the various bow To try new methods of revenge below Supplies the winds to wing her airy way Where in the port secure the navy lay Swiftly fair Iris down her arch descends And undiscern d her fatal voyage ends She saw the gath ring crowd and gliding thence The desart shore and fleet without defense The Trojan matrons on the sands alone With sighs and tears Anchises death bemoan Then turning to the sea their weeping eyes Their pity to themselves renews their cries Alas said one what oceans yet remain For us to sail what labors to sustain All take the word and with a general ral groan Implore the gods for peace and places of their own The goddess great in mischief views their pains And in a woman s form her heav nly limbs restrains In face and shape old Beroe she became Doryclus wife a venerable dame Once blest with riches and a mother s name Thus chang d amidst the crying crowd she ran Mix d with the matrons and these words began O wretched we whom not the Grecian pow r Nor flames destroy d in Troy s unhappy hour O wretched we reserv d by cruel fate Beyond the ruins of the sinking state Now sev n revolving years are wholly run Since this improsp rous voyage we begun Since toss d from shores to shores from lands to lands Inhospitable rocks and barren sands Wand ring in exile thro the stormy sea We search in vain for flying Italy Now cast by fortune on this kindred land What should our rest and rising walls withstand Or hinder here to fix our banish d band O country lost and gods redeem d in vain If still in endless exile we remain Shall we no more the Trojan walls renew Or streams of some dissembled Simois view Haste join with me th unhappy fleet consume Cassandra bids and I declare her doom In sleep I saw her she supplied my hands For this I more than dreamt with flaming brands With these said she these wand ring ships destroy These are your fatal seats and this your Troy Time calls you now the precious hour employ Slack not the good presage while Heav n inspires Our minds to dare and gives the ready fires See Neptune s altars minister their brands The god is pleas d the god supplies our hands Then from the pile a flaming fire she drew And toss d in air amidst the galleys threw Wrapp d in amaze the matrons wildly stare Then Pyrgo reverenc d for her hoary hair Pyrgo the nurse of Priam s num rous race No Beroe this tho she belies her face What terrors from her frowning front arise Behold a goddess in her ardent eyes What rays around her heav nly face are seen Mark her majestic voice and more than mortal mien Beroe but now I left whom pin d with pain Her age and anguish from these rites detain She said The matrons seiz d with new amaze Roll their malignant eyes and on the navy gaze They fear and hope and neither part obey They hope the fated land but fear the fatal way The goddess having done her task below Mounts up on equal wings and bends her painted bow Struck with the sight and seiz d with rage divine The matrons prosecute their mad design They shriek aloud they snatch with impious hands The food of altars fires and flaming brands Green boughs and saplings mingled in their haste And smoking torches on the ships they cast The flame unstopp d at first more fury gains And Vulcan rides at large with loosen d reins Triumphant to the painted sterns he soars And seizes in this way the banks and crackling oars Eumelus was the first the news to bear While yet they crowd the rural theater Then what they hear is witness d by their eyes A storm of sparkles and of flames arise Ascanius took th alarm while yet he led His early warriors on his prancing steed And spurring on his equals soon o erpass d Nor could his frighted friends reclaim his haste Soon as the royal youth appear d in view He sent his voice before him as he flew What madness moves you matrons to destroy The last remainders of unhappy Troy Not hostile fleets but your own hopes you burn And on your friends your fatal fury turn Behold your own Ascanius While he said He drew his glitt ring helmet from his head In which the youths to sportful arms he led By this Aeneas and his train appear And now the women seiz d with shame and fear Dispers d to woods and caverns take their flight Abhor their actions and avoid the light Their friends acknowledge and their error find And shake the goddess from their alter d mind Not so the raging fires their fury cease But lurking in the seams with seeming peace Work on their way amid the smold ring tow Sure in destruction but in motion slow The silent plague thro the green timber eats And vomits out a tardy flame by fits Down to the keels and upward to the sails The fire descends or mounts but still prevails Nor buckets pour d nor strength of human hand Can the victorious element withstand The pious hero rends his robe and throws To heav n his hands and with his hands his vows O Jove he cried if pray rs can yet have place If thou abhorr saint not all the Dardan race If any spark of pity still remain If gods are gods and not invok d in vain Yet spare the relics of the Trojan train Yet from the flames our burning vessels free Or let thy fury fall alone on me At this devoted head thy thunder throw And send the willing sacrifice below Scarce had he said when southern storms arise From pole to pole the forky lightning flies Loud rattling shakes the mountains and the plain Heav n bellies downward and descends in rain Whole sheets of water from the clouds are sent Which hissing thro the planks the flames prevent And stop the fiery pest Four ships alone Burn to the waist and for the fleet atone But doubtful thoughts the hero s heart divide If he should still in Sicily reside Forgetful of his fates or tempt the main In hope the promis

subdue Fly when she frowns and when she calls pursue Your friend Acestes is of Trojan kind To him disclose the secrets of your mind Trust in his hands your old and useless train Too num rous for the ships which yet remain The feeble old indulgent of their ease The dames who dread the dangers of the seas With all the dastard crew who dare not stand The shock of battle with your foes by land Here you may build a common town for all And from Acestes name Acesta call The reasons with his friend s experience join d Encourag d much but more disturb d his mind T was dead of night when to his slumb

Heav n employs my careful ghost On his commands the god who sav d from fire Your flaming fleet and heard your just desire The wholesome counsel of your friend receive And here the coward train and woman leave The chosen youth and those who nobly dare Transport to tempt the dangers of the war The stern Italians will their courage try Rough are their manners and their minds are high But first to Pluto s palace you shall go And seek my shade among the blest below For not with impious ghosts my soul remains Nor suffers with the damn d perpetual pains But breathes the living air of soft Elysian plains The chaste Sibylla shall your steps convey And blood of offer d victims free the way There shall you know what realms the gods assign And learn the fates and fortunes of your line But now farewell I vanish with the night And feel the blast of heav n s approaching light He said and mix d with shades and took his airy flight Whither so fast the filial duty cried And why ah why the wish d embrace denied He said and rose as holy zeal inspires He rakes hot embers and renews the fires His country gods and Vesta then adores With cakes and incense and their aid implores Next for his friends and royal host he sent Reveal d his vision and the gods intent With his own purpose All without delay The will of Jove and his desires obey They list with women each degenerate name Who dares not hazard life for future fame These they cashier the brave remaining few Oars banks and cables half consum d renew The prince designs a city with the plow The lots their sev ral tenements allow This part is nam d from Ilium that from Troy And the new king ascends the throne with joy A chosen senate from the people draws Appoints the judges and ordains the laws Then on the top of Eryx they begin A rising temple to the Paphian queen Anchises last is honor d as a god A priest is added annual gifts bestow d And groves are planted round his blest abode Nine days they pass in feasts their temples crown d And fumes of incense in the fanes abound Then from the south arose a gentle breeze That curl d the smoothness of the glassy seas The rising winds a ruffling gale afford And call the merry mariners aboard Now loud laments along the shores resound Of parting friends in close embraces bound The trembling women the degenerate train Who shunn d the frightful dangers of the main Ev n those desire to sail and take their share Of the rough passage and the promis d war Whom good Aeneas cheers and recommends To their new master s care his fearful friends On Eryx s altars three fat calves he lays A lamb new fallen to the stormy seas Then slips his haulsers and his anchors weighs High on the deck the godlike hero stands With olive crown d a charger in his hands Then cast the reeking entrails in the brine And pour d the sacrifice of purple wine Fresh gales arise with equal strokes they vie And brush the buxom seas and o er the billows fly Meantime the mother goddess full of fears To Neptune thus address d with tender tears The pride of Jove s imperious queen the rage The malice which no suff rings can assuage Compel me to these pray rs since neither fate Nor time nor pity can remove her hate Ev n Jove is thwarted by his haughty wife Still vanquish d yet she still renews the strife As if t were little to consume the town Which aw d the world and wore th imperial crown She prosecutes the ghost of Troy with pains And gnaws ev n to the bones the last remains Let her the causes of her hatred tell But you can witness its effects too well You saw the storm she rais d on

fleet with execrable flames And forc d Aeneas when his ships were lost To leave his foll wers on a foreign coast For what remains your godhead I implore And trust my son to your protecting pow r If neither Jove s nor Fate s decree withstand Secure his passage to the Latian land Then thus the mighty Ruler of the Main What may not Venus hope from Neptune s reign My kingdom claims your birth my late defense Of your indanger d fleet may claim your confidence Nor less by land than sea my deeds declare How much your lov d Aeneas is my care Thee Xanthus and thee Simois I attest Your Trojan troops when proud Achilles press d And drove before him headlong on the plain And dash d against the walls the trembling train When floods were fill d with bodies of the slain When crimson Xanthus doubtful of his way Stood up on ridges to behold the sea New heaps came tumbling in and chok d his way When your Aeneas fought but fought with odds Of force unequal and unequal gods I spread a cloud before the victor s sight Sustain d the vanquish d and secur d his flight Ev n then secur d him when I sought with joy The vow d destruction of ungrateful Troy My will s the same fair goddess fear no more Your fleet shall safely gain the Latian shore Their lives are giv n one destin d head alone Shall perish and for multitudes atone Thus having arm d with hopes her anxious mind His finny team Saturnian Neptune join d Then adds the foamy bridle to their jaws And to the loosen d reins permits the laws High on the waves his azure car he guides Its axles thunder and the sea subsides And the smooth ocean rolls her silent tides The tempests fly before their father s face Trains of inferior gods his triumph grace And monster whales before their master play And choirs of Tritons crowd the wat ry way The marshal d pow rs in equal troops divide To right and left the gods his better side Inclose and on the worse the Nymphs and Nereids ride Now smiling hope with sweet vicissitude Within the hero s mind his joys renew d He calls to raise the masts the sheets display The cheerful crew with diligence obey They scud before the wind and sail in open sea Ahead of all the master pilot steers And as he leads the following navy veers The steeds of Night had travel d half the sky The drowsy rowers on their benches lie When the soft God of Sleep with easy flight Descends and draws behind a trail of light Thou Palinurus art his destin d prey To thee alone he takes his fatal way Dire dreams to thee and iron sleep he bears And lighting on thy prow the form of Phorbas wears Then thus the traitor god began his tale The winds my friend inspire a pleasing gale The ships without thy care securely sail Now steal an hour of sweet repose and I Will take the rudder and thy room supply To whom the yawning pilot half asleep Me dost thou bid to trust the treach rous deep The harlot smiles of her dissembling face And to her faith commit the Trojan race Shall I believe the Siren South again And oft betray d not know the monster main He said his fasten d hands the rudder keep And fix d on heav n his eyes repel invading sleep The god was wroth and at his temples threw A branch

superior strength Fell heavy on him plung d him in the sea And with the stern the rudder tore away Headlong he fell and struggling in the main Cried out for helping hands but cried in vain The victor daemon mounts obscure in air While the ship sails without the pilot s care On Neptune s faith the floating fleet relies But what the man forsook the god supplies And o er the dang rous deep secure the navy flies Glides by the Sirens cliffs a shelfy coast Long infamous for ships and sailors lost And white with bones Th impetuous ocean roars And rocks rebellow from the sounding shores The watchful hero felt the knocks and found The tossing vessel sail d on shoaly ground Sure of his pilot s loss he takes himself The helm and steers aloof and shuns the shelf Inly he griev d and groaning from the

strand Some strike from clashing flints their fiery seed Some gather sticks the kindled flames to feed Or search for hollow trees and fell the woods Or trace thro valleys the discover d floods Thus while their sev ral charges they fulfil The pious prince ascends the sacred hill Where Phoebus is ador d and seeks the shade Which hides from sight his venerable maid Deep in a cave the Sibyl makes abode Thence full of fate returns and of the god Thro Trivia s grove they walk and now behold And enter now the temple roof d with gold When Daedalus to fly the Cretan shore His heavy limbs on jointed pinions bore The first who sail d in air t is sung by Fame To the Cumaean coast at length he came And here alighting built this costly frame Inscrib d to Phoebus here he hung on high The steerage of his wings that cut the sky Then o er the lofty gate his art emboss d Androgeos death and off rings to his ghost Sev n youths from Athens yearly sent to meet The fate appointed by revengeful Crete And next to those the dreadful urn was plac d In which the destin d names by lots were cast The mournful parents stand around in tears And rising Crete against their shore appears There too in living sculpture might be seen The mad affection of the Cretan queen Then how she cheats her bellowing lover s eye The rushing leap the doubtful progeny The lower part a beast a man above The monument of their polluted love Not far from thence he grav d the wondrous maze A thousand doors a thousand winding ways Here dwells the monster hid from human view Not to be found but by the faithful clew Till the kind artist mov d with pious grief Lent to the loving maid this last relief And all those erring paths describ d so well That Theseus conquer d and the monster fell Here hapless Icarus had found his part Had not the father s grief restrain d his art He twice assay d to cast his son in gold Twice from his hands he dropp d the forming mold All this with wond ring eyes Aeneas view d Each varying

pleasures haste the sacrifice Sev n bullocks yet unyok d for Phoebus choose And for Diana sev n unspotted ewes This said the servants urge the sacred rites While to the temple she the prince invites A spacious cave within its farmost part Was hew d and fashion d by laborious art Thro the hill s hollow sides before the place A hundred doors a hundred entries grace As many voices issue and the sound Of Sybil s words as many times rebound Now to the mouth they come Aloud she cries This is the time enquire your destinies He comes behold the god Thus while she said And shiv ring at the sacred entry stay d Her color chang d her face was not the same And hollow groans from her deep spirit came Her hair stood up convulsive rage possess d Her trembling limbs and heav d her lab ring breast Greater

hand the Dardan dart Pierc d the proud Grecian s only mortal part Thus far by fate s decrees and thy commands Thro ambient seas and thro devouring sands Our exil d crew has sought th Ausonian ground And now at length the flying coast is found Thus far the fate of Troy from place to place With fury has pursued her wand ring race Here cease ye pow rs and let your vengeance end Troy is no more and can no more offend And thou O sacred maid inspir d to see Th event of things in dark futurity Give me what Heav n has promis d to my fate To conquer and command the Latian state To fix my wand ring gods and find a place For the long exiles of the Trojan race Then shall my grateful hands a temple rear To the twin gods with vows and solemn pray r And annual rites and festivals and games Shall be perform d to their auspicious names Nor shalt thou want thy honors in my land For there thy faithful oracles shall stand Preserv d in shrines and ev ry sacred lay Which by thy mouth Apollo shall

fate Write not but what the pow rs ordain relate Struggling in vain impatient of her load And lab ring underneath the pond rous god The more she strove to shake him from her breast With more and far superior force he press d Commands his entrance and without control Usurps her organs and inspires her soul Now with a furious blast the hundred doors Ope of themselves a rushing whirlwind roars Within the cave and Sibyl s voice restores Escap d the dangers of the wat ry reign Yet more and greater ills by land remain The coast so long desir d nor doubt th event Thy troops shall reach but having reach d repent Wars horrid wars I view a field of blood And Tiber rolling with a purple flood Simois nor Xanthus shall be wanting there A new Achilles shall in arms appear And he too goddess born Fierce Juno s hate Added to hostile force shall urge thy fate To what strange nations shalt not thou resort Driv n to solicit aid at ev ry court The cause the same which Ilium once oppress d A foreign mistress and a foreign guest But thou secure of soul unbent with woes The more thy fortune frowns the more oppose The dawnings of thy safety shall be shown From whence thou least shalt hope a Grecian town Thus from the dark recess the Sibyl spoke And the resisting air the thunder broke The cave rebellow d and the temple shook Th ambiguous god who rul d her lab ring breast In these mysterious words his mind express d Some truths reveal d in terms involv d the rest At length her fury fell her foaming ceas d And ebbing in her soul the god decreas d Then thus the chief No terror to my view No frightful face of danger can be new Inur d to suffer and resolv d to dare The Fates without my pow r shall be without my care This let me crave since near your grove the road To hell lies open and the dark abode Which Acheron surrounds th innavigable flood Conduct me thro the regions void of light And lead me longing to my father s sight For him a thousand dangers I have sought And rushing where the thickest Grecians fought Safe on my back the sacred burthen brought He for my sake the raging ocean tried And wrath of Heav n my still auspicious guide And bore beyond the strength decrepid age supplied Oft since he breath d his last in dead of night His reverend image stood before my sight Enjoin d to seek below his holy shade Conducted there by your unerring aid But you if pious minds by pray rs are won Oblige the father and protect the son Yours is the pow r nor Proserpine in vain Has made you priestess of her nightly reign If Orpheus arm d with his enchanting lyre The ruthless king with pity could inspire And from the shades below redeem his wife If Pollux off ring his alternate life Could free his brother and can daily go By turns aloft by turns descend below Why name I Theseus or his greater friend Who trod the downward path and upward could ascend Not less than theirs from Jove my lineage came My mother greater my descent the same So pray d the Trojan prince and while he pray d His hand upon the holy altar laid Then thus replied the prophetess divine O goddess born of great Anchises line The gates of hell are open night and day Smooth the descent and easy is the way But to return and view the cheerful skies In this the task and mighty labor lies To few great Jupiter imparts this grace And those of shining worth and heav nly race Betwixt those regions and our upper light Deep forests and impenetrable night Possess the middle space th infernal bounds Cocytus with his sable waves surrounds But if so dire a love your soul invades As twice below to view the trembling shades If you so hard a toil will undertake As twice to pass th innavigable lake Receive my counsel In the neighb ring grove There stands a tree the queen of Stygian Jove Claims it her own thick woods and gloomy night Conceal the happy plant from human sight One bough it bears but wondrous to behold The ductile rind and leaves of radiant gold This from the vulgar branches must be torn And to fair Proserpine the present borne Ere leave be giv n to tempt the nether skies The first thus rent a second will arise And the same metal the same room supplies Look round the wood with lifted eyes to see The lurking gold upon the fatal tree Then rend it off as holy rites command The willing metal will obey thy hand Following with ease if favor d by thy fate Thou art foredoom d to view the Stygian state If not no labor can the tree constrain And strength of stubborn arms and steel are vain Besides you know not while you here attend Th unworthy fate of your unhappy friend Breathless he lies and his unburied ghost Depriv d of fun ral rites pollutes your host Pay first his pious dues and for the dead Two sable sheep around his hearse be led Then living turfs upon his body lay This done securely take the destin d way To find the regions destitute of day She said and held her peace Aeneas went Sad from the cave and full of discontent Unknowing whom the sacred Sibyl meant Achates the companion of his breast Goes grieving by his side with equal cares oppress d Walking they talk d and fruitlessly divin d What friend the priestess by those words design d But soon they found an object to deplore Misenus lay extended on the shore Son of the God of Winds none so renown d The warrior trumpet in the field to sound With breathing brass to kindle fierce alarms And rouse to dare their fate in honorable arms He serv d great Hector and was ever near Not with his trumpet only but his spear But by Pelides arms when Hector fell He chose Aeneas and he chose as well Swoln with applause and aiming still at more He now provokes the sea gods from the shore With envy Triton heard the martial sound And the bold champion for his challenge drown d Then cast his mangled carcass on the strand The gazing crowd around the body stand All weep but most Aeneas mourns his fate And hastens to perform the funeral state In altar wise a stately pile they rear The basis broad below and top advanc d in air An ancient wood fit for the work design d The shady covert of the salvage kind The Trojans found the sounding ax is plied Firs pines and pitch trees and the tow ring pride Of forest ashes feel the fatal stroke And piercing wedges cleave the stubborn oak Huge trunks of trees fell d from the steepy crown Of the bare mountains roll with ruin down Arm d like the rest the Trojan prince appears And by his pious labor urges theirs Thus while he wrought revolving in his mind The ways to compass what his wish design d He cast his eyes upon the gloomy grove And then with vows implor d the Queen of Love O may thy pow r propitious still to me Conduct my steps to find the fatal tree In this deep forest since the Sibyl s breath Foretold alas too true Misenus death Scarce had he said when full before his sight Two doves descending from their airy flight Secure upon the grassy plain alight He knew his mother s birds and thus he pray d Be you my guides with your auspicious aid And lead my footsteps till the branch be found Whose glitt ring shadow gilds the sacred ground And thou great parent with celestial care In this distress be present to my pray r Thus having said he stopp d with watchful sight Observing still the motions of their flight What course they took what happy signs they shew They fed and flutt ring by degrees withdrew Still farther from the place but still in view Hopping and flying thus they led him on To the slow lake whose baleful stench to shun They wing d their flight aloft then stooping low Perch d on the double tree that bears the golden bough Thro the green leafs the glitt ring shadows glow As on the sacred oak the wintry mistletoe Where the proud mother views her precious brood And happier branches which she never sow d Such was the glitt ring such the ruddy rind And dancing leaves that wanton d in the wind He seiz d the shining bough with griping hold And rent away with ease the ling ring gold Then to the Sibyl s palace bore the prize Meantime the Trojan troops with weeping eyes To dead Misenus pay his obsequies First from the ground a lofty pile they rear Of pitch trees oaks and pines and unctuous fir The fabric s front with cypress twigs they strew And stick the sides with boughs of baleful yew The topmost part his glitt ring arms adorn Warm waters then in brazen caldrons borne Are pour d to wash his body joint by joint And fragrant oils the stiffen d limbs anoint With groans and cries Misenus they deplore Then on a bier with purple cover d o er The breathless body thus bewail d they lay And fire the pile their faces turn d away Such reverend rites their fathers us d to pay Pure oil and incense on the fire they throw And fat of victims which his friends bestow These gifts the greedy flames to dust devour Then on the living coals red wine they pour And last the relics by themselves dispose Which in a brazen urn the priests inclose Old Corynaeus compass d thrice the crew And dipp d an olive branch in holy dew Which thrice he sprinkled round and thrice aloud Invok d the dead and then dismissed the crowd But good Aeneas order d on the shore A stately tomb whose top a trumpet bore A soldier s fauchion and a seaman s oar Thus was his friend interr d and deathless fame Still to the lofty cape consigns his name These rites perform d the prince without delay Hastes to the nether world his destin d way Deep was the cave and downward as it went From the wide mouth a rocky rough descent And here th access a gloomy grove defends And there th unnavigable lake extends O er whose unhappy waters void of light No bird presumes to steer his airy flight Such deadly stenches from the depths arise And steaming sulphur that infects the skies From hence the Grecian bards their legends make And give the name Avernus to the lake Four sable bullocks in the yoke untaught For sacrifice the pious hero brought The priestess pours the wine betwixt their horns Then cuts the curling hair that first oblation burns Invoking Hecate hither to repair A pow rful name in hell and upper air The sacred priests with ready knives bereave The beasts of life and in full bowls receive The streaming blood a lamb to Hell and Night The sable wool without a streak of white Aeneas offers and by fate s decree A barren heifer Proserpine to thee With holocausts he Pluto s altar fills Sev n brawny bulls with his own hand he kills Then on the broiling entrails oil he pours Which ointed thus the raging flame devours Late the nocturnal sacrifice begun Nor ended till the next returning sun Then earth began to bellow trees to dance And howling dogs in glimm ring light advance Ere Hecate came Far hence be souls profane The Sibyl cried and from the grove abstain Now Trojan take the way thy fates afford Assume thy courage and unsheathe thy sword She said and pass d along the gloomy space The prince pursued her steps with equal pace Ye realms yet unreveal d to human sight Ye gods who rule the regions of the night Ye gliding ghosts permit me to relate The mystic wonders of your silent state Obscure they went thro dreary shades that led Along the waste dominions of the dead Thus wander travelers in woods by night By the moon s doubtful and malignant light When Jove in dusky clouds involves the skies And the faint crescent shoots by fits before their eyes Just in the gate and in the jaws of hell Revengeful Cares and sullen Sorrows dwell And pale Diseases and repining Age Want Fear and Famine s unresisted rage Here Toils and Death and Death s half brother Sleep Forms terrible to

rumor true in your reported death And I alas the cause By Heav n I vow And all the pow rs that rule the realms below Unwilling I forsook your friendly state Commanded by the gods and forc d by fate Those gods that fate whose unresisted might Have sent me to these regions void of light Thro the vast empire of eternal night Nor dar d I to presume that press d with grief My flight should urge you to this dire relief Stay stay your steps and listen to my vows T is the last interview that fate allows In vain he thus attempts her mind to move With tears and pray rs and late repenting love Disdainfully she look d then turning round But fix d her eyes unmov d upon the ground And what he says and swears regards no more Than the deaf rocks when the loud billows roar But whirl d away to

appears Spoil d of his nose and shorten d of his ears He scarcely knew him striving to disown His blotted form and blushing to be known And therefore first began O Teucer s race Who durst thy faultless figure thus deface What heart could wish what hand inflict this dire disgrace Twas fam d that in our last and fatal night Your single prowess long sustain d the fight Till tir d not forc d a

cruel fate and my more cruel wife To Grecian swords betray d my sleeping life These are the monuments of Helen s love The shame I bear below the marks I bore above You know in what deluding joys we pass d The night that was by Heav n decreed our last For when the fatal horse descending down Pregnant with arms o erwhelm d th unhappy town She feign d nocturnal orgies left my bed And mix d with Trojan dames the dances led Then waving high her torch the signal made Which rous d the Grecians from their ambuscade With watching overworn with cares oppress d Unhappy I had laid me down to rest And heavy sleep my weary limbs possess d Meantime my worthy wife our arms mislaid And from beneath my head my sword convey d The door unlatch d and with repeated calls Invites her former lord within my

led the way Avenging pow rs with justice if I pray That fortune be their own another day But answer you and in your turn relate What brought you living to the Stygian state Driv n by the winds and errors of the sea Or did you Heav n s superior doom obey Or tell what other chance conducts your way To view with mortal eyes our dark retreats Tumults and torments of th infernal seats While thus in talk the flying hours they pass The sun had finish d more than half his race And they perhaps in words and tears had spent The little time of stay which Heav n had lent But thus the Sibyl chides their long delay Night rushes down and headlong drives the day T is here in different paths the way divides The right to Pluto s golden palace guides The left to that unhappy region tends Which to the depth of Tartarus descends The seat of night profound and punish d fiends Then thus Deiphobus O sacred maid Forbear to chide and be your will obey d Lo to the secret shadows I retire To pay my penance till my years expire Proceed auspicious prince with glory crown d And born to better fates than I have found He said and while he said his steps he turn d To secret shadows and in silence mourn d The hero looking on the left espied A lofty tow r and strong on ev ry side With treble walls which Phlegethon surrounds Whose fiery flood the burning empire bounds And press d betwixt the rocks the bellowing noise resounds Wide is the fronting gate and rais d on high With adamantine columns threats the sky Vain is the force of man and Heav n s as vain To crush the pillars which the pile sustain Sublime on these a tow r of steel is rear d And dire Tisiphone there keeps the ward Girt in her sanguine gown by night and day Observant of the souls that pass the downward way From hence are heard the groans of ghosts the pains Of sounding lashes and of dragging chains The Trojan stood astonish d at their cries And ask d his guide from whence those yells arise And what the crimes and what the tortures were And loud laments that rent the liquid air She thus replied The chaste and holy race Are all forbidden this polluted place But Hecate when she gave to rule the woods Then led me trembling thro these dire abodes And taught the tortures of th avenging gods These are the realms of unrelenting fate And awful Rhadamanthus rules the state He hears and judges each committed crime Enquires into the manner place and time The conscious wretch must all his acts reveal Loth to confess unable to conceal From the first moment of his vital breath To his last hour of unrepenting death Straight o er the guilty ghost the Fury shakes The sounding whip and brandishes her snakes And the pale sinner with her sisters takes Then of itself unfolds th eternal door With dreadful sounds the brazen hinges roar You see before the gate what stalking ghost Commands the guard what sentries keep the post More formidable Hydra stands within Whose jaws with iron teeth severely grin The gaping gulf low to the center lies And twice as deep as earth is distant from the skies The rivals of the gods the Titan race Here sing d with lightning roll within th unfathom d space Here lie th Alaean twins I saw them

on unprofitable gold Who dare not give and ev n refuse to lend To their poor kindred or a wanting friend Vast is the throng of these nor less the train Of lustful youths for foul adult ry slain Hosts of deserters who their honor sold And basely broke their faith for bribes of gold All these within the dungeon s depth remain Despairing pardon and expecting pain Ask not what pains nor farther seek to know Their process or the forms of law below Some roll a weighty stone some laid along And bound with burning wires on spokes of wheels are hung Unhappy Theseus doom d for ever there Is fix d by

souls were feasting on the plain Some did the song and some the choir maintain Beneath a laurel shade where mighty Po Mounts up to woods above and hides his head below Here patriots live who for their country s good In fighting fields were prodigal of blood Priests of unblemish d lives here make abode And poets worthy their inspiring god And searching wits of more mechanic parts Who grac d their age with new invented arts Those who to worth their bounty did extend And those who knew that bounty to commend The heads of these with holy fillets bound And all their temples were with garlands crown d To these the Sibyl thus her speech address d And first to him surrounded by the rest Tow ring his height and ample was his breast Say happy souls divine Musaeus say Where lives Anchises and where lies our way To find the hero for whose only sake We sought the dark abodes and cross d the bitter lake To this the sacred poet thus replied In no fix d place the happy souls reside In groves we live and lie on mossy beds By crystal streams that murmur thro the meads But pass yon easy hill and thence descend The path conducts you to your journey s end This said he led them up the mountain s

shadow slipp d away Like winds or empty dreams that fly the day Now in a secret vale the Trojan sees A sep rate grove thro which a gentle breeze Plays with a passing breath and whispers thro the trees And just before the confines of the wood The gliding Lethe leads her silent flood About the boughs an airy nation flew Thick as the humming bees that hunt the golden dew In summer s heat on tops of lilies feed And creep within their bells to suck the balmy seed The winged army roams the fields around The rivers and the rocks remurmur to the sound Aeneas wond ring stood then ask d the cause Which

All have their manes and those manes bear The few so cleans d to these abodes repair And breathe in ample fields the soft Elysian air Then are they happy when by length of time The scurf is worn away of each committed crime No speck is left of their habitual stains But the pure ether of the soul remains But when a thousand rolling years are past So long their punishments and penance last Whole droves of minds are by the driving god Compell d to drink the deep Lethaean flood In large forgetful draughts to steep the cares Of their past labors and their irksome years That unrememb ring of its

the moon and planetary hour With words and wicked herbs from humankind Had alter d and in brutal shapes confin d Which monsters lest the Trojans pious host Should bear or touch upon th inchanted coast Propitious Neptune steer d their course by night With rising gales that sped their happy flight Supplied with these they skim the sounding shore And hear the swelling surges vainly roar Now when the rosy morn began to rise And wav d her saffron streamer thro the skies When Thetis blush d in purple not her own And from her face the breathing winds were blown A sudden silence sate upon the sea And sweeping oars with struggling urge their way The Trojan from the main beheld a wood Which thick with shades and a brown horror stood Betwixt the trees the Tiber took his course With whirlpools dimpled and with downward force That drove the sand along he took his way And roll d his yellow billows to the sea About him and above and round the wood The birds that haunt the borders of his flood That bath d within or basked upon his side To tuneful songs their narrow throats applied The captain gives command the joyful train Glide thro the gloomy shade and leave the main Now Erato thy poet s mind

how they fought These are my theme and how the war began And how concluded by the godlike man For I shall sing of battles blood and rage Which princes and their people did engage And haughty souls that mov d with mutual hate In fighting fields pursued and found their fate That rous d the Tyrrhene realm with loud alarms And peaceful Italy involv d in arms A larger scene of action is display d And rising hence a greater work is weigh d Latinus old and mild had long possess d The Latin scepter and his people blest His father Faunus a Laurentian dame His mother fair Marica was her name But Faunus came from Picus Picus drew His birth from Saturn if records be true Thus King Latinus in the third degree Had Saturn author of his family But this old peaceful prince as Heav n decreed Was blest with no male issue to succeed His sons in blooming youth were snatch d by fate One only daughter heir d the royal state Fir d with her love and with ambition led The neighb ring princes court her nuptial bed Among the crowd but far above the rest Young Turnus to the beauteous maid address d Turnus for high descent and graceful mien Was first and favor d by the Latian queen With him she strove to join Lavinia s hand But dire portents the purpos d match withstand Deep in the palace of long growth there stood A laurel s trunk a venerable wood Where rites divine were paid whose holy hair Was kept and cut with superstitious care This plant Latinus when his town he wall d Then found and from the tree Laurentum call d And last in honor of his new abode He vow d the laurel to the laurel s god It happen d once a boding prodigy A swarm of bees that cut the liquid sky Unknown from whence they took their airy flight Upon the topmost branch in clouds alight There with their clasping feet together clung And a long cluster from the laurel hung An ancient augur prophesied from hence Behold on Latian shores a foreign prince From the same parts of heav n his navy stands To the same parts on earth his army lands The town he conquers and the tow r commands Yet more when fair Lavinia fed the fire Before the gods and stood beside her sire Strange to relate the flames involv

danc d about her head This new portent the seer with wonder views Then pausing thus his prophecy renews The nymph who scatters flaming fires around Shall shine with honor shall herself be crown d But caus d by her irrevocable fate War shall the country waste and change the state Latinus frighted with this dire ostent For counsel to his father Faunus went And sought the shades renown d for prophecy Which near Albunea s sulph rous fountain lie To these the Latian and the Sabine land Fly when distress d and thence relief demand The priest on skins of off rings takes his ease And nightly visions in his slumber sees A swarm of thin aerial shapes appears And flutt ring round his temples deafs his ears These he consults the future fates to know From pow rs above and from the fiends below Here for the gods advice Latinus flies Off ring a hundred sheep for sacrifice Their woolly fleeces as the rites requir d He laid beneath him and to rest retir d No sooner were his eyes in slumber bound When from above a more than mortal sound Invades his ears and thus the vision spoke Seek not my seed in Latian bands to yoke Our fair Lavinia nor the gods provoke A foreign son upon thy shore descends Whose martial fame from pole to pole extends His race in arms and arts of peace renown d Not Latium shall contain nor Europe bound T is theirs whate er the sun surveys around These answers in the silent night receiv d The king himself divulg d the land believ d The fame thro all the neighb ring nations flew When now the Trojan navy was in view Beneath a shady tree the hero spread His table on the turf with cakes of bread And with his chiefs on forest fruits he fed They sate and not without the god s command Their homely fare dispatch d the hungry band Invade their trenchers next and soon devour To mend the scanty meal their cakes of flour Ascanius this observ d and smiling said See we devour the plates on which we fed The speech had omen that the Trojan race Should find repose and this the time and place Aeneas took the word and thus replies Confessing fate with wonder in his eyes All hail O earth all hail my household gods Behold the destin d place of your abodes For thus Anchises prophesied of old And this our fatal place of rest foretold When on a foreign shore instead of meat By famine forc d your trenchers you shall eat Then ease your weary Trojans will attend And the long labors of your voyage end Remember on that happy coast to build And with a trench inclose the fruitful field This was that famine this the fatal place Which ends the wand ring of our exil d race Then on to morrow s dawn your care employ To search the land and where the cities lie And what the men but give this day to joy Now pour to Jove and after Jove is blest Call great Anchises to the genial feast Crown high the goblets with a cheerful draught Enjoy the present hour adjourn the future thought Thus having said the hero bound his brows With leafy branches then perform d his vows Adoring first the genius of the place Then Earth the mother of the heav nly race The nymphs and native godheads yet unknown And Night and all the stars that gild her sable throne And ancient Cybel and Idaean Jove And last his sire below and mother queen above Then heav n s high monarch thunder d thrice aloud And thrice he shook aloft a golden cloud Soon thro the joyful camp a rumor flew The time was come their city to renew Then ev ry brow with cheerful green is crown d The feasts are doubled and the bowls go round When next the rosy morn disclos d the day The scouts to sev ral parts divide their way To learn the natives names their towns explore The coasts and trendings of the crooked shore Here Tiber flows and here Numicus stands Here warlike Latins hold the happy lands The pious chief who sought by peaceful ways To found his empire and his town to raise A hundred youths from all his train selects And to the Latian court their course directs The spacious palace where their prince resides And all their heads with wreaths of olive hides They go commission d to require a peace And carry presents to procure access Thus while they speed their pace the prince designs His new elected seat and draws the lines The Trojans round the place a rampire cast And palisades about the trenches plac d Meantime the train proceeding on their way From far the town and lofty tow rs survey At length approach the walls Without the gate They see the boys and Latian youth debate The martial prizes on the dusty plain Some drive the cars and some the coursers rein Some bend the stubborn bow for

march d the lictors bore Their awful axes and the rods before Here the tribunal stood the house of pray r And here the sacred senators repair All at large tables in long order set A ram their off ring and a ram their meat Above the portal carv d in cedar wood Plac d in their ranks their godlike grandsires stood Old Saturn with his crooked scythe on high And Italus that led the colony And ancient Janus with his double face And bunch of keys the porter of the place There good Sabinus planter of the vines On a short pruning hook his head reclines And studiously surveys his general rous wines Then warlike kings who for their country fought And honorable wounds from battle brought Around the posts hung helmets darts and spears And captive chariots axes shields and bars And broken beaks of ships the trophies of their wars Above the rest as chief of all the band Was Picus plac d a buckler in his hand His other wav d a long divining wand Girt in his Gabin gown the hero sate Yet could not with his art avoid his fate For Circe long had lov d the youth in vain Till love refus d converted to disdain Then mixing pow rful herbs with magic art She chang d his form who could not change his heart Constrain d him in a bird and made him fly With party color d plumes a chatt ring pie In this high temple on a chair of state The seat of audience old Latinus sate Then gave admission to the Trojan train And thus with pleasing accents he began Tell me ye Trojans for that name you own Nor is your course upon our coasts unknown Say what you seek and whither were you bound Were you by stress of weather cast aground Such dangers as on seas are often seen And oft befall to miserable men Or come your shipping in our ports to lay Spent and disabled in so long a way Say what you want the Latians you shall find Not forc d to goodness but by will inclin d For since the time of Saturn s holy reign His hospitable customs we retain I call to mind but time the tale has worn Th Arunci told that Dardanus tho born On Latian plains yet sought the Phrygian shore And Samothracia Samos call d before From Tuscan Coritum he claim d his birth But after when exempt from mortal earth From thence ascended to his kindred skies A god and as a god augments their sacrifice He said Ilioneus made this reply O king of Faunus royal family Nor wintry winds to Latium forc d our way Nor did the stars our wand ring course betray Willing we sought your shores and hither bound The port so long desir d at length we found From our sweet homes and ancient realms expell d Great as the greatest that the sun beheld The god began our line who rules above And as our race our king descends from Jove And hither are we come by his command To crave admission in your happy land How dire a tempest from Mycenae pour d Our plains our temples and our town devour d What was the waste of war what fierce alarms Shook Asia s crown with European arms Ev n such have heard if any such there be Whose earth is bounded by the frozen sea And such as born beneath the burning sky And sultry sun betwixt the tropics lie From that dire deluge thro the wat ry waste Such length of years such various perils past At last escap d to Latium we repair To beg what you without your want may spare The common water and the common air Sheds which ourselves will build and mean abodes Fit to receive and serve our banish d gods Nor our admission shall your realm disgrace Nor length of time our gratitude efface Besides what endless honor you shall gain To save and shelter Troy s unhappy train Now by my sov reign and his fate I swear Renown d for faith in peace for force in war Oft our alliance other lands desir d And what we seek of you of us requir d Despite not then that in our hands we bear These holy boughs sue with words of pray r Fate and the gods by their supreme command Have doom d our ships to seek the Latian land To these abodes our fleet Apollo sends Here Dardanus was born and hither tends Where Tuscan Tiber rolls with rapid force And where Numicus opes his holy source Besides our prince presents with his request Some small remains of what his sire possess d This golden charger snatch d from burning Troy Anchises did in sacrifice employ This royal robe and this tiara wore Old Priam and this golden scepter bore In full assemblies and in solemn games These purple vests were weav d by Dardan dames Thus while he spoke Latinus roll d around His eyes and fix d a while upon the ground Intent he seem d and anxious in his breast Not by the scepter mov d or kingly vest But pond ring future things of wondrous weight Succession empire and his daughter s fate On these he mus d within his thoughtful mind And then revolv d what Faunus had divin d This was the foreign prince by fate decreed To share his scepter and Lavinia s bed This was the race that sure portents foreshew To sway the world and land and sea subdue At length he rais d his cheerful head and spoke The pow rs said he the pow rs we both invoke To you and yours and mine propitious be And firm our purpose with their augury Have what you ask your presents I receive Land where and when you please with ample leave Partake and use my kingdom as your own All shall be yours while I command the crown And if my wish d alliance please your king Tell him he should not send the peace but bring Then let him not a friend s embraces fear The peace is made when I behold him here Besides this answer tell my royal guest I add to his commands my own request One only daughter heirs my crown and state Whom not our oracles nor Heav n nor fate Nor frequent prodigies permit to join With any native of th Ausonian line A foreign son in law shall come from far Such is our doom a chief renown d in war Whose race shall bear aloft the Latian name And thro the conquer d world diffuse our fame Himself to be the man the fates require I firmly judge and what I judge desire He said and then on each bestow d a steed Three hundred horses in high stables fed Stood ready shining all and smoothly dress d Of these he chose the fairest and the best To mount the Trojan troop At his command The steeds caparison d with purple stand With golden trappings glorious to behold And champ betwixt their teeth the foaming gold Then to his absent guest the king decreed A pair of coursers born of heav nly breed Who from their nostrils breath d ethereal fire Whom Circe stole from her celestial sire By substituting mares produc d on earth Whose wombs conceiv d a more than mortal birth These draw the chariot which Latinus sends And the rich present to the prince commends Sublime on stately steeds the Trojans borne To their expecting lord with peace return But jealous Juno from Pachynus height As she from Argos took her airy flight Beheld with envious eyes this hateful sight She saw the Trojan and his joyful train Descend upon the shore desert the main Design a town and with unhop d success Th embassadors return with promis d peace Then pierc d with pain she shook her haughty head Sigh d from her inward soul and thus she said O hated offspring of my Phrygian foes O fates of Troy which Juno s fates oppose Could they not fall unpitied on the plain But slain revive and taken scape again When execrable Troy in ashes lay Thro fires and swords and seas they forc d their way Then vanquish d Juno must in vain contend Her rage disarm d her empire at an end Breathless and tir d is all my fury spent Or does my glutted spleen at length relent As if t were little from their town to chase I thro the seas pursued their exil d race Ingag d the heav ns oppos d the stormy main But billows roar d and tempests rag d in vain What have my Scyllas and my Syrtes done When these they overpass and those they shun On Tiber s shores they land secure of fate Triumphant o er the storms and Juno s hate Mars could in mutual blood the Centaurs bathe And Jove himself gave way to Cynthia s wrath Who sent the tusky boar to Calydon What great offense had either people done But I the consort of the Thunderer Have wag d a long and unsuccessful war With various arts and arms in vain have toil d And by a mortal man at length am foil d If native pow r prevail not shall I doubt To seek for needful succor from without If Jove and Heav n my just desires deny Hell shall the pow r of Heav n and Jove supply Grant that the Fates have firm d by their decree The Trojan race to reign in Italy At least I can defer the nuptial day And with protracted wars the peace delay With blood the dear alliance shall be bought And both the people near destruction brought So shall the son in law and father join With ruin war and waste of either line O fatal maid thy marriage is endow d With Phrygian Latian and Rutulian blood Bellona leads thee to thy lover s hand Another queen brings forth another brand To burn with foreign fires another land A second Paris diff ring but in name Shall fire his country with a second flame Thus having said she sinks beneath the ground With furious haste and shoots the Stygian sound To rouse Alecto from th infernal seat Of her dire sisters and their dark retreat This Fury fit for her intent she chose One who delights in wars and human woes Ev n Pluto hates his own misshapen race Her sister Furies fly her hideous face So frightful are the forms the monster takes So fierce the hissings of her speckled snakes Her Juno finds and thus inflames her spite O virgin daughter of eternal Night Give me this once thy labor to sustain My right and execute my just disdain Let not the Trojans with a feign d pretense Of proffer d peace delude the Latian prince Expel from Italy that odious name And let not Juno suffer in her fame T is thine to ruin realms o erturn a state Betwixt the dearest friends to raise debate And kindle kindred blood to mutual hate Thy hand o er towns the fun ral torch displays And forms a thousand ills ten thousand ways Now shake out thy fruitful breast the seeds Of envy discord and of cruel deeds Confound the peace establish d and prepare Their souls to hatred and their hands to war Smear d as she was with black Gorgonian blood The Fury sprang above the Stygian flood And on her wicker wings sublime thro night She to the Latian palace took her flight There sought the queen s apartment stood before The peaceful threshold and besieg d the door Restless Amata lay her swelling breast Fir d with disdain for Turnus dispossess d And the new nuptials of the Trojan guest From her black bloody locks the Fury shakes Her darling plague the fav rite of her snakes With her full force she threw the poisonous dart And fix d it deep within Amata s heart That thus envenom d she might kindle rage And sacrifice to strife her house husband s age Unseen unfelt the fiery serpent skims Betwixt her linen and her naked limbs His baleful breath inspiring as he glides Now like a chain around her neck he rides Now like a fillet to her head repairs And with his circling volumes folds her hairs At first the silent venom slid with ease And seiz d her cooler senses by degrees Then ere th infected mass was fir d too far In plaintive accents she began the war And thus bespoke her husband Shall she said A wand ring prince enjoy Lavinia s bed If nature plead not in a parent s heart Pity my tears and pity her desert I know my dearest lord the time will come You in vain reverse your cruel doom The faithless pirate soon will set to sea And bear the royal virgin far away A guest like him a Trojan guest before In shew of friendship sought the Spartan shore And ravish d Helen from her husband bore Think on a king s inviolable word And think on Turnus her once plighted lord To this false foreigner you give your throne And wrong a friend a kinsman and a son Resume your ancient care and if the god Your sire and you resolve on foreign blood Know all are foreign in a larger sense Not born your subjects or deriv d from hence Then if the line of Turnus you retrace He springs from Inachus of Argive race But when she saw her reasons idly spent And could not move him from his fix d intent She flew to rage for now the snake possess d Her vital parts and poison d all her breast She raves she runs with a distracted pace And fills with horrid howls the public place And as young striplings whip the top for sport On the smooth pavement of an empty court The wooden engine flies and whirls about Admir d with clamors of the beardless rout They lash aloud each other they provoke And lend their little souls at ev ry stroke Thus fares the queen and thus her fury blows Amidst the crowd and kindles as she goes Nor yet content she strains her malice more And adds new ills to those contriv d before She flies the town and mixing with a throng Of madding matrons bears the bride along Wand ring thro woods and wilds and devious ways And with these arts the Trojan match delays She feign d the rites of Bacchus cried aloud And to the buxom god the virgin vow d Evoe O Bacchus thus began the song And Evoe answer d all the female throng O virgin worthy thee alone she cried O worthy thee alone the crew replied For thee she feeds her hair she leads thy dance And with thy winding ivy wreathes her lance Like fury seiz d the rest the progress known All seek the mountains and forsake the town All clad in skins of beasts the jav lin bear Give to the wanton winds their flowing hair And shrieks and shoutings rend the suff ring air The queen herself inspir d with rage divine Shook high above her head a flaming pine Then roll d her haggard eyes around the throng And sung in Turnus name the nuptial song Io ye Latian dames if any here Hold your unhappy queen Amata dear If there be here she said who dare maintain My right nor think the name of mother vain Unbind your fillets loose your flowing hair And orgies and nocturnal rites prepare Amata s breast the Fury thus invades And fires with rage amid the sylvan shades Then when she found her venom spread so far The royal house embroil d in civil war Rais d on her dusky wings she cleaves the skies And seeks the palace where young Turnus lies His town as fame reports was built of old By Danae pregnant with almighty gold Who fled her father s rage and with a train Of following Argives thro the stormy main Driv n by the southern blasts was fated here to reign T was Ardua once now Ardea s name it bears Once a fair city now consum d with years Here in his lofty palace Turnus lay Betwixt the confines of the night and day Secure in sleep The Fury laid aside Her looks and limbs and with new methods tried The foulness of th infernal form to hide Propp d on a staff she takes a trembling mien Her face is furrow d and her front obscene Deep dinted wrinkles on her cheek she draws Sunk are her eyes and toothless are her jaws Her hoary hair with holy fillets bound Her temples with an olive wreath are crown d Old Chalybe who kept the sacred fane Of Juno now she seem d and thus began Appearing in a dream to rouse the careless man Shall Turnus then such endless toil sustain In fighting fields and conquer towns in vain Win for a Trojan head to wear the prize Usurp thy crown enjoy thy victories The bride and scepter which thy blood has bought The king transfers and foreign heirs are sought Go now deluded man and seek again New toils new dangers on the dusty plain Repel the Tuscan foes their city seize Protect the Latians in luxurious ease This dream all pow rful Juno sends I bear Her mighty mandates and her words you hear Haste arm your Ardeans issue to the plain With fate to friend assault the Trojan train Their thoughtless chiefs their painted ships that lie In Tiber s mouth with fire and sword destroy The Latian king unless he shall submit Own his old promise and his new forget Let him in arms the pow r of Turnus prove And learn to fear whom he disdains to love For such is Heav n s command The youthful prince With scorn replied and made this bold defense You tell me mother what I knew before The Phrygian fleet is landed on the shore I neither fear nor will provoke the war My fate is Juno s most peculiar care But time has made you dote and vainly tell Of arms imagin d in your lonely cell Go be the temple and the gods your care Permit to men the thought of peace and war These haughty words Alecto s rage provoke And frighted Turnus trembled as she spoke Her eyes grow stiffen d and with sulphur burn Her hideous looks and hellish form return Her curling snakes with hissings fill the place And open all the furies of her face Then darting fire from her malignant eyes She cast him backward as he strove to rise And ling ring sought to frame some new replies High on her head she rears two twisted snakes Her chains she rattles and her whip she shakes And churning bloody foam thus loudly speaks Behold whom time has made to dote and tell Of arms imagin d in her lonely cell Behold the Fates infernal minister War death destruction in my hand I bear Thus having said her smold ring torch impress d With her full force she plung d into his breast Aghast he wak d and starting from his bed Cold sweat in clammy drops his limbs o erspread Arms arms he cries my sword and shield prepare He breathes defiance blood and mortal war So when with crackling flames a caldron fries The bubbling waters from the bottom rise Above the brims they force their fiery way Black vapors climb aloft and cloud the day The peace polluted thus a chosen band He first commissions to the Latian land In threat ning embassy then rais d the rest To meet in arms th intruding Trojan guest To force the foes from the Lavinian shore And Italy s indanger d peace restore Himself alone an equal match he boasts To fight the Phrygian and Ausonian hosts The gods invok d the Rutuli prepare Their arms and warn each other to the war His beauty these and those his blooming age The rest his house and his own fame ingage While Turnus urges thus his enterprise The Stygian Fury to the Trojans flies New frauds invents and takes a steepy stand Which overlooks the vale with wide command Where fair Ascanius and his youthful train With horns and hounds a hunting match ordain And pitch their toils around the shady plain The Fury fires the pack they snuff they vent And feed their hungry nostrils with the scent Twas of a well grown stag whose antlers rise High o er his front his beams invade the skies From this light cause th infernal maid prepares The country churls to mischief hate and wars The stately beast the two Tyrrhidae bred Snatch d from his dams and the tame youngling fed Their father Tyrrheus did his fodder bring Tyrrheus chief ranger to the Latian king Their sister Silvia cherish d with her care The little wanton and did wreaths prepare To hang his budding horns with ribbons tied His tender neck and comb d his silken hide And bathed his body Patient of command In time he grew and growing us d to hand He waited at his master s board for food Then sought his salvage kindred in the wood Where grazing all the day at night he came To his known lodgings and his country dame This household beast that us d the woodland grounds Was view d at first by the young hero s hounds As down the stream he swam to seek retreat In the cool waters and to quench his heat Ascanius young and eager of his game Soon bent his bow uncertain in his aim But the dire fiend the fatal arrow guides Which pierc d his bowels thro his panting sides The bleeding creature issues from the floods Possess d with fear and seeks his known abodes His old familiar hearth and household gods He falls he fills the house with heavy groans Implores their pity and his pain bemoans Young Silvia beats her breast and cries aloud For succor from the clownish neighborhood The churls assemble for the fiend who lay In the close woody covert urg d their way One with a brand yet burning from the flame Arm d with a knotty club another came Whate er they catch or find without their care Their fury makes an instrument of war Tyrrheus the foster father of the beast Then clench d a hatchet in his horny fist But held his hand from the descending stroke And left his wedge within the cloven oak To whet their courage and their rage provoke And now the goddess exercis d in ill Who watch d an hour to work her impious will Ascends the roof and to her crooked horn Such as was then by Latian shepherds borne Adds all her breath the rocks and woods around And mountains tremble at th infernal sound The sacred lake of Trivia from afar The Veline fountains and sulphureous Nar Shake at the baleful blast the signal of the war Young mothers wildly stare with fear possess d And strain their helpless infants to their breast The clowns a boist rous rude ungovern d crew With furious haste to the loud summons flew The pow rs of Troy then issuing on the plain With fresh recruits their youthful chief sustain Not theirs a raw and unexperienc d train But a firm body of embattled men At first while fortune favor d neither side The fight with clubs and burning brands was tried But now both parties reinforc d the fields Are bright with flaming swords and brazen shields A shining harvest either host displays And shoots against the sun with equal rays Thus when a black brow d gust begins to rise White foam at first on the curl d ocean fries Then roars the main the billows mount the skies Till by the fury of the storm full blown The muddy bottom o er the clouds is thrown First Almon falls old Tyrrheus eldest care Pierc d with an arrow from the distant war Fix d in his throat the flying weapon stood And stopp d his breath and drank his vital blood Huge heaps of slain around the body rise Among the rest the rich Galesus lies A good old man while peace he preach d in vain Amidst the madness of th unruly train Five herds five bleating flocks his pastures fill d His lands a hundred yoke of oxen till d Thus while in equal scales their fortune stood The Fury bath d them in each other s blood Then having fix d the fight exulting flies And bears fulfill d her promise to the skies To Juno thus she speaks Behold It is done The blood already drawn the war begun The discord is complete nor can they cease The dire debate nor you command the peace Now since the Latian and the Trojan brood Have tasted vengeance and the sweets of blood Speak and my pow r shall add this office more The neighb ing nations of th Ausonian shore Shall hear the dreadful rumor from afar Of arm d invasion and embrace the war Then Juno thus The grateful work is done The seeds of discord sow d the war begun Frauds fears and fury have possess d the state And fix d the causes of a lasting hate A bloody Hymen shall th alliance join Betwixt the Trojan and Ausonian line But thou with speed to night and hell repair For not the gods nor angry Jove will bear Thy lawless wand ring walks in upper air Leave what remains to me Saturnia said The sullen fiend her sounding wings display d Unwilling left the light and sought the nether shade In midst of Italy well known to fame There lies a lake Amsanctus is the name Below the lofty mounts on either side Thick forests the forbidden entrance hide Full in the center of the sacred wood An arm arises of the Stygian flood Which breaking from beneath with bellowing sound Whirls the black waves and rattling stones around Here Pluto pants for breath from out his cell And opens wide the grinning jaws of hell To this infernal lake the Fury flies Here hides her hated head and frees the lab ring skies Saturnian Juno now with double care Attends the fatal process of the war The clowns return d from battle bear the slain Implore the gods and to their king complain The corps of Almon and the rest are shown Shrieks clamors murmurs fill the frighted town Ambitious Turnus in the press appears And aggravating crimes augments their fears Proclaims his private injuries aloud A solemn promise made and disavow d A foreign son is sought and a mix d mungril brood Then they whose mothers frantic with their fear In woods and wilds the flags of Bacchus bear And lead his dances with dishevel d hair Increase the clamor and the war demand Such was Amata s interest in the land Against the public sanctions of the peace Against all omens of their ill success With fates averse the rout in arms resort To force their monarch and insult the court But like a rock unmov d a rock that braves The raging tempest and the rising waves Propp d on himself he stands his solid sides Wash off the seaweeds and the sounding tides So stood the pious prince unmov d and long Sustain d the madness of the noisy throng But when he found that Juno s pow r prevail d And all the methods of cool counsel fail d He calls the gods to witness their offense Disclaims the war asserts his innocence Hurried by fate he cries and borne before A furious wind we have the faithful shore O more than madmen you yourselves shall bear The guilt of blood and sacrilegious war Thou Turnus shalt atone it by thy fate And pray to Heav n for peace but pray too late For me my stormy voyage at an end I to the port of death securely tend The fun ral pomp which to your kings you pay Is all I want and all you take away He said no more but in his walls confin d Shut out the woes which he too well divin d Nor with the rising storm would vainly strive But left the helm and let the vessel drive A solemn custom was observ d of old Which Latium held and now the Romans hold Their standard when in fighting fields they rear Against the fierce Hyrcanians or declare The Scythian Indian or Arabian war Or from the boasting Parthians would regain Their eagles lost in Carrhae s bloody plain Two gates of steel the name of Mars they bear And still are worship d with religious fear Before his temple stand the dire abode And the fear d issues of the furious god Are fenc d with brazen bolts without the gates The wary guardian Janus doubly waits Then when the sacred senate votes the wars The Roman consul their decree declares And in his robes the sounding gates unbars The youth in military shouts arise And the loud trumpets break the yielding skies These rites of old by sov reign princes us d Were the king s office but the king refus d Deaf to their cries nor would the gates unbar Of sacred peace or loose th imprison d war But hid his head and safe from loud alarms Abhorr d the wicked ministry of arms Then heav n s imperious queen shot down from high At her approach the brazen hinges fly The gates are forc d and ev ry falling bar And like a tempest issues out the war The peaceful cities of th Ausonian shore Lull d in their ease and undisturb d before Are all on fire and some with studious care Their restiff steeds in sandy plains prepare Some their soft limbs in painful marches try And war is all their wish and arms the general ral cry Part scour the rusty shields with seam and part New grind the blunted ax and point the dart With joy they view the waving ensigns fly And hear the trumpet s clangor pierce the sky Five cities forge their arms th Atinian pow rs Antemnae Tibur with her lofty tow rs Ardea the proud the Crustumerian town All these of old were places of

seems By his broad shoulders and gigantic limbs Of heav nly part and part of earthly blood A mortal woman mixing with a god For strong Alcides after he had slain The triple Geryon drove from conquer d Spain His captive herds and thence in triumph led On Tuscan Tiber s flow ry banks they fed Then on Mount Aventine the son of Jove The priestess Rhea found and forc d to love For arms his men long piles and jav lins bore And poles with pointed steel their foes in battle gore Like Hercules himself his son appears In salvage pomp a lion s hide he wears About his shoulders hangs the shaggy skin The teeth and gaping jaws severely grin Thus like the god his father homely dress d He strides into the hall a horrid guest Then two twin brothers from fair Tibur came Which from their brother Tiburs took the name Fierce Coras and Catillus void of fear Arm d Argive horse they led and in the front appear Like cloud born Centaurs from the mountain s height With rapid course descending to the fight They rush along the rattling woods give way The branches bend before their sweepy sway Nor was Praeneste s founder wanting there Whom fame reports the son of Mulciber Found in the fire and foster d in the plains A shepherd and a king at once he reigns And leads to Turnus aid his country swains His own Praeneste sends a chosen band With those who plow Saturnia s Gabine land Besides the succor which cold Anien yields The rocks of Hernicus and dewy fields Anagnia fat and Father Amasene A num rous rout but all of naked men Nor arms they wear nor swords and bucklers wield Nor drive the chariot thro the dusty field But whirl from leathern slings huge balls of lead And spoils of yellow wolves adorn their head The left foot naked when they march to fight But in a bull s raw hide they sheathe the right Messapus next great Neptune was his sire Secure of steel and fated from the fire In pomp appears and with his ardor warms A heartless train unexercis d in arms The just Faliscans he to battle brings And those who live where Lake Ciminia springs And where Feronia s grove and temple stands Who till Fescennian or Flavinian lands All these in order march and marching sing The warlike actions of their sea born king Like a long team of snowy swans on high Which clap their wings and cleave the liquid sky When homeward from their wat ry pastures borne They sing and Asia s lakes their notes return Not one who heard their music from afar Would think these troops an army train d to war But flocks of fowl that when the tempests roar With their hoarse gabbling seek the silent shore Then Clausus came who led a num rous band Of troops embodied from the Sabine land And in himself alone an army brought T was he the noble Claudian race begot The Claudian race ordain d in times to come To share the greatness of imperial Rome He led the Cures forth of old renown Mutuscans from their olive bearing town And all th Eretian pow rs besides a band That follow d from Velinum s dewy land And Amiternian troops of mighty fame And mountaineers that from Severus came And from the craggy cliffs of Tetrica And those where yellow Tiber takes his way And where Himella s wanton waters play Casperia sends her arms with those that lie By Fabaris and fruitful Foruli The warlike aids of Horta next appear And the cold Nursians come to close the rear Mix d with the natives born of Latine blood Whom Allia washes with her fatal flood Not thicker billows beat the Libyan main When pale Orion sets in wintry rain Nor thicker harvests on rich Hermus rise Or Lycian fields when Phoebus burns the skies Than stand these troops their bucklers ring around Their trampling turns the turf and shakes the solid ground High in his chariot then Halesus came A foe by birth to Troy s unhappy name From Agamemnon born to Turnus aid A thousand men the youthful hero led Who till the Massic soil for wine renown d And fierce Auruncans from their hilly ground And those who live by Sidicinian shores And where with shoaly fords Vulturnus roars Cales and Osca s old inhabitants And rough Saticulans inur d to wants Light demi lances from afar they throw Fasten d with leathern thongs to gall the foe Short

But that short isle th ambitious youth disdain d And o er Campania stretch d his ample sway Where swelling Sarnus seeks the Tyrrhene sea O er Batulum and where Abella sees From her high tow rs the harvest of her trees And these as was the Teuton use of old Wield brazen swords and brazen bucklers hold Sling weighty stones when from afar they fight Their casques are cork a covering thick and

to battle still prepar d Their soil was barren and their hearts were hard Umbro the priest the proud Marrubians led By King Archippus sent to Turnus aid And peaceful olives crown d his hoary head His

herbs and magic art To cure the wound giv n by the Dardan dart Yet his untimely fate th Angitian woods In sighs remurmur d to the Fucine floods The son of fam d Hippolytus was there Fam d as his sire

assembled all his pow rs His standard planted on Laurentum s tow rs When now the sprightly trumpet from afar Had giv n the signal of approaching war Had rous d the neighing steeds to scour the fields While the fierce riders clatter d on their shields Trembling with rage the Latian youth prepare To join th allies and headlong rush to war Fierce Ufens and Messapus led the crowd With bold Mezentius who blasphem d aloud These thro the country took their wasteful course The fields to forage and to gather force Then Venulus to Diomede they send To beg his aid Ausonia to defend Declare the common danger and inform The Grecian leader of the growing storm Aeneas landed on the Latian coast With banish d gods and with a baffled host Yet now aspir d to conquest of the state And claim d a title from the gods and fate What num rous nations in his quarrel came And how they spread his formidable name What he design d what mischief might arise If fortune favor d his first enterprise Was left for him to weigh whose equal fears And common interest was involv d in theirs While Turnus and th allies thus urge the war The Trojan floating in a flood of care Beholds the tempest which his foes prepare This way and that he turns his anxious mind Thinks and rejects the counsels he design d Explores himself in vain in ev ry part And gives no rest to his distracted heart So when the sun by day or moon by night Strike on the polish d brass their trembling light The glitt ring species here and there divide And cast their dubious beams from side to side Now on the walls now on the pavement play And to the ceiling flash the glaring day T was night and weary nature lull d asleep The birds of air and fishes of the deep And beasts and mortal men The Trojan chief Was laid on Tiber s banks oppress d with grief And found in silent slumber late relief Then thro the shadows of the poplar wood Arose the father of the Roman flood An azure robe was o er his body spread A wreath of shady reeds adorn d his head Thus manifest to sight the god appear d And with these pleasing words his sorrow cheer d Undoubted offspring of ethereal race O long expected in this promis d place Who thro the foes hast borne thy banish d gods Restor d them to their hearths and old abodes This is thy happy home the clime where fate Ordains thee to restore the Trojan state Fear not The war shall end in lasting peace And all the rage of haughty Juno cease And that this nightly vision may not seem Th effect of fancy or an idle dream A sow beneath an oak shall lie along All white herself and white her thirty young When thirty rolling years have run their race Thy son Ascanius on this empty space Shall build a royal town of lasting fame Which from this omen shall receive the name Time shall approve the truth For what remains And how with sure success to crown thy pains With patience next attend A banish d band Driv n with Evander from th Arcadian land Have planted here and plac d on high their walls Their town the founder Pallanteum calls Deriv d from Pallas his great grandsire s name But the fierce Latians old possession claim With war infesting the new colony These make thy friends and on their aid rely To thy free passage I submit my streams Wake son of Venus from thy pleasing dreams And when the setting stars are lost in day To Juno s pow r thy just devotion pay With sacrifice the wrathful queen appease Her pride at length shall fall her fury cease When thou return saint victorious from the war Perform thy vows to me with grateful care The god am I whose yellow water flows Around these fields and fattens as it goes Tiber my name among the rolling floods Renown d on earth esteem d among the gods This is my certain seat In times to come My waves shall wash the walls of mighty Rome He said and plung d below While yet he spoke His dream Aeneas and his sleep forsook He rose and looking up beheld the skies With purple blushing and the day arise Then water in his hollow palm he took From Tiber s flood and thus the pow rs bespoke Laurentian nymphs by whom the streams are fed And Father Tiber in thy sacred bed Receive Aeneas and from danger keep Whatever fount whatever holy deep Conceals thy wat ry stores where er they rise And bubbling from below salute the skies Thou king of horned floods whose plenteous urn Suffices fatness to the fruitful corn For this thy kind compassion of our woes Shalt share my morning song and ev ning vows But O be present to thy people s aid And firm the gracious promise thou hast made Thus having said two galleys from his stores With care he chooses mans and fits with oars Now on the shore the fatal swine is found Wondrous to tell She lay along the ground Her well fed offspring at her udders hung She white herself and white her thirty young Aeneas takes the mother and her brood And all on Juno s altar are bestow d The foll wing night and the succeeding day Propitious Tiber smooth d his wat ry way He roll d his river back and pois d he stood A gentle swelling and a peaceful flood The Trojans mount their ships they put from shore Borne on the waves and scarcely dip an oar Shouts from the land give omen to their course And the pitch d vessels glide with easy force The woods and waters wonder at the gleam Of shields and painted ships that stem the stream One summer s night and one whole day they pass Betwixt the greenwood shades and cut the liquid glass The fiery sun had finish d half his race Look d back and doubted in the middle space When they from far beheld the rising tow rs The tops of sheds and shepherds lowly bow rs Thin as they stood which then of homely clay Now rise in marble from the Roman sway These cots Evander s kingdom mean and poor The Trojan saw and turn d his ships to shore T was on a solemn day th Arcadian states The king and prince without the city gates Then paid their off rings in a sacred grove To Hercules the warrior son of Jove Thick clouds of rolling smoke involve the skies And fat of entrails on his altar fries But when they saw the ships that stemm d the flood And glitter d thro the covert of the wood They rose with fear and left th unfinish d feast Till dauntless Pallas reassur d the rest To pay the rites Himself without delay A jav lin seiz d and singly took his way Then gain d a rising ground and call d from far Resolve me strangers whence and what you are Your bus ness here and bring you peace or war High on the stern Aeneas his stand And held a branch of olive in his hand While thus he spoke The Phrygians arms you see Expell d from Troy provok d in Italy By Latian foes with war unjustly made At first affianc d and at last betray d This message bear The Trojans and their chief Bring holy peace and beg the king s relief Struck with so great a name and all on fire The youth replies Whatever you require Your fame exacts Upon our shores descend A welcome guest and what you wish a friend He said and downward hasting to the strand Embrac d the stranger prince and join d his hand Conducted to the grove Aeneas broke The silence first and thus the king bespoke Best of the Greeks to whom by fate s command I bear these peaceful branches in my hand Undaunted I approach you tho I know Your birth is Grecian and your land my foe From Atreus tho your ancient lineage came And both the brother kings your kindred claim Yet my self conscious worth your high renown Your virtue thro the neighb ring nations blown Our fathers mingled blood Apollo s voice Have led me hither less by need than choice Our founder Dardanus as fame has sung And Greeks acknowledge from Electra sprung Electra from the loins of Atlas came Atlas whose head sustains the starry frame Your sire is Mercury whom long before On cold Cyllene s top fair Maia bore Maia the fair on fame if we rely Was Atlas daughter who sustains the sky Thus from one common source our streams divide Ours is the Trojan yours th Arcadian side Rais d by these hopes I sent no news before Nor ask d your leave nor did your faith implore But come without a pledge my own ambassador The same Rutulians who with arms pursue The Trojan race are equal foes to you Our host expell d what farther force can stay The victor troops from universal sway Then will they stretch their pow r athwart the land And either sea from side to side command Receive our offer d faith and give us thine Ours is a general rous and experienc d line We want not hearts nor bodies for the war In council cautious and in fields we dare He said and while spoke with piercing eyes Evander view d the man with vast surprise Pleas d with his action ravish d with his face Then answer d briefly with a royal grace O valiant leader of the Trojan line In whom the features of thy father shine How I recall Anchises how I see His motions mien and all my friend in thee Long tho it be t is fresh within my mind When Priam to his sister s court design d A welcome visit with a friendly stay And thro th Arcadian kingdom took his way Then past a boy the callow down began To shade my chin and call me first a man I saw the shining train with vast delight And Priam s goodly person pleas d my sight But great Anchises far above the rest With awful wonder fir d my youthful breast I long d to join in friendship s holy bands Our mutual hearts and plight our mutual hands I first accosted him I sued I sought And with a loving force to Pheneus brought He gave me when at length constrain d to go A Lycian quiver and a Gnossian bow A vest embroider d glorious to behold And two rich bridles with their bits of gold Which my son s coursers in obedience hold The league you ask I offer as your right And when to morrow s sun reveals the light With swift supplies you shall be sent away Now celebrate with us this solemn day Whose holy rites admit no long delay Honor our annual feast and take your seat With friendly welcome at a homely treat Thus having said the bowls remov d for fear The youths replac d and soon restor d the cheer On sods of turf he set the soldiers round A maple throne rais d higher from the ground Receiv d the Trojan chief and o er the bed A lion s shaggy hide for ornament they spread The loaves were serv d in canisters the wine In bowls the priest renew d the rites divine Broil d entrails are their food and beef s continued chine But when the rage of hunger was repress d Thus spoke Evander to his royal guest These rites these altars and this feast O king From no vain fears or superstition spring Or blind devotion or from blinder chance Or heady zeal or brutal ignorance But sav d from danger with a grateful sense The labors of a god we recompense See from afar yon rock that mates the sky About whose feet such heaps of rubbish lie Such indigested ruin bleak and bare How desart now it stands expos d in air T was once a robber s den inclos d around With living stone and deep beneath the ground The monster Cacus more than half a beast This hold impervious to the sun possess d The pavement ever foul with human gore Heads and their mangled members hung the door Vulcan this plague begot and like his sire Black clouds he belch d and flakes of livid fire Time long expected eas d us of our load And brought the needful presence of a god Th avenging force of Hercules from Spain Arriv d in triumph from Geryon slain Thrice liv d the giant and thrice liv d in vain His prize the lowing herds Alcides drove Near Tiber s bank to graze the shady grove Allur d with hope of plunder and intent By force to rob by fraud to circumvent The brutal Cacus as by chance they stray d Four oxen thence and four fair kine convey d And lest the printed footsteps might be seen He dragg d em backwards to his rocky den The tracks averse a lying notice gave And led the searcher backward from the cave Meantime the herdsman hero shifts his place To find fresh pasture and untrodden grass The beasts who miss d their mates fill d all around With bellowings and the rocks restor d the sound One heifer who had heard her love complain Roar d from the cave and made the project vain Alcides found the fraud with rage he shook And toss d about his head his knotted oak Swift as the winds or Scythian arrows flight He clomb with eager haste th aerial height Then first we saw the monster mend his pace Fear his eyes and paleness in his face Confess d the god s approach Trembling he springs As terror had increas d his feet with wings Nor stay d for stairs but down the depth he threw His body on his back the door he drew The door a rib of living rock with pains His father hew d it out and bound with iron chains He broke the heavy links the mountain clos d And bars and levers to his foe oppos d The wretch had hardly made his dungeon fast The fierce avenger came with bounding haste Survey d the mouth of the forbidden hold And here and there his raging eyes he roll d He gnash d his teeth and thrice he compass d round With winged speed the circuit of the ground Thrice at the cavern s mouth he pull d in vain And panting thrice desisted from his pain A pointed flinty rock all bare and black Grew gibbous from behind the mountain s back Owls ravens all ill omens of the night Here built their nests and hither wing d their flight The leaning head hung threat ning o er the flood And nodded to the left The hero stood Adverse with planted feet and from the right Tugg d at the solid stone with all his might Thus heav d the fix d foundations of the rock Gave way heav n echo d at the rattling shock Tumbling it chok d the flood on either side The banks leap backward and the streams divide The sky shrunk upward with unusual dread And trembling Tiber div d beneath his bed The court of Cacus stands reveal d to sight The cavern glares with new admitted light So the pent vapors with a rumbling sound Heave from below and rend the hollow ground A sounding flaw succeeds and from on high The gods with hate beheld the nether sky The ghosts repine at violated night And curse th invading sun and sicken at the sight The graceless monster caught in open day Inclos d and in despair to fly away Howls horrible from underneath and fills His hollow palace with unmanly yells The hero stands above and from afar Plies him with darts and stones and distant war He from his nostrils huge mouth expires Black clouds of smoke amidst his father s fires Gath ring with each repeated blast the night To make uncertain aim and erring sight The wrathful god then plunges from above And where in thickest waves the sparkles drove There lights and wades thro fumes and gropes his way Half sing d half stifled till he grasps his prey The monster spewing fruitless flames he found He squeez d his throat he writh d his neck around And in a knot his crippled members bound Then from their sockets tore his burning eyes Roll d on a heap the breathless robber lies The doors unbarr d receive the rushing day And thoro lights disclose the ravish d prey The bulls redeem d breathe open air again Next by the feet they drag him from his den The wond ring neighborhood with glad surprise Behold his shagged breast his giant size His mouth that flames no more and his extinguish d eyes From that auspicious day with rites divine We worship at the hero s holy shrine Potitius first ordain d these annual vows As priests were added the Pinarian house Who rais d this altar in the sacred shade Where honors ever due for ever shall be paid For these deserts and this high virtue shown Ye warlike youths your heads with garlands crown Fill high the goblets with a sparkling flood And with deep draughts invoke our common god This said a double wreath Evander twin d And poplars black and white his temples bind Then brims his ample bowl With like design The rest invoke the gods with sprinkled wine Meantime the sun descended from the skies And the bright evening star began to rise And now the priests Potitius at their head In skins of beasts involv d the long procession led Held high the flaming tapers in their hands As custom had prescrib d their holy bands Then with a second course the tables load And with full chargers offer to the god The Salii sing and cense his altars round With Saban smoke their heads with poplar bound One choir of old another of the young To dance and bear the burthen of the song The lay records the labors and the praise And all th immortal acts of Hercules First how the mighty babe when swath d in bands The serpents strangled with his infant hands Then as in years and matchless force he grew Th Oechalian walls and Trojan overthrew Besides a thousand hazards they relate Procur d by Juno s and Eurystheus hate Thy hands unconquer d hero could subdue The cloud born Centaurs and the monster crew Nor thy resistless arm the bull withstood Nor he the roaring terror of the wood The triple porter of the Stygian seat With lolling tongue lay fawning at thy feet And seiz d with fear forgot his mangled meat Th infernal waters trembled at thy sight Thee god no face of danger could affright Not huge Typhoeus nor th unnumber d snake Increas d with hissing heads in Lerna s lake Hail Jove s undoubted son an added grace To heav n and the great author of thy race Receive the grateful off rings which we pay And smile propitious on thy solemn day In numbers thus they sung above the rest The den and death of Cacus crown the feast The woods to hollow vales convey the sound The vales to hills and hills the notes rebound The rites perform d the cheerful train retire Betwixt young Pallas and his aged sire The Trojan pass d the city to survey And pleasing talk beguil d the tedious way The stranger cast around his curious eyes New objects viewing still with new surprise With greedy joy enquires of various things And acts and monuments of ancient kings Then thus the founder of the Roman tow rs These woods were first the seat of sylvan pow rs Of Nymphs and Fauns and salvage men who took Their birth from trunks of trees and stubborn oak Nor laws they knew nor manners nor the care Of lab ring oxen or the shining share Nor arts of gain nor what they gain d to spare Their exercise the chase the running flood Supplied their thirst the trees supplied their food Then Saturn came who fled the pow r of Jove Robb d of his realms and banish d from above The men dispers d on hills to towns he brought And laws ordain d and civil customs taught And Latium call d the land where safe he lay From his unduteous son and his usurping sway With his mild empire peace and plenty came And hence the golden times deriv d their name A more degenerate and discolor d age Succeeded this with avarice and rage Th Ausonians then and bold Sicanians came And Saturn s empire often chang d the name Then kings gigantic Tybris and the rest With arbitrary sway the land oppress d For Tiber s flood was Albula before Till from the tyrant s fate his name it bore I last arriv d driv n from my native home By fortune s pow r and fate s resistless doom Long toss d on seas I sought this happy land Warn d by my mother nymph and call d by Heav n s command Thus walking on he spoke and shew d the gate Since call d Carmental by the Roman state Where stood an altar sacred to the name Of old Carmenta the prophetic dame Who to her son foretold th Aenean race Sublime in fame and Rome s imperial place Then shews the forest which in after times Fierce Romulus for perpetrated crimes A sacred refuge made with this the shrine Where Pan below the rock had rites divine Then tells of Argus death his murder d guest Whose grave and tomb his innocence attest Thence to the steep Tarpeian rock he leads Now roof d with gold then thatch d with homely reeds A reverent fear such superstition reigns Among the rude ev n then possess d the swains Some god they knew what god they could not tell Did there amidst the sacred horror dwell Th Arcadians thought him Jove and said they saw The mighty Thund rer with majestic awe Who took his shield and dealt his bolts around And scatter d tempests on the teeming ground Then saw two heaps of ruins once they stood Two stately towns on either side the flood Saturnia s and Janicula s remains And either place the founder s name retains Discoursing thus together they resort Where poor Evander kept his country court They view d the ground of Rome s litigious hall Once oxen low d where now the lawyers bawl Then stooping thro the narrow gate they press d When thus the king bespoke his Trojan guest Mean as it is this palace and this door Receiv d Alcides then a conqueror Dare to be poor accept our homely food Which feasted him and emulate a god Then underneath a lowly roof he led The weary prince and laid him on a bed The stuffing leaves with hides of bears o erspread Now Night had shed her silver dews around And with her sable wings embrac d the ground When love s fair goddess anxious for her son New tumults rising and new wars begun Couch d with her husband in his golden bed With these alluring words invokes his aid And that her pleasing speech his mind may move Inspires each accent with the charms of love While cruel fate conspir d with Grecian pow rs To level with the ground the Trojan tow rs I ask d not aid th unhappy to restore Nor did the succor of thy skill implore Nor urg d the labors of my lord in vain A sinking empire longer to sustain Tho much I ow d to Priam s house and more The dangers of Aeneas did deplore But now by Jove s command and fate s decree His race is doom d to reign in Italy With humble suit I beg thy needful art O still propitious pow r that rules my heart A mother kneels a suppliant for her son By Thetis and Aurora thou wert won To forge impenetrable shields and grace With fated arms a less illustrious race Behold what haughty nations are combin d Against the relics of the Phrygian kind With fire and sword my people to destroy And conquer Venus twice in conqu ring Troy She said and straight her arms of snowy hue About her unresolving husband threw Her soft embraces soon infuse desire His bones and marrow sudden warmth inspire And all the godhead feels the wonted fire Not half so swift the rattling thunder flies Or forky lightnings flash along the skies The goddess proud of her successful wiles And conscious of her form in secret smiles Then thus the pow r obnoxious to her charms Panting and half dissolving in her arms Why seek you reasons for a cause so just Or your own beauties or my love distrust Long since had you requir d my helpful hand Th artificer and art you might command To labor arms for Troy nor Jove nor fate Confin d their empire to so short a date And if you now desire new wars to wage My skill I promise and my pains engage Whatever melting metals can conspire Or breathing bellows or the forming fire Is freely yours your anxious fears remove And think no task is difficult to love Trembling he spoke and eager of her charms He snatch d the willing goddess to his arms Till in her lap infus d he lay possess d Of full desire and sunk to pleasing rest Now when the Night her middle race had rode And his first slumber had refresh d the god The time when early housewives leave the bed When living embers on the hearth they spread Supply the lamp and call the maids to rise With yawning mouths and with half open d eyes They ply the distaff by the winking light And to their daily labor add the night Thus frugally they earn their children s bread And uncorrupted keep the nuptial bed Not less concern d nor at a later hour Rose from his downy couch the forging pow r Sacred to Vulcan s name an isle there lay Betwixt Sicilia s coasts and Lipare Rais d high on smoking rocks and deep below In hollow caves the fires of Aetna glow The Cyclops here their heavy hammers deal Loud strokes and hissings of tormented steel Are heard around the boiling waters roar And smoky flames thro fuming tunnels soar Hether the Father of the Fire by night Thro the brown air precipitates his flight On their eternal anvils here he found The brethren beating and the blows go round A load of pointless thunder now there lies Before their hands to ripen for the skies These darts for angry Jove they daily cast Consum d on mortals with prodigious waste Three rays of writhen rain of fire three more Of winged southern winds and cloudy store As many parts the dreadful mixture frame And fears are added and avenging flame Inferior ministers for Mars repair His broken axletrees and blunted war And send him forth again with furbish d arms To wake the lazy war with trumpets loud alarms The rest refresh the scaly snakes that fold The shield of Pallas and renew their gold Full on the crest the Gorgon s head they place With eyes that roll in death and with distorted face My sons said Vulcan set your tasks aside Your strength and master skill must now be tried Arms for a hero forge arms that require Your force your speed and all your forming fire He said They set their former work aside And their new toils with eager haste divide A flood of molten silver brass and gold And deadly steel in the large furnace roll d Of this their artful hands a shield prepare Alone sufficient to sustain the war Sev n orbs within a spacious round they close One stirs the fire and one the bellows blows The hissing steel is in the smithy drown d The grot with beaten anvils groans around By turns their arms advance in equal time By turns their hands descend and hammers chime They turn the glowing mass with crooked tongs The fiery work proceeds with rustic songs While at the Lemnian god s command they urge Their labors thus and ply th Aeolian forge The cheerful morn salutes Evander s eyes And songs of chirping birds invite to rise He leaves his lowly bed his buskins meet Above his ankles sandals sheathe his feet He sets his trusty sword upon his side And o er his shoulder throws a panther s hide Two menial dogs before their master press d Thus clad and guarded thus he seeks his kingly guest Mindful of promis d aid he mends his pace But meets Aeneas in the middle space Young Pallas did his father s steps attend And true Achates waited on his friend They join their hands a secret seat they choose Th Arcadian first their former talk renews Undaunted prince I never can believe The Trojan empire lost while you survive Command th assistance of a faithful friend But feeble are the succors I can send Our narrow kingdom here the Tiber bounds That other side the Latian state surrounds Insults our walls and wastes our fruitful grounds But mighty nations I prepare to join Their arms with yours and aid your just design You come as by your better genius sent And fortune seems to favor your intent Not far from hence there stands a hilly town Of ancient building and of high renown Torn from the Tuscans by the Lydian race Who gave the name of Caere to the place Once Agyllina call d It flourish d long In pride of wealth and warlike people strong Till curs d Mezentius in a fatal hour Assum d the crown with arbitrary pow r What words can paint those execrable times The subjects suff rings and the tyrant s crimes That blood those murthers O ye gods replace On his own head and on his impious race The living and the dead at his command Were coupled face to face and hand to hand Till chok d with stench in loath d embraces tied The ling ring wretches pin d away and died Thus plung d in ills and meditating more The people s patience tir d no longer bore The raging monster but with arms beset His house and vengeance and destruction threat They fire his palace while the flame ascends They force his guards and execute his friends He cleaves the crowd and favor d by the night To Turnus friendly court directs his flight By just revenge the Tuscans set on fire With arms their king to punishment require Their num rous troops now muster d on the strand My counsel shall submit to your command Their navy swarms upon the coasts they cry To hoist their anchors but the gods deny An ancient augur skill d in future fate With these foreboding words restrains their hate Ye brave in arms ye Lydian blood the flow r Of Tuscan youth and choice of all their pow r Whom just revenge against Mezentius arms To seek your tyrant s death by lawful arms Know this no native of our land may lead This pow rful people seek a foreign head Aw d with these words in camps they still abide And wait with longing looks their

Dispels the darkness and the day renews The trembling wives the walls and turrets crowd And follow with their eyes the dusty cloud Which winds disperse by fits and shew from far The blaze of arms and shields and shining war The troops drawn up in beautiful array O er heathy plains pursue the ready way Repeated peals of shouts are heard around The neighing coursers answer to the sound And shake

in distant places pass d The various Iris Juno sends with haste To find bold Turnus who with anxious thought The secret shade of his great grandsire sought Retir d alone she found the daring man And op d her rosy lips and thus began What none of all the gods could grant thy vows That Turnus this auspicious day bestows Aeneas gone to seek th Arcadian prince Has left the Trojan camp without defense And short of succors there employs his pains In parts remote to raise the Tuscan swains Now snatch an hour that favors thy designs Unite thy forces and attack their lines This said on equal wings she pois d her weight And form d a radiant rainbow in her flight The Daunian hero lifts his hands eyes And thus invokes the goddess as she flies Iris the grace of heav n what pow r divine Has sent thee down thro dusky clouds to shine See they divide immortal day appears And glitt ring planets dancing in their spheres With joy these happy omens I obey And follow to the war the god that leads the way Thus having said as by the brook he stood He scoop d the water from the crystal flood Then with his hands the drops to heav n he throws And loads the pow rs above with offer d vows Now march the bold confed rates thro the plain Well hors d well clad a rich and shining train Messapus leads the van and in the rear The sons of Tyrrheus in bright arms appear In the main battle with his flaming crest The mighty Turnus tow rs above the rest Silent they move majestically slow Like ebbing Nile or Ganges in his flow The Trojans view the dusty cloud from far And the dark menace of the distant war Caicus from the rampire saw it rise Black ning the fields and thick ning thro the skies Then to his fellows thus aloud he calls What rolling clouds my friends approach the walls Arm arm and man the works prepare your spears And pointed darts the Latian host appears Thus warn d they shut their gates with shouts ascend The bulwarks and secure their foes attend For their wise general ral with foreseeing care Had charg d them not to tempt the doubtful war Nor tho provok d in open fields advance But close within their lines attend their chance Unwilling yet they keep the strict command And sourly wait in arms the hostile band The fiery Turnus flew before the rest A piebald steed of Thracian strain he press d His helm of massy gold and crimson was his crest With twenty horse to second his designs An unexpected foe he fac d the lines Is there he said in arms who bravely dare His leader s honor and his danger share Then spurring on his brandish d dart he threw In sign of war applauding shouts ensue Amaz d to find a dastard race that run Behind the rampires and the battle shun He rides around the camp with rolling eyes And stops at ev ry post and ev ry passage tries So roams the nightly wolf about the fold Wet with descending show rs and stiff with cold He howls for hunger and he grins for pain His gnashing teeth are exercis d in vain And impotent of anger finds no way In his distended paws to grasp the prey The mothers listen but the bleating lambs Securely swig the dug beneath the dams Thus ranges eager Turnus o er the plain Sharp with desire and furious with disdain Surveys each passage with a piercing sight To force his foes in equal field to fight Thus while he gazes round at length he spies Where fenc d with strong redoubts their navy lies Close underneath the walls the washing tide Secures from all approach this weaker side He takes the wish d occasion fills his hand With ready fires and shakes a flaming brand Urg d by his presence ev ry soul is warm d And ev ry hand with kindled firs is arm d From the fir d pines the scatt ring sparkles fly Fat vapors mix d with flames involve the sky What pow r O Muses could avert the flame Which threaten d in the fleet the Trojan name Tell for the fact thro length of time obscure Is hard to faith yet shall the fame endure T is said that when the chief prepar d his flight And fell d his timber from Mount Ida s height The grandam goddess then approach d her son And with a mother s majesty begun Grant me she said the sole request I bring Since conquer d heav n has own d you for its king On Ida s brows for ages past there stood With firs and maples fill d a shady wood And on the summit rose a sacred grove Where I was worship d with religious love Those woods that holy grove my long delight I gave the Trojan prince to speed his flight Now fill d with fear on their behalf I come Let neither winds o erset nor waves intomb The floating forests of the sacred pine But let it be their safety to be mine Then thus replied her awful son who rolls The radiant stars and heav n and earth controls How dare you mother endless date demand For vessels molded by a mortal hand What then is fate Shall bold Aeneas ride Of safety certain on th uncertain tide Yet what I can I grant when wafted o er The chief is landed on the Latian shore Whatever ships escape the raging storms At my command shall change their fading forms To nymphs divine and plow the wat ry way Like Dotis and the daughters of the sea To seal his sacred vow by Styx he swore The lake of liquid pitch the dreary shore And Phlegethon s innavigable flood And the black regions of his brother god He said and shook the skies with his imperial nod And now at length the number d hours were come Prefix d by fate s irrevocable doom When the great Mother of the Gods was free To save her ships and finish Jove s decree First from the quarter of the morn there sprung A light that sign d the heav ns and shot along Then from a cloud fring d round with golden fires Were timbrels heard and Berecynthian choirs And last a voice with more than mortal sounds Both hosts in arms oppos d with equal horror wounds O Trojan race your needless aid forbear And know my ships are my peculiar care With greater ease the bold Rutulian may With hissing brands attempt to burn the sea Than singe my sacred pines But you my charge Loos d from your crooked anchors launch at large Exalted each a nymph forsake the sand And swim the seas at Cybele s command No sooner had the goddess ceas d to speak When lo th obedient ships their haulsers break And strange to tell like dolphins in the main They plunge their prows and dive and spring again As many beauteous maids the billows sweep As rode before tall vessels on the deep The foes surpris d with wonder stood aghast Messapus curb d his fiery courser s haste Old Tiber roar d and raising up his head Call d back his waters to their oozy bed Turnus alone undaunted bore the shock And with these words his trembling troops bespoke These monsters for the Trojans fate are meant And are by Jove for black presages sent He takes the cowards last relief away For fly they cannot and constrain d to stay Must yield unfought a base inglorious prey The liquid half of all the globe is lost Heav n shuts the seas and we secure the coast Theirs is no more than that small spot of ground Which myriads of our martial men surround Their fates I fear not or vain oracles T was giv n to Venus they should cross the seas And land secure upon the Latian plains Their promis d hour is pass d and mine remains T is in the fate of Turnus to destroy With sword and fire the faithless race of Troy Shall such affronts as these alone inflame The Grecian brothers and the Grecian name My cause and theirs is one a fatal strife And final ruin for a ravish d wife Was t not enough that punish d for the crime They fell but will they fall a second time One would have thought they paid enough before To curse the costly sex and durst offend no more Can they securely trust their feeble wall A slight partition a thin interval Betwixt their fate and them when Troy tho built By hands divine yet perish d by their guilt Lend me for once my friends your valiant hands To force from out their lines these dastard bands Less than a thousand ships will end this war Nor Vulcan needs his fated arms prepare Let all the Tuscans all th Arcadians join Nor these nor those shall frustrate my design Let them not fear the treasons of the night The robb d Palladium the pretended flight Our onset shall be made in open light No wooden engine shall their town betray Fires they shall have around but fires by day No Grecian babes before their camp appear Whom Hector s arms detain d to the tenth tardy year Now since the sun is rolling to the west Give we the silent night to needful rest Refresh your bodies and your arms prepare The morn shall end the small remains of war The post of honor to Messapus falls To keep the nightly guard to watch the walls To pitch the fires at distances around And close the Trojans in their scanty ground Twice seven Rutulian captains ready stand And twice seven hundred horse these chiefs command All clad in shining arms the works invest Each with a radiant helm and waving crest Stretch d at their length they press the grassy ground They laugh they sing the jolly bowls go round With lights and cheerful fires renew the day And pass the wakeful night in feasts and play The Trojans from above their foes beheld And with arm d legions all the rampires fill d Seiz d with affright their gates they first explore Join works to works with bridges tow r to tow r Thus all things needful for defense abound Mnestheus and brave Seresthus walk the round Commission d by their absent prince to share The common danger and divide the care The soldiers draw their lots and as they fall By turns relieve each other on the wall Nigh where the foes their utmost guards advance To watch the gate was warlike Nisus chance His father Hyrtacus of noble blood His mother was a huntress of the wood And sent him to the wars Well could he bear His lance in fight and dart the flying spear But better skill d unerring shafts to send Beside him stood Euryalus his friend Euryalus than whom the Trojan host No fairer face or sweeter air could boast Scarce had the down to shade his cheeks begun One was their care and their delight was one One common hazard in the war they shar d And now were both by choice upon the guard Then Nisus thus Or do the gods inspire This warmth or make we gods of our desire A general rous ardor boils within my breast Eager of action enemy to rest This urges me to fight and fires my mind To leave a memorable name behind Thou see saint the foe secure how faintly shine Their scatter d fires the most in sleep supine Along the ground an easy conquest lie The wakeful few the fuming flagon ply All hush d around Now hear what I revolve A thought unripe and scarcely yet resolve Our absent prince both camp and council mourn By message both would hasten his return If they confer what I demand on thee For fame is recompense enough for me Methinks beneath yon hill I have espied A way that safely will my passage guide Euryalus stood list ning while he spoke With love of praise and noble envy struck Then to his ardent friend expos d his mind All this alone and leaving me behind Am I unworthy Nisus to be join d Thinkist thou I can my share of glory yield Or send thee unassisted to the field Not so my father taught my childhood arms Born in a siege and bred among alarms Nor is my youth unworthy of my friend Nor of the heav n born hero I attend The thing call d life with ease I can disclaim And think it over sold to purchase fame Then Nisus thus Alas thy tender years Would minister new matter to my fears So may the gods who view this friendly strife Restore me to thy lov d embrace with life Condemn d to pay my vows as sure I trust This thy request is cruel and unjust But if some chance as many chances are And doubtful hazards in the deeds of war If one should reach my head there let it fall And spare thy life I would not perish all Thy bloomy youth deserves a longer date Live thou to mourn thy love s unhappy fate To bear my mangled body from the foe Or buy it back and fun ral rites bestow Or if hard fortune shall those dues deny Thou canst at least an empty tomb supply O let not me the widow s tears renew Nor let a mother s curse my name pursue Thy pious parent who for love of thee Forsook the coasts of friendly Sicily Her age committing to the seas and wind When ev ry weary matron stay d behind To this Euryalus You plead in vain And but protract the cause you cannot gain No more delays but haste With that he wakes The nodding watch each to his office takes The guard reliev d the general rous couple went To find the council at the royal tent All creatures else forgot their daily care And sleep the common gift of nature share Except the Trojan peers who wakeful sate In nightly council for th indanger d state They vote a message to their absent chief Shew their distress and beg a swift relief Amid the camp a silent seat they chose Remote from clamor and secure from foes On their left arms their ample shields they bear The right reclin d upon the bending spear Now Nisus and his friend approach the guard And beg admission eager to be heard Th affair important not to be deferr d Ascanius bids em be conducted in Ord ring the more experienc d to begin Then Nisus thus Ye fathers lend your ears Nor judge our bold attempt beyond our years The foe securely drench d in sleep and wine Neglect their watch the fires but thinly shine And where the smoke in cloudy vapors flies Cov ring the plain and curling to the skies Betwixt two paths which at the gate divide Close by the sea a passage we have spied Which will our way to great Aeneas guide Expect each hour to see him safe again Loaded with spoils of foes in battle slain Snatch we the lucky minute while we may Nor can we be mistaken in the way For hunting in the vale we both have seen The rising turrets and the stream between And know the winding course with ev ry ford He ceas d and old Alethes took the word Our country gods in whom our trust we place Will yet from ruin save the Trojan race While we behold such dauntless worth appear In dawning youth and souls so void of fear Then into tears of joy the father broke Each in his longing arms by turns he took Panted and paus d and thus again he spoke Ye brave young men what equal gifts can we In recompense of such desert decree The greatest sure and best you can receive The gods and your own conscious worth will give The rest our grateful general ral will bestow And young Ascanius till his manhood owe And I whose welfare in my father lies Ascanius adds by the great deities By my dear country by my household gods By hoary Vesta s rites and dark abodes Adjure you both on you my fortune stands That and my faith I plight into your hands Make me but happy in his safe return Whose wanted presence I can only mourn Your common gift shall two large goblets be Of silver wrought with curious imagery And high emboss d which when old Priam reign d My conqu ring sire at sack d Arisba gain d And more two tripods cast in antic mold With two great talents of the finest gold Beside a costly bowl ingrav d with art Which Dido gave when first she gave her heart But if in conquer d Italy we reign When spoils by lot the victor shall obtain Thou saw saint the courser by proud Turnus press d That Nisus and his arms and nodding crest And shield from chance exempt shall be thy share Twelve lab ring slaves twelve handmaids young and fair All clad in rich attire and train d with care And last a Latian field with fruitful plains And a large portion of the king s domains But thou whose years are more to mine allied No fate my vow d affection shall divide From thee heroic youth Be wholly mine Take full possession all my soul is thine One faith one fame one fate shall both attend My life s companion and my bosom friend My peace shall be committed to thy care And to thy conduct my concerns in war Then thus the young Euryalus replied Whatever fortune good or bad betide The same shall be my age as now my youth No time shall find me wanting to my truth This only from your goodness let me gain And this ungranted all rewards are vain Of Priam s royal race my mother came And sure the best that ever bore the name Whom neither Troy nor Sicily could hold From me departing but o erspent and old My fate she follow d Ignorant of this Whatever danger neither parting kiss Nor pious blessing taken her I leave And in this only act of all my life deceive By this right hand and conscious Night I swear My soul so sad a farewell could not bear Be you her comfort fill my vacant place Permit me to presume so great a grace Support her age forsaken and distress d That hope alone will fortify my breast Against the worst of fortunes and of fears He said The mov d assistants melt in tears Then thus Ascanius wonderstruck to see That image of his filial piety So great beginnings in so green an age Exact the faith which I again ingage Thy mother all the dues shall justly claim Creusa had and only want the name Whate er event thy bold attempt shall have T is merit to have borne a son so brave Now by my head a sacred oath I swear My father us d it what returning here Crown d with success I for thyself prepare That if thou fail shall thy lov d mother share He said and weeping while he spoke the word From his broad belt he drew a shining sword Magnificent with gold Lycaon made And in an ivory scabbard sheath d the blade This was his gift Great Mnestheus gave his friend A lion s hide his body to defend And good Alethes furnish d him beside With his own trusty helm of temper tried Thus arm d they went The noble Trojans wait Their issuing forth and follow to the gate With prayers and vows Above the rest appears Ascanius manly far beyond his years And messages committed to their care Which all in winds were lost and flitting air The trenches first they pass d then took their way Where their proud foes in pitch d pavilions lay To many fatal ere themselves were slain They found the careless host dispers d upon the plain Who gorg d and drunk with wine supinely snore Unharness d chariots stand along the shore Amidst the wheels and reins the goblet by A medley of debauch and war they lie Observing Nisus shew d his friend the sight Behold a conquest gain d without a fight Occasion offers and I stand prepar d There lies our way be thou upon the guard And look around while I securely go And hew a passage thro the sleeping foe Softly he spoke then striding took his way With his drawn sword where haughty Rhamnes lay His head rais d high on tapestry beneath And heaving from his breast he drew his breath A king and prophet by King Turnus lov d But fate by prescience cannot be remov d Him and his sleeping slaves he slew then spies Where Remus with his rich retinue lies His armor bearer first and next he kills His charioteer intrench d betwixt the wheels And his lov d horses last invades their lord Full on his neck he drives the fatal sword The gasping head flies off a purple flood Flows from the trunk that welters in the blood Which by the spurning heels dispers d around The bed besprinkles and bedews the ground Lamus the bold and Lamyrus the strong He slew and then Serranus fair and young From dice and wine the youth retir d to rest And puff d the fumy god from out his breast Ev n then he dreamt of drink and lucky play More lucky had it lasted till the day The famish d lion thus with hunger bold O erleaps the fences of the nightly fold And tears the peaceful flocks with silent awe Trembling they lie and pant beneath his paw Nor with less rage Euryalus employs The wrathful sword or fewer foes destroys But on th ignoble crowd his fury flew He Fadus Hebesus and Rhoetus slew Oppress d with heavy sleep the former fell But Rhoetus wakeful and observing all Behind a spacious jar he slink d for fear The fatal iron found and reach d him there For as he rose it pierc d his naked side And reeking thence return d in crimson dyed The wound pours out a stream of wine and blood The purple soul comes floating in the flood Now where Messapus quarter d they arrive The fires were fainting there and just alive The warrior horses tied in order fed Nisus observ d the discipline and said Our eager thirst of blood may both betray And see the scatter d streaks of dawning day Foe to nocturnal thefts No more my friend Here let our glutted execution end A lane thro slaughter d bodies we have made The bold Euryalus tho loth obey d Of arms and arras and of plate they find A precious load but these they leave behind Yet fond of gaudy spoils the boy would stay To make the rich caparison his prey Which on the steed of conquer d Rhamnes lay Nor did his eyes less longingly behold The girdle belt with nails of burnish d gold This present Caedicus the rich bestow d On Remulus when friendship first they vow d And absent join d in hospitable ties He dying to his heir bequeath d the prize Till by the conqu ring Ardean troops oppress d He fell and they the glorious gift possess d These glitt ring spoils now made the victor s gain He to his body suits but suits in vain Messapus helm he finds among the rest And laces on and wears the waving crest Proud of their conquest prouder of their prey They leave the camp and take the ready way But far they had not pass d before they spied Three hundred horse with Volscens for their guide The queen a legion to King Turnus sent But the swift horse the slower foot prevent And now advancing sought the leader s tent They saw the pair for thro the doubtful shade His shining helm Euryalus betray d On which the moon with full reflection play d T is not for naught cried Volscens from the crowd These men go there then rais d his voice aloud Stand stand why thus in arms And whither bent From whence to whom and on what errand sent Silent they scud away and haste their flight To neighb ring woods and trust themselves to night The speedy horse all passages belay And spur their smoking steeds to cross their way And watch each entrance of the winding wood Black was the forest thick with beech it stood Horrid with fern and intricate with thorn Few paths of human feet or tracks of beasts were worn The darkness of the shades his heavy prey And fear misled the younger from his way But Nisus hit the turns with happier haste And thoughtless of his friend the forest pass d And Alban plains from Alba s name so call d Where King Latinus then his oxen stall d Till turning at the length he stood his ground And miss d his friend and cast his eyes around Ah wretch he cried where have I left behind Th unhappy youth where shall I hope to find Or what way take Again he ventures back And treads the mazes of his former track He winds the wood and list ning hears the noise Of tramping coursers and the riders voice The sound approach d and suddenly he view d The foes inclosing and his friend pursued Forelaid and taken while he strove in vain The shelter of the friendly shades to gain What should he next attempt what arms employ What fruitless force to free the captive boy Or desperate should he rush and lose his life With odds oppress d in such unequal strife Resolv d at length his pointed spear he shook And casting on the moon a mournful look Guardian of groves and goddess of the night Fair queen he said direct my dart aright If e er my pious father for my sake Did grateful off rings on thy altars make Or I increas d them with my sylvan toils And hung thy holy roofs with savage spoils Give me to scatter these Then from his ear He pois d and aim d and launch d the trembling spear The deadly weapon hissing from the grove Impetuous on the back of Sulmo drove Pierc d his thin armor drank his vital blood And in his body left the broken wood He staggers round his eyeballs roll in death And with short sobs he gasps away his breath All stand amaz d a second jav lin flies With equal strength and quivers thro the skies This thro thy temples Tagus forc d the way And in the brainpan warmly buried lay Fierce Volscens foams with rage and gazing round Descried not him who gave the fatal wound Nor knew to fix revenge But thou he cries Shalt pay for both and at the pris ner flies With his drawn sword Then struck with deep despair That cruel sight the lover could not bear But from his covert rush d in open view And sent his voice before him as he flew Me me he cried turn all your swords alone On me the fact confess d the fault my own He neither could nor durst the guiltless youth Ye moon and stars bear witness to the truth His only crime if friendship can offend Is too much love to his unhappy friend Too late he speaks the sword which fury guides Driv n with full force had pierc d his tender sides Down fell the beauteous youth the yawning wound Gush d out a purple stream and stain d the ground His snowy neck reclines upon his breast Like a fair flow r by the keen share oppress d Like a white poppy sinking on the plain Whose heavy head is overcharg d with rain Despair and rage and vengeance justly vow d Drove Nisus headlong on the hostile crowd Volscens he seeks on him alone he bends Borne back and bor d by his surrounding friends Onward he press d and kept him still in sight Then whirl d aloft his sword with all his might Th unerring steel descended while he spoke Piered his wide mouth and thro his weazon broke Dying he slew and stagg ring on the plain With swimming eyes he sought his lover slain Then quiet on his bleeding bosom fell Content in death to be reveng d so well O happy friends for if my verse can give Immortal life your fame shall ever live Fix d as the Capitol s foundation lies And spread where er the Roman eagle flies The conqu ring party first divide the prey Then their slain leader to the camp convey With wonder as they went the troops were fill d To see such numbers whom so few had kill d Serranus Rhamnes and the rest they found Vast crowds the dying and the dead surround And the yet reeking blood o erflows the ground All knew the helmet which Messapus lost But mourn d a purchase that so dear had cost Now rose the ruddy morn from Tithon s bed And with the dawn of day the skies o erspread Nor long the sun his daily course withheld But added colors to the world reveal d When early Turnus wak ning with the light All clad in armor calls his troops to fight His martial men with fierce harangue he fir d And his own ardor in their souls inspir d This done to give new terror to his foes The heads of Nisus and his friend he shows Rais d high on pointed spears a ghastly sight Loud peals of shouts ensue and barbarous delight Meantime the Trojans run where danger calls They line their trenches and they man their walls In front extended to the left they stood Safe was the right surrounded by the flood But casting from their tow rs a frightful view They saw the faces which too well they knew Tho then disguis d in death and smear d all o er With filth obscene and dropping putrid gore Soon hasty fame thro the sad city bears The mournful message to the mother s ears An icy cold benumbs her limbs she shakes Her cheeks the blood her hand the web forsakes She runs the rampires round amidst the war Nor fears the flying darts she rends her hair And fills with loud laments the liquid air Thus then my lov d Euryalus appears Thus looks the prop my declining years Was t on this face my famish d eyes I fed Ah how unlike the living is the dead And could saint thou leave me cruel thus alone Not one kind kiss from a departing son No look no last adieu before he went In an ill boding hour to slaughter sent Cold on the ground and pressing foreign clay To Latian dogs and fowls he lies a prey Nor was I near to close his dying eyes To wash his wounds to weep his obsequies To call about his corpse his crying friends Or spread the mantle made for other ends On his dear body which I wove with care Nor did my daily pains or nightly labor spare Where shall I find his corpse what earth sustains His trunk dismember d and his cold remains For this alas I left my needful ease Expos d my life to winds and winter seas If any pity touch Rutulian hearts Here empty all your quivers all your darts Or if they fail thou Jove conclude my woe And send me thunderstruck to shades below Her shrieks and clamors pierce the Trojans ears Unman their courage and augment their fears Nor young Ascanius could the sight sustain Nor old Ilioneus his tears restrain But Actor and Idaeus jointly sent To bear the madding mother to her tent And now the trumpets terribly from far With rattling clangor rouse the sleepy war The soldiers shouts succeed the brazen sounds And heav n from pole to pole the noise rebounds The Volscians bear their shields upon their head And rushing forward form a moving shed These fill the ditch those pull the bulwarks down Some raise the ladders others scale the town But where void spaces on the walls appear Or thin defense they pour their forces there With poles and missive weapons from afar The Trojans keep aloof the rising war Taught by their ten years siege defensive fight They roll down ribs of rocks an unresisted weight To break the penthouse with the pond rous blow Which yet the patient Volscians undergo But could not bear th unequal combat long For where the Trojans find the thickest throng The ruin falls their shatter d shields give way And their crush d heads become an easy prey They shrink for fear abated of their rage Nor longer dare in a blind fight engage Contented now to gall them from below With darts and slings and with the distant bow Elsewhere Mezentius terrible to view A blazing pine within the trenches threw But brave Messapus Neptune s warlike son Broke down the palisades the trenches won And loud for ladders calls to scale the town Calliope begin Ye sacred Nine Inspire your poet in his high design To sing what slaughter manly Turnus made What souls he sent below the Stygian shade What fame the soldiers with their captain share And the vast circuit of the fatal war For you in singing martial facts excel You best remember and alone can tell There stood a tow r amazing to the sight Built up of beams and of stupendous height Art and the nature of the place conspir d To furnish all the strength that war requir d To level this the bold Italians join The wary Trojans obviate their design With weighty stones o erwhelm their troops below Shoot thro the loopholes and sharp jav lins throw Turnus the chief toss d from his thund ring hand Against the wooden walls a flaming brand It stuck the fiery plague the winds were high The planks were season d and the timber dry Contagion caught the posts it spread along Scorch d and to distance drove the scatter d throng The Trojans fled the fire pursued amain Still gath ring fast upon the trembling train Till crowding to the corners of the wall Down the defense and the defenders fall The mighty flaw makes heav n itself resound The dead and dying Trojans strew the ground The tow r that follow d on the fallen crew Whelm d o er their heads and buried whom it slew Some stuck upon the darts themselves had sent All the same equal ruin underwent Young Lycus and Helenor only scape Sav d how they know not from the steepy leap Helenor elder of the two by birth On one side royal one a son of earth Whom to the Lydian king Licymnia bare And sent her boasted bastard to the war A privilege which none but freemen share Slight were his arms a sword and silver shield No marks of honor charg d its empty field Light as he fell so light the youth arose And rising found himself amidst his foes Nor flight was left nor hopes to force his way Embolden d by despair he stood at bay And like a stag whom all the troop surrounds Of eager huntsmen and invading hounds Resolv d on death he dissipates his fears And bounds aloft against the pointed spears So dares the youth secure of death and throws His dying body on his thickest foes But Lycus swifter of his feet by far Runs doubles winds and turns amidst the war Springs to the walls and leaves his foes behind And snatches at the beam he first can find Looks up and leaps aloft at all the stretch In hopes the helping hand of some kind friend to reach But Turnus follow d hard his hunted prey His spear had almost reach d him in the way Short of his reins and scarce a span behind Fool said the chief tho fleeter than the wind Couldst thou presume to scape when I pursue He said and downward by the feet he drew The trembling dastard at the tug he falls Vast ruins come along rent from the smoking walls Thus on some silver swan or tim rous hare Jove s bird comes sousing down from upper air Her crooked talons truss the fearful prey Then out of sight she soars and wings her way So seizes the grim wolf the tender lamb In vain lamented by the bleating dam Then rushing onward with a barb rous cry The troops of Turnus to the combat fly The ditch with fagots fill d the daring foe Toss d firebrands to the steepy turrets throw Ilioneus as bold Lucetius came To force the gate and feed the kindling flame Roll d down the fragment of a rock so right It crush d him double underneath the weight Two more young Liger and Asylas slew To bend the bow young Liger better knew Asylas best the pointed jav lin threw Brave Caeneus laid Ortygius on the plain The victor Caeneus was by Turnus slain By the same hand Clonius and Itys fall Sagar and Ida standing on the wall From Capys arms his fate Privernus found Hurt by Themilla first but slight the wound His shield thrown by to mitigate the smart He clapp d his hand upon the wounded part The second shaft came swift and unespied And pierc d his hand and nail d it to his side Transfix d his breathing lungs and beating heart The soul came issuing out and hiss d against the dart The son of Arcens shone amid the rest In glitt ring armor and a purple vest Fair was his face his eyes inspiring love Bred by his father in the Martian grove Where the fat altars of Palicus flame And send in arms to purchase early fame Him when he spied from far the Tuscan king Laid by the lance and took him to the sling Thrice whirl d the thong around his head and threw The heated lead half melted as it flew It pierc d his hollow temples and his brain The youth came tumbling down and spurn d the plain Then young Ascanius who before this day Was wont in woods to shoot the savage prey First bent in martial strife the twanging bow And exercis d against a human foe With this bereft Numanus of his life Who Turnus younger sister took to wife Proud of his realm and of his royal bride Vaunting before his troops and lengthen d with a stride In these insulting terms the Trojans he defied Twice conquer d

What gods what madness hether steer d your course You shall not find the sons of Atreus here Nor need the frauds of sly Ulysses fear Strong from the cradle of a sturdy brood We bear our newborn infants to the flood There bath d amid the stream our boys we hold With winter harden d and inur d to cold They wake before the day to range the wood Kill ere they eat nor taste unconquer d food No sports but what belong to war they know To break the stubborn colt to bend the bow Our youth of labor patient earn their bread Hardly they work with frugal diet fed From plows and harrows sent to seek renown They fight in fields and storm the shaken town No part of life from toils of war is free No change in age or diff rence in degree We plow and till in arms our oxen feel Instead of goads the spur and pointed steel Th inverted lance makes furrows in the plain Ev n time that changes all yet changes us in vain The body not the mind nor can control Th immortal vigor or abate the soul Our

unequal sound the flute invites Sing dance and howl by turns in Ida s shade Resign the war to men who know the martial trade This foul reproach Ascanius could not hear With patience or a vow d revenge forbear At the full stretch of both his hands he drew And almost join d the horns of the tough yew But first before the throne of Jove he stood And thus with lifted hands invok d the god My first attempt great Jupiter succeed An annual off ring in thy grove shall bleed A snow white steer before thy altar led Who like his mother bears aloft his head Butts with his threat ning brows and bellowing stands And dares the fight and spurns the yellow sands Jove bow d the heav ns and lent a gracious ear And thunder d on the left amidst the clear Sounded at once the bow and swiftly flies The feather d death and hisses thro the skies The steel thro both his temples forc d the way Extended on the ground Numanus lay Go now vain boaster and true valor scorn The Phrygians twice subdued yet make this third return Ascanius said no more The Trojans shake The heav ns with shouting and new vigor take Apollo then bestrode a golden cloud To view the feats of arms and fighting crowd And thus the beardless victor he bespoke aloud Advance illustrious youth increase in fame And wide from east to west extend thy name Offspring of gods thyself and Rome shall owe To thee a race of demigods below This is the way to heav n the pow rs divine From this beginning date the Julian line To thee to them and their victorious heirs The conquer d war is due and the vast world is theirs Troy is too

squire Now left to rule Ascanius by his sire His wrinkled visage and his hoary hairs His mien his habit and his arms he wears And thus salutes the boy too forward for his years Suffice it thee thy father s worthy son The warlike prize thou hast already won The god of archers gives thy youth a part Of his own praise nor envies equal art Now tempt the war no more He said and flew Obscure in air and vanish d from their view The Trojans by his arms their patron know And hear the twanging of his heav nly bow Then duteous force they use and Phoebus name To keep from fight the youth too fond of fame Undaunted they themselves no danger shun From wall to wall the shouts and clamors run They bend their bows they whirl their slings around Heaps of spent arrows fall and strew the ground And helms and shields and rattling arms resound The combat thickens like the storm that flies From westward when the show ry Kids arise Or patt ring hail comes pouring on the main When Jupiter descends in harden d rain Or bellowing clouds burst with a stormy sound And with an armed winter strew the ground Pand rus and Bitias thunderbolts of war Whom Hiera to bold Alcanor bare On Ida s top two youths of height and size Like firs that on their mother mountain rise Presuming on their force the gates unbar And of their own accord invite the war With fates averse against their king s command Arm d on the

And Creteus whom the Muses held so dear He fought with courage and he sung the fight Arms were his bus ness verses his delight The Trojan chiefs behold with rage and grief Their slaughter d friends

void of sense and courage Mnestheus cried Where can you hope your coward heads to hide Ah where beyond these rampires can you run One man and in your camp inclos d you shun Shall then a single sword such slaughter boast And pass unpunish d from a num rous host Forsaking honor and renouncing fame Your gods your country and your king you shame This just reproach their virtue does excite They stand they join they thicken to the fight Now Turnus doubts and yet disdains to yield But with slow paces measures back the field And inches to the walls where Tiber s tide Washing the camp defends the weaker side The more he loses they advance the more And tread in ev ry step he trod before They shout they bear him back and whom by might They cannot conquer they oppress with weight As compass d

pursues But now they swarm and with fresh troops supplied Come rolling on and rush from ev ry side Nor Juno who sustain d his arms before Dares with new strength suffice th exhausted store For Jove

from shore we fled his fires profane Unwillingly we broke our master s chain And since have sought you thro the Tuscan main The mighty Mother chang d our forms to these And gave us life immortal in the seas But young Ascanius in his camp distress d By your insulting foes is hardly press d Th Arcadian horsemen and Etrurian host Advance in order on the Latian coast To cut their way the Daunian chief designs Before their troops can reach the Trojan lines Thou when the rosy morn restores the light First arm thy soldiers for th ensuing fight Thyself the fated sword of Vulcan wield And bear aloft th impenetrable shield To morrow s sun unless my skill be vain Shall see huge heaps of foes in battle slain Parting she spoke and with immortal force Push d on the vessel in her wat ry course For well she knew the way Impell d behind The ship flew forward and outstripp d the wind The rest make up Unknowing of the cause The chief admires their speed and happy omens draws Then thus he pray d and fix d on heav n his eyes Hear thou great Mother of the deities With turrets crown d on Ida s holy hill Fierce tigers rein d and curb d obey thy will Firm thy own omens lead us on to fight And let thy Phrygians conquer in thy right He said no more And now renewing day Had chas d the shadows of the night away He charg d the soldiers with preventing care Their flags to follow and their arms prepare Warn d of th ensuing fight and bade em hope the war Now his lofty poop he view d below His camp incompass d and th inclosing foe His blazing shield imbrac d he held on high The camp receive the sign and with loud shouts reply Hope arms their courage from their tow rs they throw Their darts with double force and drive the foe Thus at the signal giv n the cranes arise Before the stormy south and blacken all the skies King Turnus wonder d at the fight renew d Till looking back the Trojan fleet he view d The seas with swelling canvas cover d o er And the swift ships descending on the shore The Latians saw from far with dazzled eyes The radiant crest that seem d in flames to rise And dart diffusive fires around the field And the keen glitt ring of the golden shield Thus threat ning comets when by night they rise Shoot sanguine streams and sadden all the skies So Sirius flashing forth sinister lights Pale humankind with plagues and with dry famine fright Yet Turnus with undaunted mind is bent To man the shores and hinder their descent And thus awakes the courage of his friends What you so long have wish d kind Fortune sends In ardent arms to meet th invading foe You find and find him at advantage now Yours is the day you need but only dare Your swords will make you masters of the war Your sires your sons your houses and your lands And dearest wifes are all within your hands Be mindful of the race from whence you came And emulate in arms your fathers fame Now take the time while stagg ring yet they stand With feet unfirm and prepossess the strand Fortune befriends the bold Nor more he said But balanc d whom to leave and whom to lead Then these elects the landing to prevent And those he leaves to keep the city pent Meantime the Trojan sends his troops ashore Some are by boats expos d by bridges more With lab ring oars they bear along the strand Where the tide languishes and leap aland Tarchon observes the coast with careful eyes And where no ford he finds no water fries Nor billows with unequal murmurs roar But smoothly slide along and swell the shore That course he steer d and thus he gave command Here ply your oars and at all hazard land Force on the vessel that her keel may wound This hated soil and furrow hostile ground Let me securely land I ask no more Then sink my ships or shatter on the shore This fiery speech inflames his fearful friends They tug at ev ry oar and ev ry stretcher bends They run their ships aground the vessels knock Thus forc d ashore and tremble with the shock Tarchon s alone was lost that stranded stood Stuck on a bank and beaten by the flood She breaks her back the loosen d sides give way And plunge the Tuscan soldiers in the sea Their broken oars and floating planks withstand Their passage while they labor to the land And ebbing tides bear back upon th uncertain sand Now Turnus leads his troops without delay Advancing to the margin of the sea The trumpets sound Aeneas first assail d The clowns new rais d and raw and soon prevail d Great Theron fell an omen of the fight Great Theron large of limbs of giant height He first in open field defied the prince But armor scal d with gold was no defense Against the fated sword which open d wide His plated shield and pierc d his naked side Next Lichas fell who not like others born Was from his wretched mother ripp d and torn Sacred O Phoebus from his birth to thee For his beginning life from biting steel was free Not far from him was Gyas laid along Of monstrous bulk with Cisseus fierce and strong Vain bulk and strength for when the chief assail d Nor valor nor Herculean arms avail d Nor their fam d father wont in war to go With great Alcides while he toil d below The noisy Pharos next receiv d his death Aeneas writh d his dart and stopp d his bawling breath Then wretched Cydon had receiv d his doom Who courted Clytius in his beardless bloom And sought with lust obscene polluted joys The Trojan sword had curd his love of boys Had not his sev n bold brethren stopp d the course Of the fierce champions with united force Sev n darts were thrown at once and some rebound From his bright shield some on his helmet sound The rest had reach d him but his mother s care Prevented those and turn d aside in air The prince then call d Achates to supply The spears that knew the way to victory Those fatal weapons which inur d to blood In Grecian bodies under Ilium stood Not one of those my hand shall toss in vain Against our foes on this contended plain He said then seiz d a mighty spear and threw Which wing d with fate thro Maeon s buckler flew Pierc d all the brazen plates and reach d his heart He stagger d with intolerable smart Alcanor saw and reach d but reach d in vain His helping hand his brother to sustain A second spear which kept the former course From the same hand and sent with equal force His right arm pierc d and holding on bereft His use of both and pinion d down his left Then Numitor from his dead brother drew Th ill omen d spear and at the Trojan threw Preventing fate directs the lance awry Which glancing only mark d Achates thigh In pride of youth the Sabine Clausus came And from afar at Dryops took his aim The spear flew hissing thro the middle space And pierc d his throat directed at his face It stopp d at once the passage of his wind And the free soul to flitting air resign d His forehead was the first that struck the ground Lifeblood and life rush d mingled thro the wound He slew three brothers of the Borean race And three whom Ismarus their native place Had sent to war but all the sons of Thrace Halesus next the bold Aurunci leads The son of Neptune to his aid succeeds Conspicuous on his horse On either hand These fight to keep and those to win the land With mutual blood th Ausonian soil is dyed While on its borders each their claim decide As wintry winds contending in the sky With equal force of lungs their titles try They rage they roar the doubtful rack of heav n Stands without motion and the tide undriv n Each bent to conquer neither side to yield They long suspend the fortune of the field Both armies thus perform what courage can Foot set to foot and mingled man to man But in another part th Arcadian horse With ill success ingage the Latin force For where th impetuous torrent rushing down Huge craggy stones and rooted trees had thrown They left their coursers and unus d to fight On foot were scatter d in a shameful flight Pallas who with disdain and grief had view d His foes pursuing and his friends pursued Us d threat nings mix d with pray rs his last resource With these to move their minds with those to fire their force Which way companions whether would you run By you yourselves and mighty battles won By my great sire by his establish d name And early promise of my future fame By my youth emulous of equal right To share his honors shun ignoble flight Trust not your feet your hands must hew way Thro yon black body and that thick array T is thro that forward path that we must come There lies our way and that our passage home Nor pow rs above nor destinies below Oppress our arms with equal strength we go With mortal hands to meet a mortal foe See on what foot we stand a scanty shore The sea behind our enemies before No passage left unless we swim the main Or forcing these the Trojan trenches gain This said he strode with eager haste along And bore amidst the thickest of the throng Lagus the first he met with fate to foe Had heav d a stone of mighty weight to throw Stooping the spear descended on his chine Just where the bone distinguished either loin It stuck so fast so deeply buried lay That scarce the victor forc d the steel away Hisbon came on but while he mov d too slow To wish d revenge the prince prevents his blow For warding his at once at once he press d And plung d the fatal weapon in his breast Then lewd Anchemolus he laid in dust Who stain d his stepdam s bed with impious lust And after him the Daucian twins were slain Laris and Thymbrus on the Latian plain So wondrous like in feature shape and size As caus d an error in their parents eyes Grateful mistake but soon the sword decides The nice distinction and their fate divides For Thymbrus head was lopp d and Laris hand Dismember d sought its owner on the strand The trembling fingers yet the fauchion strain And threaten still th intended stroke in vain Now to renew the charge th Arcadians came Sight of such acts and sense of honest shame And grief with anger mix d their minds inflame Then with a casual blow was Rhoeteus slain Who chanc d as Pallas threw to cross the plain The flying spear was after Ilus sent But Rhoeteus happen d on a death unmeant From Teuthras and from Tyres while he fled The lance athwart his body laid him dead Roll d from his chariot with a mortal wound And intercepted fate he spurn d the ground As when in summer welcome winds arise The watchful shepherd to the forest flies And fires the midmost plants contagion spreads And catching flames infect the neighb ring heads Around the forest flies the furious blast And all the leafy nation sinks at last And Vulcan rides in triumph o er the waste The pastor pleas d with his dire victory Beholds the satiate flames in sheets ascend the sky So Pallas troops their scatter d strength unite And pouring on their foes their prince delight Halesus came fierce with desire of blood But first collected in his arms he stood Advancing then he plied the spear so well Ladon Demodocus and Pheres fell Around his head he toss d his glitt ring brand And from Strymonius hew d his better hand Held up to guard his throat then hurl d a stone At Thoas ample front and pierc d the bone It struck beneath the space of either eye And blood and mingled brains together fly Deep skill d in future fates Halesus sire Did with the youth to lonely groves retire But when the father s mortal race was run Dire destiny laid hold upon the son And haul d him to the war to find beneath Th Evandrian spear a memorable death Pallas th encounter seeks but ere he throws To Tuscan Tiber thus address d his vows O sacred stream direct my flying dart And give to pass the proud Halesus heart His arms and spoils thy holy oak shall bear Pleas d with the bribe the god receiv d his pray r For while his shield protects a friend distress d The dart came driving on and pierc d his breast But Lausus no small portion of the war Permits not panic fear to reign too far Caus d by the death of so renown d a knight But by his own example cheers the fight Fierce Abas first he slew Abas the stay Of Trojan hopes and hindrance of the day The Phrygian troops escap d the Greeks in vain They and their mix d allies now load the plain To the rude shock of war both armies came Their leaders equal and their strength the same The rear so press d the front they could not wield Their angry weapons to dispute the field Here Pallas urges on and Lausus there Of equal youth and beauty both appear But both by fate forbid to breathe their native air Their congress in the field great Jove withstands Both doom d to fall but fall by greater hands Meantime Juturna warns the Daunian chief Of Lausus danger urging swift relief With his driv n chariot he divides the crowd And making to his friends thus calls aloud Let none presume his needless aid to join Retire and clear the field the fight is mine To this right hand is Pallas only due O were his father here my just revenge to view From the forbidden space his men retir d Pallas their awe and his stern words admir d Survey d him o er and o er with wond ring sight Struck with his haughty mien and tow ring height Then to the king Your empty vaunts forbear Success I hope and fate I cannot fear Alive or dead I shall deserve a name Jove is impartial and to both the same He said and to the void advanc d his pace Pale horror sate on each Arcadian face Then Turnus from his chariot leaping light Address d himself on foot to single fight And as a lion when he spies from far A bull that seems to meditate the war Bending his neck and spurning back the sand Runs roaring downward from his hilly stand Imagine eager Turnus not more slow To rush from high on his unequal foe Young Pallas when he saw the chief advance Within due distance of his flying lance Prepares to charge him first resolv d to try If fortune would his want of force supply And thus to Heav n and Hercules address d Alcides once on earth Evander s guest His son adjures you by those holy rites That hospitable board those genial nights Assist my great attempt to gain this prize And let proud Turnus view with dying eyes His ravish d spoils T was heard the vain request Alcides mourn d and stifled sighs within his breast Then Jove to soothe his sorrow thus began Short bounds of life are set to mortal man T is virtue s work alone to stretch the narrow span So many sons of gods in bloody fight Around the walls of Troy have lost the light My own Sarpedon fell beneath his foe Nor I his mighty sire could ward the blow Ev n Turnus shortly shall resign his breath And stands already on the verge of death This said the god permits the fatal fight But from the Latian fields averts his sight Now with full force his spear young Pallas threw And having thrown his shining fauchion drew The steel just graz d along the shoulder joint And mark d it slightly with the glancing point Fierce Turnus first to nearer distance drew And pois d his pointed spear before he threw Then as the winged weapon whizz d along See now said he whose arm is better strung The spear kept on the fatal course unstay d By plates of ir n which o er the shield were laid Thro folded brass and tough bull hides it pass d His corslet pierc d and reach d his heart at last In vain the youth tugs at the broken wood The soul comes issuing with the vital blood He falls his arms upon his body sound And with his bloody teeth he bites the ground Turnus bestrode the corpse Arcadians hear Said he my message to your master bear Such as the sire deserv d the son I send It costs him dear to be the Phrygians friend The lifeless body tell him I bestow Unask d to rest his wand ring ghost below He said and trampled down with all the force Of his left foot and spurn d the wretched corse Then snatch d the shining belt with gold inlaid The belt Eurytion s artful hands had made Where fifty fatal brides express d to sight All in the compass of one mournful night Depriv d their bridegrooms of returning light In an ill hour insulting Turnus tore Those golden spoils and in a worse he wore O mortals blind in fate who never know To bear high fortune or endure the low The time shall come when Turnus but in vain Shall wish untouch d the trophies of the slain Shall wish the fatal belt were far away And curse the dire remembrance of the day The sad Arcadians from th unhappy field Bear back the breathless body on a shield O grace and grief of war at once restor d With praises to thy sire at once deplor d One day first sent thee to the fighting field Beheld whole heaps of foes in battle kill d One day beheld thee dead and borne upon thy shield This dismal news not from uncertain fame But sad spectators to the hero came His friends upon the brink of ruin stand Unless reliev d by his victorious hand He whirls his sword around without delay And hews thro adverse foes an ample way To find fierce Turnus of his conquest proud Evander Pallas all that friendship ow d To large deserts are present to his eyes His plighted hand and hospitable ties Four sons of Sulmo four whom Ufens bred He took in fight and living victims led To please the ghost of Pallas and expire In sacrifice before his fun ral fire At Magus next he threw he stoop d below The flying spear and shunn d the promis d blow Then creeping clasp d the hero s knees and pray d By young Iulus by thy father s shade O spare my life and send me back to see My longing sire and tender progeny A lofty house I have and wealth untold In silver ingots and in bars of gold All these and sums besides which see no day The ransom of this one poor life shall pay If I survive will Troy the less prevail A single soul s too light to turn the scale He said The hero sternly thus replied Thy bars and ingots and the sums beside Leave for thy children s lot Thy Turnus broke All rules of war by one relentless stroke When Pallas fell so deems nor deems alone My father s shadow but my living son Thus having said of kind remorse bereft He seiz d his helm and dragg d him with his left Then with his right hand while his neck he wreath d Up to the hilts his shining fauchion sheath d Apollo s priest Emonides was near His holy fillets on his front appear Glitt ring in arms he shone amidst the crowd Much of his god more of his purple proud Him the fierce Trojan follow d thro the field The holy coward fell and forc d to yield The prince stood o er the priest and at one blow Sent him an off ring to the shades below His arms Seresthus on his shoulders bears Design d a trophy to the God of Wars Vulcanian Caeculus renews the fight And Umbro born upon the mountains height The champion cheers his troops t encounter those And seeks revenge himself on other foes At Anxur s shield he drove and at the blow Both shield and arm to ground together go Anxur had boasted much of magic charms And thought he wore impenetrable arms So made by mutter d spells and from the spheres Had life secur d in vain for length of years Then Tarquitus the field in triumph trod A nymph his mother his sire a god Exulting in bright arms he braves the prince With his protended lance he makes defense Bears back his feeble foe then pressing on Arrests his better hand and drags him down Stands o er the prostrate wretch and as he lay Vain tales inventing and prepar d to pray Mows off his head the trunk a moment stood Then sunk and roll d along the sand in blood The vengeful victor thus upbraids the slain Lie there proud man unpitied on the plain Lie there inglorious and without a tomb Far from thy mother and thy native home Exposed to savage beasts and birds of prey Or thrown for food to monsters of the sea On Lycas and Antaeus next he ran Two chiefs of Turnus and who led his van They fled for fear with these he chas d along Camers the yellow lock d and Numa strong Both great in arms and both were fair and young Camers was son to Volscens lately slain In wealth surpassing all the Latian train And in Amycla fix d his silent easy reign And as Aegaeon when with heav n he strove Stood opposite in arms to mighty Jove Mov d all his hundred hands provok d the war Defied the forky lightning from afar At fifty mouths his flaming breath expires And flash for flash returns and fires for fires In his right hand as many swords he wields And takes the thunder on as many shields With strength like his the Trojan hero stood And soon the fields with falling corps were strow d When once his fauchion found the taste of blood With fury scarce to be conceiv d he flew Against Niphaeus whom four coursers drew They when they see the fiery chief advance And pushing at their chests his pointed lance Wheel d with so swift a motion mad with fear They threw their master headlong from the chair They stare they start nor stop their course before They bear the bounding chariot to the shore Now Lucagus and Liger scour the plains With two white steeds but Liger holds the reins And Lucagus the lofty seat maintains Bold brethren both The former wav d in air His flaming sword Aeneas couch d his spear Unus d to threats and more unus d to fear Then Liger thus Thy confidence is vain To scape from hence as from the Trojan plain Nor these the steeds which Diomede bestrode Nor this the chariot where Achilles rode Nor Venus veil is here near Neptune s shield Thy fatal hour is come and this the field Thus Liger vainly vaunts the Trojan peer Return d his answer with his flying spear As Lucagus to lash his horses bends Prone to the wheels and his left foot protends Prepar d for fight the fatal dart arrives And thro the borders of his buckler drives Pass d thro and pierc d his groin the deadly wound Cast from his chariot roll d him on the ground Whom thus the chief upbraids with scornful spite Blame not the slowness of your steeds in flight Vain shadows did not force their swift retreat But you yourself forsake your empty seat He said and seiz d at once the loosen d rein For Liger lay already on the plain By the same shock then stretching out his hands The recreant thus his wretched life demands Now by thyself O more than mortal man By her and him from whom thy breath began Who form d thee thus divine I beg thee spare This forfeit life and hear thy suppliant s pray r Thus much he spoke and more he would have said But the stern hero turn d aside his head And cut him short I hear another man You talk d not thus before the fight began Now take your turn and as a brother should Attend your brother to the Stygian flood Then thro his breast his fatal sword he sent And the soul issued at the gaping vent As storms the skies and torrents tear the ground Thus rag d the prince and scatter d deaths around At length Ascanius and the Trojan train Broke from the camp so long besieg d in vain Meantime the King of Gods and Mortal Man Held conference with his queen and thus began My sister goddess and well pleasing wife Still think you Venus aid supports the strife Sustains her Trojans or themselves alone With inborn valor force their fortune on How fierce in fight with courage undecay d Judge if such warriors want immortal aid To whom the goddess with the charming eyes Soft in her tone submissively replies Why O my sov reign lord whose frown I fear And cannot unconcern d your anger bear Why urge you thus my grief when if I still As once I was were mistress of your will From your almighty pow r your pleasing wife Might gain the grace of length ning Turnus life Securely snatch him from the fatal fight And give him to his aged father s sight Now let him perish since you hold it good And glut the Trojans with his pious blood Yet from our lineage he derives his name And in the fourth degree from god Pilumnus came Yet he devoutly pays you rites divine And offers daily incense at your shrine Then shortly thus the sov reign god replied Since in my pow r and goodness you confide If for a little space a lengthen d span You beg reprieve for this expiring man I grant you leave to take your Turnus hence From instant fate and can so far dispense But if some secret meaning lies beneath To save the short liv d youth from destin d death Or if a farther thought you entertain To change the fates you feed your hopes in vain To whom the goddess thus with weeping eyes And what if that request your tongue denies Your heart should grant and not a short reprieve But length of certain life to Turnus give Now speedy death attends the guiltless youth If my presaging soul divines with truth Which O I wish might err thro causeless fears And you for you have pow r prolong his years Thus having said involv d in clouds she flies And drives a storm before her thro the skies Swift she descends alighting on the plain Where the fierce foes a dubious fight maintain Of air condens d a specter soon she made And what Aeneas was such seem d the shade Adorn d with Dardan arms the phantom bore His head aloft a plumy crest he wore This hand appear d a shining sword to wield And that sustain d an imitated shield With manly mien he stalk d along the ground Nor wanted voice belied nor vaunting sound Thus haunting ghosts appear to waking sight Or dreadful visions in our dreams by night The specter seems the Daunian chief to dare And flourishes his empty sword in air At this advancing Turnus hurl d his spear The phantom wheel d and seem d to fly for fear Deluded Turnus thought the Trojan fled And with vain hopes his haughty fancy fed Whether O coward thus he calls aloud Nor found he spoke to wind and chas d a cloud Why thus forsake your bride Receive from me The fated land you sought so long by sea He said and brandishing at once his blade With eager pace pursued the flying shade By chance a ship was fasten d to the shore Which from old Clusium King Osinius bore The plank was ready laid for safe ascent For shelter there the trembling shadow bent And skipp t and skulk d and under hatches went Exulting Turnus with regardless haste Ascends the plank and to the galley pass d Scarce had he reach d the prow Saturnia s hand The haulsers cuts and shoots the ship from land With wind in poop the vessel plows the sea And measures back with speed her former way Meantime Aeneas seeks his absent foe And sends his slaughter d troops to shades below The guileful phantom now forsook the shroud And flew sublime and vanish d in a cloud Too late young Turnus the delusion found Far on the sea still making from the ground Then thankless for a life redeem d by shame With sense of honor stung and forfeit fame Fearful besides of what in fight had pass d His hands and haggard eyes to heav n he cast O Jove he cried for what offense have Deserv d to bear this endless infamy Whence am I forc d and whether am I borne How and with what reproach shall I return Shall ever I behold the Latian plain Or see Laurentum s lofty tow rs again What will they say of their deserting chief The war was mine I fly from their relief I led to slaughter and in slaughter leave And ev n from hence their dying groans receive Here overmatch d in fight in heaps they lie There scatter d o er the fields ignobly fly Gape wide O earth and draw me down alive Or O ye pitying winds a wretch relieve On sands or shelves the splitting vessel drive Or set me shipwrack d on some desart shore Where no Rutulian eyes may see me more Unknown to friends or foes or conscious Fame Lest she should follow and my flight proclaim Thus Turnus rav d and various fates revolv d The choice was doubtful but the death resolv d And now the sword and now the sea took place That to revenge and this to purge disgrace Sometimes he thought to swim the stormy main By stretch of arms the distant shore to gain Thrice he the sword assay d and thrice the flood But Juno mov d with pity both withstood And thrice repress d his rage strong gales supplied And push d the vessel o er the swelling tide At length she lands him on his native shores And to his father s longing arms restores Meantime by Jove s impulse Mezentius arm d Succeeding Turnus with his ardor warm d His fainting friends reproach d their shameful flight Repell d the victors and renew d the fight Against their king the Tuscan troops conspire Such is their hate and such their fierce desire Of wish d revenge on him and him alone All hands employ d and all their darts are thrown He like a solid rock by seas inclos d To raging winds and roaring waves oppos d From his proud summit looking down disdains Their empty menace and unmov d remains Beneath his feet fell haughty Hebrus dead Then Latagus and Palmus as he fled At Latagus a weighty stone he flung His face was flatted and his helmet rung But Palmus from behind receives his wound Hamstring d he falls and grovels on the ground His crest and armor from his body torn Thy shoulders Lausus and thy head adorn Evas and Mimas both of Troy he slew Mimas his birth from fair Theano drew Born on that fatal night when big with fire The queen produc d young Paris to his sire But Paris in the Phrygian fields was slain Unthinking Mimas on the Latian plain And as a savage boar on mountains bred With forest mast and fatt ning marshes fed When once he sees himself in toils inclos d By huntsmen and their eager hounds oppos d He whets his tusks and turns and dares the war Th invaders dart their jav lins from afar All keep aloof and safely shout around But none presumes to give a nearer wound He frets and froths erects his bristled hide And shakes a grove of lances from his side Not otherwise the troops with hate inspir d And just revenge against the tyrant fir d Their darts with clamor at a distance drive And only keep the languish d war alive From Coritus came Acron to the fight Who left his spouse betroth d and unconsummate night Mezentius sees him thro the squadrons ride Proud of the purple favors of his bride Then as a hungry lion who beholds A gamesome goat who frisks about the folds Or beamy stag that grazes on the plain He runs he roars he shakes his rising mane He grins and opens wide his greedy jaws The prey lies panting underneath his paws He fills his famish d maw his mouth runs o er With unchew d morsels while he churns the gore So proud Mezentius rushes on his foes And first unhappy Acron overthrows Stretch d at his length he spurns the swarthy ground The lance besmear d with blood lies broken in the wound Then with disdain the haughty victor view d Orodes flying nor the wretch pursued Nor thought the dastard s back deserv d a wound But running gain d th advantage of the ground Then turning short he met him face to face To give his victor the better grace Orodes falls in equal fight oppress d Mezentius fix d his foot upon his breast And rested lance and thus aloud he cries Lo here the champion of my rebels lies The fields around with Io Paean ring And peals of shouts applaud the conqu ring king At this the vanquish d with his dying breath Thus faintly spoke and prophesied in death Nor thou proud man unpunish d shalt remain Like death attends thee on this fatal plain Then sourly smiling thus the king replied For what belongs to me let Jove provide But die thou first whatever chance ensue He said and from the wound the weapon drew A hov ring mist came swimming o er his sight And seal d his eyes in everlasting night By Caedicus Alcathous was slain Sacrator laid Hydaspes on the plain Orses the strong to greater strength must yield He with Parthenius were by Rapo kill d Then brave Messapus Ericetes slew Who from Lycaon s blood his lineage drew But from his headstrong horse his fate he found Who threw his master as he made a bound The chief alighting stuck him to the ground Then Clonius hand to hand on foot assails The Trojan sinks and Neptune s son prevails Agis the Lycian stepping forth with pride To single fight the boldest foe defied Whom Tuscan Valerus by force o ercame And not belied his mighty father s fame Salius to death the great Antronius sent But the same fate the victor underwent Slain by Nealces hand well skill d to throw The flying dart and draw the far deceiving bow Thus equal deaths are dealt with equal chance By turns they quit their ground by turns advance Victors and vanquish d in the various field Nor wholly overcome nor wholly yield The gods from heav n survey the fatal strife And mourn the miseries of human life Above the rest two goddesses appear Concern d for each here Venus Juno there Amidst the crowd infernal Ate shakes Her scourge aloft and crest of hissing snakes Once more the proud Mezentius with disdain Brandish d his spear and rush d into the plain Where tow ring in the midmost rank she stood Like tall Orion stalking o er the flood When with his brawny breast he cuts the waves His shoulders scarce the topmost billow laves Or like a mountain ash whose roots are spread Deep fix d in earth in clouds he hides his head The Trojan prince beheld him from afar And dauntless undertook the doubtful war Collected in his strength and like a rock Pois d on his base Mezentius stood the shock He stood and measuring first with careful eyes The space his spear could reach aloud he cries My strong right hand and sword assist my stroke Those only gods Mezentius will invoke His armor from the Trojan pirate torn By my triumphant Lausus shall be worn He said and with his utmost force he threw The massy spear which hissing as it flew Reach d the celestial shield that stopp d the course But glancing thence the yet unbroken force Took a new bent obliquely and betwixt The side and bowels fam d Anthores fix d Anthores had from Argos travel d far Alcides friend and brother of the war Till tir d with toils fair Italy he chose And in

Of solid brass of linen trebly roll d And three bull hides which round the buckler fold All these it pass d resistless in the course Transpierc d his thigh and spent its dying force The gaping wound gush d out a crimson flood The Trojan glad with sight of hostile blood His faunchion drew to closer fight address d And with new force his fainting foe oppress d His father s peril Lausus view d with grief He sigh d he wept he ran to his relief And here heroic youth t is here I must To thy immortal memory be just And sing an act so noble and so new Posterity will scarce believe t is true Pain d with his wound and useless for the fight The father sought to save himself by flight Incumber d slow he dragg d the spear along Which pierc d his thigh and in his buckler hung The pious youth resolv d on death below The lifted sword springs forth to face the foe Protects his parent and prevents the blow Shouts of applause ran ringing thro the field To see the son the vanquish d father shield All fir d with general rous indignation strive And with a storm of darts to distance drive The Trojan chief who held at bay from far On his Vulcanian orb sustain d the war As when thick hail comes rattling in the wind The plowman passenger and lab ring hind For shelter to the neighb ring covert fly Or hous d or safe in hollow caverns lie But that o erblown when heav n above em smiles Return to travel and renew their toils Aeneas thus o erwhelmed on ev ry side The storm of darts undaunted did abide And thus to Lausus loud with friendly threat ning cried Why wilt thou rush to certain death and rage In rash attempts beyond thy tender age Betray d by pious love Nor thus forborne The youth desists but with insulting scorn Provokes the ling ring prince whose patience tir d Gave place and

from so sweet a mansion to depart But when with blood and paleness all o erspread The pious prince beheld young Lausus dead He griev d he wept the sight an image brought Of his own filial love a sadly pleasing thought Then stretch d his hand to hold him up and said Poor hapless youth what praises can be paid To love so great to such transcendent store Of early worth and sure presage of more Accept whate er Aeneas can afford Untouch d thy arms untaken be thy sword And all that pleas d thee living still remain Inviolate and sacred to the slain Thy body on thy parents I bestow To rest thy soul at

by Tiber s yellow flood Oppress d with anguish panting and o erspent His fainting limbs against an oak he leant A bough his brazen helmet did sustain His heavier arms lay scatter d on the plain A chosen train of youth around him stand His drooping head was rested on his hand His grisly beard his pensive bosom sought And all on Lausus ran his restless thought Careful concern d his danger to prevent He much enquir d and many a message sent To warn him from the field alas in vain Behold his mournful followers bear him slain O er his broad shield still gush d the yawning wound And drew a bloody trail along the ground Far off he heard their cries far off divin d The dire event with a foreboding mind With dust he sprinkled first his hoary head Then both his lifted hands to heav n he spread Last the dear corpse embracing thus he said What joys alas could this frail being give That I have been so covetous to live To see my son and such a son resign His life a ransom for preserving mine And am I then preserv d and art thou lost How much too dear has that redemption cost T is now my bitter banishment I feel This is a wound too deep for time to heal My guilt thy growing virtues did defame My blackness blotted thy unblemish d name Chas d from a throne abandon d and exil d For foul misdeeds were punishments too mild I ow d my people these and from their hate With less resentment could have borne my fate And yet I live and yet sustain the sight Of hated men and of more hated light But will not long With that he rais d from ground His fainting limbs that stagger d

arms his ornament in peace Soothing his courage with a gentle stroke The steed seem d sensible while thus he spoke O Rhoebus we have liv d too long for me If life and long were terms that could agree This day thou either shalt bring back the head And bloody trophies of the Trojan dead This day thou either shalt revenge my woe For murther d Lausus on his cruel foe Or if inexorable fate deny Our conquest with thy conquer d master die For after such a lord I rest secure Thou wilt no foreign reins or Trojan load endure He said and straight th officious courser kneels To take his wonted weight His hands he fills With pointed jav lins on his head he lac d His glitt ring helm which terribly was grac d With waving horsehair nodding from afar Then spurr d his thund ring steed amidst the war Love anguish wrath and grief to madness wrought Despair and secret shame and conscious thought Of inborn worth his lab ring soul oppress d Roll d in his eyes and rag d within his breast Then loud he

in the son Nor fate I fear but all the gods defy Forbear thy threats my bus ness is to die But first receive this parting legacy He said and straight a whirling dart he sent Another after and another went Round in a spacious ring he rides the field And vainly plies th impenetrable shield Thrice rode he round and thrice Aeneas wheel d Turn d as he turn d the golden orb withstood The strokes and bore about an iron wood Impatient of delay and weary grown Still to defend and to defend alone To wrench the darts which in his buckler light Urg d and o er labor d in unequal fight At length resolv d

staring on the skies With scarce recover d sight he thus replies Why these insulting words this waste of breath To souls undaunted and secure of death T is no dishonor for the brave to die Nor came I here with hope victory Nor ask I life nor fought with that design As I had us d my fortune use thou thine My dying son contracted no such band The gift is hateful from his murd rer s hand For this

their vengeance after fate This refuge for my poor remains provide And lay my much lov d Lausus by my side He said and to the sword his throat applied The crimson stream distain d his arms around And the disdainful soul came rushing thro the wound BOOK XI Scarce had the rosy Morning rais d her head Above the waves and left her wat ry bed The pious chief whom double cares attend For his unburied soldiers and his friend Yet first to Heav n perform d a victor s vows He bar d an ancient oak of all her boughs Then on a rising ground the trunk he plac d Which with the spoils of his dead foe he grac d The coat of arms by proud Mezentius worn Now on a naked snag in triumph borne Was hung on high and glitter d from afar A trophy sacred to the God of War Above his arms fix d on the leafless wood Appear d his plumy crest besmear d with blood His brazen buckler on the left was seen Truncheons of shiver d lances hung between And on the right was placed his corslet bor d And to the neck was tied his unavailing sword A crowd of chiefs inclose the godlike man Who thus conspicuous in the midst began Our toils my friends are crown d with sure success The greater part perform d achieve the less Now follow cheerful to the trembling town Press but an entrance and presume it won Fear is no more for fierce Mezentius lies As the first fruits of war a sacrifice Turnus shall fall extended on the plain And in this omen is already slain Prepar d in arms pursue your happy chance That none unwarn d may plead his ignorance And I at Heav n s appointed hour may find Your warlike ensigns waving in the wind Meantime the rites and fun ral pomps prepare Due to your dead companions of the war The last respect the living can bestow To shield their shadows from contempt below That conquer d earth be theirs for which they fought And which for us with their own blood they bought But first the corpse of our unhappy friend To the sad city of Evander send Who not inglorious in his age s bloom Was hurried hence by too severe a doom Thus weeping while he spoke he took his way Where new in death lamented Pallas lay Acoetes watch d the corpse whose youth deserv d The father s trust and now the son he serv d With equal faith but less auspicious care Th attendants of the slain his sorrow share A troop of Trojans mix d with these appear And mourning matrons with dishevel d hair Soon as the prince appears they raise a cry All beat their breasts and echoes rend the sky They rear his drooping forehead from the ground But when Aeneas view d the grisly wound Which Pallas in his manly bosom bore And the fair flesh distain d with purple gore First melting into tears the pious man Deplor d so sad a sight then thus began Unhappy youth when Fortune gave the rest Of my full wishes she refus d the best She came but brought not thee along to bless My longing eyes and share in my success She grudg d thy safe return the triumphs due To prosp rous valor in the public view Not thus I promis d when thy father lent Thy needless succor with a sad consent Embrac d me parting for th Etrurian land And sent me to possess a large command He warn d and from his own experience told Our foes were warlike disciplin d and bold And now perhaps in hopes of thy return Rich odors on his loaded altars burn While we with vain officious pomp prepare To send him back his portion of the war A bloody breathless body which can owe No farther debt but to the pow rs below The wretched father ere his race is run Shall view the fun ral honors of his son These are my triumphs of the Latian war Fruits of my plighted faith and boasted care And yet unhappy sire thou shalt not see A son whose death disgrac d his ancestry Thou shalt not blush old man however griev d Thy Pallas no dishonest wound receiv d He died no death to make thee wish too late Thou hadst not liv d to see his shameful fate But what a champion has th Ausonian coast And what a friend hast thou Ascanius lost Thus having mourn d he gave the word around To raise the breathless body from the ground And chose a thousand horse the flow r of all His warlike troops to wait the funeral To bear him back and share Evander s grief A well becoming but a weak relief Of oaken twigs they twist an easy bier Then on their shoulders the sad burden rear The body on this rural hearse is borne Strew d leaves and funeral greens the bier adorn All pale he lies and looks a lovely flow r New cropp d by virgin hands to dress the bow r Unfaded yet but yet unfed below No more to mother earth or the green stern shall owe Then two fair vests of wondrous work and cost Of purple woven and with gold emboss d For ornament the Trojan hero brought Which with her hands Sidonian Dido wrought One vest array d the corpse and one they spread O er his clos d eyes and wrapp d around his head That when the yellow hair in flame should fall The catching fire might burn the golden caul Besides the spoils of foes in battle slain When he descended on the Latian plain Arms trappings horses by the hearse are led In long array th achievements of the dead Then pinion d with their hands behind appear Th unhappy captives marching in the rear Appointed off rings in the victor s name To sprinkle with their blood the fun ral flame Inferior trophies by the chiefs are borne Gauntlets and helms their loaded hands adorn And fair inscriptions fix d and titles read Of Latian leaders conquer d by the dead Acoetes on his pupil s corpse attends With feeble steps supported by his friends Pausing at ev ry pace in sorrow drown d Betwixt their arms he sinks upon the ground Where grov ling while he lies in deep despair He beats his breast and rends his hoary hair The champion s chariot next is seen to roll Besmear d with hostile blood and honorably foul To close the pomp Aethon the steed of state Is led the fun rals of his lord to wait Stripp d of his trappings with a sullen pace He walks and the big tears run rolling down his face The lance of Pallas and the crimson crest Are borne behind the victor seiz d the rest The march begins the trumpets hoarsely sound The pikes and lances trail along the ground Thus while the Trojan and Arcadian horse To Pallantean tow rs direct their course In long procession rank d the pious chief Stopp d in the rear and gave a vent to grief The public care he said which war attends Diverts our present woes at least suspends Peace with the manes of great Pallas dwell Hail holy relics and a last farewell He said no more but inly thro he mourn d Restrained his tears and to the camp return d Now suppliants from Laurentum sent demand A truce with olive branches in their hand Obtest his clemency and from the plain Beg leave to draw the bodies of their slain They plead that none those common rites deny To conquer d foes that in fair battle die All cause of hate was ended in their death Nor could he war with bodies void of breath A king they hop d would hear a king s request Whose son he once was call d and once his guest Their suit which was too just to be denied The hero grants and farther thus replied O Latian princes how severe a fate In causeless quarrels has involv d your state And arm d against an unoffending man Who sought your friendship ere the war began You beg a truce which I would gladly give Not only for the slain but those who live I came not hither but by Heav n s command And sent by fate to share the Latian land Nor wage I wars unjust your king denied My proffer d friendship and my promis d bride Left me for Turnus Turnus then should try His cause in arms to conquer or to die My right and his are in dispute the slain Fell without fault our quarrel to maintain In equal arms let us alone contend And let him vanquish whom his fates befriend This is the way so tell him to possess The royal virgin and restore the peace Bear this message back with ample leave That your slain friends may fun ral rites receive Thus having said th embassadors amaz d Stood mute a while and on each other gaz d Drances their chief who harbor d in his breast Long hate to Turnus as his foe profess d Broke silence first and to the godlike man With graceful action bowing thus began Auspicious prince in arms a mighty name But yet whose actions far transcend your fame Would I your justice or your force express Thought can but equal and all words are less Your answer we shall thankfully relate And favors granted to the Latian state If wish d success our labor shall attend Think peace concluded and the king your friend Let Turnus leave the realm to your command And seek alliance in some other land Build you the city which your fates assign We shall be proud in the great work to join Thus Drances and his words so well persuade The rest impower d that soon a truce is made Twelve days the term allow d and during those Latians and Trojans now no longer foes Mix d in the woods for fun ral piles prepare To fell the timber and forget the war Loud axes thro the groaning groves resound Oak mountain ash and poplar spread the ground First fall from high and some the trunks receive In loaden wains with wedges some they cleave And now the fatal news by Fame is blown Thro the short circuit of th Arcadian town Of Pallas slain by Fame which just before His triumphs on distended pinions bore Rushing from out the gate the people stand Each with a fun ral flambeau in his hand Wildly they stare distracted with amaze The fields are lighten d with a fiery blaze That cast a sullen splendor on their friends The marching troop which their dead prince attends Both parties meet they raise a doleful cry The matrons from the walls with shrieks reply And their mix d mourning rends the vaulted sky The town is fill d with tumult and with tears Till the loud clamors reach Evander s ears Forgetful of his state he runs along With a disorder d pace and cleaves the throng Falls on the corpse and groaning there he lies With silent grief that speaks but at his eyes Short sighs and sobs succeed till sorrow breaks A passage and at once he weeps and speaks O Pallas thou hast fail d thy plighted word To fight with caution not to tempt the sword I warn d thee but in vain for well I knew What perils youthful ardor would pursue That boiling blood would carry thee too far Young as thou wert in dangers raw to war O curst essay of arms disastrous doom Prelude of bloody fields and fights to come Hard elements of unauspicious war Vain vows to Heav n and unavailing care Thrice happy thou dear partner of my bed Whose holy soul the stroke of Fortune fled Praescious of ills and leaving me behind To drink the dregs of life by fate assign d Beyond the goal of nature I have gone My Pallas late set out but reach d too soon If for my league against th Ausonian state Amidst their weapons I had found my fate Deserv d from them then I had been return d A breathless victor and my son had mourn d Yet will I not my Trojan friend upbraid Nor grudge th alliance I so gladly made T was not his fault my Pallas fell so young But my own crime for having liv d too long Yet since the gods had destin d him to die At least he led the way to victory First for his friends he won the fatal shore And sent whole herds of slaughter d foes before A death too great too glorious to deplore Nor will I add new honors to thy grave Content with those the Trojan hero gave That funeral pomp thy Phrygian friends design d In which the Tuscan chiefs and army join d Great spoils and trophies gain d by thee they bear Then let thy own achievements be thy share Even thou O Turnus hadst a trophy stood Whose mighty trunk had better grac d the wood If Pallas had arriv d with equal length Of years to match thy bulk with equal strength But why unhappy man dost thou detain These troops to view the tears thou shedd saint in vain Go friends this message to your lord relate Tell him that if I bear my bitter fate And after Pallas death live ling ring on T is to behold his vengeance for my son I stay for Turnus whose devoted head Is owing to the living and the dead My son and I expect it from his hand T is all that he can give or we demand Joy is no more but I would gladly go To greet my Pallas with such news below The morn had now dispell d the shades of night Restoring toils when she restor d the light The Trojan king and Tuscan chief command To raise the piles along the winding strand Their friends convey the dead fun ral fires Black smold ring smoke from the green wood expires The light of heav n is chok d and the new day retires Then thrice around the kindled piles they go For ancient custom had ordain d it so Thrice horse and foot about the fires are led And thrice with loud laments they hail the dead Tears trickling down their breasts bedew the ground And drums and trumpets mix their mournful sound Amid the blaze their pious brethren throw The spoils in battle taken from the foe Helms bits emboss d and swords of shining steel One casts a target one a chariot wheel Some to their fellows their own arms restore The fauchions which in luckless fight they bore Their bucklers pierc d their darts bestow d in vain And shiver d lances gather d from the plain Whole herds of offer d bulls about the fire And bristled boars and woolly sheep expire Around the piles a careful troop attends To watch the wasting flames and weep their burning friends Ling ring along the shore till dewy night New decks the face of heav n with starry light The conquer d Latians with like pious care Piles without number for their dead prepare Part in the places where they fell are laid And part are to the neighb ring fields convey d The corps of kings and captains of renown Borne off in state are buried in the town The rest unhonor d and without a name Are cast a common heap to feed the flame Trojans and Latians vie with like desires To make the field of battle shine with fires And the promiscuous blaze to heav n aspires Now had the morning thrice renew d the light And thrice dispell d the shadows of the night When those who round the wasted fires remain Perform the last sad office to the slain They rake the yet warm ashes from below These and the bones unburn d in earth bestow These relics with their country rites they grace And raise a mount of turf to mark the place But in the palace of the king appears A scene more solemn and a pomp of tears Maids matrons widows mix their common moans Orphans their sires and sires lament their sons All in that universal sorrow share And curse the cause of this unhappy war A broken league a bride unjustly sought A crown usurp d which with their blood is bought These are the crimes with which they load the name Of Turnus and on him alone exclaim Let him who lords it o er th Ausonian land Engage the Trojan hero hand to hand His is the gain our lot is but to serve T is just the sway he seeks he should deserve This Drances aggravates and adds with spite His foe expects and dares him to the fight Nor Turnus wants a party to support His cause and credit in the Latian court His former acts secure his present fame And the queen shades him with her mighty name While thus their factious minds with fury burn The legates from th Aetolian prince return Sad news they bring that after all the cost And care employ d their embassy is lost That Diomedes refus d his aid in war Unmov d with presents and as deaf to pray r Some new alliance must elsewhere be sought Or peace with Troy on hard conditions bought Latinus sunk in sorrow finds too late A foreign son is pointed out by fate And till Aeneas shall Lavinia wed The wrath of Heav n is hov ring o er his head The gods he saw espous d the juster side When late their titles in the field were tried Witness the fresh laments and fun ral tears undried Thus full of anxious thought he summons all The Latian senate to the council hall The princes come commanded by their head And crowd the paths that to the palace lead Supreme in pow

and sacred silence reign d around We have said he perform d your high command And pass d with peril a long tract of land We reach d the place desir d with wonder fill d The Grecian tents and rising

presents first we bring Then crave an instant audience from the king His leave obtain d our native soil we name And tell th important cause for which we came Attentively he heard us while we spoke Then with soft accents and a pleasing look Made this return Ausonian race of old Renown d for peace and for an age of gold What madness has your alter d minds possess d To change for war hereditary rest Solicit arms unknown and tempt the sword A needless ill your ancestors abhorr d We for myself I speak and all the name Of Grecians who to Troy s destruction came Omitting those who were in battle slain Or borne by rolling Simois to the main Not one but suffer d and too dearly bought The prize of honor which in arms he sought Some doom d to death and some in exile driv n Outcasts abandon d by the care of Heav n So worn so wretched so despis d a crew As ev n old Priam might with pity view Witness the vessels by Minerva toss d In storms the vengeful Capharean coast Th Euboean rocks the

dead of night Break my short sleep and skim before my sight I might have promis d to myself those harms Mad as I was when I with mortal arms Presum d against immortal pow rs to move And violate with wounds the Queen of Love Such arms this hand shall never more employ No hate remains with me to ruin d Troy I war not with its dust nor am I glad To think of past events or good or bad Your presents I return whate er you bring To buy my friendship send the Trojan king We met in fight I know him to my cost With what a whirling force his lance he toss d Heav ns what a spring was in his arm to throw How high he held his shield and rose at ev ry blow Had Troy produc d two more his match in might They would have chang d the fortune of the fight Th invasion of the Greeks had been return d Our empire

inferior in the field In pious reverence to the gods excell d Make peace ye Latians and avoid with care Th impending dangers of a fatal war He said no more but with this cold excuse Refus d th alliance and advis d a truce Thus Venulus concluded his report A jarring murmur fill d the factious court As when a torrent rolls with rapid force And dashes o er the stones that stop the course The flood constrain d within a scanty space Roars horrible along th uneasy race White foam in gath ring eddies floats around The rocky shores rebellow to the sound The murmur ceas d then from his lofty throne The king invok d the gods and thus begun I wish ye Latins what we now debate Had been resolv d before it was too late Much better had it been for you and me Unforc d by this our last necessity To have been earlier wise than now to call A council when the foe surrounds the wall O citizens we wage unequal war With men not only Heav n s peculiar care But Heav n s own race unconquer d in the field Or conquer d yet unknowing how to yield What hopes you had in Diomedes lay down Our hopes must center on ourselves alone Yet those how feeble and indeed how vain You see too well nor need my words explain Vanquish d without resource laid flat by fate Factions within a foe without the gate Not but I grant that all perform d their parts With manly force and with undaunted hearts With our united strength the war we wag d With equal numbers equal arms engag d You see th event Now hear what I propose To save our friends and satisfy our foes A tract of land the Latins have possess d Along the Tiber stretching to the west Which now Rutulians and Auruncans till And their mix d cattle graze the fruitful hill Those mountains fill d with firs that lower land If you consent the Trojan shall command Call d into part of what is ours and there On terms agreed the common country share There let em build and settle if they please Unless they choose once more to cross the seas In search of seats remote from Italy And from unwelcome inmates set us free Then twice ten galleys let us build with speed Or twice as many more if more they need Materials are at hand a well grown wood Runs equal with the margin of the flood Let them the number and the form assign The care and cost of all the stores be mine To treat the peace a hundred senators Shall be commission d hence with ample pow rs With olive the presents they shall bear A purple robe a royal iv ry chair And all the marks of sway that Latian monarchs wear And sums of gold Among yourselves debate This great affair and save the sinking state Then Drances took the word who grudg d long since The rising glories of the Daunian prince Factious and rich bold at the council board But cautious in the field he shunn d the sword A close caballer and tongue valiant lord Noble his mother was and near the throne But what his father s parentage unknown He rose and took th advantage of the times To load young Turnus with invidious crimes Such truths O king said he your words contain As strike the sense and all replies are vain Nor are your loyal subjects now to seek What common needs require but fear to speak Let him give leave of speech that haughty man Whose pride this unauspicious war began For whose ambition let me dare to say Fear set apart tho death is in my way The plains of Latium run with blood around So many valiant heroes bite the ground Dejected grief in ev ry face appears A town in mourning and a land in tears While he th undoubted author of our harms The man who menaces the gods with arms Yet after all his boasts forsook the fight And sought his safety in ignoble flight Now best of kings since you propose to send Such bounteous presents to your Trojan friend Add yet a greater at our joint request One which he values more than all the rest Give him the fair Lavinia for his bride With that alliance let the league be tied And for the bleeding land a lasting peace provide Let insolence no longer awe the throne But with a father s right bestow your own For this maligner of the general good If still we fear his force he must be woo d His haughty godhead we with pray rs implore Your scepter to release and our just rights restore O cursed cause of all our ills must we Wage wars unjust and fall in fight for thee What right hast thou to rule the Latian state And send us out to meet our certain fate T is a destructive war from Turnus hand Our peace and public safety we demand Let the fair bride to the brave chief remain If not the peace without the pledge is vain Turnus I know you think me not your friend Nor will I much with your belief contend I beg your greatness not to give the law In others realms but beaten to withdraw Pity your own or pity our estate Nor twist our fortunes with your sinking fate Your interest is the war should never cease But we have felt enough to wish the peace A land exhausted to the last remains Depopulated towns and driven plains Yet if desire of fame and thirst of pow r A beauteous princess with a crown in dow r So fire your mind in arms assert your right And meet your foe who dares you to the fight Mankind it seems is made for you alone We but the slaves who mount you to the throne A base ignoble crowd without a name Unwept unworthy of the fun ral flame By duty bound to forfeit each his life That Turnus may possess a royal wife Permit not mighty man so mean a crew Should share such triumphs and detain from you The post of honor your undoubted due Rather alone your matchless force employ To merit what alone you must enjoy These words so full of malice mix d with art Inflam d with rage the youthful hero s heart Then groaning from the bottom of his breast He heav d for wind and thus his wrath express d You Drances never want a stream of words Then when the public need requires our swords First in the council hall to steer the state And ever foremost in a tongue debate While our strong walls secure us from the foe Ere yet with blood our ditches overflow But let the potent orator declaim And with the brand of coward blot my name Free leave is giv n him when his fatal hand Has cover d with more corps the sanguine strand And high as mine his tow ring trophies stand If any doubt remains who dares the most Let us decide it at the Trojan s cost And issue both abreast where honor calls Foes are not far to seek without the walls Unless his noisy tongue can only fight And feet were giv n him but to speed his flight I beaten from the field I forc d away Who but so known a dastard dares to say Had he but ev n beheld the fight his eyes Had witness d for me what his tongue denies What heaps of Trojans by this hand were slain And how the bloody Tiber swell d the main All saw but he th Arcadian troops retire In scatter d squadrons and their prince expire The giant brothers in their camp have found I was not forc d with ease to quit my ground Not such the Trojans tried me when inclos d I singly their united arms oppos d First forc d an entrance thro their thick array Then glutted with their slaughter freed my way T is a destructive war So let it be But to the Phrygian pirate and to thee Meantime proceed to fill the people s ears With false reports their minds with panic fears Extol the strength of a twice conquer d race Our foes encourage and our friends debase Believe thy fables and the Trojan town Triumphant stands the Grecians are o erthrown Suppliant at Hector s feet Achilles lies And Diomede from fierce Aeneas flies Say rapid Aufidus with awful dread Runs backward from the sea and hides his head When the great Trojan on his bank appears For that s as true as thy dissembled fears Of my revenge Dismiss that vanity Thou Drances art below a death from me Let that vile soul in that vile body rest The lodging is well worthy of the guest Now royal father to the present state Of our affairs and of this high debate If in your arms thus early you diffide And think your fortune is already tried If one defeat has brought us down so low As never more in fields to meet the foe Then I conclude for peace t is time to treat And lie like vassals at the victor s feet But O if any ancient blood remains One drop of all our fathers in our veins That man would I prefer before the rest Who dar d his death with an undaunted breast Who comely fell by no dishonest wound To shun that sight and dying gnaw d the ground But if we still have fresh recruits in store If our confederates can afford us more If the contended field we bravely fought And not a bloodless victory was bought Their losses equal d ours and for their slain With equal fires they fill d the shining plain Why thus unforc d should we so tamely yield And ere the trumpet sounds resign the field Good unexpected evils unforeseen Appear by turns as fortune shifts the scene Some rais d aloft come tumbling down amain Then fall so hard they bound and rise again If Diomede refuse his aid to lend The great Messapus yet remains our friend Tolumnius who foretells events is ours Th Italian chiefs and princes join their pow rs Nor least in number nor in name the last Your own brave subjects have your cause embrac d Above the rest the Volscian Amazon Contains an army in herself alone And heads a squadron terrible to sight With glitt ring shields in brazen armor bright Yet if the foe a single fight demand And I alone the public peace withstand If you consent he shall not be refus d Nor find a hand to victory unus d This new Achilles let him take the field With fated armor and Vulcanian shield For you my royal father and my fame I Turnus not the least of all my name Devote my soul He calls me hand to hand And I alone will answer his demand Drances shall rest secure and neither share The danger nor divide the prize of war While they debate nor these nor those will yield Aeneas draws his forces to the field And moves his camp The scouts with flying speed Return and thro the frighted city spread Th unpleasing news the Trojans are descried In battle marching by the river side And bending to the town They take th alarm Some tremble some are bold all in confusion arm Th impetuous youth press forward to the field They clash the sword and clatter on the shield The fearful matrons raise a screaming cry Old feeble men with fainter groans reply A jarring sound results and mingles in the sky Like that of swans remurm ring to the floods Or birds of diff ring kinds in hollow woods Turnus th occasion takes and cries aloud Talk on ye quaint haranguers of the crowd Declaim in praise of peace when danger calls And the fierce foes in arms approach the walls He said and turning short with speedy pace Casts back a scornful glance and quits the place Thou Volusus the Volscian troops command To mount and lead thyself our Ardean band Messapus and Catillus post your force Along the fields to charge the Trojan horse Some guard the passes others man the wall Drawn up in arms the rest attend my call They swarm from ev ry quarter of the town And with disorder d haste the rampires crown Good old Latinus when he saw too late The gath ring storm just breaking on the state Dismiss d the council till a fitter time And own d his easy temper as his crime Who forc d against his reason had complied To break the treaty for the promis d bride Some help to sink new trenches others aid To ram the stones or raise the palisade Hoarse trumpets sound th alarm around the walls Runs a distracted crew whom their last labor calls A sad procession in the streets is seen Of matrons that attend the mother queen High in her chair she sits and at her side With downcast eyes appears the fatal bride They mount the cliff where Pallas temple stands Pray rs in their mouths and presents in their hands With censers first they fume the sacred shrine Then in this common supplication join O patroness of arms unspotted maid Propitious hear and lend thy Latins aid Break short the pirate s lance pronounce his fate And lay the Phrygian low before the gate Now Turnus arms for fight His back and breast Well temper d steel and scaly brass invest The cuishes which his brawny thighs infold Are mingled metal damask d o er with gold His faithful fauchion sits upon his side Nor casque nor crest his manly features hide But bare to view amid surrounding friends With godlike grace he from the tow r descends Exulting in his strength he seems to dare His absent rival and to promise war Freed from his keepers thus with broken reins The wanton courser prances o er the plains Or in the pride of youth o erleaps the mounds And snuffs the females in forbidden grounds Or seeks his wat ring in the well known flood To quench his thirst and cool his fiery blood He swims luxuriant in the liquid plain And o er his shoulder flows his waving mane He neighs he snorts he bears his head on high Before his ample chest the frothy waters fly Soon as the prince appears without the gate The Volscians with their virgin leader wait His last commands Then with a graceful mien Lights from her lofty steed the warrior queen Her squadron imitates and each descends Whose common suit Camilla thus commends If sense of honor if a soul secure Of inborn worth that can all tests endure Can promise aught or on itself rely Greatly to dare to conquer or to die Then I alone sustain d by these will meet The Tyrrhene troops and promise their defeat Ours be the danger ours the sole renown You general ral stay behind and guard the town Turnus a while stood mute with glad surprise And on the fierce virago fix d his eyes Then thus return d O grace of Italy With what becoming thanks can I reply Not only words lie lab ring in my breast But thought itself is by thy praise oppress d Yet rob me not of all but let me join My toils my hazard and my fame with thine The Trojan not in stratagem unskill d Sends his light horse before to scour the field Himself thro steep ascents and thorny brakes A larger compass to the city takes This news my scouts confirm and I prepare To foil his cunning and his force to dare With chosen foot his passage to forelay And place an ambush in the winding way Thou with thy Volscians face the Tuscan horse The brave Messapus shall thy troops inforce With those of Tibur and the Latian band Subjected all to thy supreme command This said he warns Messapus to the war Then ev ry chief exhorts with equal care All thus encourag d his own troops he joins And hastes to prosecute his deep designs Inclos d with hills a winding valley lies By nature form d for fraud and fitted for surprise A narrow track by human steps untrode Leads thro perplexing thorns to this obscure abode High o er the vale a steepy mountain stands Whence the surveying sight the nether ground commands The top is level an offensive seat Of war and from the war a safe retreat For on the right and left is room to press The foes at hand or from afar distress To drive em headlong downward and to pour On their descending backs a stony show r Thither young Turnus took the well known way Possess d the pass and in blind ambush lay Meantime Latonian Phoebe from the skies Beheld th approaching war with hateful eyes And call d the light foot Opis to her aid Her most belov d and ever trusty maid Then with a sigh began Camilla goes To meet her death amidst her fatal foes The nymphs I lov d of all my mortal train Invested with Diana s arms in vain Nor is my kindness for the virgin new T was born with her and with her years it grew Her father Metabus when forc d away From old Privernum for tyrannic sway Snatch d up and sav d from his prevailing foes This tender babe companion of his woes Casmilla was her mother but he drown d One hissing letter in a softer sound And call d Camilla Thro the woods he flies Wrapp d in his robe the royal infant lies His foes in sight he mends his weary pace With shout and clamors they pursue the chase The banks of Amasene at length he gains The raging flood his farther flight restrains Rais d o er the borders with unusual rains Prepar d to plunge into the stream he fears Not for himself but for the charge he bears Anxious he stops a while and thinks in haste Then desp rate in distress resolves at last A knotty lance of well boil d oak he bore The middle part with cork he cover d o er He clos d the child within the hollow space With twigs of bending osier bound the case Then pois d the spear heavy with human weight And thus invok d my favor for the freight Accept great goddess of the woods he said Sent by her sire this dedicated maid Thro air she flies a suppliant to thy shrine And the first weapons that she knows are thine He said and with full force the spear he threw Above the sounding waves Camilla flew Then press d by foes he stemm d the stormy tide And gain d by stress of arms the farther side His fasten d spear he pull d from out the ground And victor of his vows his infant nymph unbound Nor after that in towns which walls inclose Would trust his hunted life amidst his foes But rough in open air he chose to lie Earth was his couch his cov ring was the sky On hills unshorn or in a desart den He shunn d the dire society of men A shepherd s solitary life he led His daughter with the milk of mares he fed The dugs of bears and ev ry salvage beast He drew and thro her lips the liquor press d The little Amazon could scarcely go He loads her with a quiver and a bow And that she might her stagg ring steps command He with a slender jav lin fills her hand Her flowing hair no golden fillet bound Nor swept her trailing robe the dusty ground Instead of these a tiger s hide o erspread Her back and shoulders fasten d to her head The flying dart she first attempts to fling And round her tender temples toss d the sling Then as her strength with years increas d began To pierce aloft in air the soaring swan And from the clouds to fetch the heron and the crane The Tuscan matrons with each other vied To bless their rival sons with such a bride But she disdains their love to share with me The sylvan shades and vow d virginity And O I wish contented with my cares Of salvage spoils she had not sought the wars Then had she been of my celestial train And shunn d the fate that dooms her to be slain But since opposing Heav n s decree she goes To find her death among forbidden foes Haste with these arms and take thy steepy flight Where with the gods averse the Latins fight This bow to thee this quiver I bequeath This chosen arrow to revenge her death By whate er hand Camilla shall be slain Or of the Trojan or Italian train Let him not pass unpunish d from the plain Then in a hollow cloud myself will aid To bear the breathless body of my maid Unspoil d shall be her arms and unprofan d Her holy limbs with any human hand And in a marble tomb laid in her native land She said The faithful nymph descends from high With rapid flight and cuts the sounding sky Black clouds and stormy winds around her body fly By this the Trojan and the Tuscan horse Drawn up in squadrons with united force Approach the walls the sprightly coursers bound Press forward on their bits and shift their ground Shields arms and spears flash horribly from far And the fields glitter with a waving war Oppos d to these come on with furious force Messapus Coras and the Latian horse These in the body plac d on either hand Sustain d and clos d by fair Camilla s band Advancing in a line they couch their spears And less and less the middle space appears Thick smoke obscures the field and scarce are seen The neighing coursers and the shouting men In distance of their darts they stop their course Then man to man they rush and horse to horse The face of heav n their flying jav lins hide And deaths unseen are dealt on either side Tyrrhenus and Aconteus void of fear By mettled coursers borne in full career Meet first oppos d and with a mighty shock Their horses heads against each other knock Far from his steed is fierce Aconteus cast As with an engine s force or lightning s blast He rolls along in blood and breathes his last The Latin squadrons take a sudden fright And sling their shields behind to save their backs in flight Spurring at speed to their own walls they drew Close in the rear the Tuscan troops pursue And urge their flight Asylas leads the chase Till seiz d with shame they wheel about and face Receive their foes and raise a threat ning cry The Tuscans take their turn to fear and fly So swelling surges with a thund ring roar Driv n on each other s backs insult the shore Bound o er the rocks incroach upon the land And far upon the beach eject the sand Then backward with a swing they take their way Repuls d from upper ground and seek their mother sea With equal hurry quit th invaded shore And swallow back the sand and stones they spew d before Twice were the Tuscans masters of the field Twice by the Latins in their turn repell d Asham d at length to the third charge they ran Both hosts resolv d and mingled man to man Now dying groans are heard the fields are strow d With falling bodies and are drunk with blood Arms horses men on heaps together lie Confus d the fight and more confus d the cry Orsilochus who durst not press too near Strong Remulus at distance drove his spear And stuck the steel beneath his horse s ear The fiery steed impatient of the wound Curvets and springing upward with a bound His helpless lord cast backward on the ground Catillus pierc d Iolas first then drew His reeking lance and at Herminius threw The mighty champion of the Tuscan crew His neck and throat unarm d his head was bare But shaded with a length of yellow hair Secure he fought expos d on ev ry part A spacious mark for swords and for the flying dart Across the shoulders came the feather d wound Transfix d he fell and doubled to the ground The sands with streaming blood are sanguine dyed And death with honor sought on either side Resistless thro the war Camilla rode In danger unappall d and pleas d with blood One side was bare for her exerted breast One shoulder with her painted quiver press d Now from afar her fatal jav lins play Now with her ax s edge she hews her way Diana s arms upon her shoulder sound And when too closely press d she quits the ground From her bent bow she sends a backward wound Her maids in martial pomp on either side Larina Tulla fierce Tarpeia ride Italians all in peace their queen s delight In war the bold companions of the fight So march d the Tracian Amazons of old When Thermodon with bloody billows roll d Such troops as these in shining arms were seen When Theseus met in fight their maiden queen Such to the field Penthisilea led From the fierce virgin when the Grecians fled With such return d triumphant from the war Her maids with cries attend the lofty car They clash with manly force their moony shields With female shouts resound the Phrygian fields Who foremost and who last heroic maid On the cold earth were by thy courage laid Thy spear of mountain ash Eumenius first With fury driv n from side to side transpierc d A purple stream came spouting from the wound Bath d in his blood he lies and bites the ground Liris and Pegasus at once she slew The former as the slacken d reins he drew Of his faint steed the latter as he stretch d His arm to prop his friend the jav lin reach d By the same weapon sent from the same hand Both fall together and both spurn the sand Amastrus next is added to the slain The rest in rout she follows o er the plain Tereus Harpalycus Demophoon And Chromis at full speed her fury shun Of all her deadly darts not one she lost Each was attended with a Trojan ghost Young Ornithus bestrode a hunter steed Swift for the chase and of Apulian breed Him from afar she spied in arms unknown O er his broad back an ox s hide was thrown His helm a wolf whose gaping jaws were spread A cov ring for his cheeks and grinn d around his head He clench d within his hand an iron prong And tower d above the rest conspicuous in the throng Him soon she singled from the flying train And slew with ease then thus insults the slain Vain hunter didst thou think thro woods to chase The savage herd a vile and trembling race Here cease thy vaunts and own my victory A woman warrior was too strong for thee Yet if the ghosts demand the conqu ror s name Confessing great Camilla save thy shame Then Butes and Orsilochus she slew The bulkiest bodies of the Trojan crew But Butes breast to breast the spear descends Above the gorget where his helmet ends And o er the shield which his left side defends Orsilochus and she their courses ply He seems to follow and she seems to fly But in a narrower ring she makes the race And then he flies and she pursues the chase Gath ring at length on her deluded foe She swings her ax and rises to the blow Full on the helm behind with such a sway The weapon falls the riven steel gives way He groans he roars he sues in vain for grace Brains mingled with his blood besmear his face Astonish d Aunus just arrives by chance To see his fall nor farther dares advance But fixing on the horrid maid his eye He stares and shakes and finds it vain to fly Yet like a true Ligurian born to cheat At least while fortune favor d his deceit Cries out aloud What courage have you shown Who trust your courser s strength and not your own Forego the vantage of your horse alight And then on equal terms begin the fight It shall be seen weak woman what you can When foot to foot you combat with a man He said She glows with anger and disdain Dismounts with speed to dare him on the plain And leaves her horse at large among her train With her drawn sword defies him to the field And marching lifts aloft her maiden shield The youth who thought his cunning did succeed Reins round his horse and urges all his speed Adds the remembrance of the spur and hides The goring rowels in his bleeding sides Vain fool and coward cries the lofty maid Caught in the train which thou thyself hast laid On others practice thy Ligurian arts Thin stratagems and tricks of little hearts Are lost on me nor shalt thou safe retire With vaunting lies to thy fallacious sire At this so fast her flying feet she sped That soon she strain d beyond his horse s head Then turning short at once she seiz d the rein And laid the boaster grov ling on the plain Not with more ease the falcon from above Trusses in middle air the trembling dove Then plumes the prey in her strong pounces bound The feathers foul with blood come tumbling to the ground Now mighty Jove from his superior height With his broad eye surveys th unequal fight He fires the breast of Tarchon with disdain And sends him to redeem th abandon d plain Betwixt the broken ranks the Tuscan rides And these encourages and those he chides Recalls each leader by his name from flight Renews their ardor and restores the fight What panic fear has seiz d your souls O shame O brand perpetual of th Etrurian name Cowards incurable a woman s hand Drives breaks and scatters your ignoble band Now cast away the sword and quit the shield What use of weapons which you dare not wield Not thus you fly your female foes by night Nor shun the feast when the full bowls invite When to fat off rings the glad augur calls And the shrill hornpipe sounds to bacchanals These are your studied cares your lewd delight Swift to debauch but slow to manly fight Thus having said he spurs amid the foes Not managing the life he meant to lose The first he found he seiz d with headlong haste In his strong gripe and clasp d around the waist T was Venulus whom from his horse he tore And laid athwart his own in triumph bore Loud shouts ensue the Latins turn their eyes And view th unusual sight with vast surprise The fiery Tarchon flying o er the plains Press d in his arms the pond rous prey sustains Then with his shorten d spear explores around His jointed arms to fix a deadly wound Nor less the captive struggles for his life He writhes his body to prolong the strife And fencing for his naked throat exerts His utmost vigor and the point averts So stoops the yellow eagle from on high And bears a speckled serpent thro the sky Fast ning his crooked talons on the prey The pris ner hisses thro the liquid way Resists the royal hawk and tho oppress d She fights in volumes and erects her crest Turn d to her foe she stiffens ev ry scale And shoots her forky tongue and whisks her threat ning tail Against the victor all defense is weak Th imperial bird still plies her with his beak He tears her bowels and her breast he gores Then claps his pinions and securely soars Thus thro the midst of circling enemies Strong Tarchon snatch d and bore away his prize The Tyrrhene troops that shrunk before now press The Latins and presume the like success Then Aruns doom d to death his arts assay d To murther unespied the Volscian maid This way and that his winding course he bends And whereso er she turns her steps attends When she retires victorious from the chase He wheels about with care and shifts his place When rushing on she seeks her foes flight He keeps aloof but keeps her still in sight He threats and trembles trying ev ry way Unseen to kill and safely to betray Chloreus the priest of Cybele from far Glitt ring in Phrygian arms amidst the war Was by the virgin view d The steed he press d Was proud with trappings and his brawny chest With scales of gilded brass was cover d o er A robe of Tyrian dye the rider wore With deadly wounds he gall d the distant foe Gnossian his shafts and Lycian was his bow A golden helm his front and head surrounds A gilded quiver from his shoulder sounds Gold weav d with linen on his thighs he wore With flowers of needlework distinguish d o er With golden buckles bound and gather d up before Him the fierce maid beheld with ardent eyes Fond and ambitious of so rich a prize Or that the temple might his trophies hold Or else to shine herself in Trojan gold Blind in her haste she chases him alone And seeks his life regardless of her own This lucky moment the sly traitor chose Then starting from his ambush up he rose And threw but first to Heav n address d his vows O patron of Socrates high abodes Phoebus the ruling pow r among the gods Whom first we serve whole woods of unctuous pine Are fell d for thee and to thy glory shine By thee protected with our naked soles Thro flames unsing d we march and tread the kindled coals Give me propitious pow r to wash away The stains of this dishonorable day Nor spoils nor triumph from the fact I claim But with my future actions trust my fame Let me by stealth this female plague o ercome And from the field return inglorious home Apollo heard and granting half his pray r Shuffled in winds the rest and toss d in empty air He gives the death desir d his safe return By southern tempests to the seas is borne Now when the jav lin whizz d along the skies Both armies on Camilla turn d their eyes Directed by the sound Of either host Th unhappy virgin tho concern d the most Was only deaf so greedy was she bent On golden spoils and on her prey intent Till in her pap the winged weapon stood Infix d and deeply drunk the purple blood Her sad attendants hasten to sustain Their dying lady drooping on the plain Far from their sight the trembling Aruns flies With beating heart and fear confus d with joys Nor dares he farther to pursue his blow Or ev n to bear the sight of his expiring foe As when the wolf has torn a bullock s hide At unawares or ranch d a shepherd s side Conscious of his audacious deed he flies And claps his quiv ring tail between his thighs So speeding once the wretch no more attends But spurring forward herds among his friends She wrench d the jav lin with her dying hands But wedg d within her breast the weapon stands The wood she draws the steely point remains She staggers in her seat with agonizing pains A gath ring mist o erclouds her cheerful eyes And from her cheeks the rosy color flies Then turns to her whom of her female train She trusted most and thus she speaks with pain Acca t is past he swims before my sight Inexorable Death and claims his right Bear my last words to Turnus fly with speed And bid him timely to my charge succeed Repel the Trojans and the town relieve Farewell and in this kiss my parting breath receive She said and sliding sunk upon the plain Dying her open d hand forsakes the rein Short and more short she pants by slow degrees Her mind the passage from her body frees She drops her sword she nods her plumy crest Her drooping head declining on her breast In the last sigh her struggling soul expires And murm ring with disdain to Stygian sounds retires A shout that struck the golden stars ensued Despair and rage the languish d fight renew d The Trojan troops and Tuscans in a line Advance to charge the mix d Arcadians join But Cynthia s maid high seated from afar Surveys the field and fortune of the war Unmov d a while till prostrate on the plain Welt ring in blood she sees Camilla slain And round her corpse of friends and foes a fighting train Then from the bottom of her breast she drew A mournful sigh and these sad words ensue Too dear a fine ah much lamented maid For warring with the Trojans thou hast paid Nor aught avail d in this unhappy strife Diana s sacred arms to save thy life Yet unreveng d thy goddess will not leave Her vot ry s death nor with vain sorrow grieve Branded the wretch and be his name abhorr d But after ages shall thy praise record Th inglorious coward soon shall press the plain Thus vows thy queen and thus the Fates ordain High o er the field there stood a hilly mound Sacred the place and spread with oaks around Where in a marble tomb Dercennus lay A king that once in Latium bore the sway The beauteous Opis thither bent her flight To mark the traitor Aruns from the height Him in refulgent arms she soon espied Swoln with success and loudly thus she cried Thy backward steps vain boaster are too late Turn like a man at length and meet thy fate Charg d with my message to Camilla go And say I sent thee to the shades below An honor undeserv d from Cynthia s bow She said and from her quiver chose with speed The winged shaft predestin d for the deed Then to the stubborn yew her strength applied Till the far distant horns approach d on either side The bowstring touch d her breast so strong she drew Whizzing in air the fatal arrow flew At once the twanging bow and sounding dart The traitor heard and felt the point within his heart Him beating with his heels in pangs of death His flying friends to foreign fields bequeath The conqu ring damsel with expanded wings The welcome message to her mistress brings Their leader lost the Volscians quit the field And unsustain d the chiefs of Turnus yield The frighted soldiers when their captains fly More on their speed than on their strength rely Confus d in flight they bear each other down And spur their horses headlong to the town Driv

horses with a rattling sound Beat short and thick and shake the rotten ground Black clouds of dust come rolling in the sky And o er the darken d walls and rampires fly The trembling matrons from their lofty stands Rend heav n with female shrieks and wring their hands All pressing on pursuers and pursued Are crush d in crowds a mingled multitude Some happy few escape the throng too late Rush on for entrance till they choke the gate Ev n in the sight of home the wretched sire Looks on and sees his helpless son expire Then in a fright the folding gates they close But leave their friends excluded with their foes The vanquish d cry the victors loudly shout T is terror all within and slaughter all without Blind in their fear they bounce against the wall Or to the moats pursued precipitate their fall The Latian virgins valiant with despair Arm d on the tow rs the common danger share So much of zeal their country s cause inspir d So much Camilla s great example fir d Poles sharpen d in the flames from high they throw With imitated darts to gall the foe Their lives for godlike freedom they bequeath And crowd each other to be first in death Meantime to Turnus ambush d in the shade With heavy tidings came th unhappy maid The Volscians overthrown Camilla kill d The foes entirely masters of the field Like a resistless flood come rolling on The cry goes off the plain and thickens to the town Inflam d with rage for so the Furies fire The Daunian s breast and so the Fates require He leaves the hilly pass the woods in vain Possess d and downward issues on the plain Scarce was he gone when to the straits now freed From secret foes the Trojan troops succeed Thro the black forest and the ferny brake Unknowingly secure their way they take From the rough mountains to the plain descend And there in order drawn their line extend Both armies now in open fields are seen Nor far the distance of the space between Both to the city bend Aeneas sees Thro smoking fields his hast ning enemies And Turnus views the Trojans in array And hears th approaching horses proudly neigh Soon had their hosts in bloody battle join d But westward to the sea the sun declin d Intrench d before the town both armies lie While Night with sable wings involves the sky BOOK XII When Turnus saw the Latins leave the field Their armies broken and their courage quell d Himself become the mark of public spite His honor question d for the promis d fight The more he was with vulgar hate oppress d The more his fury boil d within his breast He rous d his vigor for the last debate And rais d his haughty soul to meet his fate As when the swains the Libyan lion chase He makes a sour retreat nor mends his pace But if the pointed jav lin pierce his side The lordly beast returns with double pride He wrenches out the steel he roars for pain His sides he lashes and erects his mane So Turnus fares his eyeballs flash with fire Thro his wide nostrils clouds of smoke expire Trembling with rage around the court he ran At length approach d the king and thus began No more excuses or delays I stand In arms prepar d to combat hand to hand This base deserter of his native land The Trojan by his word is bound to take The same conditions which himself did make Renew the truce the solemn rites prepare And to my single virtue trust the war The Latians unconcern d shall see the fight This arm unaided shall assert your right Then if my prostrate body press the plain To him the crown and beauteous bride remain To whom the king sedately thus replied Brave youth the more your valor has been tried The more becomes it us with due respect To weigh the chance of war which you neglect You want not wealth or a successive throne Or cities which your arms have made your own My towns and treasures are at your command And stor d with blooming beauties is my land Laurentum more than one Lavinia sees Unmarried fair of noble families Now let me speak and you with patience hear Things which perhaps may grate a lover s ear But sound advice proceeding from a heart Sincerely yours and free from fraudful art The gods by signs have manifestly shown No prince Italian born should heir my throne Oft have our augurs in prediction skill d And oft our priests foreign son reveal d Yet won by worth that cannot be withstood Brib d by my kindness to my kindred blood Urg d by my wife who would not be denied I promis d my Lavinia for your bride Her from her plighted lord by force I took All ties of treaties and of honor broke On your account I wag d an impious war With what success t is needless to declare I and my subjects feel and you have had your share Twice vanquish d while in bloody fields we strive Scarce in our walls we keep our hopes alive The rolling flood runs warm with human gore The bones of Latians blanch the neighb ring shore Why put I not an end to this debate Still unresolv d and still a slave to fate If Turnus death a lasting peace can give Why should I not procure it whilst you live Should I to doubtful arms your youth betray What would my kinsmen the Rutulians say And should you fall in fight which Heav n defend How curse the cause which hasten d to his end The daughter s lover and the father s friend Weigh in your mind the various chance of war Pity your parent s age and ease his care Such balmy words he pour d but all in vain The proffer d med cine but provok d the pain The wrathful youth disdaining the relief With intermitting sobs thus vents his grief The care O best of fathers which you take For my concerns at my desire forsake Permit me not to languish out my days But make the best exchange of life for praise This arm this lance can well dispute the prize And the blood follows where the weapon flies His goddess mother is not near to shroud The flying coward with an empty cloud But now the queen who fear d for Turnus life And loath d the hard conditions of the strife Held him by force and dying in his death In these sad accents gave her sorrow breath O Turnus I adjure thee by these tears And whate er price Amata s honor bears Within thy breast since thou art all my hope My sickly mind s repose my sinking age s prop Since on the safety of thy life alone Depends Latinus and the Latian throne Refuse me not this one this only pray r To waive the combat and pursue the war Whatever chance attends this fatal strife Think it includes in thine Amata s life I cannot live a slave or see my throne Usurp d by strangers or a Trojan son At this a flood of tears Lavinia shed A crimson blush her beauteous face o erspread Varying her cheeks by turns with white and red The driving colors never at a stay Run here and there and flush and fade away Delightful change Thus Indian iv ry shows Which with the bord ring paint of purple glows Or lilies damask d by the neighb ring rose The lover gaz d and burning with desire The more he look d the more he fed the fire Revenge and jealous rage and secret spite Roll in his breast and rouse him to the fight Then fixing on the queen his ardent eyes Firm to his first intent he thus replies O mother do not by your tears prepare Such boding omens and prejudge the war Resolv d on fight I am no longer free To shun my death if Heav n my death decree Then turning to the herald thus pursues Go greet the Trojan with ungrateful news Denounce from me that when to morrow s light Shall gild the heav ns he need not urge the fight The Trojan and Rutulian troops no more Shall dye with mutual blood the Latian shore Our single swords the quarrel shall decide And to the victor be the beauteous bride He said and striding on with speedy pace He sought his coursers of the Thracian race At his approach they toss their heads on high And proudly neighing promise victory The sires of these Orythia sent from far To grace Pilumnus when he went to war The drifts of Thracian snows were scarce so white Nor northern winds in fleetness match d their flight Officious grooms stand ready by his side And some with combs their flowing manes divide And others stroke their chests and gently soothe their pride He sheath d his limbs in arms a temper d mass Of golden metal those and mountain brass Then to his head his glitt ring helm he tied And girt his faithful fauchion to his side In his Aetnaean forge the God of Fire That fauchion labor d for the hero s sire Immortal keenness on the blade bestow d And plung d it hissing in the Stygian flood Propp d on a pillar which the ceiling bore Was plac d the lance Auruncan Actor wore Which with such force he brandish d in his hand The tough ash trembled like an osier wand Then cried O pond rous spoil of Actor slain And never yet by Turnus toss d in vain Fail not this day thy wonted force but go Sent by this hand to pierce the Trojan foe Give me to tear his corslet from his breast And from that eunuch head to rend the crest Dragg d in the dust his frizzled hair to soil Hot from the vexing ir n and smear d with fragrant oil Thus while he raves from his wide nostrils flies A fiery steam and sparkles from his eyes So fares the bull in his lov d female s sight Proudly he bellows and preludes the fight He tries his goring horns against a tree And meditates his absent enemy He pushes at the winds he digs the strand With his black hoofs and spurns the yellow sand Nor less the Trojan in his Lemnian arms To future fight his manly courage warms He whets his fury and with joy prepares To terminate at once the ling ring wars To cheer his chiefs and tender son relates What Heav n had promis d and expounds the fates Then to the Latian king he sends to cease The rage of arms and ratify the peace The morn ensuing from the mountain s height Had scarcely spread the skies with rosy light Th ethereal coursers bounding from the sea From out their flaming nostrils breath d the day When now the Trojan and Rutulian guard In friendly labor join d the list prepar d Beneath the walls they measure out the space Then sacred altars rear on sods of grass Where with religious their common gods they place In purest white the priests their heads attire And living waters bear and holy fire And o er their linen hoods and shaded hair Long twisted wreaths of sacred veryain wear In order issuing from the town appears The Latin legion arm d with pointed spears And from the fields advancing on a line The Trojan and the Tuscan forces join Their various arms afford a pleasing sight A peaceful train they seem in peace prepar d for fight Betwixt the ranks the proud commanders ride Glitt ring with gold and vests in purple dyed Here Mnestheus author of the Memmian line And there Messapus born of seed divine The sign is giv n and round the listed space Each man in order fills his proper place Reclining on their ample shields they stand And fix their pointed lances in the sand Now studious of the sight a num rous throng Of either sex promiscuous old and young Swarm the town by those who rest behind The gates and walls and houses tops are lin d Meantime the Queen of Heav n beheld the sight With eyes unpleas d from Mount Albano s height Since call d Albano by succeeding fame But then an empty hill without a name She thence survey d the field the Trojan pow rs The Latian

Compress d by force but by the grateful god Now made the Nais of the neighb ring flood O nymph the pride of living lakes said she O most renown d and most belov d by me Long hast thou known nor need I to record The wanton sallies of my wand ring lord Of ev ry Latian fair whom Jove misled To mount by stealth my violated bed To thee alone I grudg d not his embrace But gave a part of heav n and an unenvied place Now learn from me thy near approaching grief Nor think my wishes want to thy relief While fortune favor d nor Heav n s King denied To lend my succor to the Latian side I sav d thy brother and the sinking state But now he struggles with unequal fate And goes with gods averse o ermatch d in might To meet inevitable death in fight Nor must I break the truce nor can sustain the sight Thou if thou dar saint thy present aid supply It well becomes a sister s care to try At this the lovely nymph with grief oppress d Thrice tore her hair and beat her comely breast To whom Saturnia thus Thy tears are late Haste snatch him if he can be snatch d from fate New tumults kindle violate the truce Who knows what changeful fortune may produce T is not a crime t attempt what I

Latinus bear Twelve golden beams around his temples play To mark his lineage from the God of Day Two snowy coursers Turnus chariot yoke And in his hand two massy spears he shook Then issued from the

and their abodes I ask but altars for my weary gods The care of those religious rites be mine The crown to King Latinus I resign His be the sov reign sway Nor will I share His pow r in peace or his command in war For me my friends another town shall frame And bless the rising tow rs with fair Lavinia s name Thus he Then with erected eyes and hands The Latian king before his altar stands By the same heav n said he and earth and main And all the pow rs that all the three contain By hell below and by that upper god Whose thunder signs the peace who seals it with his nod So let Latona s double offspring hear And double fronted Janus what I swear I touch the sacred altars touch the flames And all those pow rs attest and all their names Whatever chance befall on either side No term of time this union shall divide No force no fortune shall my vows unbind Or shake the steadfast tenor of my mind Not tho the circling seas should break their bound O erflow the shores or sap the solid ground Not tho the lamps of heav n their spheres forsake Hurl d down and hissing in the nether lake Ev n as this royal scepter for he bore A scepter in his hand shall never more Shoot out in branches or renew the birth An orphan now cut from the mother earth By the keen ax dishonor d of its hair And cas d in brass for Latian kings to bear When thus in public view the peace was tied With solemn vows and sworn on either side All dues perform d which holy rites require The victim beasts are slain before the fire The trembling entrails from their bodies torn And to the fatten d flames in chargers borne Already the Rutulians deem their man O ermatch d in arms before the fight began First rising fears are whisper d thro the crowd Then gath ring sound they murmur more aloud Now side to side they measure with their eyes The champions bulk their sinews and their size The nearer they approach the more is known Th apparent disadvantage of their own Turnus himself appears in public sight Conscious of fate desponding of the fight Slowly he moves and at his altar stands With eyes dejected and with trembling hands And while he mutters undistinguish d pray rs A livid deadness in his cheeks appears With anxious pleasure when Juturna view d Th increasing fright of the mad multitude When their short sighs and thick ning sobs she heard And found their ready minds for change prepar d Dissembling her immortal form she took Camertus mien his habit and his look A chief of ancient blood in arms well known Was his great sire and he his greater son His shape assum d amid the ranks she ran And humoring their first motions thus began For shame Rutulians can you bear the sight Of one expos d for all in single fight Can we before the face of heav n confess Our courage colder or our numbers less View all the Trojan host th Arcadian band And Tuscan army count em as they stand Undaunted to the battle if we go Scarce ev ry second man will share a foe Turnus t is true in this unequal strife Shall lose with honor his devoted life Or change it rather for immortal fame Succeeding to the gods from whence he came But you a servile and inglorious band For foreign lords shall sow your native land Those fruitful fields your fighting fathers gain d Which have so long their lazy sons sustain d With words like these she carried her design A rising murmur runs along the line Then ev n the city troops and Latians tir d With tedious war seem with new souls inspir d Their champion s fate with pity they lament And of the league so lately sworn repent Nor fails the goddess to foment the rage With lying wonders and a false presage But adds a sign which present to their eyes Inspires new courage and a glad surprise For sudden in the fiery tracts above Appears in pomp th imperial bird of Jove A plump of fowl he spies that swim the lakes And o er their heads his sounding pinions shakes Then stooping on the fairest of the train In his strong talons truss d a silver swan Th Italians wonder at th unusual sight But while he lags and labors in his flight Behold the dastard fowl return anew And with united force the foe pursue Clam rous around the royal hawk they fly And thick ning in a cloud o ershade the sky They cuff they scratch they cross his airy course Nor can th incumber d bird sustain their force But vex d not vanquish d drops the pond rous prey And lighten d of his burthen wings his way Th Ausonian bands with shouts salute the sight Eager of action and demand the fight Then King Tolumnius vers d in augurs arts Cries out and thus his boasted skill imparts At length t is granted what I long desir d This this is what my frequent vows requir d Ye gods I take your omen and obey Advance my friends and charge I lead the way These are the foreign foes whose impious band Like that rapacious bird infest our land But soon like him they shall be forc d to sea By strength united and forego the prey Your timely succor to your country bring Haste to the rescue and redeem your king He said and pressing onward thro the crew Pois d in his lifted arm his lance he threw The winged weapon whistling in the wind Came driving on nor miss d the mark design d At once the cornel rattled in the skies At once tumultuous shouts and clamors rise Nine brothers in a goodly band there stood Born of Arcadian mix d with Tuscan blood Gylippus sons the fatal jav lin flew Aim d at the midmost of the friendly crew A passage thro the jointed arms it found Just where the belt was to the body bound And struck the gentle youth extended on the ground Then fir d with pious rage the general rous train Run madly forward to revenge the slain And some with eager haste their jav lins throw And some with sword in hand assault the foe The wish d insult the Latine troops embrace And meet their ardor in the middle space The Trojans Tuscans and Arcadian line With equal courage obviate their design Peace leaves the violated fields and hate Both armies urges to their mutual fate With impious haste their altars are o erturn d The sacrifice half broil d and half unburn d Thick storms of steel from either army fly And clouds of clashing darts obscure the sky Brands from the fire are missive weapons made With chargers bowls and all the priestly trade Latinus frighted hastens from the fray And bears his unregarded gods away These on their horses vault those yoke the car The rest with swords on high run headlong to the war Messapus eager to confound the peace Spurr d his hot courser thro the fighting prease At King Aulestes by his purple known A Tuscan prince and by his regal crown And with a shock encount ring bore him down Backward he fell and as his fate design d The ruins of an altar were behind There pitching on his shoulders and his head Amid the scatt ring fires he lay supinely spread The beamy spear descending from above His cuirass pierc d and thro his body drove Then with a scornful smile the victor cries The gods have found a fitter sacrifice Greedy of spoils th Italians strip the dead Of his rich armor and uncrown his head Priest Corynaeus arm d his better hand From his own altar with a blazing brand And as Ebusus with a thund ring pace Advanc d to battle dash d it on his face His bristly beard shines out with sudden fires The crackling crop a noisome scent expires Following the blow he seiz d his curling crown With his left hand his other cast him down The prostrate body with his knees he press d And plung d his holy poniard in his breast While Podalirius with his sword pursued The shepherd Alsus thro the flying crowd Swiftly he turns and aims a deadly blow Full on the front of his unwary foe The broad ax enters with a crashing sound And cleaves the chin with one continued wound Warm blood and mingled brains besmear his arms around An iron sleep his stupid eyes oppress d And seal d their heavy lids in endless rest But good Aeneas rush d amid the bands Bare was his head and naked were his hands In sign of truce then thus he cries aloud What sudden rage what new desire of blood Inflames your alter d minds O Trojans cease From impious arms nor violate the peace By human sanctions and by laws divine The terms are all agreed the war is mine Dismiss your fears and let the fight ensue This hand alone shall right the gods and you Our injur d altars and their broken vow To this avenging sword the faithless Turnus owe Thus while he spoke unmindful of defense A winged arrow struck the pious prince But whether from some human hand it came Or hostile god is left unknown by fame No human hand or hostile god was found To boast the triumph of so base a wound When Turnus saw the Trojan quit the plain His chiefs dismay d his troops a fainting train Th unhop d event his heighten d soul inspires At once his arms and coursers he requires Then with a leap his lofty chariot gains And with a ready hand assumes the reins He drives impetuous and where er he goes He leaves behind a lane of slaughter d foes These his lance reaches over those he rolls His rapid car and crushes out their souls In vain the vanquish d fly the victor sends The dead men s weapons at their living friends Thus on the banks of Hebrus freezing flood The God of Battles in his angry mood Clashing his sword against his brazen shield Let loose the reins and scours along the field Before the wind his fiery coursers fly Groans the sad earth resounds the rattling sky Wrath Terror Treason Tumult and Despair Dire faces and deform d surround the car Friends of the god and followers of the war With fury not unlike nor less disdain Exulting Turnus flies along the plain His smoking horses at their utmost speed He lashes on and urges o er the dead Their fetlocks run with blood and when they bound The gore and gath ring dust are dash d around Thamyris and Pholus masters of the war He kill d at hand but Sthenelus afar From far the sons of Imbracus he slew Glaucus and Lades of the Lycian crew Both taught to fight on foot in battle join d Or mount the courser that outstrips the wind Meantime Eumedes vaunting in the field New fir d the Trojans and their foes repell d This son of Dolon bore his grandsire s name But emulated more his father s fame His guileful father sent a nightly spy The Grecian camp and order to descry Hard enterprise and well he might require Achilles car and horses for his hire But met upon the scout th Aetolian prince In death bestow d a juster recompense Fierce Turnus view d the Trojan from afar And launch d his jav lin from his lofty car Then lightly leaping down pursued the blow And pressing with his foot his prostrate foe Wrench d from his feeble hold the shining sword And plung d it in the bosom of its lord Possess said he the fruit of all thy pains And measure at thy length our Latian plains Thus are my foes rewarded by my hand Thus may they build their town and thus enjoy the land Then Dares Butes Sybaris he slew Whom o er his neck his flound ring courser threw As when loud Boreas with his blust ring train Stoops from above incumbent on the main Where er he flies he drives the rack before And rolls the billows on th Aegaean shore So where resistless Turnus takes his course The scatter d squadrons bend before his force His crest of horses hair is blown behind By adverse air and rustles in the wind This haughty Phegeus saw with high disdain And as the chariot roll d along the plain Light from the ground he leapt and seiz d the rein Thus hung in air he still retain d his hold The coursers frighted and their course controll d The lance of Turnus reach d him as he hung And pierc d his plated arms but pass d along And only raz d the skin He turn d and held Against his threat ning foe his ample shield Then call d for aid but while he cried in vain The chariot bore him backward on the plain He lies revers d the victor king descends And strikes so justly where his helmet ends He lops the head The Latian fields are drunk With streams that issue from the bleeding trunk While he triumphs and while the Trojans yield The wounded prince is forc d to leave the field Strong Mnestheus and Achates often tried And young Ascanius weeping by his side Conduct him to his tent Scarce can he rear His limbs from earth supported on his spear Resolv d in mind regardless of the smart He tugs with both his hands and breaks the dart The steel remains No readier way he found To draw the weapon than t inlarge the wound Eager of fight impatient of delay He begs and his unwilling friends obey Iapis was at hand to prove his art Whose blooming youth so fir d Apollo s heart That for his love he proffer d to bestow His tuneful harp and his unerring bow The pious youth more studious how to save His aged sire now sinking to the grave Preferr d the pow r of plants and silent praise Of healing arts before Phoebean bays Propp d on his lance the pensive hero stood And heard and saw unmov d the mourning crowd The fam d physician tucks his robes around With ready hands and hastens to the wound With gentle touches he performs his part This way and that soliciting the dart And exercises all his heav nly art All soft ning simples known of sov reign use He presses out and pours their noble juice These first infus d to lenify the pain He tugs with pincers but he tugs in vain Then to the patron of his art he pray d The patron of his art refus d his aid Meantime the war approaches to the tents Th alarm grows hotter and the noise augments The driving dust proclaims the danger near And first their friends and then their foes appear Their friends retreat their foes pursue the rear The camp is fill d with terror and affright The hissing shafts within the trench alight An undistinguish d noise ascends the sky The shouts of those who kill and groans of those who die But now the goddess mother mov d with grief And pierc d with pity hastens her relief A branch of healing dittany she brought Which in the Cretan fields with care she sought Rough is the stern which woolly leafs surround The leafs with flow rs the flow rs with purple crown d Well known to wounded goats a sure relief To draw the pointed steel and ease the grief This Venus brings in clouds involv d and brews Th extracted liquor with ambrosian dews And odorous panacee Unseen she stands Temp ring the mixture with her heav nly hands And pours it in a bowl already crown d With juice of med c nal herbs prepar d to bathe the wound The leech unknowing of superior art Which aids the cure with this foments the part And in a moment ceas d the raging smart Stanch d is the blood and in the bottom stands The steel but scarcely touch d with tender hands Moves up and follows of its own accord And health and vigor are at once restor d Iapis first perceiv d the closing wound And first the footsteps of a god he found Arms arms he cries the sword and shield prepare And send the willing chief renew d to war This is no mortal work no cure of mine Nor art s effect but done by hands divine Some god our general to the battle sends Some god preserves his life for greater ends The hero arms in haste his hands infold His thighs with cuishes of refulgent gold Inflam d to fight and rushing to the field That hand sustaining the celestial shield This gripes the lance and with such vigor shakes That to the rest the beamy weapon quakes Then with a close embrace he strain d his son And kissing thro his helmet thus begun My son from my example learn the war In camps to suffer and in fields to dare But happier chance than mine attend thy care This day my hand thy tender age shall shield And crown with honors of the conquer d field Thou when thy riper years shall send thee forth To toils of war be mindful of my worth Assert thy birthright and in arms be known For Hector s nephew and Aeneas son He said and striding issued on the plain Anteus and Mnestheus and a num rous train Attend his steps the rest their weapons take And crowding to the field the camp forsake A cloud of blinding dust is rais d around Labors beneath their feet the trembling ground Now Turnus posted on a hill from far Beheld the progress of the moving war With him the Latins view d the cover d plains And the chill blood ran backward in their veins Juturna saw th advancing troops appear And heard the hostile sound and fled for fear Aeneas leads and draws a sweeping train Clos d in their ranks and pouring on the plain As when a whirlwind rushing to the shore From the mid ocean drives the waves before The painful hind with heavy heart foresees The flatted fields and slaughter of the trees With like impetuous rage the prince appears Before his doubled front nor less destruction bears And now both armies shock in open field Osiris is by strong Thymbraeus kill d Archetius Ufens Epulon are slain All fam d in arms and of the Latian train By Gyas Mnestheus and Achates hand The fatal augur falls by whose command The truce was broken and whose lance embrued With Trojan blood th unhappy fight renew d Loud shouts and clamors rend the liquid sky And o er the field the frighted Latins fly The prince disdains the dastards to pursue Nor moves to meet in arms the fighting few Turnus alone amid the dusky plain He seeks and to the combat calls in vain Juturna heard and seiz d with mortal fear Forc d from the beam her brother s charioteer Assumes his shape his armor and his mien And like Metiscus in his seat is seen As the black swallow near the palace plies O er empty courts and under arches flies Now hawks aloft now skims along the flood To furnish her loquacious nest with food So drives the rapid goddess o er the plains The smoking horses run with loosen d reins She steers a various course among the foes Now here now there her conqu ring brother shows Now with a straight now with a wheeling flight She turns and bends but shuns the single fight Aeneas fir d with fury breaks the crowd And seeks his foe and calls by name aloud He runs within a narrower ring and tries To stop the chariot but the chariot flies If he but gain a glimpse Juturna fears And far away the Daunian hero bears What should he do Nor arts nor arms avail And various cares in vain his mind assail The great Messapus thund ring thro the field In his left hand two pointed jav lins held Encount ring on the prince one dart he drew And with unerring aim and utmost vigor threw Aeneas saw it come and stooping low Beneath his buckler shunn d the threat ning blow The weapon hiss d above his head and tore The waving plume which on his helm he wore Forced by this hostile act and fir d with spite That flying Turnus still declin d the fight The Prince whose piety had long repell d His inborn ardor now invades the field Invokes the pow rs of violated peace Their rites and injur d altars to redress Then to his rage abandoning the rein With blood and slaughter d bodies fills the plain What god can tell what numbers can display The various labors of that fatal day What chiefs and champions fell on either side In combat slain or by what deaths they died Whom Turnus whom the Trojan hero kill d Who shar d the fame and fortune of the field Jove could saint thou view and not avert thy sight Two jarring nations join d in cruel fight Whom leagues of lasting love so shortly shall unite Aeneas first Rutulian Sucro found Whose valor made the Trojans quit their ground Betwixt his ribs the jav lin drove so just It reach d his heart nor needs a second thrust Now Turnus at two blows two brethren slew First from his horse fierce Amycus he threw Then leaping on the ground on foot assail d Diores and in equal fight prevail d Their lifeless trunks he leaves upon the place Their heads distilling gore his chariot grace Three cold on earth the Trojan hero threw Whom without respite at one charge he slew Cethegus Tanais Tagus fell oppress d And sad Onythes added to the rest Of Theban blood whom Peridia bore Turnus two brothers from the Lycian shore And from Apollo s fane to battle sent O erthrew nor Phoebus could their fate prevent Peaceful Menoetes after these he kill d Who long had shunn d the dangers of the field On Lerna s lake a silent life he led And with his nets and angle earn d his bread Nor pompous cares nor palaces he knew But wisely from th infectious world withdrew Poor was his house his father s painful hand Discharg d his rent and plow d another s land As flames among the lofty woods are thrown On diff rent sides and both by winds are blown The laurels crackle in the sputt ring fire The frighted sylvans from their shades retire Or as two neighb ring torrents fall from high Rapid they run the foamy waters fry They roll to sea with unresisted force And down the rocks precipitate their course Not with less rage the rival heroes take Their diff rent ways nor less destruction make With spears afar with swords at hand they strike And zeal of slaughter fires their souls alike Like them their dauntless men maintain the field And hearts are pierc d unknowing how to yield They blow for blow return and wound for wound And heaps of bodies raise the level ground Murranus boasting of his blood that springs From a long royal race of Latian kings Is by the Trojan from his chariot thrown Crush d with the weight of an unwieldy stone Betwixt the wheels he fell the wheels that bore His living load his dying body tore His starting steeds to shun the glitt ring sword Paw down his trampled limbs forgetful of their lord Fierce Hyllus threaten d high and face to face Affronted Turnus in the middle space The prince encounter d him in full career And at his temples aim d the deadly spear So fatally the flying weapon sped That thro his helm it pierc d his head Nor Cisseus couldst thou scape from Turnus hand In vain the strongest of th Arcadian band Nor to Cupentus could his gods afford Availing aid against th Aenean sword Which to his naked heart pursued the course Nor could his plated shield sustain the force Iolas fell whom not the Grecian pow rs Nor great subverter of the Trojan tow rs Were doom d to kill while Heav n prolong d his date But who can pass the bounds prefix d by fate In high Lyrnessus and in Troy he held Two palaces and was from each expell d Of all the mighty man the last remains A little spot of foreign earth contains And now both hosts their broken troops unite In equal ranks and mix in mortal fight Seresthus and undaunted Mnestheus join The Trojan Tuscan and Arcadian line Sea born Messapus with Atinas heads The Latin squadrons and to battle leads They strike they push they throng the scanty space Resolv d on death impatient of disgrace And where one falls another fills his place The Cyprian goddess now inspires her son To leave th unfinish d fight and storm the town For while he rolls his eyes around the plain In quest of Turnus whom he seeks in vain He views th unguarded city from afar In careless quiet and secure of war Occasion offers and excites his mind To dare beyond the task he first design d Resolv d he calls his chiefs they leave the fight Attended thus he takes a neighb ring height The crowding troops about their general ral stand All under arms and wait his high command Then thus the lofty prince Hear and obey Ye Trojan bands without the least delay Jove is with us and what I have decreed Requires our utmost vigor and our speed Your instant arms against the town prepare The source of mischief and the seat of war This day the Latian tow rs that mate the sky Shall level with the plain in ashes lie The people shall be slaves unless in time They kneel for pardon and repent their crime Twice have our foes been vanquish d on the plain Then shall I wait till Turnus will be slain Your force against the perjur d city bend There it began and there the war shall end The peace profan d our rightful arms requires Cleanse the polluted place with purging fires He finish d and one soul inspiring all Form d in a wedge the foot approach the wall Without the town an unprovided train Of gaping gazing citizens are slain Some firebrands others scaling ladders bear And those they toss aloft and these they rear The flames now launch d the feather d arrows fly And clouds of missive arms obscure the sky Advancing to the front the hero stands And stretching out to heav n his pious hands Attests the gods asserts his innocence Upbraids with breach of faith th Ausonian prince Declares the royal honor doubly stain d And twice the rites of holy peace profan d Dissenting clamors in the town arise Each will be heard and all at once advise One part for peace and one for war contends Some would exclude their foes and some admit their friends The helpless king is hurried in the throng And whate er tide prevails is borne along Thus when the swain within a hollow rock Invades the bees with suffocating smoke They run around or labor on their wings Disus d to flight and shoot their sleepy stings To shun the bitter fumes in vain they try Black vapors issuing from the vent involve the sky But fate and envious fortune now prepare To plunge the Latins in the last despair The queen who saw the foes invade the town And brands on tops of burning houses thrown Cast round her eyes distracted with her fear No troops of Turnus in the field appear Once more she stares abroad but still in vain And then concludes the royal youth is slain Mad with her anguish impotent to bear The mighty grief she loathes the vital air She calls herself the cause of all this ill And owns the dire effects of her ungovern d will She raves against the gods she beats her breast She tears with both her hands her purple vest Then round a beam a running noose she tied And fasten d by the neck obscenely died Soon as the fatal news by Fame was blown And to her dames and to her daughter known The sad Lavinia rends her yellow hair And rosy cheeks the rest her sorrow share With shrieks the palace rings and madness of despair The spreading rumor fills the public place Confusion fear distraction and disgrace And silent shame are seen in ev ry face Latinus tears his garments as he goes Both for his public and his private woes With filth his venerable beard besmears And sordid dust deforms his silver hairs And much he blames the softness of his mind Obnoxious to the charms of womankind And soon seduc d to change what he so well design d To break the solemn league so long desir d Nor finish what his fates and those of Troy requir d Now Turnus rolls aloof o er empty plains And here and there some straggling foes he gleans His flying coursers please him less and less Asham d of easy fight and cheap success Thus half contented anxious in his mind The distant cries come driving in the wind Shouts from the walls but shouts in murmurs drown d A jarring mixture and a boding sound Alas said he what mean these dismal cries What doleful clamors from the town arise Confus d he stops and backward pulls the reins She who the driver s office now sustains Replies Neglect my lord these new alarms Here fight and urge the fortune of your arms There want not others to defend the wall If by your rival s hand th Italians fall So shall your fatal sword his friends oppress In honor equal equal in success To this the prince O sister for I knew The peace infring d proceeded first from you I knew you when you mingled first in fight And now in vain you would deceive my sight Why goddess this unprofitable care Who sent you down from heav n involv d in air Your share of mortal sorrows to sustain And see your brother bleeding on the plain For to what pow r can Turnus have recourse Or how resist his fate s prevailing force These eyes beheld Murranus bite the ground Mighty the man and mighty was the wound I heard my dearest friend with dying breath My name invoking to revenge his death Brave Ufens fell with honor on the place To shun the shameful sight of my disgrace On earth supine a manly corpse he lies His vest and armor are the victor s prize Then shall I see Laurentum in a flame Which only wanted to complete my shame How will the Latins hoot their champion s flight How Drances will insult and point them to the sight Is death so hard to bear Ye gods below Since those above so small compassion show Receive a soul unsullied yet with shame Which not belies my great forefather s name He said and while he spoke with flying speed Came Sages urging on his foamy steed Fix d on his wounded face a shaft he bore And seeking Turnus sent his voice before Turnus on you on you alone depends Our last relief compassionate your friends Like lightning fierce Aeneas rolling on With arms invests with flames invades the town The brands are toss d on high the winds conspire To drive along the deluge of the fire All eyes are fix d on you your foes rejoice Ev n the king staggers and suspends his choice Doubts to deliver or defend the town Whom to reject or whom to call his son The queen on whom your utmost hopes were plac d Herself suborning death has breath d her last T is true Messapus fearless of his fate With fierce Atinas aid defends the gate On ev ry side surrounded by the foe The more they kill the greater numbers grow An iron harvest mounts and still remains to mow You far aloof from your forsaken bands Your rolling chariot drive o er empty sands Stupid he sate his eyes on earth declin d And various cares revolving in his mind Rage boiling from the bottom of his breast And sorrow mix d with shame his soul oppress d And conscious worth lay lab ring in his thought And love by jealousy to madness wrought By slow degrees his reason drove away The mists of passion and resum d her sway Then rising on his car he turn d his look And saw the town involv d in fire and smoke A wooden tow r with flames already blaz d Which his own hands on beams and rafters rais d And bridges laid above to join the space And wheels below to roll from place to place Sister the Fates have vanquish d let us go The way which Heav n and my hard fortune show The fight is fix d nor shall the branded name Of a base coward blot your brother s fame Death is my choice but suffer me to try My force and vent my rage before I die He said and leaping down without delay Thro crowds of scatter d foes he freed his way Striding he pass d impetuous as the wind And left the grieving goddess far behind As when a fragment from a mountain torn By raging tempests or by torrents borne Or sapp d by time or loosen d from the roots Prone thro the void the rocky ruin shoots Rolling from crag to crag from steep to steep Down sink at once the shepherds and their sheep Involv d alike they rush to nether ground Stunn d with the shock they fall and stunn d from earth rebound So Turnus hasting headlong to the town Should ring and shoving bore the squadrons down Still pressing onward to the walls he drew Where shafts and spears and darts promiscuous flew And sanguine streams the slipp ry ground embrue First stretching out his arm in sign of peace He cries aloud to make the combat cease Rutulians hold and Latin troops retire The fight is mine and me the gods require T is just that I should vindicate alone The broken truce or for the breach atone This day shall free from wars th Ausonian state Or finish my misfortunes in my fate Both armies from their bloody work desist And bearing backward form a spacious list The Trojan hero who receiv d from fame The welcome sound and heard the champion s name Soon leaves the taken works and mounted walls Greedy of war where greater glory calls He springs to fight exulting in his force His jointed armor rattles in the course Like Eryx or like Athos great he shows Or Father Apennine when white with snows His head divine obscure in clouds he hides And shakes the sounding forest on his sides The nations overaw d surcease the fight Immovable their bodies fix d their sight Ev n death stands still nor from above they throw Their darts nor drive their batt ring rams below In silent order either army stands And drop their swords unknowing from their hands Th Ausonian king beholds with wond ring sight Two mighty champions match d in single fight Born under climes remote and brought by fate With swords to try their titles to the state Now in clos d field each other from afar They view and rushing on begin the war They launch their spears then hand to hand they meet The trembling soil resounds beneath their feet Their bucklers clash thick blows descend from high And flakes of fire from their hard helmets fly Courage conspires with chance and both ingage With equal fortune yet and mutual rage As when two bulls for their fair female fight In Sila s shades or on Taburnus height With horns adverse they meet the keeper flies Mute stands the herd the heifers roll their eyes And wait th event which victor they shall bear And who shall be the lord to rule the lusty year With rage of love the jealous rivals burn And push for push and wound for wound return Their dewlaps gor d their sides are lav d in blood Loud cries and roaring sounds rebellow thro the wood Such was the combat in the listed ground So clash their swords and so their shields resound Jove sets the beam in either scale he lays The champions fate and each exactly weighs On this side life and lucky chance ascends Loaded with death that other scale descends Rais d on the stretch young Turnus aims a blow Full on the helm of his unguarded foe Shrill shouts and clamors ring on either side As hopes and fears their panting hearts divide But all in pieces flies the traitor sword And in the middle stroke deserts his lord Now is but death or flight disarm d he flies When in his hand an unknown hilt he spies Fame says that Turnus when his steeds he join d Hurrying to war disorder d in his mind Snatch d the first weapon which his haste could find T was not the fated sword his father bore But that his charioteer Metiscus wore This while the Trojans fled the toughness held But vain against the great Vulcanian shield The mortal temper d steel deceiv d his hand The shiver d fragments shone amid the sand Surpris d with fear he fled along the field And now forthright and now in orbits wheel d For here the Trojan troops the list surround And there the pass is clos d with pools and marshy ground Aeneas hastens tho with heavier pace His wound so newly knit retards the chase And oft his trembling knees their aid refuse Yet pressing foot by foot his foe pursues Thus when a fearful stag is clos d around With crimson toils or in a river found High on the bank the deep mouth d hound appears Still opening following still where er he steers The persecuted creature to and fro Turns here and there to scape his Umbrian foe Steep is th ascent and if he gains the land The purple death is pitch d along the strand His eager foe determin d to the chase Stretch d at his length gains ground at ev ry pace Now to his beamy head he makes his way And now he holds or thinks he holds his prey Just at the pinch the stag springs out with fear He bites the wind and fills his sounding jaws with air The rocks the lakes the meadows ring with cries The mortal tumult mounts and thunders in the skies Thus flies the Daunian prince and flying blames His tardy troops and calling by their names Demands his trusty sword The Trojan threats The realm with ruin and their ancient seats To lay in ashes if they dare supply With arms or aid his vanquish d enemy Thus menacing he still pursues the course With vigor tho diminish d of his force Ten times already round the listed place One chief had fled and t other giv n the chase No trivial prize is play d for on the life Or death of Turnus now depends the strife Within the space an olive tree had stood A sacred shade a venerable wood For vows to Faunus paid the Latins guardian god Here hung the vests and tablets were ingrav d Of sinking mariners from shipwrack sav d With heedless hands the Trojans fell d the tree To make the ground inclos d for combat free Deep in the root whether by fate or chance Or erring haste the Trojan drove his lance Then stoop d and tugg d with force immense to free Th incumber d spear from the tenacious tree That whom his fainting limbs pursued in vain His flying weapon might from far attain Confus d with fear bereft of human aid Then Turnus to the gods and first to Faunus pray d O Faunus pity and thou Mother Earth Where I thy foster son receiv d my birth Hold fast the steel If my religious hand Your plant has honor d which your foes profan d Propitious hear my pious pray r He said Nor with successless vows invok d their aid Th incumbent hero wrench d and pull d and strain d But still the stubborn earth the steel detain d Juturna took her time and while in vain He strove assum d Meticus form again And in that imitated shape restor d To the despairing prince his Daunian sword The Queen of Love who with disdain and grief Saw the bold nymph afford this prompt relief T assert her offspring with a greater deed From the tough root the ling ring weapon freed Once more erect the rival chiefs advance One trusts the sword and one the pointed lance And both resolv d alike to try their fatal chance Meantime imperial Jove to Juno spoke Who from a shining cloud beheld the shock What new arrest O Queen of Heav n is sent To stop the Fates now lab ring in th event What farther hopes are left thee to pursue Divine Aeneas and thou know saint it too Foredoom d to these celestial seats are due What more attempts for Turnus can be made That thus thou ling rest in this lonely shade Is it becoming of the due respect And awful honor of a god elect A wound unworthy of our state to feel Patient of human hands and earthly steel Or seems it just the sister should restore A second sword when one was lost before And arm a conquer d wretch against his conqueror For what without thy knowledge and avow Nay more thy dictate durst Juturna do At last in deference to my love forbear To lodge within thy soul this anxious care Reclin d upon my breast thy grief unload Who should relieve the goddess but the god Now all things to their utmost issue tend Push d by the Fates to their appointed While leave was giv n thee and a lawful hour For vengeance wrath and unresisted pow r Toss d on the seas thou couldst thy foes distress And driv n ashore with hostile arms oppress Deform the royal house and from the side Of the just bridegroom tear the plighted bride Now cease at my command The Thund rer said And with dejected eyes this answer Juno made Because your dread decree too well I knew From Turnus and from earth unwilling I withdrew Else should you not behold me here alone Involv d in empty clouds my friends bemoan But girt with vengeful flames in open sight Engag d against my foes in mortal fight T is true Juturna mingled in the strife By my command to save her brother s life At least to try but by the Stygian lake The most religious oath the gods can take With this restriction not to bend the bow Or toss the spear or trembling dart to throw And now resign d to your superior might And tir d with fruitless toils I loathe the fight This let me beg and this no fates withstand Both for myself and for your father s land That when the nuptial bed shall bind the peace Which I since you ordain consent to bless The laws of either nation be the same But let the Latins still retain their name Speak the same language which they spoke before Wear the same habits which their grandsires wore Call them not Trojans perish the renown And name of Troy with that detested town Latium be Latium still let Alba reign And Rome s immortal majesty remain Then thus the founder of mankind replies Unruffled was his front serene his eyes Can Saturn s issue and heav n s other heir Such endless anger in her bosom bear Be mistress and your full desires obtain But quench the choler you foment in vain From ancient blood th Ausonian people sprung Shall keep their name their habit and their tongue The Trojans to their customs shall be tied I will myself their common rites provide The natives shall command the foreigners subside All shall be Latium Troy without a name And her lost sons forget from whence they came From blood so mix d a pious race shall flow Equal to gods excelling all below No nation more respect to you shall pay Or greater off rings on your altars lay Juno consents well pleas d that her desires Had found success and from the cloud retires The peace thus made the Thund rer next prepares To force the wat ry goddess from the wars Deep in the dismal regions void of light Three daughters at a birth were born to Night These their brown mother brooding on her care Indued with windy wings to flit in air With serpents girt alike and crown d with hissing hair In heav n the Dirae call d and still at hand Before the throne of angry Jove they stand His ministers of wrath and ready still The minds of mortal men with fears to fill Whene er the moody sire to wreak his hate On realms or towns deserving of their fate Hurls down diseases death and deadly care And terrifies the guilty world with war One sister plague if these from heav n he sent To fright Juturna with a dire portent The pest comes whirling down by far more slow Springs the swift arrow from the Parthian bow Or Cydon yew when traversing the skies And drench d in pois nous juice the sure destruction flies With such a sudden and unseen a flight Shot thro the clouds the daughter of the night Soon as the field inclos d she had in view And from afar her destin d quarry knew Contracted to the boding bird she turns Which haunts the ruin d piles and hallow d urns And beats about the tombs with nightly wings Where songs obscene on sepulchers she sings Thus lessen d in her form with frightful cries The Fury round unhappy Turnus flies Flaps on his shield and flutters o er his eyes A lazy chillness crept along his blood Chok d was his voice his hair with horror stood Juturna from afar beheld her fly And knew th ill omen by her screaming cry And stridor of her wings Amaz d with fear Her beauteous breast she beat and rent her flowing hair Ah me she cries in this unequal strife What can thy sister more to save thy life Weak as I am can I alas contend In arms with that inexorable fiend Now now I quit the field forbear to fright My tender soul ye baleful birds of night The lashing of your wings I know too well The sounding flight and fun ral screams of hell These are the gifts you bring from haughty Jove The worthy recompense of ravish d love Did he for this exempt my life from fate O hard conditions of immortal state Tho born to death not privileg d to die But forc d to bear impos d eternity Take back your envious bribes and let me go Companion to my brother s ghost below The joys are vanish d nothing now remains Of life immortal but immortal pains What earth will open her devouring womb To rest a weary goddess in the tomb She drew a length of sighs nor more she said But in her azure mantle wrapp d her head Then plung d into her stream with deep despair And her last sobs came bubbling up in air Now stern Aeneas his weighty spear Against his foe and thus upbraids his fear What farther subterfuge can Turnus find What empty hopes are harbor d in his mind T is not thy swiftness can secure thy flight Not with their feet but hands the valiant fight Vary thy shape in thousand forms and dare What skill and courage can attempt in war Wish for the wings of winds to mount the sky Or hid within the hollow earth to lie The champion shook his head and made this short reply No threats of thine my manly mind can move T is hostile heav n I dread and partial Jove He said no more but with a sigh repress d The mighty sorrow in his swelling breast Then as he roll d his troubled eyes around An antique stone he saw the common bound Of neighb ring fields and barrier of the ground So vast that twelve strong men of modern days Th enormous weight from earth could hardly raise He heav d it at a lift and pois d on high Ran stagg ring on against his enemy But so disorder d that he scarcely knew His way or what unwieldly weight he threw His knocking knees are bent beneath the load And shiv ring cold congeals his vital blood The stone drops from his arms and falling short For want of vigor mocks his vain effort And as when heavy sleep has clos d the sight The sickly fancy labors in the night We seem to run and destitute of force Our sinking limbs forsake us in the course In vain we heave for breath in vain we cry The nerves unbrac d their usual strength deny And on the tongue the falt ring accents die So Turnus far d whatever means he tried All force of arms and points of art employ d The Fury flew athwart and made th endeavor void A thousand various thoughts his soul confound He star d about nor aid nor issue found His own men stop the pass and his own walls surround Once more he pauses and looks out again And seeks the goddess charioteer in vain Trembling he views the thund ring chief advance And brandishing aloft the deadly lance Amaz d he cow rs beneath his conqu ring foe Forgets to ward and waits the coming blow Astonish d while he stands and fix d with fear Aim d at his shield he sees th impending spear The hero measur d first with narrow view The destin d mark and rising as he threw With its full swing the fatal weapon flew Not with less rage the rattling thunder falls Or stones from batt ring engines break the walls Swift as a whirlwind from an arm so strong The lance drove on and bore the death along Naught could his sev nfold shield the prince avail Nor aught beneath his arms the coat of mail It pierc d thro all and with a grisly wound Transfix d his thigh and doubled him to ground With groans the Latins rend the vaulted sky Woods hills and valleys to the voice reply Now low on earth the lofty chief is laid With eyes cast upward and with arms display d And recreant thus to the proud victor pray d I know my death deserv d nor hope to live Use what the gods and thy good fortune give Yet think O think if mercy may be shown Thou hadst a father once and hast a son Pity my sire now sinking to the grave And for Anchises sake old Daunus save Or if thy vow d revenge pursue my death Give to my friends my body void of breath The Latian chiefs have seen me beg my life Thine is the conquest thine the royal wife Against a yielded man t is mean ignoble strife In deep suspense the Trojan seem d to stand And just prepar d to strike repress d his hand He roll d his eyes and ev ry moment felt His manly soul with more compassion melt When casting down a casual glance he spied The golden belt that glitter d on his side The fatal spoils which haughty Turnus tore From dying Pallas and in triumph wore Then rous d anew to wrath he loudly cries Flames while he spoke came flashing from his eyes Traitor dost thou dost thou to grace pretend Clad as thou art in trophies of my friend To his sad soul a grateful off ring go T is Pallas Pallas gives this deadly blow He rais d his arm aloft and at the word Deep in his bosom drove the shining sword The streaming blood distain d his arms around And the disdainful soul came rushing thro the wound End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Aeneid by
