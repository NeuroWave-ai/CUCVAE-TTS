STUDY IN TWO PARTS The text is that of the first American appearance in book form eighteen seventy nine PART I At the little town of Vevey in Switzerland there is a particularly comfortable hotel There are indeed many hotels for the entertainment of tourists is the business of the place which as many travelers will remember is seated upon the edge of a remarkably blue lake a lake that it behooves every tourist to visit The shore of the lake presents an unbroken array of establishments of this order of every category from the grand hotel of the newest fashion with a chalk white front a hundred balconies and a dozen flags flying from its roof to the little Swiss pension of an elder day with its name inscribed in German looking lettering upon a pink or yellow wall and an awkward summerhouse in the angle of the garden One of the hotels at Vevey however is famous even classical being distinguished from many of its upstart neighbors by an air both of luxury and of maturity In this region in the month of June American travelers are extremely numerous it may be said indeed that Vevey assumes at this period some of the characteristics of an American watering place There are sights and sounds which evoke a vision an echo of Newport and Saratoga There is a flitting hither and thither of stylish young girls a rustling of muslin flounces a rattle of dance music in the morning hours a sound of high pitched voices at all times You receive an impression of these things at the excellent inn of the Trois Couronnes and are transported in fancy to the Ocean House or to Congress Hall But at the Trois Couronnes it must be added there are other features that are much at variance with these suggestions neat German waiters who look like secretaries of legation Russian princesses sitting in the garden little Polish boys walking about held by the hand with their governors a view of the sunny crest of the Dent du Midi and the picturesque towers of the Castle of Chillon I hardly know whether it was the analogies or the differences that were uppermost in the mind of a young American who two or three years ago sat in the garden of the Trois Couronnes looking about him rather idly at some of the graceful objects I have mentioned It was a beautiful summer morning and in whatever fashion the young American looked at things they must have seemed to him charming He had come from Geneva the day before by the little steamer to see his aunt who was staying at the hotel Geneva having been for a long time his place of residence But his aunt had a headache his aunt had almost always a headache and now she was shut up in her room smelling camphor so that he was at liberty to wander about He was some seven and twenty years of age when his friends spoke of him they usually said that he was at Geneva studying When his enemies spoke of him they said but after all he had no enemies he was an extremely amiable fellow and universally liked What I should say is simply that when certain persons spoke of him they affirmed that the reason of his spending so much time at Geneva was that he was extremely devoted to a lady who lived there a foreign lady a person older than himself Very few Americans indeed I think none had ever seen this lady about whom there were some singular stories But Winterbourne had an old attachment for the little metropolis of Calvinism he had been put to school there as a boy and he had afterward gone to college there circumstances which had led to his forming a great many youthful friendships Many of these he had kept and they were a source of great satisfaction to him After knocking at his aunt s door and learning that she was indisposed he had taken a walk about the town and then he had come in to his breakfast He had now finished his breakfast but he was drinking a small cup of coffee which had been served to him on a little table in the garden by one of the waiters who looked like an attache At last he finished his coffee and lit a cigarette Presently a small boy came walking along the path an urchin of nine or ten The child who was diminutive for his years had an aged expression of countenance a pale complexion and sharp little features He was dressed in knickerbockers with red stockings which displayed his poor little spindle shanks he also wore a brilliant red cravat He carried in his hand a long alpenstock the sharp point of which he thrust into everything that he approached the flowerbeds the garden benches the trains of the ladies dresses In front of Winterbourne he paused looking at him with a pair of bright penetrating little eyes Will you give me a lump of sugar he asked in a sharp hard little voice a voice immature and yet somehow not young Winterbourne glanced at the small table near him on which his coffee service rested and saw that several morsels of sugar remained Yes you may take one he answered but I don t think sugar is good for little boys This little boy stepped forward and carefully selected three of the coveted fragments two of which he buried in the pocket of his knickerbockers depositing the other as promptly in another place He poked his alpenstock lance fashion into Winterbourne s bench and tried to crack the lump of sugar with his teeth Oh blazes it s har r d he exclaimed pronouncing the adjective in a peculiar manner Winterbourne had immediately perceived that he might have the honor of claiming him as a fellow countryman Take care you don t hurt your teeth he said paternally I haven t got any teeth to hurt They have all come out I have only got seven teeth My mother counted them last night and one came out right afterward She said she d slap me if any more came out I can t help it It s this old Europe It s the climate that makes them come out In America they didn t come out It s these hotels Winterbourne was much amused If you eat three lumps of sugar your mother will certainly slap you he said She s got to give me some candy then rejoined his young interlocutor I can t get any candy here any American candy American candy s the best candy And are American little boys the best little boys asked Winterbourne I don t know I m an American boy said the child I see you are one of the best laughed Winterbourne Are you an American man pursued this vivacious infant And then on Winterbourne s affirmative reply American men are the best he declared His companion thanked him for the compliment and the child who had now got astride of his alpenstock stood looking about him while he attacked a second lump of sugar Winterbourne wondered if he himself had been like this in his infancy for he had been brought to Europe at about this age Here comes my sister cried the child in a moment She s an American girl Winterbourne looked along the path and saw a beautiful young lady advancing American girls are the best girls he said cheerfully to his young companion My sister ain t the best the child declared She s always blowing at me I imagine that is your fault not hers said Winterbourne The young lady meanwhile had drawn near She was dressed in white muslin with a hundred frills and flounces and knots of pale colored ribbon She was bareheaded but she balanced in her hand a large parasol with a deep border of embroidery and she was strikingly admirably pretty How pretty they are thought Winterbourne straightening himself in his seat as if he were prepared to rise The young lady paused in front of his bench near the parapet of the garden which overlooked the lake The little boy had now converted his alpenstock into a vaulting pole by the aid of which he was springing about in the gravel and kicking it up not a little Randolph said the young lady what ARE you doing I m going up the Alps replied Randolph This is the way And he gave another little jump scattering the pebbles about Winterbourne s ears That s the way they come down said Winterbourne He s an American man cried Randolph in his little hard voice The young lady gave no heed to this announcement but looked straight at her brother Well I guess you had better be quiet she simply observed It seemed to Winterbourne that he had been in a manner presented He got up and stepped slowly toward the young girl throwing away his cigarette This little boy and I have made acquaintance he said with great civility In Geneva as he had been perfectly aware a young man was not at liberty to speak to a young unmarried lady except under certain rarely occurring conditions but here at Vevey what conditions could be better than these a pretty American girl coming and standing in front of you in a garden This pretty American girl however on hearing Winterbourne s observation simply glanced at him she then turned her head and looked over the parapet at the lake and the opposite mountains He wondered whether he had gone too far but he decided that he must advance farther rather than retreat While he was thinking of something else to say the young lady turned to the little boy again I should like to know where you got that pole she said I bought it responded Randolph You don t mean to say you re going to take it to Italy Yes I am going to take it to Italy the child declared The young girl glanced over the front of her dress and smoothed out a knot or two of ribbon Then she rested her eyes upon the prospect again Well I guess you had better leave it somewhere she said after a moment Are you going to Italy Winterbourne inquired in a tone of great respect The young lady glanced at him again Yes sir she replied And she said nothing more Are you a going over the Simplon Winterbourne pursued a little embarrassed I don t know she said I suppose it s some mountain Randolph what mountain are we going over Going where the child demanded To Italy Winterbourne explained I don t know said Randolph I don t want to go to Italy I want to go to America Oh Italy is a beautiful place rejoined the young man Can you get candy there Randolph loudly inquired I hope not said his sister I guess you have had enough candy and mother thinks so too I haven t had any for ever so long for a hundred weeks cried the boy still jumping about The young lady inspected her flounces and smoothed her ribbons again and Winterbourne presently risked an observation upon the beauty of the view He was ceasing to be embarrassed for he had begun to perceive that she was not in the least embarrassed herself There had not been the slightest alteration in her charming complexion she was evidently neither offended nor flattered If she looked another way when he spoke to her and seemed not particularly to hear him this was simply her habit her manner Yet as he talked a little more and pointed out some of the objects of interest in the view with which she appeared quite unacquainted she gradually gave him more of the benefit of her glance and then he saw that this glance was perfectly direct and unshrinking It was not however what would have been called an immodest glance for the young girl s eyes were singularly honest and fresh They were wonderfully pretty eyes and indeed Winterbourne had not seen for a long time anything prettier than his fair countrywoman s various features her complexion her nose her ears her teeth He had a great relish for feminine beauty he was addicted to observing and analyzing it and as regards this young lady s face he made several observations It was not at all insipid but it was not exactly expressive and though it was eminently delicate Winterbourne mentally accused it very forgivingly of a want of finish He thought it very possible that Master Randolph s sister was a coquette he was sure she had a spirit of her own but in her bright sweet superficial little visage there was no mockery no irony Before long it became obvious that she was much disposed toward conversation She told him that they were going to Rome for the winter she and her mother and Randolph She asked him if he was a real American she shouldn t have taken him for one he seemed more like a German this was said after a little hesitation especially when he spoke Winterbourne laughing answered that he had met Germans who spoke like Americans but that he had not so far as he remembered met an American who spoke like a German Then he asked her if she should not be more comfortable in sitting upon the bench which he had just quitted She answered that she liked standing up and walking about but she presently sat down She told him she was from New York State if you know where that is Winterbourne learned more about her by catching hold of her small slippery brother and making him stand a few minutes by his side Tell me your name my boy he said Randolph C Miller said the boy sharply And I ll tell you her name and he leveled his alpenstock at his sister You had better wait till you are asked said this young lady calmly I should like very much to know your name said Winterbourne Her name is Daisy Miller cried the child But that isn t her real name that isn t her name on her cards It s a pity you haven t got one of my cards said Miss Miller Her real name is Annie P Miller the boy went on Ask him HIS name said his sister indicating Winterbourne But on this point Randolph seemed perfectly indifferent he continued to supply information with regard to his own family My father s name is Ezra B Miller he announced My father ain t in Europe my father s in a better place than Europe Winterbourne imagined for a moment that this was the manner in which the child had been taught to intimate that mister Miller had been removed to the sphere of celestial reward But Randolph immediately added My father s in Schenectady He s got a big business My father s rich you bet Well ejaculated Miss Miller lowering her parasol and looking at the embroidered border Winterbourne presently released the child who departed dragging his alpenstock along the path He doesn t like Europe said the young girl He wants to go back To Schenectady you mean Yes he wants to go right home He hasn t got any boys here There is one boy here but he always goes round with a teacher they won t let him play And your brother hasn t any teacher Winterbourne inquired Mother thought of getting him one to travel round with us There was a lady told her of a very good teacher an American lady perhaps you know her missus Sanders I think she came from Boston She told her of this teacher and we thought of getting him to travel round with us But Randolph said he didn t want a teacher traveling round with us He said he wouldn t have lessons when he was in the cars And we ARE in the cars about half the time There was an English lady we met in the cars I think her name was Miss Featherstone perhaps you know her She wanted to know why I didn t give Randolph lessons give him instruction she called it I guess he could give me more instruction than I could give him He s very smart Yes said Winterbourne he seems very smart Mother s going to get a teacher for him as soon as we get to Italy Can you get good teachers in Italy Very good I should think said Winterbourne Or else she s going to find some school He ought to learn some more He s only nine He s going to college And in this way Miss Miller continued to converse upon the affairs of her family and upon other topics She sat there with her extremely pretty hands ornamented with very brilliant rings folded in her lap and with her pretty eyes now resting upon those of Winterbourne now wandering over the garden the people who passed by and the beautiful view She talked to Winterbourne as if she had known him a long time He found it very pleasant It was many years since he had heard a young girl talk so much It might have been said of this unknown young lady who had come and sat down beside him upon a bench that she chattered She was very quiet she sat in a charming tranquil attitude but her lips and her eyes were constantly moving She had a soft slender agreeable voice and her tone was decidedly sociable She gave Winterbourne a history of her movements and intentions and those of her mother and brother in Europe and enumerated in particular the various hotels at which they had stopped That English lady in the cars she said Miss Featherstone asked me if we didn t all live in hotels in America I told her I had never been in so many hotels in my life as since I came to Europe I have never seen so many it s nothing but hotels But Miss Miller did not make this remark with a querulous accent she appeared to be in the best humor with everything She declared that the hotels were very good when once you got used to their ways and that Europe was perfectly sweet She was not disappointed not a bit Perhaps it was because she had heard so much about it before She had ever so many intimate friends that had been there ever so many times And then she had had ever so many dresses and things from Paris Whenever she put on a Paris dress she felt as if she were in Europe It was a kind of a wishing cap said Winterbourne Yes said Miss Miller without examining this analogy it always made me wish I was here But I needn t have done that for dresses I am sure they send all the pretty ones to America you see the most frightful things here The only thing I don t like she proceeded is the society There isn t any society or if there is I don t know where it keeps itself Do you I suppose there is some society somewhere but I haven t seen anything of it I m very fond of society and I have always had a great deal of it I don t mean only in Schenectady but in New York I used to go to New York every winter In New York I had lots of society Last winter I had seventeen dinners given me and three of them were by gentlemen added Daisy Miller I have more friends in New York than in Schenectady more gentleman friends and more young lady friends too she resumed in a moment She paused again for an instant she was looking at Winterbourne with all her prettiness in her lively eyes and in her light slightly monotonous smile I have always had she said a great deal of gentlemen s society 
1509_143477_000000_000000	train-clean-360	Poor Winterbourne was amused perplexed and decidedly charmed 
1509_143477_000000_000001	train-clean-360	He had never yet heard a young girl express herself in just this fashion never at least save in cases where to say such things seemed a kind of demonstrative evidence of a certain laxity of deportment 
1509_143477_000000_000002	train-clean-360	And yet was he to accuse Miss Daisy Miller of actual or potential inconduite as they said at Geneva 
1509_143477_000000_000003	train-clean-360	He felt that he had lived at Geneva so long that he had lost a good deal he had become dishabituated to the American tone Never indeed since he had grown old enough to appreciate things had he encountered a young American girl of so pronounced a type as this Certainly she was very charming but how deucedly sociable 
none	none	Was she simply a pretty girl from New York State Were they all like that the pretty girls who had a good deal of gentlemen s society Or was she also a designing an audacious an unscrupulous young person 
1509_143477_000000_000007	train-clean-360	Winterbourne had lost his instinct in this matter and his reason could not help him Miss Daisy Miller looked extremely innocent 
1509_143477_000000_000008	train-clean-360	Some people had told him that after all American girls were exceedingly innocent and others had told him that after all they were not 
1509_143477_000000_000009	train-clean-360	He was inclined to think Miss Daisy Miller was a flirt a pretty American flirt 
none	none	He had never as yet had any relations with young ladies of this category 
1509_143477_000000_000011	train-clean-360	He had known here in Europe two or three women persons older than Miss Daisy Miller and provided for respectability s sake with husbands who were great coquettes dangerous terrible women with whom one s relations were liable to take a serious turn 
1509_143477_000000_000012	train-clean-360	But this young girl was not a coquette in that sense she was very unsophisticated she was only a pretty American flirt 
none	none	Winterbourne was almost grateful for having found the formula that applied to Miss Daisy Miller 
1509_143477_000000_000014	train-clean-360	He leaned back in his seat he remarked to himself that she had the most charming nose he had ever seen he wondered what were the regular conditions and limitations of one s intercourse with a pretty American flirt 
1509_143477_000000_000015	train-clean-360	It presently became apparent that he was on the way to learn 
none	none	Have you been to that old castle asked the young girl pointing with her parasol to the far gleaming walls of the Chateau de Chillon
1509_143477_000002_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes formerly more than once said Winterbourne 
1509_143477_000002_000001	train-clean-360	 You too I suppose have seen it 
1509_143477_000003_000000	train-clean-360	 No we haven t been there 
1509_143477_000003_000001	train-clean-360	I want to go there dreadfully 
1509_143477_000003_000002	train-clean-360	Of course I mean to go there 
none	none	I wouldn t go away from here without having seen that old castle
1509_143477_000004_000000	train-clean-360	 It s a very pretty excursion said Winterbourne and very easy to make 
1509_143477_000004_000001	train-clean-360	You can drive you know or you can go by the little steamer 
1509_143477_000005_000000	train-clean-360	 You can go in the cars said Miss Miller 
1509_143477_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes you can go in the cars Winterbourne assented 
none	none	Our courier says they take you right up to the castle the young girl continued
1509_143477_000007_000001	train-clean-360	 We were going last week but my mother gave out 
1509_143477_000007_000002	train-clean-360	She suffers dreadfully from dyspepsia 
1509_143477_000007_000003	train-clean-360	She said she couldn t go 
1509_143477_000007_000004	train-clean-360	Randolph wouldn t go either he says he doesn t think much of old castles 
1509_143477_000007_000005	train-clean-360	But I guess we ll go this week if we can get Randolph 
none	none	Your brother is not interested in ancient monuments Winterbourne inquired smiling
1509_143477_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 He says he don t care much about old castles 
none	none	He s only nine 
1509_143477_000009_000002	train-clean-360	He wants to stay at the hotel 
none	none	Mother s afraid to leave him alone and the courier won t stay with him so we haven t been to many places But it will be too bad if we don t go up there And Miss Miller pointed again at the Chateau de Chillon I should think it might be arranged said Winterbourne
1509_143477_000010_000001	train-clean-360	 Couldn t you get some one to stay for the afternoon with Randolph 
1509_143477_000011_000000	train-clean-360	Miss Miller looked at him a moment and then very placidly I wish YOU would stay with him she said 
1509_143477_000012_000000	train-clean-360	Winterbourne hesitated a moment 
1509_143477_000012_000001	train-clean-360	 I should much rather go to Chillon with you 
none	none	With me asked the young girl with the same placidity 
1509_143477_000014_000000	train-clean-360	She didn t rise blushing as a young girl at Geneva would have done and yet Winterbourne conscious that he had been very bold thought it possible she was offended 
1509_143477_000014_000001	train-clean-360	 With your mother he answered very respectfully 
1509_143477_000015_000000	train-clean-360	But it seemed that both his audacity and his respect were lost upon Miss Daisy Miller 
1509_143477_000015_000001	train-clean-360	 I guess my mother won t go after all she said 
1509_143477_000015_000002	train-clean-360	 She don t like to ride round in the afternoon 
none	none	But did you really mean what you said just now that you would like to go up there Most earnestly Winterbourne declared
1509_143477_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 Then we may arrange it 
none	none	If mother will stay with Randolph I guess Eugenio will
1509_143477_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 Eugenio the young man inquired 
1509_143477_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 Eugenio s our courier 
none	none	He doesn t like to stay with Randolph he s the most fastidious man I ever saw 
1509_143477_000019_000002	train-clean-360	But he s a splendid courier 
1509_143477_000019_000003	train-clean-360	I guess he ll stay at home with Randolph if mother does and then we can go to the castle 
none	none	Winterbourne reflected for an instant as lucidly as possible we could only mean Miss Daisy Miller and himself This program seemed almost too agreeable for credence he felt as if he ought to kiss the young lady s hand 
1509_143477_000020_000002	train-clean-360	Possibly he would have done so and quite spoiled the project but at this moment another person presumably Eugenio appeared 
none	none	A tall handsome man with superb whiskers wearing a velvet morning coat and a brilliant watch chain approached Miss Miller looking sharply at her companion
1509_143477_000020_000004	train-clean-360	 Oh Eugenio said Miss Miller with the friendliest accent 
none	none	Eugenio had looked at Winterbourne from head to foot he now bowed gravely to the young lady I have the honor to inform mademoiselle that luncheon is upon the table Miss Miller slowly rose See here Eugenio she said I m going to that old castle anyway To the Chateau de Chillon mademoiselle the courier inquired Mademoiselle has made arrangements he added in a tone which struck Winterbourne as very impertinent 
1509_143477_000024_000000	train-clean-360	Eugenio s tone apparently threw even to Miss Miller s own apprehension a slightly ironical light upon the young girl s situation 
1509_143477_000024_000001	train-clean-360	She turned to Winterbourne blushing a little a very little 
none	none	You won t back out she said
1509_143477_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 I shall not be happy till we go he protested 
none	none	And you are staying in this hotel she went on And you are really an American The courier stood looking at Winterbourne offensively 
1509_143477_000027_000001	train-clean-360	The young man at least thought his manner of looking an offense to Miss Miller it conveyed an imputation that she picked up acquaintances 
none	none	I shall have the honor of presenting to you a person who will tell you all about me he said smiling and referring to his aunt Oh well we ll go some day said Miss Miller And she gave him a smile and turned away She put up her parasol and walked back to the inn beside Eugenio Winterbourne stood looking after her and as she moved away drawing her muslin furbelows over the gravel said to himself that she had the tournure of a princess He had however engaged to do more than proved feasible in promising to present his aunt missus Costello to Miss Daisy Miller As soon as the former lady had got better of her headache he waited upon her in her apartment and after the proper inquiries in regard to her health he asked her if she had observed in the hotel an American family a mamma a daughter and a little boy And a courier said missus Costello
1509_143477_000030_000001	train-clean-360	 Oh yes I have observed them 
1509_143477_000030_000002	train-clean-360	Seen them heard them and kept out of their way missus Costello was a widow with a fortune a person of much distinction who frequently intimated that if she were not so dreadfully liable to sick headaches she would probably have left a deeper impress upon her time 
none	none	She had a long pale face a high nose and a great deal of very striking white hair which she wore in large puffs and rouleaux over the top of her head She had two sons married in New York and another who was now in Europe This young man was amusing himself at Hamburg and though he was on his travels was rarely perceived to visit any particular city at the moment selected by his mother for her own appearance there 
1509_143477_000030_000006	train-clean-360	Her nephew who had come up to Vevey expressly to see her was therefore more attentive than those who as she said were nearer to her 
1509_143477_000030_000007	train-clean-360	He had imbibed at Geneva the idea that one must always be attentive to one s aunt 
none	none	missus Costello had not seen him for many years and she was greatly pleased with him manifesting her approbation by initiating him into many of the secrets of that social sway which as she gave him to understand she exerted in the American capital 
1509_143477_000030_000009	train-clean-360	She admitted that she was very exclusive but if he were acquainted with New York he would see that one had to be 
1509_143477_000030_000010	train-clean-360	And her picture of the minutely hierarchical constitution of the society of that city which she presented to him in many different lights was to Winterbourne s imagination almost oppressively striking 
1509_143477_000031_000000	train-clean-360	He immediately perceived from her tone that Miss Daisy Miller s place in the social scale was low 
1509_143477_000031_000001	train-clean-360	 I am afraid you don t approve of them he said 
1509_143477_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 They are very common missus Costello declared 
none	none	They are the sort of Americans that one does one s duty by not not accepting Ah you don t accept them said the young man
1509_143477_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 I can t my dear Frederick 
1509_143477_000034_000001	train-clean-360	I would if I could but I can t 
1509_143477_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 The young girl is very pretty said Winterbourne in a moment 
1509_143477_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 Of course she s pretty 
1509_143477_000036_000001	train-clean-360	But she is very common 
none	none	I see what you mean of course said Winterbourne after another pause
1509_143477_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 She has that charming look that they all have his aunt resumed 
1509_143477_000038_000001	train-clean-360	 I can t think where they pick it up and she dresses in perfection no you don t know how well she dresses 
1509_143477_000038_000002	train-clean-360	I can t think where they get their taste 
none	none	But my dear aunt she is not after all a Comanche savage
1509_143477_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 She is a young lady said missus Costello who has an intimacy with her mamma s courier 
1509_143477_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 An intimacy with the courier the young man demanded 
1509_143477_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh the mother is just as bad 
1509_143477_000042_000001	train-clean-360	They treat the courier like a familiar friend like a gentleman 
1509_143477_000042_000002	train-clean-360	I shouldn t wonder if he dines with them Very likely they have never seen a man with such good manners such fine clothes so like a gentleman 
1509_143477_000042_000003	train-clean-360	He probably corresponds to the young lady s idea of a count 
1509_143477_000042_000004	train-clean-360	He sits with them in the garden in the evening I think he smokes 
1509_143477_000043_000000	train-clean-360	Winterbourne listened with interest to these disclosures they helped him to make up his mind about Miss Daisy 
1509_143477_000043_000001	train-clean-360	Evidently she was rather wild Well he said I am not a courier and yet she was very charming to me 
1509_143477_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 You had better have said at first said missus Costello with dignity that you had made her acquaintance 
none	none	We simply met in the garden and we talked a bit Tout bonnement 
1509_143477_000046_000001	train-clean-360	And pray what did you say 
none	none	I said I should take the liberty of introducing her to my admirable aunt
1509_143477_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 I am much obliged to you 
none	none	It was to guarantee my respectability said Winterbourne
1509_143477_000050_000000	train-clean-360	 And pray who is to guarantee hers 
none	none	Ah you are cruel said the young man She s a very nice young girl
1509_143477_000052_000000	train-clean-360	 You don t say that as if you believed it missus Costello observed 
1509_143477_000053_000000	train-clean-360	 She is completely uncultivated Winterbourne went on 
1509_143477_000053_000001	train-clean-360	 But she is wonderfully pretty and in short she is very nice 
none	none	To prove that I believe it I am going to take her to the Chateau de Chillon
1509_143477_000054_000000	train-clean-360	 You two are going off there together 
1509_143477_000054_000001	train-clean-360	I should say it proved just the contrary 
none	none	How long had you known her may I ask when this interesting project was formed 
1509_143477_000054_000003	train-clean-360	You haven t been twenty four hours in the house 
1509_143477_000055_000000	train-clean-360	 I have known her half an hour said Winterbourne smiling 
none	none	Dear me cried missus Costello
1509_143477_000056_000001	train-clean-360	 What a dreadful girl 
1509_143477_000057_000000	train-clean-360	Her nephew was silent for some moments 
none	none	You really think then he began earnestly and with a desire for trustworthy information you really think that But he paused again
1509_143477_000058_000000	train-clean-360	 Think what sir said his aunt 
1509_143477_000059_000000	train-clean-360	 That she is the sort of young lady who expects a man sooner or later to carry her off 
1509_143477_000060_000000	train-clean-360	 I haven t the least idea what such young ladies expect a man to do 
1509_143477_000060_000001	train-clean-360	But I really think that you had better not meddle with little American girls that are uncultivated as you call them 
1509_143477_000060_000002	train-clean-360	You have lived too long out of the country 
1509_143477_000060_000003	train-clean-360	You will be sure to make some great mistake 
1509_143477_000060_000004	train-clean-360	You are too innocent 
1509_143477_000061_000000	train-clean-360	 My dear aunt I am not so innocent said Winterbourne smiling and curling his mustache 
none	none	You are guilty too then Winterbourne continued to curl his mustache meditatively
1509_143477_000063_000001	train-clean-360	 You won t let the poor girl know you then he asked at last 
none	none	Is it literally true that she is going to the Chateau de Chillon with you
1509_143477_000065_000000	train-clean-360	 I think that she fully intends it 
1509_143477_000066_000000	train-clean-360	 Then my dear Frederick said missus Costello I must decline the honor of her acquaintance 
1509_143477_000066_000001	train-clean-360	I am an old woman but I am not too old thank Heaven to be shocked 
1509_143477_000067_000000	train-clean-360	 But don t they all do these things the young girls in America Winterbourne inquired 
1509_143477_000068_000000	train-clean-360	missus Costello stared a moment 
1509_143477_000068_000001	train-clean-360	 I should like to see my granddaughters do them she declared grimly 
none	none	This seemed to throw some light upon the matter for Winterbourne remembered to have heard that his pretty cousins in New York were tremendous flirts If therefore Miss Daisy Miller exceeded the liberal margin allowed to these young ladies it was probable that anything might be expected of her 
1509_143477_000069_000001	train-clean-360	Winterbourne was impatient to see her again and he was vexed with himself that by instinct he should not appreciate her justly 
1509_143477_000070_000000	train-clean-360	Though he was impatient to see her he hardly knew what he should say to her about his aunt s refusal to become acquainted with her but he discovered promptly enough that with Miss Daisy Miller there was no great need of walking on tiptoe 
1509_143477_000070_000001	train-clean-360	He found her that evening in the garden wandering about in the warm starlight like an indolent sylph and swinging to and fro the largest fan he had ever beheld 
1509_143477_000070_000002	train-clean-360	It was ten o clock 
none	none	He had dined with his aunt had been sitting with her since dinner and had just taken leave of her till the morrow Miss Daisy Miller seemed very glad to see him she declared it was the longest evening she had ever passed Have you been all alone he asked
1509_143477_000072_000000	train-clean-360	 I have been walking round with mother 
1509_143477_000072_000001	train-clean-360	But mother gets tired walking round she answered 
none	none	Has she gone to bed
1509_143477_000074_000000	train-clean-360	 No she doesn t like to go to bed said the young girl 
1509_143477_000074_000006	train-clean-360	he doesn t like to go to bed 
none	none	said the young girl
1509_143477_000074_000001	train-clean-360	 She doesn t sleep not three hours 
none	none	She says she doesn t know how she lives 
1509_143477_000074_000003	train-clean-360	She s dreadfully nervous 
none	none	I guess she sleeps more than she thinks 
1509_143477_000074_000005	train-clean-360	She s gone somewhere after Randolph she wants to try to get him to go to bed 
none	none	He doesn t like to go to bed
1509_143477_000075_000000	train-clean-360	 Let us hope she will persuade him observed Winterbourne 
1509_143477_000076_000000	train-clean-360	 She will talk to him all she can but he doesn t like her to talk to him said Miss Daisy opening her fan 
1509_143477_000076_000001	train-clean-360	 She s going to try to get Eugenio to talk to him 
none	none	But he isn t afraid of Eugenio Eugenio s a splendid courier but he can t make much impression on Randolph 
1509_143477_000076_000004	train-clean-360	I don t believe he ll go to bed before eleven 
1509_143477_000076_000005	train-clean-360	It appeared that Randolph s vigil was in fact triumphantly prolonged for Winterbourne strolled about with the young girl for some time without meeting her mother 
none	none	I have been looking round for that lady you want to introduce me to his companion resumed
1509_143477_000076_000007	train-clean-360	 She s your aunt Then on Winterbourne s admitting the fact and expressing some curiosity as to how she had learned it she said she had heard all about missus Costello from the chambermaid 
1509_143477_000076_000008	train-clean-360	She was very quiet and very comme il faut she wore white puffs she spoke to no one and she never dined at the table d hote 
1509_143477_000076_000009	train-clean-360	Every two days she had a headache 
none	none	I think that s a lovely description headache and all said Miss Daisy chattering along in her thin gay voice
1509_143477_000076_000011	train-clean-360	 I want to know her ever so much 
1509_143477_000076_000012	train-clean-360	I know just what YOUR aunt would be I know I should like her 
1509_143477_000076_000013	train-clean-360	She would be very exclusive 
none	none	I like a lady to be exclusive I m dying to be exclusive myself 
1509_143477_000076_000015	train-clean-360	Well we ARE exclusive mother and I We don t speak to everyone or they don t speak to us 
1509_143477_000076_000016	train-clean-360	I suppose it s about the same thing 
none	none	Anyway I shall be ever so glad to know your aunt 
1509_143477_000077_000000	train-clean-360	Winterbourne was embarrassed 
none	none	She would be most happy he said but I am afraid those headaches will interfere 
1509_143477_000078_000000	train-clean-360	The young girl looked at him through the dusk 
none	none	But I suppose she doesn t have a headache every day she said sympathetically Winterbourne was silent a moment
1509_143477_000079_000001	train-clean-360	 She tells me she does he answered at last not knowing what to say 
1509_143477_000080_000000	train-clean-360	Miss Daisy Miller stopped and stood looking at him 
1509_143477_000080_000001	train-clean-360	Her prettiness was still visible in the darkness she was opening and closing her enormous fan 
none	none	She doesn t want to know me she said suddenly Why don t you say so 
1509_143477_000080_000004	train-clean-360	You needn t be afraid 
none	none	I m not afraid And she gave a little laugh 
1509_143477_000081_000000	train-clean-360	Winterbourne fancied there was a tremor in her voice he was touched shocked mortified by it 
none	none	My dear young lady he protested she knows no one It s her wretched health The young girl walked on a few steps laughing still You needn t be afraid she repeated Why should she want to know me Then she paused again she was close to the parapet of the garden and in front of her was the starlit lake There was a vague sheen upon its surface and in the distance were dimly seen mountain forms Daisy Miller looked out upon the mysterious prospect and then she gave another little laugh Gracious she IS exclusive she said Winterbourne wondered whether she was seriously wounded and for a moment almost wished that her sense of injury might be such as to make it becoming in him to attempt to reassure and comfort her He had a pleasant sense that she would be very approachable for consolatory purposes He felt then for the instant quite ready to sacrifice his aunt conversationally to admit that she was a proud rude woman and to declare that they needn t mind her 
1780-143478-0000	train-other-500	But before he had time to commit himself to this perilous mixture of gallantry and impiety the young lady resuming her walk gave an exclamation in quite another tone Well here s Mother I guess she hasn t got Randolph to go to bed
1780-143478-0001	train-other-500	The figure of a lady appeared at a distance very indistinct in the darkness and advancing with a slow and wavering movement Suddenly it seemed to pause Are you sure it is your mother Can you distinguish her in this thick dusk
none	none	 Winterbourne asked Well cried Miss Daisy Miller with a laugh I guess I know my own mother 
1780-143478-0002	train-other-500	And when she has got on my shawl too She is always wearing my things The lady in question ceasing to advance hovered vaguely about the spot at which she had checked her steps I am afraid your mother doesn t see you said Winterbourne Or perhaps
1780-143478-0003	train-other-500	he added thinking with Miss Miller the joke permissible perhaps she feels guilty about your shawl Oh it s a fearful old thing the young girl replied serenely I told her she could wear it She won t come here because she sees you Ah then
1780-143478-0004	train-other-500	said Winterbourne I had better leave you Oh no come on urged Miss Daisy Miller I m afraid your mother doesn t approve of my walking with you Miss Miller gave him a serious glance It isn t for me it s for you
1780-143478-0005	train-other-500	that is it s for HER Well I don t know who it s for But mother doesn t like any of my gentlemen friends She s right down timid She always makes a fuss if I introduce a gentleman But I DO introduce them almost always
1780-143478-0006	train-other-500	If I didn t introduce my gentlemen friends to Mother the young girl added in her little soft flat monotone I shouldn t think I was natural To introduce me said Winterbourne you must know my name And he proceeded to pronounce it Oh
1780-143478-0007	train-other-500	dear I can t say all that said his companion with a laugh But by this time they had come up to missus Miller who as they drew near walked to the parapet of the garden and leaned upon it looking intently at the lake and turning her back to them Mother
none	none	 said the young girl in a tone of decision Upon this the elder lady turned round mister Winterbourne said Miss Daisy Miller introducing the young man very frankly and prettily 
1780-143478-0008	train-other-500	Common she was as missus Costello had pronounced her yet it was a wonder to Winterbourne that with her commonness she had a singularly delicate grace Her mother was a small spare light person
1780-143478-0009	train-other-500	with a wandering eye a very exiguous nose and a large forehead decorated with a certain amount of thin much frizzled hair Like her daughter missus Miller was dressed with extreme elegance
1780-143478-0010	train-other-500	she had enormous diamonds in her ears So far as Winterbourne could observe she gave him no greeting she certainly was not looking at him Daisy was near her pulling her shawl straight
1780-143478-0011	train-other-500	What are you doing poking round here this young lady inquired but by no means with that harshness of accent which her choice of words may imply I don t know said her mother turning toward the lake again I shouldn t think you d want that shawl
1780-143478-0012	train-other-500	Daisy exclaimed Well I do her mother answered with a little laugh Did you get Randolph to go to bed asked the young girl No I couldn t induce him said missus Miller very gently He wants to talk to the waiter
1780-143478-0013	train-other-500	He likes to talk to that waiter I was telling mister Winterbourne the young girl went on and to the young man s ear her tone might have indicated that she had been uttering his name all her life Oh yes said Winterbourne I have the pleasure of knowing your son
1780-143478-0014	train-other-500	Randolph s mamma was silent she turned her attention to the lake But at last she spoke Well I don t see how he lives Anyhow it isn t so bad as it was at Dover said Daisy Miller And what occurred at Dover Winterbourne asked
1780-143478-0015	train-other-500	He wouldn t go to bed at all I guess he sat up all night in the public parlor He wasn t in bed at twelve o clock I know that It was half past twelve declared missus Miller with mild emphasis Does he sleep much during the day Winterbourne demanded
1780-143478-0016	train-other-500	I guess he doesn t sleep much Daisy rejoined I wish he would said her mother It seems as if he couldn t I think he s real tiresome Daisy pursued Then for some moments there was silence Well Daisy Miller
1780-143478-0017	train-other-500	said the elder lady presently I shouldn t think you d want to talk against your own brother Well he IS tiresome Mother said Daisy quite without the asperity of a retort He s only nine urged missus Miller
1780-143478-0018	train-other-500	Well he wouldn t go to that castle said the young girl I m going there with mister Winterbourne To this announcement very placidly made Daisy s mamma offered no response Winterbourne took for granted that she deeply disapproved of the projected excursion
1780-143478-0019	train-other-500	but he said to himself that she was a simple easily managed person and that a few deferential protestations would take the edge from her displeasure Yes he began your daughter has kindly allowed me the honor of being her guide
1780-143478-0020	train-other-500	missus Miller s wandering eyes attached themselves with a sort of appealing air to Daisy who however strolled a few steps farther gently humming to herself I presume you will go in the cars said her mother
1780-143478-0021	train-other-500	Yes or in the boat said Winterbourne Well of course I don t know missus Miller rejoined I have never been to that castle It is a pity you shouldn t go said Winterbourne beginning to feel reassured as to her opposition
1780-143478-0022	train-other-500	And yet he was quite prepared to find that as a matter of course she meant to accompany her daughter We ve been thinking ever so much about going she pursued but it seems as if we couldn t Of course Daisy she wants to go round But there s a lady here
1780-143478-0023	train-other-500	I don t know her name she says she shouldn t think we d want to go to see castles HERE she should think we d want to wait till we got to Italy
none	none	 It seems as if there would be so many there 
1780-143478-0024	train-other-500	continued missus Miller with an air of increasing confidence Of course we only want to see the principal ones We visited several in England she presently added Ah yes in England there are beautiful castles said Winterbourne
none	none	 But Chillon here is very well worth seeing 
1780-143478-0025	train-other-500	Well if Daisy feels up to it said missus Miller in a tone impregnated with a sense of the magnitude of the enterprise It seems as if there was nothing she wouldn t undertake Oh I think she ll enjoy it Winterbourne declared
1780-143478-0026	train-other-500	And he desired more and more to make it a certainty that he was to have the privilege of a tete a tete with the young lady who was still strolling along in front of them softly vocalizing You are not disposed madam he inquired to undertake it yourself
1780-143478-0027	train-other-500	Daisy s mother looked at him an instant askance and then walked forward in silence Then I guess she had better go alone she said simply
1780-143478-0028	train-other-500	Winterbourne observed to himself that this was a very different type of maternity from that of the vigilant matrons who massed themselves in the forefront of social intercourse in the dark old city at the other end of the lake
1780-143478-0029	train-other-500	But his meditations were interrupted by hearing his name very distinctly pronounced by missus Miller s unprotected daughter mister Winterbourne murmured Daisy Mademoiselle said the young man Don t you want to take me out in a boat
1780-143478-0030	train-other-500	At present he asked Of course said Daisy
none	none	 Well Annie Miller exclaimed her mother 
1780-143478-0031	train-other-500	I beg you madam to let her go said Winterbourne ardently for he had never yet enjoyed the sensation of guiding through the summer starlight a skiff freighted with a fresh and beautiful young girl I shouldn t think she d want to said her mother
1780-143478-0032	train-other-500	I should think she d rather go indoors I m sure mister Winterbourne wants to take me Daisy declared He s so awfully devoted
none	none	 I will row you over to Chillon in the starlight I don t believe it said Daisy Well ejaculated the elder lady again 
1780-143478-0033	train-other-500	You haven t spoken to me for half an hour her daughter went on I have been having some very pleasant conversation with your mother said Winterbourne Well I want you to take me out in a boat Daisy repeated
1780-143478-0034	train-other-500	They had all stopped and she had turned round and was looking at Winterbourne Her face wore a charming smile her pretty eyes were gleaming she was swinging her great fan about No it s impossible to be prettier than that thought Winterbourne
1780-143478-0035	train-other-500	There are half a dozen boats moored at that landing place he said pointing to certain steps which descended from the garden to the lake If you will do me the honor to accept my arm we will go and select one of them Daisy stood there smiling
1780-143478-0036	train-other-500	she threw back her head and gave a little light laugh I like a gentleman to be formal she declared I assure you it s a formal offer I was bound I would make you say something Daisy went on You see it s not very difficult said Winterbourne
1780-143478-0037	train-other-500	But I am afraid you are chaffing me I think not sir remarked missus Miller very gently Do then let me give you a row he said to the young girl It s quite lovely the way you say that cried Daisy It will be still more lovely to do it
1780-143478-0038	train-other-500	Yes it would be lovely said Daisy But she made no movement to accompany him she only stood there laughing I should think you had better find out what time it is interposed her mother It is eleven o clock madam
1780-143478-0039	train-other-500	said a voice with a foreign accent out of the neighboring darkness and Winterbourne turning perceived the florid personage who was in attendance upon the two ladies He had apparently just approached Oh Eugenio said Daisy I am going out in a boat
1780-143478-0040	train-other-500	Eugenio bowed At eleven o clock mademoiselle I am going with mister Winterbourne this very minute Do tell her she can t said missus Miller to the courier I think you had better not go out in a boat mademoiselle Eugenio declared
1780-143478-0041	train-other-500	Winterbourne wished to Heaven this pretty girl were not so familiar with her courier but he said nothing I suppose you don t think it s proper Daisy exclaimed Eugenio doesn t think anything s proper I am at your service said Winterbourne
1780-143478-0042	train-other-500	Does mademoiselle propose to go alone
none	none	 asked Eugenio of missus Miller Oh no with this gentleman 
1780-143478-0043	train-other-500	answered Daisy s mamma The courier looked for a moment at Winterbourne the latter thought he was smiling and then solemnly with a bow As mademoiselle pleases he said
none	none	 Oh I hoped you would make a fuss said Daisy I don t care to go now 
1780-143478-0044	train-other-500	I myself shall make a fuss if you don t go said Winterbourne That s all I want a little fuss And the young girl began to laugh again mister Randolph has gone to bed the courier announced frigidly Oh
1780-143478-0045	train-other-500	Daisy now we can go said missus Miller Daisy turned away from Winterbourne looking at him smiling and fanning herself Good night she said I hope you are disappointed or disgusted or something He looked at her
1780-143478-0046	train-other-500	taking the hand she offered him I am puzzled he answered Well I hope it won t keep you awake she said very smartly and under the escort of the privileged Eugenio the two ladies passed toward the house Winterbourne stood looking after them
1780-143478-0047	train-other-500	he was indeed puzzled He lingered beside the lake for a quarter of an hour turning over the mystery of the young girl s sudden familiarities and caprices But the only very definite conclusion he came to was that he should enjoy deucedly going off with her somewhere
none	none	 Two days afterward he went off with her to the Castle of Chillon 
1780-143478-0048	train-other-500	He waited for her in the large hall of the hotel where the couriers the servants the foreign tourists were lounging about and staring It was not the place he should have chosen but she had appointed it
1780-143478-0049	train-other-500	She came tripping downstairs buttoning her long gloves squeezing her folded parasol against her pretty figure dressed in the perfection of a soberly elegant traveling costume
1780-143478-0050	train-other-500	Winterbourne was a man of imagination and as our ancestors used to say sensibility as he looked at her dress and on the great staircase her little rapid confiding step he felt as if there were something romantic going forward
1780-143478-0051	train-other-500	He could have believed he was going to elope with her He passed out with her among all the idle people that were assembled there they were all looking at her very hard she had begun to chatter as soon as she joined him
none	none	 Winterbourne s preference had been that they should be conveyed to Chillon in a carriage 
1780-143478-0052	train-other-500	but she expressed a lively wish to go in the little steamer she declared that she had a passion for steamboats There was always such a lovely breeze upon the water and you saw such lots of people
none	none	 The sail was not long but Winterbourne s companion found time to say a great many things 
1780-143478-0053	train-other-500	To the young man himself their little excursion was so much of an escapade an adventure that even allowing for her habitual sense of freedom
none	none	 he had some expectation of seeing her regard it in the same way 
1780-143478-0054	train-other-500	But it must be confessed that in this particular he was disappointed Daisy Miller was extremely animated she was in charming spirits but she was apparently not at all excited
1780-143478-0055	train-other-500	she was not fluttered she avoided neither his eyes nor those of anyone else she blushed neither when she looked at him nor when she felt that people were looking at her
none	none	 People continued to look at her a great deal 
1780-143478-0056	train-other-500	and Winterbourne took much satisfaction in his pretty companion s distinguished air He had been a little afraid that she would talk loud laugh overmuch and even perhaps desire to move about the boat a good deal But he quite forgot his fears
1780-143478-0057	train-other-500	he sat smiling with his eyes upon her face while without moving from her place she delivered herself of a great number of original reflections It was the most charming garrulity he had ever heard He had assented to the idea that she was common
1780-143478-0058	train-other-500	but was she so after all or was he simply getting used to her commonness Her conversation was chiefly of what metaphysicians term the objective cast but every now and then it took a subjective turn
1780-143478-0059	train-other-500	What on EARTH are you so grave about she suddenly demanded fixing her agreeable eyes upon Winterbourne s Am I grave he asked I had an idea I was grinning from ear to ear
1780-143478-0060	train-other-500	You look as if you were taking me to a funeral If that s a grin your ears are very near together Should you like me to dance a hornpipe on the deck Pray do and I ll carry round your hat It will pay the expenses of our journey
1780-143478-0061	train-other-500	I never was better pleased in my life murmured Winterbourne She looked at him a moment and then burst into a little laugh I like to make you say those things You re a queer mixture
1780-143478-0062	train-other-500	In the castle after they had landed the subjective element decidedly prevailed Daisy tripped about the vaulted chambers rustled her skirts in the corkscrew staircases flirted back with a pretty little cry and a shudder from the edge of the oubliettes
1780-143478-0063	train-other-500	and turned a singularly well shaped ear to everything that Winterbourne told her about the place But he saw that she cared very little for feudal antiquities
none	none	 and that the dusky traditions of Chillon made but a slight impression upon her They had the good fortune to have been able to walk about without other companionship than that of the custodian 
1780-143478-0064	train-other-500	and Winterbourne arranged with this functionary that they should not be hurried that they should linger and pause wherever they chose The custodian interpreted the bargain generously Winterbourne on his side had been generous and ended by leaving them quite to themselves
1780-143478-0065	train-other-500	Miss Miller s observations were not remarkable for logical consistency for anything she wanted to say she was sure to find a pretext
none	none	 She found a great many pretexts in the rugged embrasures of Chillon for asking Winterbourne sudden questions about himself 
1780-143478-0066	train-other-500	his family his previous history his tastes his habits his intentions and for supplying information upon corresponding points in her own personality Of her own tastes habits and intentions Miss Miller was prepared to give the most definite
1780-143478-0067	train-other-500	and indeed the most favorable account Well I hope you know enough she said to her companion
none	none	 after he had told her the history of the unhappy Bonivard 
1780-143478-0068	train-other-500	I never saw a man that knew so much The history of Bonivard had evidently as they say gone into one ear and out of the other But Daisy went on to say that she wished Winterbourne would travel with them and go round with them they might know something in that case
1780-143478-0069	train-other-500	Don t you want to come and teach Randolph she asked Winterbourne said that nothing could possibly please him so much but that he had unfortunately other occupations Other occupations
none	none	 I don t believe it said Miss Daisy What do you mean 
1780-143478-0070	train-other-500	You are not in business The young man admitted that he was not in business but he had engagements which even within a day or two would force him to go back to Geneva Oh bother she said I don t believe it
none	none	 and she began to talk about something else 
1780-143478-0071	train-other-500	But a few moments later when he was pointing out to her the pretty design of an antique fireplace she broke out irrelevantly You don t mean to say you are going back to Geneva
none	none	 It is a melancholy fact that I shall have to return to Geneva tomorrow Well mister Winterbourne said Daisy I think you re horrid Oh don t say such dreadful things said Winterbourne 
1780-143478-0072	train-other-500	just at the last The last
none	none	 cried the young girl I call it the first I have half a mind to leave you here and go straight back to the hotel alone 
1780-143478-0073	train-other-500	And for the next ten minutes she did nothing but call him horrid Poor Winterbourne was fairly bewildered no young lady had as yet done him the honor to be so agitated by the announcement of his movements
none	none	 His companion after this ceased to pay any attention to the curiosities of Chillon or the beauties of the lake 
1780-143478-0074	train-other-500	she opened fire upon the mysterious charmer in Geneva whom she appeared to have instantly taken it for granted that he was hurrying back to see How did Miss Daisy Miller know that there was a charmer in Geneva Winterbourne who denied the existence of such a person
1780-143478-0075	train-other-500	was quite unable to discover and he was divided between amazement at the rapidity of her induction and amusement at the frankness of her persiflage She seemed to him in all this an extraordinary mixture of innocence and crudity
1780-143478-0076	train-other-500	Does she never allow you more than three days at a time asked Daisy ironically Doesn t she give you a vacation in summer There s no one so hard worked but they can get leave to go off somewhere at this season I suppose if you stay another day she ll come after you in the boat
1780-143478-0077	train-other-500	Do wait over till Friday and I will go down to the landing to see her arrive Winterbourne began to think he had been wrong to feel disappointed in the temper in which the young lady had embarked If he had missed the personal accent the personal accent was now making its appearance
1780-143478-0078	train-other-500	It sounded very distinctly at last in her telling him she would stop teasing him if he would promise her solemnly to come down to Rome in the winter That s not a difficult promise to make said Winterbourne My aunt has taken an apartment in Rome for the winter
1780-143478-0079	train-other-500	and has already asked me to come and see her I don t want you to come for your aunt said Daisy I want you to come for me And this was the only allusion that the young man was ever to hear her make to his invidious kinswoman
1780-143478-0080	train-other-500	He declared that at any rate he would certainly come After this Daisy stopped teasing
none	none	 Winterbourne took a carriage and they drove back to Vevey in the dusk 
1780-143478-0081	train-other-500	the young girl was very quiet
none	none	 In the evening Winterbourne mentioned to missus Costello that he had spent the afternoon at Chillon with Miss Daisy Miller 
1780-143478-0082	train-other-500	The Americans of the courier asked this lady Ah happily said Winterbourne the courier stayed at home She went with you all alone All alone
none	none	 missus Costello sniffed a little at her smelling bottle And that she exclaimed is the young person whom you wanted me to know PART II Winterbourne who had returned to Geneva the day after his excursion to Chillon went to Rome toward the end of January His aunt had been established there for several weeks and he had received a couple of letters from her Those people you were so devoted to last summer at Vevey have turned up here courier and all she wrote They seem to have made several acquaintances but the courier continues to be the most intime The young lady however is also very intimate with some third rate Italians with whom she rackets about in a way that makes much talk Bring me that pretty novel of Cherbuliez s Paule Mere and don t come later than the twenty third In the natural course of events Winterbourne on arriving in Rome would presently have ascertained missus Miller s address at the American banker s and have gone to pay his compliments to Miss Daisy After what happened at Vevey I think I may certainly call upon them he said to missus Costello If after what happens at Vevey and everywhere you desire to keep up the acquaintance you are very welcome Of course a man may know everyone Men are welcome to the privilege Pray what is it that happens here for instance Winterbourne demanded The girl goes about alone with her foreigners As to what happens further you must apply elsewhere for information She has picked up half a dozen of the regular Roman fortune hunters and she takes them about to people s houses When she comes to a party she brings with her a gentleman with a good deal of manner and a wonderful mustache And where is the mother I haven t the least idea They are very dreadful people Winterbourne meditated a moment They are very ignorant very innocent only Depend upon it they are not bad They are hopelessly vulgar said missus Costello Whether or no being hopelessly vulgar is being bad is a question for the metaphysicians They are bad enough to dislike at any rate and for this short life that is quite enough The news that Daisy Miller was surrounded by half a dozen wonderful mustaches checked Winterbourne s impulse to go straightway to see her He had perhaps not definitely flattered himself that he had made an ineffaceable impression upon her heart but he was annoyed at hearing of a state of affairs so little in harmony with an image that had lately flitted in and out of his own meditations the image of a very pretty girl looking out of an old Roman window and asking herself urgently when mister Winterbourne would arrive If however he determined to wait a little before reminding Miss Miller of his claims to her consideration he went very soon to call upon two or three other friends One of these friends was an American lady who had spent several winters at Geneva where she had placed her children at school She was a very accomplished woman and she lived in the Via Gregoriana Winterbourne found her in a little crimson drawing room on a third floor the room was filled with southern sunshine He had not been there ten minutes when the servant came in announcing Madame Mila This announcement was presently followed by the entrance of little Randolph Miller who stopped in the middle of the room and stood staring at Winterbourne An instant later his pretty sister crossed the threshold and then after a considerable interval missus Miller slowly advanced I know you said Randolph I m sure you know a great many things exclaimed Winterbourne taking him by the hand How is your education coming on Daisy was exchanging greetings very prettily with her hostess but when she heard Winterbourne s voice she quickly turned her head Well I declare she said I told you I should come you know Winterbourne rejoined smiling Well I didn t believe it said Miss Daisy I am much obliged to you laughed the young man You might have come to see me said Daisy I arrived only yesterday I don t believe that the young girl declared Winterbourne turned with a protesting smile to her mother but this lady evaded his glance and seating herself fixed her eyes upon her son We ve got a bigger place than this said Randolph It s all gold on the walls missus Miller turned uneasily in her chair I told you if I were to bring you you would say something she murmured I told YOU Randolph exclaimed I tell YOU sir he added jocosely giving Winterbourne a thump on the knee It IS bigger too Daisy had entered upon a lively conversation with her hostess Winterbourne judged it becoming to address a few words to her mother I hope you have been well since we parted at Vevey he said missus Miller now certainly looked at him at his chin Not very well sir she answered She s got the dyspepsia said Randolph I ve got it too Father s got it I ve got it most This announcement instead of embarrassing missus Miller seemed to relieve her I suffer from the liver she said I think it s this climate it s less bracing than Schenectady especially in the winter season I don t know whether you know we reside at Schenectady I was saying to Daisy that I certainly hadn t found any one like doctor Davis and I didn t believe I should Oh at Schenectady he stands first they think everything of him He has so much to do and yet there was nothing he wouldn t do for me He said he never saw anything like my dyspepsia but he was bound to cure it I m sure there was nothing he wouldn t try He was just going to try something new when we came off mister Miller wanted Daisy to see Europe for herself But I wrote to mister Miller that it seems as if I couldn t get on without doctor Davis At Schenectady he stands at the very top and there s a great deal of sickness there too It affects my sleep Winterbourne had a good deal of pathological gossip with doctor Davis s patient during which Daisy chattered unremittingly to her own companion The young man asked missus Miller how she was pleased with Rome Well I must say I am disappointed she answered We had heard so much about it I suppose we had heard too much But we couldn t help that We had been led to expect something different Ah wait a little and you will become very fond of it said Winterbourne I hate it worse and worse every day cried Randolph You are like the infant Hannibal said Winterbourne No I ain t Randolph declared at a venture You are not much like an infant said his mother But we have seen places she resumed that I should put a long way before Rome And in reply to Winterbourne s interrogation There s Zurich she concluded I think Zurich is lovely and we hadn t heard half so much about it The best place we ve seen is the City of Richmond said Randolph He means the ship his mother explained We crossed in that ship Randolph had a good time on the City of Richmond It s the best place I ve seen the child repeated Only it was turned the wrong way Well we ve got to turn the right way some time said missus Miller with a little laugh Winterbourne expressed the hope that her daughter at least found some gratification in Rome and she declared that Daisy was quite carried away It s on account of the society the society s splendid She goes round everywhere she has made a great number of acquaintances Of course she goes round more than I do I must say they have been very sociable they have taken her right in And then she knows a great many gentlemen Oh she thinks there s nothing like Rome Of course it s a great deal pleasanter for a young lady if she knows plenty of gentlemen By this time Daisy had turned her attention again to Winterbourne I ve been telling missus Walker how mean you were the young girl announced And what is the evidence you have offered asked Winterbourne rather annoyed at Miss Miller s want of appreciation of the zeal of an admirer who on his way down to Rome had stopped neither at Bologna nor at Florence simply because of a certain sentimental impatience He remembered that a cynical compatriot had once told him that American women the pretty ones and this gave a largeness to the axiom were at once the most exacting in the world and the least endowed with a sense of indebtedness Why you were awfully mean at Vevey said Daisy You wouldn t do anything You wouldn t stay there when I asked you My dearest young lady cried Winterbourne with eloquence have I come all the way to Rome to encounter your reproaches Just hear him say that said Daisy to her hostess giving a twist to a bow on this lady s dress Did you ever hear anything so quaint So quaint my dear murmured missus Walker in the tone of a partisan of Winterbourne Well I don t know said Daisy fingering missus Walker s ribbons missus Walker I want to tell you something Mother r interposed Randolph with his rough ends to his words I tell you you ve got to go Eugenio ll raise something I m not afraid of Eugenio said Daisy with a toss of her head Look here missus Walker she went on you know I m coming to your party I am delighted to hear it I ve got a lovely dress I am very sure of that But I want to ask a favor permission to bring a friend I shall be happy to see any of your friends said missus Walker turning with a smile to missus Miller Oh they are not my friends answered Daisy s mamma smiling shyly in her own fashion I never spoke to them It s an intimate friend of mine mister Giovanelli said Daisy without a tremor in her clear little voice or a shadow on her brilliant little face missus Walker was silent a moment she gave a rapid glance at Winterbourne I shall be glad to see mister Giovanelli she then said He s an Italian Daisy pursued with the prettiest serenity He s a great friend of mine he s the handsomest man in the world except mister Winterbourne He knows plenty of Italians but he wants to know some Americans He thinks ever so much of Americans He s tremendously clever He s perfectly lovely It was settled that this brilliant personage should be brought to missus Walker s party and then missus Miller prepared to take her leave I guess we ll go back to the hotel she said You may go back to the hotel Mother but I m going to take a walk said Daisy She s going to walk with mister Giovanelli Randolph proclaimed I am going to the Pincio said Daisy smiling Alone my dear at this hour missus Walker asked The afternoon was drawing to a close it was the hour for the throng of carriages and of contemplative pedestrians I don t think it s safe my dear said missus Walker Neither do I subjoined missus Miller You ll get the fever as sure as you live Remember what doctor Davis told you Give her some medicine before she goes said Randolph The company had risen to its feet Daisy still showing her pretty teeth bent over and kissed her hostess missus Walker you are too perfect she said I m not going alone I am going to meet a friend Your friend won t keep you from getting the fever missus Miller observed Is it mister Giovanelli asked the hostess Winterbourne was watching the young girl at this question his attention quickened She stood there smiling and smoothing her bonnet ribbons she glanced at Winterbourne Then while she glanced and smiled she answered without a shade of hesitation mister Giovanelli the beautiful Giovanelli My dear young friend said missus Walker taking her hand pleadingly don t walk off to the Pincio at this hour to meet a beautiful Italian Well he speaks English said missus Miller Gracious me Daisy exclaimed I don t to do anything improper There s an easy way to settle it She continued to glance at Winterbourne The Pincio is only a hundred yards distant and if mister Winterbourne were as polite as he pretends he would offer to walk with me Winterbourne s politeness hastened to affirm itself and the young girl gave him gracious leave to accompany her They passed downstairs before her mother and at the door Winterbourne perceived missus Miller s carriage drawn up with the ornamental courier whose acquaintance he had made at Vevey seated within Goodbye Eugenio cried Daisy I m going to take a walk The distance from the Via Gregoriana to the beautiful garden at the other end of the Pincian Hill is in fact rapidly traversed As the day was splendid however and the concourse of vehicles walkers and loungers numerous the young Americans found their progress much delayed This fact was highly agreeable to Winterbourne in spite of his consciousness of his singular situation The slow moving idly gazing Roman crowd bestowed much attention upon the extremely pretty young foreign lady who was passing through it upon his arm and he wondered what on earth had been in Daisy s mind when she proposed to expose herself unattended to its appreciation His own mission to her sense apparently was to consign her to the hands of mister Giovanelli but Winterbourne at once annoyed and gratified resolved that he would do no such thing Why haven t you been to see me asked Daisy You can t get out of that I have had the honor of telling you that I have only just stepped out of the train You must have stayed in the train a good while after it stopped cried the young girl with her little laugh I suppose you were asleep You have had time to go to see missus Walker I knew missus Walker Winterbourne began to explain I know where you knew her You knew her at Geneva She told me so Well you knew me at Vevey That s just as good So you ought to have come She asked him no other question than this she began to prattle about her own affairs We ve got splendid rooms at the hotel Eugenio says they re the best rooms in Rome We are going to stay all winter if we don t die of the fever and I guess we ll stay then It s a great deal nicer than I thought I thought it would be fearfully quiet I was sure it would be awfully poky I was sure we should be going round all the time with one of those dreadful old men that explain about the pictures and things But we only had about a week of that and now I m enjoying myself I know ever so many people and they are all so charming The society s extremely select There are all kinds English and Germans and Italians I think I like the English best I like their style of conversation But there are some lovely Americans I never saw anything so hospitable There s something or other every day There s not much dancing but I must say I never thought dancing was everything I was always fond of conversation I guess I shall have plenty at missus Walker s her rooms are so small When they had passed the gate of the Pincian Gardens Miss Miller began to wonder where mister Giovanelli might be We had better go straight to that place in front she said where you look at the view I certainly shall not help you to find him Winterbourne declared Then I shall find him without you cried Miss Daisy You certainly won t leave me cried Winterbourne She burst into her little laugh Are you afraid you ll get lost or run over But there s Giovanelli leaning against that tree He s staring at the women in the carriages did you ever see anything so cool Winterbourne perceived at some distance a little man standing with folded arms nursing his cane He had a handsome face an artfully poised hat a glass in one eye and a nosegay in his buttonhole Winterbourne looked at him a moment and then said Do you mean to speak to that man Do I mean to speak to him Why you don t suppose I mean to communicate by signs Pray understand then said Winterbourne that I intend to remain with you Daisy stopped and looked at him without a sign of troubled consciousness in her face with nothing but the presence of her charming eyes and her happy dimples Well she s a cool one thought the young man I don t like the way you say that said Daisy It s too imperious I beg your pardon if I say it wrong The main point is to give you an idea of my meaning The young girl looked at him more gravely but with eyes that were prettier than ever I have never allowed a gentleman to dictate to me or to interfere with anything I do I think you have made a mistake said Winterbourne You should sometimes listen to a gentleman the right one Daisy began to laugh again I do nothing but listen to gentlemen she exclaimed Tell me if mister Giovanelli is the right one The gentleman with the nosegay in his bosom had now perceived our two friends and was approaching the young girl with obsequious rapidity He bowed to Winterbourne as well as to the latter s companion he had a brilliant smile an intelligent eye Winterbourne thought him not a bad looking fellow But he nevertheless said to Daisy No he s not the right one Daisy evidently had a natural talent for performing introductions she mentioned the name of each of her companions to the other She strolled alone with one of them on each side of her mister Giovanelli who spoke English very cleverly Winterbourne afterward learned that he had practiced the idiom upon a great many American heiresses addressed her a great deal of very polite nonsense he was extremely urbane and the young American who said nothing reflected upon that profundity of Italian cleverness which enables people to appear more gracious in proportion as they are more acutely disappointed Giovanelli of course had counted upon something more intimate he had not bargained for a party of three But he kept his temper in a manner which suggested far stretching intentions Winterbourne flattered himself that he had taken his measure He is not a gentleman said the young American he is only a clever imitation of one He is a music master or a penny a liner or a third rate artist D n his good looks mister Giovanelli had certainly a very pretty face but Winterbourne felt a superior indignation at his own lovely fellow countrywoman s not knowing the difference between a spurious gentleman and a real one Giovanelli chattered and jested and made himself wonderfully agreeable It was true that if he was an imitation the imitation was brilliant Nevertheless Winterbourne said to himself a nice girl ought to know And then he came back to the question whether this was in fact a nice girl Would a nice girl even allowing for her being a little American flirt make a rendezvous with a presumably low lived foreigner The rendezvous in this case indeed had been in broad daylight and in the most crowded corner of Rome but was it not impossible to regard the choice of these circumstances as a proof of extreme cynicism Singular though it may seem Winterbourne was vexed that the young girl in joining her amoroso should not appear more impatient of his own company and he was vexed because of his inclination It was impossible to regard her as a perfectly well conducted young lady she was wanting in a certain indispensable delicacy It would therefore simplify matters greatly to be able to treat her as the object of one of those sentiments which are called by romancers lawless passions That she should seem to wish to get rid of him would help him to think more lightly of her and to be able to think more lightly of her would make her much less perplexing But Daisy on this occasion continued to present herself as an inscrutable combination of audacity and innocence She had been walking some quarter of an hour attended by her two cavaliers and responding in a tone of very childish gaiety as it seemed to Winterbourne to the pretty speeches of mister Giovanelli when a carriage that had detached itself from the revolving train drew up beside the path At the same moment Winterbourne perceived that his friend missus Walker the lady whose house he had lately left was seated in the vehicle and was beckoning to him Leaving Miss Miller s side he hastened to obey her summons missus Walker was flushed she wore an excited air It is really too dreadful she said That girl must not do this sort of thing She must not walk here with you two men Fifty people have noticed her Winterbourne raised his eyebrows I think it s a pity to make too much fuss about it It s a pity to let the girl ruin herself She is very innocent said Winterbourne She s very crazy cried missus Walker Did you ever see anything so imbecile as her mother After you had all left me just now I could not sit still for thinking of it It seemed too pitiful not even to attempt to save her I ordered the carriage and put on my bonnet and came here as quickly as possible Thank Heaven I have found you What do you propose to do with us asked Winterbourne smiling To ask her to get in to drive her about here for half an hour so that the world may see she is not running absolutely wild and then to take her safely home I don t think it s a very happy thought said Winterbourne but you can try missus Walker tried The young man went in pursuit of Miss Miller who had simply nodded and smiled at his interlocutor in the carriage and had gone her way with her companion Daisy on learning that missus Walker wished to speak to her retraced her steps with a perfect good grace and with mister Giovanelli at her side She declared that she was delighted to have a chance to present this gentleman to missus Walker She immediately achieved the introduction and declared that she had never in her life seen anything so lovely as missus Walker s carriage rug I am glad you admire it said this lady smiling sweetly Will you get in and let me put it over you Oh no thank you said Daisy I shall admire it much more as I see you driving round with it Do get in and drive with me said missus Walker That would be charming but it s so enchanting just as I am and Daisy gave a brilliant glance at the gentlemen on either side of her It may be enchanting dear child but it is not the custom here urged missus Walker leaning forward in her victoria with her hands devoutly clasped Well it ought to be then said Daisy If I didn t walk I should expire You should walk with your mother dear cried the lady from Geneva losing patience With my mother dear exclaimed the young girl Winterbourne saw that she scented interference My mother never walked ten steps in her life And then you know she added with a laugh I am more than five years old You are old enough to be more reasonable You are old enough dear Miss Miller to be talked about Daisy looked at missus Walker smiling intensely Talked about What do you mean Come into my carriage and I will tell you Daisy turned her quickened glance again from one of the gentlemen beside her to the other mister Giovanelli was bowing to and fro rubbing down his gloves and laughing very agreeably Winterbourne thought it a most unpleasant scene I don t think I want to know what you mean said Daisy presently I don t think I should like it Winterbourne wished that missus Walker would tuck in her carriage rug and drive away but this lady did not enjoy being defied as she afterward told him Should you prefer being thought a very reckless girl she demanded Gracious exclaimed Daisy She looked again at mister Giovanelli then she turned to Winterbourne There was a little pink flush in her cheek she was tremendously pretty Does mister Winterbourne think she asked slowly smiling throwing back her head and glancing at him from head to foot that to save my reputation I ought to get into the carriage Winterbourne colored for an instant he hesitated greatly It seemed so strange to hear her speak that way of her reputation But he himself in fact must speak in accordance with gallantry The finest gallantry here was simply to tell her the truth and the truth for Winterbourne as the few indications I have been able to give have made him known to the reader was that Daisy Miller should take missus Walker s advice He looked at her exquisite prettiness and then he said very gently I think you should get into the carriage Daisy gave a violent laugh I never heard anything so stiff If this is improper missus Walker she pursued then I am all improper and you must give me up Goodbye I hope you ll have a lovely ride and with mister Giovanelli who made a triumphantly obsequious salute she turned away missus Walker sat looking after her and there were tears in missus Walker s eyes Get in here sir she said to Winterbourne indicating the place beside her The young man answered that he felt bound to accompany Miss Miller whereupon missus Walker declared that if he refused her this favor she would never speak to him again She was evidently in earnest Winterbourne overtook Daisy and her companion and offering the young girl his hand told her that missus Walker had made an imperious claim upon his society He expected that in answer she would say something rather free something to commit herself still further to that recklessness from which missus Walker had so charitably endeavored to dissuade her But she only shook his hand hardly looking at him while mister Giovanelli bade him farewell with a too emphatic flourish of the hat Winterbourne was not in the best possible humor as he took his seat in missus Walker s victoria That was not clever of you he said candidly while the vehicle mingled again with the throng of carriages In such a case his companion answered I don t wish to be clever I wish to be EARNEST Well your earnestness has only offended her and put her off It has happened very well said missus Walker If she is so perfectly determined to compromise herself the sooner one knows it the better one can act accordingly I suspect she meant no harm Winterbourne rejoined So I thought a month ago But she has been going too far What has she been doing Everything that is not done here Flirting with any man she could pick up sitting in corners with mysterious Italians dancing all the evening with the same partners receiving visits at eleven o clock at night Her mother goes away when visitors come But her brother said Winterbourne laughing sits up till midnight He must be edified by what he sees I m told that at their hotel everyone is talking about her and that a smile goes round among all the servants when a gentleman comes and asks for Miss Miller The servants be hanged said Winterbourne angrily The poor girl s only fault he presently added is that she is very uncultivated She is naturally indelicate missus Walker declared Take that example this morning How long had you known her at Vevey A couple of days Fancy then her making it a personal matter that you should have left the place Winterbourne was silent for some moments then he said I suspect missus Walker that you and I have lived too long at Geneva And he added a request that she should inform him with what particular design she had made him enter her carriage I wished to beg you to cease your relations with Miss Miller not to flirt with her to give her no further opportunity to expose herself to let her alone in short I m afraid I can t do that said Winterbourne I like her extremely All the more reason that you shouldn t help her to make a scandal There shall be nothing scandalous in my attentions to her There certainly will be in the way she takes them But I have said what I had on my conscience missus Walker pursued If you wish to rejoin the young lady I will put you down Here by the way you have a chance The carriage was traversing that part of the Pincian Garden that overhangs the wall of Rome and overlooks the beautiful Villa Borghese It is bordered by a large parapet near which there are several seats One of the seats at a distance was occupied by a gentleman and a lady toward whom missus Walker gave a toss of her head At the same moment these persons rose and walked toward the parapet Winterbourne had asked the coachman to stop he now descended from the carriage His companion looked at him a moment in silence then while he raised his hat she drove majestically away Winterbourne stood there he had turned his eyes toward Daisy and her cavalier They evidently saw no one they were too deeply occupied with each other When they reached the low garden wall they stood a moment looking off at the great flat topped pine clusters of the Villa Borghese then Giovanelli seated himself familiarly upon the broad ledge of the wall The western sun in the opposite sky sent out a brilliant shaft through a couple of cloud bars whereupon Daisy s companion took her parasol out of her hands and opened it She came a little nearer and he held the parasol over her then still holding it he let it rest upon her shoulder so that both of their heads were hidden from Winterbourne This young man lingered a moment then he began to walk But he walked not toward the couple with the parasol toward the residence of his aunt missus Costello He flattered himself on the following day that there was no smiling among the servants when he at least asked for missus Miller at her hotel This lady and her daughter however were not at home and on the next day after repeating his visit Winterbourne again had the misfortune not to find them missus Walker s party took place on the evening of the third day and in spite of the frigidity of his last interview with the hostess Winterbourne was among the guests missus Walker was one of those American ladies who while residing abroad make a point in their own phrase of studying European society and she had on this occasion collected several specimens of her diversely born fellow mortals to serve as it were as textbooks When Winterbourne arrived Daisy Miller was not there but in a few moments he saw her mother come in alone very shyly and ruefully missus Miller s hair above her exposed looking temples was more frizzled than ever As she approached missus Walker Winterbourne also drew near You see I ve come all alone said poor missus Miller I m so frightened I don t know what to do It s the first time I ve ever been to a party alone especially in this country I wanted to bring Randolph or Eugenio or someone but Daisy just pushed me off by myself I ain t used to going round alone And does not your daughter intend to favor us with her society demanded missus Walker impressively Well Daisy s all dressed said missus Miller with that accent of the dispassionate if not of the philosophic historian with which she always recorded the current incidents of her daughter s career She got dressed on purpose before dinner But she s got a friend of hers there that gentleman the Italian that she wanted to bring They ve got going at the piano it seems as if they couldn t leave off mister Giovanelli sings splendidly But I guess they ll come before very long concluded missus Miller hopefully I m sorry she should come in that way said missus Walker Well I told her that there was no use in her getting dressed before dinner if she was going to wait three hours responded Daisy s mamma I didn t see the use of her putting on such a dress as that to sit round with mister Giovanelli This is most horrible said missus Walker turning away and addressing herself to Winterbourne Elle s affiche It s her revenge for my having ventured to remonstrate with her When she comes I shall not speak to her Daisy came after eleven o clock but she was not on such an occasion a young lady to wait to be spoken to She rustled forward in radiant loveliness smiling and chattering carrying a large bouquet and attended by mister Giovanelli Everyone stopped talking and turned and looked at her She came straight to missus Walker I m afraid you thought I never was coming so I sent mother off to tell you I wanted to make mister Giovanelli practice some things before he came you know he sings beautifully and I want you to ask him to sing This is mister Giovanelli you know I introduced him to you he s got the most lovely voice and he knows the most charming set of songs I made him go over them this evening on purpose we had the greatest time at the hotel Of all this Daisy delivered herself with the sweetest brightest audibleness looking now at her hostess and now round the room while she gave a series of little pats round her shoulders to the edges of her dress Is there anyone I know she asked I think every one knows you said missus Walker pregnantly and she gave a very cursory greeting to mister Giovanelli This gentleman bore himself gallantly He smiled and bowed and showed his white teeth he curled his mustaches and rolled his eyes and performed all the proper functions of a handsome Italian at an evening party He sang very prettily half a dozen songs though missus Walker afterward declared that she had been quite unable to find out who asked him It was apparently not Daisy who had given him his orders Daisy sat at a distance from the piano and though she had publicly as it were professed a high admiration for his singing talked not inaudibly while it was going on It s a pity these rooms are so small we can t dance she said to Winterbourne as if she had seen him five minutes before I am not sorry we can t dance Winterbourne answered I don t dance Of course you don t dance you re too stiff said Miss Daisy I hope you enjoyed your drive with missus Walker No I didn t enjoy it I preferred walking with you We paired off that was much better said Daisy But did you ever hear anything so cool as missus Walker s wanting me to get into her carriage and drop poor mister Giovanelli and under the pretext that it was proper People have different ideas It would have been most unkind he had been talking about that walk for ten days He should not have talked about it at all said Winterbourne he would never have proposed to a young lady of this country to walk about the streets with him About the streets cried Daisy with her pretty stare Where then would he have proposed to her to walk The Pincio is not the streets either and I thank goodness am not a young lady of this country The young ladies of this country have a dreadfully poky time of it so far as I can learn I don t see why I should change my habits for THEM I am afraid your habits are those of a flirt said Winterbourne gravely Of course they are she cried giving him her little smiling stare again I m a fearful frightful flirt Did you ever hear of a nice girl that was not But I suppose you will tell me now that I am not a nice girl You re a very nice girl but I wish you would flirt with me and me only said Winterbourne Ah thank you thank you very much you are the last man I should think of flirting with As I have had the pleasure of informing you you are too stiff You say that too often said Winterbourne Daisy gave a delighted laugh If I could have the sweet hope of making you angry I should say it again Don t do that when I am angry I m stiffer than ever But if you won t flirt with me do cease at least to flirt with your friend at the piano they don t understand that sort of thing here I thought they understood nothing else exclaimed Daisy Not in young unmarried women It seems to me much more proper in young unmarried women than in old married ones Daisy declared Well said Winterbourne when you deal with natives you must go by the custom of the place Flirting is a purely American custom it doesn t exist here So when you show yourself in public with mister Giovanelli and without your mother Gracious poor Mother interposed Daisy Though you may be flirting mister Giovanelli is not he means something else He isn t preaching at any rate said Daisy with vivacity And if you want very much to know we are neither of us flirting we are too good friends for that we are very intimate friends Ah rejoined Winterbourne if you are in love with each other it is another affair She had allowed him up to this point to talk so frankly that he had no expectation of shocking her by this ejaculation but she immediately got up blushing visibly and leaving him to exclaim mentally that little American flirts were the queerest creatures in the world mister Giovanelli at least she said giving her interlocutor a single glance never says such very disagreeable things to me Winterbourne was bewildered he stood staring mister Giovanelli had finished singing He left the piano and came over to Daisy Won t you come into the other room and have some tea he asked bending before her with his ornamental smile Daisy turned to Winterbourne beginning to smile again He was still more perplexed for this inconsequent smile made nothing clear though it seemed to prove indeed that she had a sweetness and softness that reverted instinctively to the pardon of offenses It has never occurred to mister Winterbourne to offer me any tea she said with her little tormenting manner I have offered you advice Winterbourne rejoined I prefer weak tea cried Daisy and she went off with the brilliant Giovanelli She sat with him in the adjoining room in the embrasure of the window for the rest of the evening There was an interesting performance at the piano but neither of these young people gave heed to it When Daisy came to take leave of missus Walker this lady conscientiously repaired the weakness of which she had been guilty at the moment of the young girl s arrival She turned her back straight upon Miss Miller and left her to depart with what grace she might Winterbourne was standing near the door he saw it all Daisy turned very pale and looked at her mother but missus Miller was humbly unconscious of any violation of the usual social forms She appeared indeed to have felt an incongruous impulse to draw attention to her own striking observance of them Good night missus Walker she said we ve had a beautiful evening You see if I let Daisy come to parties without me I don t want her to go away without me Daisy turned away looking with a pale grave face at the circle near the door Winterbourne saw that for the first moment she was too much shocked and puzzled even for indignation He on his side was greatly touched That was very cruel he said to missus Walker She never enters my drawing room again replied his hostess Since Winterbourne was not to meet her in missus Walker s drawing room he went as often as possible to missus Miller s hotel The ladies were rarely at home but when he found them the devoted Giovanelli was always present Very often the brilliant little Roman was in the drawing room with Daisy alone missus Miller being apparently constantly of the opinion that discretion is the better part of surveillance Winterbourne noted at first with surprise that Daisy on these occasions was never embarrassed or annoyed by his own entrance but he very presently began to feel that she had no more surprises for him the unexpected in her behavior was the only thing to expect She showed no displeasure at her tete a tete with Giovanelli being interrupted she could chatter as freshly and freely with two gentlemen as with one there was always in her conversation the same odd mixture of audacity and puerility Winterbourne remarked to himself that if she was seriously interested in Giovanelli it was very singular that she should not take more trouble to preserve the sanctity of their interviews and he liked her the more for her innocent looking indifference and her apparently inexhaustible good humor He could hardly have said why but she seemed to him a girl who would never be jealous At the risk of exciting a somewhat derisive smile on the reader s part I may affirm that with regard to the women who had hitherto interested him it very often seemed to Winterbourne among the possibilities that given certain contingencies he should be afraid literally afraid of these ladies he had a pleasant sense that he should never be afraid of Daisy Miller It must be added that this sentiment was not altogether flattering to Daisy it was part of his conviction or rather of his apprehension that she would prove a very light young person But she was evidently very much interested in Giovanelli She looked at him whenever he spoke she was perpetually telling him to do this and to do that she was constantly chaffing and abusing him She appeared completely to have forgotten that Winterbourne had said anything to displease her at missus Walker s little party One Sunday afternoon having gone to saint Peter s with his aunt Winterbourne perceived Daisy strolling about the great church in company with the inevitable Giovanelli Presently he pointed out the young girl and her cavalier to missus Costello This lady looked at them a moment through her eyeglass and then she said That s what makes you so pensive in these days eh I had not the least idea I was pensive said the young man You are very much preoccupied you are thinking of something And what is it he asked that you accuse me of thinking of Of that young lady s Miss Baker s Miss Chandler s what s her name Miss Miller s intrigue with that little barber s block Do you call it an intrigue Winterbourne asked an affair that goes on with such peculiar publicity That s their folly said missus Costello it s not their merit No rejoined Winterbourne with something of that pensiveness to which his aunt had alluded I don t believe that there is anything to be called an intrigue I have heard a dozen people speak of it they say she is quite carried away by him They are certainly very intimate said Winterbourne missus Costello inspected the young couple again with her optical instrument He is very handsome One easily sees how it is She thinks him the most elegant man in the world the finest gentleman She has never seen anything like him he is better even than the courier It was the courier probably who introduced him and if he succeeds in marrying the young lady the courier will come in for a magnificent commission I don t believe she thinks of marrying him said Winterbourne and I don t believe he hopes to marry her You may be very sure she thinks of nothing She goes on from day to day from hour to hour as they did in the Golden Age I can imagine nothing more vulgar And at the same time added missus Costello depend upon it that she may tell you any moment that she is engaged I think that is more than Giovanelli expects said Winterbourne Who is Giovanelli The little Italian I have asked questions about him and learned something He is apparently a perfectly respectable little man I believe he is in a small way a cavaliere avvocato But he doesn t move in what are called the first circles I think it is really not absolutely impossible that the courier introduced him He is evidently immensely charmed with Miss Miller If she thinks him the finest gentleman in the world he on his side has never found himself in personal contact with such splendor such opulence such expensiveness as this young lady s And then she must seem to him wonderfully pretty and interesting I rather doubt that he dreams of marrying her That must appear to him too impossible a piece of luck He has nothing but his handsome face to offer and there is a substantial mister Miller in that mysterious land of dollars Giovanelli knows that he hasn t a title to offer If he were only a count or a marchese He must wonder at his luck at the way they have taken him up He accounts for it by his handsome face and thinks Miss Miller a young lady qui se passe ses fantaisies said missus Costello It is very true Winterbourne pursued that Daisy and her mamma have not yet risen to that stage of what shall I call it of culture at which the idea of catching a count or a marchese begins I believe that they are intellectually incapable of that conception Ah but the avvocato can t believe it said missus Costello Of the observation excited by Daisy s intrigue Winterbourne gathered that day at saint Peter s sufficient evidence A dozen of the American colonists in Rome came to talk with missus Costello who sat on a little portable stool at the base of one of the great pilasters The vesper service was going forward in splendid chants and organ tones in the adjacent choir and meanwhile between missus Costello and her friends there was a great deal said about poor little Miss Miller s going really too far Winterbourne was not pleased with what he heard but when coming out upon the great steps of the church he saw Daisy who had emerged before him get into an open cab with her accomplice and roll away through the cynical streets of Rome he could not deny to himself that she was going very far indeed He felt very sorry for her not exactly that he believed that she had completely lost her head but because it was painful to hear so much that was pretty and undefended and natural assigned to a vulgar place among the categories of disorder He made an attempt after this to give a hint to missus Miller He met one day in the Corso a friend a tourist like himself who had just come out of the Doria Palace where he had been walking through the beautiful gallery His friend talked for a moment about the superb portrait of Innocent X by Velasquez which hangs in one of the cabinets of the palace and then said And in the same cabinet by the way I had the pleasure of contemplating a picture of a different kind that pretty American girl whom you pointed out to me last week In answer to Winterbourne s inquiries his friend narrated that the pretty American girl prettier than ever was seated with a companion in the secluded nook in which the great papal portrait was enshrined Who was her companion asked Winterbourne A little Italian with a bouquet in his buttonhole The girl is delightfully pretty but I thought I understood from you the other day that she was a young lady du meilleur monde So she is answered Winterbourne and having assured himself that his informant had seen Daisy and her companion but five minutes before he jumped into a cab and went to call on missus Miller She was at home but she apologized to him for receiving him in Daisy s absence She s gone out somewhere with mister Giovanelli said missus Miller She s always going round with mister Giovanelli I have noticed that they are very intimate Winterbourne observed Oh it seems as if they couldn t live without each other said missus Miller Well he s a real gentleman anyhow I keep telling Daisy she s engaged And what does Daisy say Oh she says she isn t engaged But she might as well be this impartial parent resumed she goes on as if she was But I ve made mister Giovanelli promise to tell me if SHE doesn t I should want to write to mister Miller about it shouldn t you Winterbourne replied that he certainly should and the state of mind of Daisy s mamma struck him as so unprecedented in the annals of parental vigilance that he gave up as utterly irrelevant the attempt to place her upon her guard After this Daisy was never at home and Winterbourne ceased to meet her at the houses of their common acquaintances because as he perceived these shrewd people had quite made up their minds that she was going too far They ceased to invite her and they intimated that they desired to express to observant Europeans the great truth that though Miss Daisy Miller was a young American lady her behavior was not representative was regarded by her compatriots as abnormal Winterbourne wondered how she felt about all the cold shoulders that were turned toward her and sometimes it annoyed him to suspect that she did not feel at all He said to himself that she was too light and childish too uncultivated and unreasoning too provincial to have reflected upon her ostracism or even to have perceived it Then at other moments he believed that she carried about in her elegant and irresponsible little organism a defiant passionate perfectly observant consciousness of the impression she produced He asked himself whether Daisy s defiance came from the consciousness of innocence or from her being essentially a young person of the reckless class It must be admitted that holding one s self to a belief in Daisy s innocence came to seem to Winterbourne more and more a matter of fine spun gallantry As I have already had occasion to relate he was angry at finding himself reduced to chopping logic about this young lady he was vexed at his want of instinctive certitude as to how far her eccentricities were generic national and how far they were personal From either view of them he had somehow missed her and now it was too late She was carried away by mister Giovanelli A few days after his brief interview with her mother he encountered her in that beautiful abode of flowering desolation known as the Palace of the Caesars The early Roman spring had filled the air with bloom and perfume and the rugged surface of the Palatine was muffled with tender verdure Daisy was strolling along the top of one of those great mounds of ruin that are embanked with mossy marble and paved with monumental inscriptions It seemed to him that Rome had never been so lovely as just then He stood looking off at the enchanting harmony of line and color that remotely encircles the city inhaling the softly humid odors and feeling the freshness of the year and the antiquity of the place reaffirm themselves in mysterious interfusion It seemed to him also that Daisy had never looked so pretty but this had been an observation of his whenever he met her Giovanelli was at her side and Giovanelli too wore an aspect of even unwonted brilliancy Well said Daisy I should think you would be lonesome Lonesome asked Winterbourne You are always going round by yourself Can t you get anyone to walk with you I am not so fortunate said Winterbourne as your companion Giovanelli from the first had treated Winterbourne with distinguished politeness He listened with a deferential air to his remarks he laughed punctiliously at his pleasantries he seemed disposed to testify to his belief that Winterbourne was a superior young man He carried himself in no degree like a jealous wooer he had obviously a great deal of tact he had no objection to your expecting a little humility of him It even seemed to Winterbourne at times that Giovanelli would find a certain mental relief in being able to have a private understanding with him to say to him as an intelligent man that bless you HE knew how extraordinary was this young lady and didn t flatter himself with delusive or at least TOO delusive hopes of matrimony and dollars On this occasion he strolled away from his companion to pluck a sprig of almond blossom which he carefully arranged in his buttonhole I know why you say that said Daisy watching Giovanelli Because you think I go round too much with HIM And she nodded at her attendant Every one thinks so if you care to know said Winterbourne Of course I care to know Daisy exclaimed seriously But I don t believe it They are only pretending to be shocked They don t really care a straw what I do Besides I don t go round so much I think you will find they do care They will show it disagreeably Daisy looked at him a moment How disagreeably Haven t you noticed anything Winterbourne asked I have noticed you But I noticed you were as stiff as an umbrella the first time I saw you You will find I am not so stiff as several others said Winterbourne smiling How shall I find it By going to see the others What will they do to me They will give you the cold shoulder Do you know what that means Daisy was looking at him intently she began to color Do you mean as missus Walker did the other night Exactly said Winterbourne She looked away at Giovanelli who was decorating himself with his almond blossom Then looking back at Winterbourne I shouldn t think you would let people be so unkind she said How can I help it he asked I should think you would say something I do say something and he paused a moment I say that your mother tells me that she believes you are engaged Well she does said Daisy very simply Winterbourne began to laugh And does Randolph believe it he asked I guess Randolph doesn t believe anything said Daisy Randolph s skepticism excited Winterbourne to further hilarity and he observed that Giovanelli was coming back to them Daisy observing it too addressed herself again to her countryman Since you have mentioned it she said I AM engaged Winterbourne looked at her he had stopped laughing You don t believe she added He was silent a moment and then Yes I believe it he said Oh no you don t she answered Well then I am not The young girl and her cicerone were on their way to the gate of the enclosure so that Winterbourne who had but lately entered presently took leave of them A week afterward he went to dine at a beautiful villa on the Caelian Hill and on arriving dismissed his hired vehicle The evening was charming and he promised himself the satisfaction of walking home beneath the Arch of Constantine and past the vaguely lighted monuments of the Forum There was a waning moon in the sky and her radiance was not brilliant but she was veiled in a thin cloud curtain which seemed to diffuse and equalize it When on his return from the villa it was eleven o clock Winterbourne approached the dusky circle of the Colosseum it recurred to him as a lover of the picturesque that the interior in the pale moonshine would be well worth a glance He turned aside and walked to one of the empty arches near which as he observed an open carriage one of the little Roman streetcabs was stationed Then he passed in among the cavernous shadows of the great structure and emerged upon the clear and silent arena The place had never seemed to him more impressive One half of the gigantic circus was in deep shade the other was sleeping in the luminous dusk As he stood there he began to murmur Byron s famous lines out of Manfred but before he had finished his quotation he remembered that if nocturnal meditations in the Colosseum are recommended by the poets they are deprecated by the doctors The historic atmosphere was there certainly but the historic atmosphere scientifically considered was no better than a villainous miasma Winterbourne walked to the middle of the arena to take a more general glance intending thereafter to make a hasty retreat The great cross in the center was covered with shadow it was only as he drew near it that he made it out distinctly Then he saw that two persons were stationed upon the low steps which formed its base One of these was a woman seated her companion was standing in front of her Presently the sound of the woman s voice came to him distinctly in the warm night air Well he looks at us as one of the old lions or tigers may have looked at the Christian martyrs These were the words he heard in the familiar accent of Miss Daisy Miller Let us hope he is not very hungry responded the ingenious Giovanelli He will have to take me first you will serve for dessert Winterbourne stopped with a sort of horror and it must be added with a sort of relief It was as if a sudden illumination had been flashed upon the ambiguity of Daisy s behavior and the riddle had become easy to read She was a young lady whom a gentleman need no longer be at pains to respect He stood there looking at her looking at her companion and not reflecting that though he saw them vaguely he himself must have been more brightly visible He felt angry with himself that he had bothered so much about the right way of regarding Miss Daisy Miller Then as he was going to advance again he checked himself not from the fear that he was doing her injustice but from a sense of the danger of appearing unbecomingly exhilarated by this sudden revulsion from cautious criticism He turned away toward the entrance of the place but as he did so he heard Daisy speak again Why it was mister Winterbourne He saw me and he cuts me What a clever little reprobate she was and how smartly she played at injured innocence But he wouldn t cut her Winterbourne came forward again and went toward the great cross Daisy had got up Giovanelli lifted his hat Winterbourne had now begun to think simply of the craziness from a sanitary point of view of a delicate young girl lounging away the evening in this nest of malaria What if she WERE a clever little reprobate that was no reason for her dying of the perniciosa How long have you been here he asked almost brutally Daisy lovely in the flattering moonlight looked at him a moment Then All the evening she answered gently I never saw anything so pretty I am afraid said Winterbourne that you will not think Roman fever very pretty This is the way people catch it I wonder he added turning to Giovanelli that you a native Roman should countenance such a terrible indiscretion Ah said the handsome native for myself I am not afraid Neither am I for you I am speaking for this young lady Giovanelli lifted his well shaped eyebrows and showed his brilliant teeth But he took Winterbourne s rebuke with docility I told the signorina it was a grave indiscretion but when was the signorina ever prudent I never was sick and I don t mean to be the signorina declared I don t look like much but I m healthy I was bound to see the Colosseum by moonlight I shouldn t have wanted to go home without that and we have had the most beautiful time haven t we mister Giovanelli If there has been any danger Eugenio can give me some pills He has got some splendid pills I should advise you said Winterbourne to drive home as fast as possible and take one What you say is very wise Giovanelli rejoined I will go and make sure the carriage is at hand And he went forward rapidly Daisy followed with Winterbourne He kept looking at her she seemed not in the least embarrassed Winterbourne said nothing Daisy chattered about the beauty of the place Well I HAVE seen the Colosseum by moonlight she exclaimed That s one good thing Then noticing Winterbourne s silence she asked him why he didn t speak He made no answer he only began to laugh They passed under one of the dark archways Giovanelli was in front with the carriage Here Daisy stopped a moment looking at the young American DID you believe I was engaged the other day she asked It doesn t matter what I believed the other day said Winterbourne still laughing Well what do you believe now I believe that it makes very little difference whether you are engaged or not He felt the young girl s pretty eyes fixed upon him through the thick gloom of the archway she was apparently going to answer But Giovanelli hurried her forward Quick quick he said if we get in by midnight we are quite safe Daisy took her seat in the carriage and the fortunate Italian placed himself beside her Don t forget Eugenio s pills said Winterbourne as he lifted his hat I don t care said Daisy in a little strange tone whether I have Roman fever or not Upon this the cab driver cracked his whip and they rolled away over the desultory patches of the antique pavement Winterbourne to do him justice as it were mentioned to no one that he had encountered Miss Miller at midnight in the Colosseum with a gentleman but nevertheless a couple of days later the fact of her having been there under these circumstances was known to every member of the little American circle and commented accordingly Winterbourne reflected that they had of course known it at the hotel and that after Daisy s return there had been an exchange of remarks between the porter and the cab driver But the young man was conscious at the same moment that it had ceased to be a matter of serious regret to him that the little American flirt should be talked about by low minded menials These people a day or two later had serious information to give the little American flirt was alarmingly ill Winterbourne when the rumor came to him immediately went to the hotel for more news He found that two or three charitable friends had preceded him and that they were being entertained in missus Miller s salon by Randolph It s going round at night said Randolph that s what made her sick She s always going round at night I shouldn t think she d want to it s so plaguy dark You can t see anything here at night except when there s a moon In America there s always a moon missus Miller was invisible she was now at least giving her daughter the advantage of her society It was evident that Daisy was dangerously ill Winterbourne went often to ask for news of her and once he saw missus Miller who though deeply alarmed was rather to his surprise perfectly composed and as it appeared a most efficient and judicious nurse She talked a good deal about doctor Davis but Winterbourne paid her the compliment of saying to himself that she was not after all such a monstrous goose Daisy spoke of you the other day she said to him Half the time she doesn t know what she s saying but that time I think she did She gave me a message she told me to tell you She told me to tell you that she never was engaged to that handsome Italian I am sure I am very glad mister Giovanelli hasn t been near us since she was taken ill I thought he was so much of a gentleman but I don t call that very polite A lady told me that he was afraid I was angry with him for taking Daisy round at night Well so I am but I suppose he knows I m a lady I would scorn to scold him Anyway she says she s not engaged I don t know why she wanted you to know but she said to me three times Mind you tell mister Winterbourne And then she told me to ask if you remembered the time you went to that castle in Switzerland But I said I wouldn t give any such messages as that Only if she is not engaged I m sure I m glad to know it But as Winterbourne had said it mattered very little A week after this the poor girl died it had been a terrible case of the fever Daisy s grave was in the little Protestant cemetery in an angle of the wall of imperial Rome beneath the cypresses and the thick spring flowers Winterbourne stood there beside it with a number of other mourners a number larger than the scandal excited by the young lady s career would have led you to expect Near him stood Giovanelli who came nearer still before Winterbourne turned away Giovanelli was very pale on this occasion he had no flower in his buttonhole he seemed to wish to say something At last he said She was the most beautiful young lady I ever saw and the most amiable and then he added in a moment and she was the most innocent Winterbourne looked at him and presently repeated his words And the most innocent The most innocent Winterbourne felt sore and angry Why the devil he asked did you take her to that fatal place mister Giovanelli s urbanity was apparently imperturbable He looked on the ground a moment and then he said For myself I had no fear and she wanted to go That was no reason Winterbourne declared The subtle Roman again dropped his eyes If she had lived I should have got nothing She would never have married me I am sure She would never have married you For a moment I hoped so But no I am sure Winterbourne listened to him he stood staring at the raw protuberance among the April daisies When he turned away again mister Giovanelli with his light slow step had retired Winterbourne almost immediately left Rome but the following summer he again met his aunt missus Costello at Vevey missus Costello was fond of Vevey In the interval Winterbourne had often thought of Daisy Miller and her mystifying manners One day he spoke of her to his aunt said it was on his conscience that he had done her injustice I am sure I don t know said missus Costello How did your injustice affect her She sent me a message before her death which I didn t understand at the time but I have understood it since She would have appreciated one s esteem Is that a modest way asked missus Costello of saying that she would have reciprocated one s affection Winterbourne offered no answer to this question but he presently said You were right in that remark that you made last summer I was booked to make a mistake I have lived too long in foreign parts Nevertheless he went back to live at Geneva whence there continue to come the most contradictory accounts of his motives of sojourn a report that he is studying hard an intimation that he is much interested in a very clever foreign lady End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Daisy Miller by Henry James END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK DAISY MILLER This file should be named two
