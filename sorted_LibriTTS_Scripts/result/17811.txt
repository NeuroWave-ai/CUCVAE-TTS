Junior Year at High School CHAPTER I A NEW ARRIVAL Next to home there is really nothing quite so satisfying as our dear old High School exclaimed Grace Harlowe as she entered the locker room and beamed on her three friends who stood near by It does seem good to be back even though we have had such a perfectly glorious summer said Jessica Bright We are a notch higher too We re actually juniors This locker room is now our property although I don t like it as well as the one we had last year We ll get accustomed to it and it will seem like home inside of two weeks said Anne Pierson philosophically Everything is bound to change in this world you know We must put ourselves in harmony with the things among which our lot is cast Well Marcus Aurelius we ll try to accept your teaching laughed Grace who immediately recognized the quotation as coming from a tiny Marcus Aurelius Year Book that Anne kept in her desk and frequently perused I wonder what school will bring us this year mused Nora O Malley as she retied her bow for the fifth time before the mirror and critically surveyed the final effect We had a stormy enough time last year goodness knows Really girls it is hard to believe that Miriam Nesbit and Julia Crosby were at one time the banes of our existence They come next to you three girls with me now I think that we all feel the same about them replied Grace Miriam is a perfect dear now and is just as enthusiastic over class matters as we are It looks as though everything were going to be plain sailing this year said Jessica There isn t a disturbing element in the class that I know of Still one can never tell Oh here come Eva Allen and Marian Barber called Grace delightedly and rushed over to the newcomers with outstretched hands By this time girls began to arrive rapidly and soon the locker room hummed with the sound of fresh young voices Coats of tan were compared and newly acquired freckles deplored as the girls stood about in groups talking of the delights of the summer vacation just ended To the readers of GRACE HARLOWE S PLEBE YEAR AT HIGH SCHOOL and GRACE HARLOWE S SOPHOMORE YEAR AT HIGH SCHOOL the girl chums have become familiar figures It will be remembered how Grace Harlowe and her friends Nora O Malley and Jessica Bright during their freshman year became the firm friends of Anne Pierson the brilliant young girl who won the freshman prize offered each year to the freshmen by missus Gray The reader will recall the repeated efforts of Miriam Nesbit aided by Miss Leece the algebra teacher to disgrace Anne in the eyes of the faculty and the way each attempt was frustrated by Grace Harlowe and her friends missus Gray s house party the winter picnic in Upton Wood and Anne Pierson s struggles to escape her unworthy father all contributed toward making the story stand out in the reader s mind In GRACE HARLOWE S SOPHOMORE YEAR the girl chums were found leading their class in athletics Here Miriam Nesbit still unsubdued endeavored once more to humiliate Anne Pierson and to oust Grace from her position as captain of the basketball team being aided in her plan by Julia Crosby captain of the junior team against whom the sophomores had engaged to play a series of three games Grace s brave rescue of Julia Crosby during a skating party and the latter s subsequent repentance restored good feeling between the two classes and the book ended with the final conversion of Miriam after her long and stubbornly nursed enmity David Nesbit s trial flight in his aeroplane Grace s encounter with the escaped lunatic who imagined himself to be Napoleon Bonaparte were among the features which made the book absorbing from start to finish The clang of the first bell broke in upon the chattering groups and obedient to its summons the girls moved slowly out of the locker room and down the corridor talking in subdued tones as they strolled toward the study hall Miss Thompson stood at her desk serene and smiling as the girls filed in How well Miss Thompson looks whispered Grace to Anne as they neared their seats Let s go up and see her when this session is over It s sure to be short this morning It was customary on the opening of school for the members of the various classes to take their seats of the previous year Then the sections were rearranged the seniors taking the seats left by the graduates and the other classes moving up accordingly The first day of school amounted to really nothing further than being assigned to one s seat and getting used to the idea of school again Miss Thompson usually addressed the girls on the duty of High School students and the girls went forth full of new resolutions that last for at least a week Grace looked curiously about her She wondered if there were to be many new girls that year The present freshmen direct from the Grammar Schools sat on the front seats looking a trifle awed at the idea of being academic pupils and feeling very strange and uncomfortable under the scrutiny of so many pairs of eyes Her glance wandered toward the new sophomore class as though in search of some one her eyes brightening as she caught sight of the brown eyed girl who had won the freshman prize the previous June The latter looked as helpless and friendless as when Grace first saw her step up on the platform to receive her money I shall certainly find out more about that child she decided What is her name I heard it at commencement but I have forgotten it Taking a leaf from a little note book that she always carried Grace wrote

none	none	see the freshman prize girl over among the sophomores What is her name I can t remember Then folding the paper she tossed it to Anne who nodded then wrote Mabel Allison and handed it to the girl sitting opposite her who obligingly passed it over to Grace With a nod of thanks to Anne Grace glanced at the paper and then at the owner of the name who sat with her hands meekly folded on her desk listening to Miss Thompson as though her life depended upon hearing every word that the principal uttered I want all my girls to try particularly this year to reach a higher standard than ever before Miss Thompson concluded not only in your studies but in your attitude toward one another Be straightforward and honorable in all your dealings girls so that when the day comes for you to receive your diplomas and bid Oakdale High School farewell you can do so with the proud consciousness that you have been to your schoolmates just what you would have wished them to be to you I know of no better preparation for a happy life than constant observation of the golden rule And now I hope I shall have no occasion to deliver another lecture during the school year said the principal smiling There can be no formation of classes to day as the bulletins of the various subjects have just been posted and will undoubtedly undergo some changes It would be advisable however to arrange as speedily as possible about the subjects you intend to take as we wish to begin recitations by Friday at the latest and I dare say the changes made in the schedule will be slight Then the work of assigning each class to its particular section of the study hall began The seniors moved with evident pride into the places reserved for the first class while the freshmen looked visibly relieved at having any place at all to call their own Immediately after this the classes were dismissed and a general rush was made to the end of the great room where the bulletins were posted Grace Nora Anne and Jessica wished to recite in the same classes as far as could be arranged and a lively confab ensued as to what would be best to take They all decided on solid geometry and English reading as they could be together for these classes but the rest was not so easy for Nora who loathed history was obliged to take ancient history to complete her history group the other girls having wisely completed theirs the previous year Jessica wanted to take physical geography Anne rhetoric and Grace boldly announced a hankering for zooelogy How horrible shuddered Jessica How can you bear to think of cutting up live cats and dogs and angleworms and things Oh you silly laughed Grace You re thinking of vivisection I wouldn t cut up anything alive for all the world The girls did dissect crabs and lobsters and even rabbits last year but they were dead long before they ever reached the zooelogy class Oh said Jessica somewhat reassured I m glad to hear that at any rate That makes three subjects said Nora Now we want one more Are any of you going to be over ambitious and take five Not I responded Grace and Jessica in chorus I shall said Anne quietly I m going to learn just as much as I can while I have the chance Well said Jessica you re different Five studies aren t any harder for you than four for us Thank the lady prettily for her high opinion of your ability Anne said Grace laughing She really seems to be sincere She s too sincere for comfort murmured Anne who hated compliments We haven t settled on that fourth subject yet interposed Nora Why don t you all take French it is such a beautiful language said a soft voice behind them I m sure you d like it The four girls turned simultaneously at the sound of the strange soft voice to face a girl whose beauty was almost startling She was a trifle taller than Grace and beautifully straight and slender Her hair was jet black and lay on her forehead in little silky rings while she had the bluest eyes the girls had ever seen Her features were small and regular and her skin as creamy as the petal of a magnolia She stood regarding the astonished girls with a fascinating little smile that was irresistible Please excuse me for breaking in upon you but I saw you from afar and you looked awfully good to me Her clear enunciation made the slang phrase sound like the purest English I have just been with your principal in her office She told me to come here and look over the list of subjects Do you think me unpardonably rude She looked appealingly at the four chums Why of course not said Grace promptly recovering in a measure from her first surprise I suppose you are going to enter our school are you not Let me introduce you to my friends She named her three chums in turn who bowed cordially to the attractive stranger My name is Grace Harlowe Will you tell me yours My name is Eleanor Savell replied the new comer and I have just come to Oakdale with my aunt We have leased a quaint old house in the suburbs called Heartsease My aunt fell quite in love with it so perhaps we shall stay awhile We travel most of the time and I get very tired of it she concluded with a little pout Heartsease cried the girls in chorus Do you live at Heartsease Yes said the stranger curiously Is there anything peculiar about it Oh no Grace hastened to reply The reason we are interested is because we know the owner of the property missus Gray very well Oh do you know her replied Eleanor lightly Isn t she a dainty little old creature She looks like a Dresden shepherdess grown old For an elderly woman she really is interesting We call her our fairy godmother said Anne and love her so dearly that we never think of her as being old There had been something about the careless words that jarred upon Anne Oh I am sure she is all that is delightful responded Miss Savell quickly divining that Anne was not pleased at her remark I hope to know her better You are lucky to get Heartsease said Grace missus Gray has refused over and over again to rent it It belonged to her favorite brother who willed it to her when he died She has always kept it in repair Even the furniture has not been changed I have been there with her and I love every bit of it I am glad to know that it has a tenant at last missus Gray knew my aunt years ago They have kept up a correspondence for ever so long It was due to her that we came here said Eleanor Is your aunt Miss Margaret Nevin asked Anne quietly Why how did you know her name cried Eleanor apparently mystified This is getting curiouser and curiouser The four girls laughed merrily Anne is missus Gray s private secretary explained Jessica She tends to all her correspondence I suppose you have written more than one letter to Miss Savell s aunt haven t you Anne Yes indeed replied Anne Her name is very familiar to me What class are you girls in said Eleanor abruptly changing the subject Or aren t you all in the same class We are all juniors laughed Nora and proud of it Our green and callow days are over and we have entered into the realm of the upper classes Then I shall enter the junior class too for I choose to hob nob with you girls Don t say you don t want me for I have made up my mind and it is like the laws of the Medes and Persians unchangeable We shall be glad to welcome a new classmate of course responded Grace I hope you will soon be one of us Did Miss Thompson say that you would have to take examinations She did she did answered Eleanor ruefully Still I m not much afraid I ve studied with a tutor so I m pretty well up in mathematics and English I can speak French German Italian and Spanish almost as well as English You know I ve lived most of my life abroad I ll manage to pass somehow I should think you would exclaimed Anne admiringly I hope you pass I m sure Perhaps you ll be too far advanced for our class Never fear my dear said Eleanor My heart is with the juniors and leave it to me not to land in any other class But really I ve bothered you long enough I must go back to your principal and announce myself ready to meet my fate I hope to know you better when examinations have ceased to be a burden and the weary are at rest That is if I survive With a gay little nod and a dazzling smile that revealed almost perfect teeth she walked quickly down the long room and out the door leaving the girl chums staring after her What an extraordinary girl said Jessica She acts as though she d known us all her life and we never set eyes on her until she marched in and calmly interrupted us ten minutes ago It doesn t seem to make much difference whether or not we like her She has decided she likes us and that settles it said Grace smiling What do you think of her Anne You are a pretty good judge of character I don t know yet replied Anne slowly She seems charming She must be awfully clever too to know so many languages but But what queried Nora Oh I don t know just what I want to say only let s proceed slowly with her then we ll never have anything to regret

none	none	girls said Jessica impatiently Let s hurry You know we promised to meet the boys as soon as school was over The girl chums walked out of the study hall each with her mind so full of the new girl who had so suddenly appeared in their midst that the proposed call upon Miss Thompson was entirely forgotten CHAPTER II CONFIDENCES I am the bearer of an invitation announced Anne Pierson as the four girls collected in one corner of the locker room during the brief recess allowed each morning missus Gray wishes to see us all at four o clock this afternoon We are to dine with her and spend the evening and the boys are invited for the evening too So we will have just time enough after school to go home and dress You had better meet at my house then said Grace for it s on the way to missus Gray s Good bye Be sure and be there at a quarter of four at the latest Promptly at the appointed time the girls hurried up the Harlowe walk They were met at the door by Grace who had been standing at the window for the last ten minutes with hat and gloves on impatiently waiting their arrival As they neared missus Gray s beautiful home Anne said in a low tone to Grace who was walking with her I suppose missus Gray has a double motive in asking us up here to day I believe she wants to talk to us about Eleanor Savell Miss Nevin called on missus Gray yesterday and they were in the parlor together for a long time After Miss Nevin had gone missus Gray told me that Miss Nevin was anxious that Eleanor should associate with girls of her own age That is the reason she brought her to Oakdale Hurry up you two called Nora who had reached the steps How you do lag to day You will hear more of this later whispered Anne missus Gray stood in the wide hall with hands outstretched in welcome She kissed each girl affectionately but her eyes lingered upon Anne who was plainly her favorite The old lady had become so accustomed to the sympathetic presence of the quiet young girl that it seemed at times as though her own daughter had come back to her once more Come right into the library and make yourself comfy cried missus Gray cheerily I spend most of my time there The view from the windows is so beautiful and as one grows old one resorts more and more to book friendships What shall we do with you missus Gray if you keep on insisting that you are old said Grace You re not a day older at heart than any of the rest of us Here sit down in this nice easy chair while we take turns telling you just how young you are It is due to my adopted children that I am not a cross crotchety complaining old woman said missus Gray allowing Grace to seat her in the big leather covered arm chair Now what does your Majesty crave of her loyal subjects inquired Grace bowing low before the little old lady Very well if I am queen then I must be obeyed Draw up your chairs and sit in a circle I want to tell you a little story That is partly my reason for inviting you here this afternoon although you know you are welcome whenever you choose to come Is it a fairy story dear missus Gray and does it begin with Once upon a time queried Jessica It is a story of real life my child but I ll begin it like a fairy tale if you wish it Oh please begin at once said Grace who at eighteen was as fond of a story as she had been at six Well once upon a time there were two sisters They were really only half sisters and the one was almost twenty years older than the other The mother of the elder sister had died when she was about fifteen years of age and two years later the father had married a beautiful young Irish girl of very good family who loved him dearly in spite of the difference in their ages After they had been married a little over two years a little girl came to them and the older sister loved the tiny baby as dearly as she loved her beautiful young step mother Why that sounds very much like Grimm s fairy tales exclaimed Nora Only the book people are all kings and queens but this is even better because the heroine is actually Irish There was a general laugh over Nora s remark in which missus Gray joined It s a case of Ireland forever isn t it Nora said Grace teasingly Fine and dandy are the Irish said Nora with a grin quoting from a popular song she had heard in a recent musical comedy But stop teasing me and let missus Gray go on with her story When the baby sister whose name was Edith was about three years old the beautiful young mother died and left the husband inconsolable A year later he was killed in a railroad accident and the elder sister named Margaret was left with only little Edith to comfort her The father had been a rich man so they had no anxiety about money and lived on year after year in their beautiful old home with everything heart could wish As Edith grew older she developed a decided talent for music and when she was fifteen Margaret decided to take her abroad and allow her to enter one of the great conservatories of Europe They went to Leipsic and Edith who had high hopes of one day becoming a concert pianiste continued her studies under the best instructors that money could procure Things ran along smoothly until Edith met a young Italian named Guido Savelli who was studying the violin at the same conservatory His brilliant playing had already created a sensation wherever he appeared and he gave promise of being a virtuoso He fell violently in love with Edith who had her mother s beautiful blue eyes and the combination of white skin and black hair that go to make an Irish beauty She returned his love and after a brief engagement they were married much against the wishes of Margaret who thought them both too young and impressionable to know their own minds And did they live happy ever after asked Grace eagerly That is the sad part of my story said missus Gray sighing They were anything but happy They both had too much of the artistic temperament to live peaceably Besides Guido Savelli was thoroughly selfish at heart Next to himself his music was the only thing in the world that he really cared for When they had been married for about a year and a half he played before the king and soon became the man of the hour He neglected his beautiful young wife who in spite of their frequent quarrels loved him with a pure and disinterested affection Finally he went on a concert tour through the principal European cities and she never saw him again She wrote him repeatedly but he never answered her letters and she was too proud to follow him She had one child a baby girl named Eleanor who was the sole comfort of the heartbroken mother At this juncture Anne and Grace exchanged significant glances When Eleanor was about a year old the mother wrote Guido Savelli once more begging him to come to her if only for the sake of his child but either he never received the letter or else paid no attention to it for she received no reply She relapsed into a dull apathetic state from which the repeated efforts of her sister failed to arouse her The following winter she contracted pneumonia and died leaving her sister the sole guardian of Eleanor How long ago did all this happen dear missus Gray queried Nora eagerly and is little Eleanor living It was sixteen years ago my dear replied missus Gray and the reason that I have told you this long tale is because the baby girl is almost a woman now and The girl is Eleanor Savell and we met her the other day broke in Grace excitedly forgetting for an instant that she had interrupted missus Gray She is going to live at Heartsease and oh missus Gray please pardon me for interrupting you I was so excited that I didn t realize my own rudeness Granted my dear smiled the old lady But how did you happen to meet Eleanor They arrived only a few days ago Grace rapidly narrated their meeting and conversation with Eleanor while missus Gray listened without comment When Grace repeated Eleanor s remark about having made up her mind the old lady looked a little troubled Then her face cleared and she said softly My dear Christmas children I am very anxious that for her own sake you should become well acquainted with Eleanor Her aunt was here yesterday and we had a long talk regarding her Eleanor is an uncommon girl in many respects She has remarkable beauty and talent but she is frightfully self willed Her aunt has spoiled her and realizes too late the damage she has done by having allowed her to grow up on the continent They have lived in France Germany Italy and Spain with an occasional visit to America and Eleanor has always done just as she pleased For years her aunt has obeyed her slightest whim but as she grows older she grows more like her father and her aunt wants her to have some steadying influence that will put a curb on her unconventional tendencies When she wrote me of Eleanor I wrote her about my girls and offered her Heartsease She was delighted with the whole thing and lost no time in getting here So now you understand why I have told you all this I want you to promise me that you will do what you can for this motherless girl But we felt sure we should like her when we saw her the other day said Nora She seemed so sweet and winning So she is She has her father s winning personality and a good deal of his selfishness too replied missus Gray You won t find her at all disagreeable But she is reckless self willed defiant of public opinion and exceedingly impulsive I look to you girls to keep her out of mischief Well we ll try but I never did pride myself on being a first class reformer said Grace laughing Where is her father now asked Anne Is it possible that he is the great Savelli who toured America two years ago He is the man said missus Gray He is a wonderful musician I heard him in New York City I shall never forget the way he played one of Liszt s Hungarian Rhapsodies I must caution you girls never to mention Eleanor s father to her She has been kept in absolute ignorance of him When she is twenty one her aunt will tell her about him If she knew he was the great Savelli she would rush off and join him to morrow she is so impulsive She has the music madness of both father and mother Her aunt tells me she is a remarkable performer on both violin and piano But why shouldn t she go to her father if he is a great musician said Jessica And why is she called Savell if her name is Savelli Because my dear her father has never evinced the slightest desire to look up his own child Even if he had he is too irresponsible and too temperamental to assume the care of a girl like Eleanor missus Gray answered No Eleanor is better off with her aunt As to her name her aunt hates everything Italian so she dropped the I and made the name Savell My said Nora with a sigh She is almost as remarkable as a fairy princess after all Oh I don t know replied Grace quickly Her life of course has been eventful but I believe if we are to do her any good we shall just have to act as though she were an everyday girl like the rest of us If we begin to bow down to her we shall be obliged to keep it up Besides I have an idea that I am as fond of having my own way as she is Dinner is served announced John the butler The four girls arose and followed missus Gray to the dining room During the dinner Eleanor was not again mentioned although she occupied more or less of the four girls thoughts Later on David Hippy and Reddy appeared and a merry frolic ensued It was after ten o clock before the little party of young folks prepared to take their departure Remember I rely upon you whispered missus Gray to Grace as she kissed her good night Grace nodded sympathetically but went home with an uneasy feeling that playing the guardian angel to Eleanor would be anything but a light task CHAPTER III AN AUTUMN WALKING EXPEDITION It is simply too lovely to go home to day exclaimed Grace Harlowe to her three chums as they strolled down High School Street one sunny afternoon in early October I move that we drop our books at my house and go for a walk I m willing to drop my books anywhere and never see them again grumbled Nora O Malley who was not fond of study I ought to go straight home demurred Anne Pierson but I ll put pleasure before duty and stay with the crowd What about you Jessica asked Grace You couldn t drive me home replied Jessica promptly Very well laughed Grace as we are all of the same mind let s shed these books and be off After a brief stop at Grace s home the four girls started out keenly alive to the beauty of the day The leaves on the trees were beginning to lose their green and put on their dresses of red and gold Though the sun shone brightly the air was cool and bracing and filled one with that vigor and joy of living which makes autumn the most delightful season of the year Once outside the gate the chums unconsciously headed in the same direction I believe we all have the same place in mind laughed Grace I was thinking about a walk to the old Omnibus House Great minds run in the same channel quoted Jessica I haven t been out there since the spread last year said Anne I have said Grace with a slight shudder I am not likely to forget it either Well we are not apt to meet any more Napoleon Bonapartes out there said Nora referring to Grace s encounter with an escaped lunatic fully narrated in GRACE HARLOWE S SOPHOMORE YEAR AT HIGH SCHOOL They were nearing their destination when Anne suddenly exclaimed Look girls Some one is over at the old house I just saw a man go around the corner The girls looked quickly in the direction of the house Just then a figure appeared stared at the approaching girls and began waving his hat wildly at the same time doing a sort of war dance It s another lunatic screamed Jessica Run girls run Run nothing exclaimed Nora Don t you know Reddy Brooks when you see him Just wait until I get near enough to tell him that you mistook him for a lunatic Hurrah David and Hippy are with him Well well well exclaimed Hippy as the girls approached Here is missus Harlowe s little girl and some of her juvenile friends I m very glad to see so many Oakdale children out to day How dare you take possession of the very spot we had our eye on asked Grace as she shook hands with David I came over to try my bird before I have it sent home for the winter replied David I was just locking up And the exhibition is all over cried Grace in a disappointed tone I m so sorry You see I still have a hankering for aeroplanes There wasn t any exhibition after all said David It wouldn t fly worth a cent to day I shall have to give it a complete overhauling when I get it back to my workshop What are you girls doing out this way Oh we just came out to walk because it was too nice to stay indoors said Anne And now we are particularly glad we came Not half as glad as I am replied David looking at her with a smile Speaking of walking remarked Hippy I have decided to go in for a little on my own account Object to become a light weight Is there any one who will encourage me in this laudable resolution and beguile me while I go galumphing over the ground Oh I know something that would be perfectly fine exclaimed Nora hopping about in excitement Watch her cried Hippy She is about to have a conniption She always has them when an idea hits her I ve known her for years and Make him stop appealed Nora to David and Reddy or I won t tell any of you a single thing I ll desist merely to please the Irish lady not because I m afraid of you two long slim persons said Hippy cleverly dodging both David and Reddy Suppose we go on a walking expedition said Nora We can start early some Saturday morning with enough lunch to last us all day and walk to the other side of Upton Wood and back My sister would be glad to go with us so that will settle the matter of having an older person along We can have the whole day in the woods and the walk will do us all good We won t have many more chances either for winter will be upon us before we know it It s a shame to waste such perfect days as these What a perfectly lovely stunt exclaimed Grace We ll write to Tom Gray and see if he can t come too The walking expedition wouldn t be complete without him I ll write to him to night said David I certainly should like to see the good old chap Will there be plenty to eat asked Hippy I always feel hungry after such strenuous exercise as walking I am not very strong you know Hear him jeered Reddy One minute he vows to walk until he reaches the skeleton stage and the next he threatens to kick over all his vows by overeating I didn t say anything about overeating retorted Hippy I merely stated that there are times when I feel the pangs of hunger Stop squabbling said Jessica and let s lay some plans Where shall we lay them innocently asked Hippy Nowhere if you re not good said Nora eyeing him severely Then an animated discussion began and the following Saturday was agreed upon the weather permitting as the best time to go Saturday turned out fair and by nine o clock the entire party were monopolizing the Harlowe s veranda Well are we all ready said Tom Gray as he glanced at his watch Everybody scramble One two three walk Eight highly excited boys and girls accompanied by Miss Edith O Malley hustled down the steps waving good bye to missus Harlowe as she stood on the veranda and watched them out of sight The lunch had been divided into four packages and each boy strapped a package to his shoulder Grace wore a little knapsack fitted to her back with two cross straps There s nothing in it but some walnut fudge that I made last night but I couldn t resist wearing it It belonged to my grandfather she confided to the girls when they had exclaimed over it My but it s great to be here said Tom Gray to Grace as they entered Upton Wood I m so glad I could come So are we she replied A lark in the woods wouldn t be half the fun with our forester missing Back to nature for me every time he exclaimed taking a deep breath and looking about him his face aglow with forest worship I love the woods too said Grace almost enough to wish I were a gypsy On down the shady wood road they traveled sometimes stopping to watch a squirrel or a chipmunk or to knock down a few burrs from the chestnut trees they occasionally found along the way Once they stopped and played hide and seek for half an hour By one o clock they were ravenously hungry Hippy clamored incessantly for food Let us feed him at once and have peace exclaimed Nora I m hungry too It seems an age since breakfast A halt was made and the contents of two of the lunch packages were arranged on a little tablecloth at the foot of a great oak The hungry young folks gathered around it and in a short time nothing remained of the lunch excepting the packages reserved for supper I move we all take a half hour s rest and then go on said David We still have a mile to go before we are through the wood We ll feel more like walking after we ve rested a little Let us all sit in a row with our backs against this fallen tree and tell a story said Grace Hippy you are on the end so you can begin it then after you have gone a little way Nora must take up the narrative and so on down the line until the story is finished Fine said Hippy Here goes Once upon a time in the heart of a deep forest there lived a most beautiful prince He had all that heart could wish still he was not happy for alas he was too fat At this statement there was a shout of laughter from his listeners at which Hippy pretending anger glared ferociously and vowed that he would not continue Nora thereupon took up the narrative and convulsed her hearers with the remedies tried by the fat prince to reduce his weight Then the story was passed on to Anne With each narrator it grew funnier until the party screamed with laughter over the misfortunes of the ill starred prince Hippy ended the tale by marrying the hero to a princess who was a golf fiend and who forced the poor prince to be her caddy From the day of his marriage he chased golf balls concluded Hippy and the habit became so firmly fixed with him that he even rose and chased them in his sleep He lost flesh at an alarming rate and three months after his wedding day they laid him to rest in the quiet churchyard with the touching epitaph over him Things are not what they seem Hippy buried his face in his handkerchief and sobbed audibly until David and Reddy pounced upon him and he was obliged to forego his lamentations and defend himself It s time to move said Tom Gray consulting his watch I don t believe we d better go on through the wood We ll have to about face if we expect to get home before dark So the start back was made but their progress was slow A dozen things beguiled them from the path Tom s trained eye spied a wasp s nest hanging from a limb It was as large as a Japanese lantern and a beautiful silver gray color Anne stopped to pick some ground berries she found nestling under the leaves Then they all started in wild pursuit of a rabbit and in consequence had difficulty in finding the road again Finally they all grew so hungry they sat down and disposed of the remaining food How dark it is growing exclaimed Jessica as they again took the road It must be very late It s after four o clock replied David and there s a storm coming too I think we had better hurry I don t fancy being caught in the woods in bad weather Hustle everybody As they hurried along the path a blast of wind blew full in their faces The whole forest seemed suddenly astir There were strange sounds from every direction The branches creaked and the dry leaves fell rattling to the ground by hundreds Another gust of wind filled their eyes and nostrils with fine dust Don t be frightened called Tom Follow me He led the way with Reddy but the storm was upon them before they had gone ten steps The wind almost blew them off their feet and black darkness settled down over the woods They could just see the outlines of the trees as they staggered on a blinding rain drenching them to the skin Tom divided the party into two sections four in one and five in the other They were to hold each other s hands tightly and keep together Frequent flashes of lightning revealed the woods in a tremendous state of agitation and it seemed better to be moving than to stand still and watch the terrifying spectacle On they stumbled but suddenly came to grief for the four in front fell headlong over a tree that had been blown across the path and the other five hearing their cries of warning too late followed after By the time they had picked themselves up the storm had grown so furious that they could only press miserably together and wait for it to pass Suddenly Tom amazed them all by putting his hands to his mouth and blowing a strange kind of hollow whistle that sounded like the note of a trumpet He repeated the whistle again and again You may not believe it he said between calls but the hunter who taught me this told me never to use it unless I was in dire need Then help of some sort would surely come It is called the Elf s Horn Did you ever try it before asked Reddy curiously No he answered I never did I suppose it s only superstition but I love hunter s lore Perhaps it may work Who knows Hello o o cried a voice seemingly close by Hello o o Where are you called Tom This way answered the voice and a light flashed a little distance off revealing to them a man waving a lantern with one hand and beckoning with the other One and all dashed toward the light feeling that shelter was at hand It must be a hunter panted Tom and he has heard the Elf s Horn It was a hunter and none other than old Jean Their blind wandering had taken them straight to the hunter s cabin It is Mademoiselle Grace and her friends cried the old man with delight When the sky grow so dark I take my lantern and go out to my trap I have set this morning Then I hear a strange whistle many times and I think some one get lost and I cry hello and you answer and I find mademoiselle and her friends That was the Elf s Horn Jean replied Tom and you heard because you are a hunter I know not what monsieur mean by Elf Horn but I hear whistle anyhow and come remarked the old man smiling The others laughed It s a shame to spoil it replied David but I am afraid your Elf s Horn and Jean s helloing were just a coincidence Coincidence or not replied Tom good naturedly my faith in the fairy horn is now unshakable I shall use it again if I ever need to Before a blazing fire kindled by Jean in the big fireplace the whole party dried themselves The old hunter listened to the story of their mad scramble through the woods with many expressions of sympathy It was eight o clock when the storm had abated sufficiently to allow them to sally forth and in a short time they were in Oakdale Fifteen minutes later they were telling mister and missus Harlowe just how it all happened CHAPTER IV GRACE MAKES A DISCOVERY The Monday after the walking expedition Grace Harlowe set out for school full of an idea that had been revolving in her busy brain for weeks The time had come for herself and for her three chums to bind themselves together as a sorority As charter members they would initiate four other girls as soon as proper rites could be thought of It should be a Greek letter society Grace thought Phi Sigma Tau would sound well Aside from the social part their chief object would be to keep a watchful eye open for girls in school who needed assistance of any sort missus Gray s anxiety over Eleanor Savell had set the bee in Grace s bonnet buzzing and now her plans were practically perfected All that remained to be done was to tell her three friends and consult them as to what other four girls would be eligible to membership Her proposition was hailed with acclamation by Anne Nora and Jessica Miriam Nesbit Marian Barber Eva Allen and Eleanor Savell were chosen as candidates and promptly notified to report at Jessica s home the next Thursday evening for initiation They at once accepted the invitation and solemnly promised to be there Where are you going my pretty maid said David Nesbit stopping directly in front of Grace Harlowe as she hurried toward the Bright home the following Thursday evening Grace laughed merrily dropped a little curtsy and recited I m going to an initiation sir she said And may I go with you my pretty maid replied David bowing low No boys allowed there sir she said That settles it sighed David I suppose a sorority is about to come to the surface Am I right and will you take me along Yes we are going to initiate members into our new sorority but you can t come so you might as well be resigned to fate retorted Grace We didn t receive invitations to your fraternity initiations Be kind to Anne won t you Tell her she has my sympathy said David solemnly Anne is a charter member if you please laughed Grace She is spared the ordeals of initiation But Miriam will not escape so easily She is one of the candidates Ah ha exclaimed David That s what she was so mysterious over I tried to find out where she was going but she wouldn t tell me By the way where does the affair take place he added trying to look innocent Don t you wish you knew teased Grace However you shan t find out from me I know too well what would happen if you boys traced us to our lair But I must go or I shall be late Good night David Please be good and don t follow me Promise me you won t I never make rash promises answered David smiling Be merciful to the candidates Lifting his cap the young man hurried off and turned the corner without looking back I wonder what I had better do Grace mused I know perfectly well that David Nesbit won t go away He will wait until he thinks I am far enough up the street and then he ll follow me As soon as he finds out where I am going he ll rush back and hunt up Hippy Wingate and Reddy Brooks Goodness knows what the three of them will plan She decided to turn down a side street go back one block and into the public library She could easily leave the library by the side entrance and cut across Putnam Square That would mislead David although no doubt he would find them before the evening was over Grace lost no time in putting her plan into action As she hurried into the library she looked back but saw no sign of David When she reached Putnam Square she almost ran along the broad asphalt walk It was fifteen minutes past seven by the city hall clock and she did not wish to be late The girls had agreed to be there by half past seven She was almost across the square when her ear caught the sound of a low sob Grace glanced quickly about The square was practically deserted but under one of the great trees curled up on a bench was a girl Without an instant s hesitation Grace made for the bench She touched the girl on the shoulder and said You seem to be in distress Can I do anything to help you Then Grace gave a little surprised exclamation The face turned toward her was that of Mabel Allison the freshman prize girl The glare from the neighboring light revealed her tear swollen eyes and quivering lips She gave Grace one long agonized look then dropped her head on her arm and sobbed harder than ever Why Miss Allison don t cry so soothed Grace Tell me what your trouble is Perhaps I can be of some service to you I ve wanted to know you ever since you won the freshman prize last June and so has Anne Pierson She won the prize the year before you know The girl nodded but she could not sufficiently control herself to speak Grace stood silently waiting until the other should find her voice A moment more and Mabel Allison began to speak in a plaintive little voice that went straight to Grace s heart You are Grace Harlowe I believe every girl in Oakdale High School knows you I have heard so much about you but I never dreamed that you d ever speak to me Nonsense replied Grace laughing I m just a girl like yourself There isn t anything remarkable about me I m very glad to know you Miss Allison but I am sorry to find you so unhappy Can t you tell me about it she coaxed sitting down on the bench and slipping one arm around the shabby little figure Mabel s lip quivered again Then she turned impulsively toward Grace and said Yes I will tell you although no one can help me I suppose you don t know where I live or anything about me do you No replied Grace shaking her head but I d be glad to have you tell me Well continued Mabel I m an orphan and I live with Miss Brant She Not that horrible miserly Miss Brant who lives in that ugly yellow house on Elm Street interrupted Grace in a horrified tone Yes she is the one I mean continued Mabel She took me from an orphan asylum two years ago I hated her the first time I ever saw her but the matron said I was old enough to work that I d have a good home with her and that I should be paid for my work She promised to send me to school and I was wild to get a good education so I went with her But she is perfectly awful and I wish I were dead Her voice ended almost in a wail I don t blame you said Grace sympathetically She has the reputation of being one of the most hateful women in Oakdale I am surprised that she even allows you to go to school That s just the trouble the girl replied her voice husky She s going to take me out of school I shall be sixteen next month and exempt from the school law So she is going to make me stop school and go to work in the silk mill I worked there all through vacation last summer and she took every cent of my wages She took my freshman prize money too What a burning shame exclaimed Grace indignantly Haven t you any relatives at all Miss Allison or any one else with whom you could stay Mabel shook her head I don t know anything about myself she said I was picked up on the street in New York City when I was three years old and as no one claimed me I was put in an orphanage There was one woman at the orphanage who was always good to me She remembered the day they brought me and she said that I was beautifully dressed She always believed that I had been stolen She said that I could tell my name Mabel Isabel Allison and that I would be three years old in November but that I couldn t tell where I lived Whenever they asked me I cried and said I didn t know She wanted to save my clothes for me thinking that by them I might some day find my parents but the matron took them away from her all but three little gold baby pins marked M I A She hid them away from the matron When she heard I was to go with Miss Brant she kissed me and gave them to me She was the only person that ever cared for me The tears stood in Grace s eyes You poor little thing she cried I care for you and I m going to see if I can do something for you You shan t stop school if I can help it I can t stay with you any longer just now because I am going to Miss Bright s and I am late It is eight o clock you see The girl gave a little cry of fright Oh I didn t think it was so late I know Miss Brant will be very angry She will probably beat me I am still carrying the marks from the last whipping she gave me She sent me out on an errand but I felt as though I must be alone if only for a few minutes That s why I stopped in the square Beat you exclaimed Grace How dare she touch you Why I never had a whipping in my life I won t keep you another minute but wait for me outside the campus when school is out to morrow I wish to talk further with you I ll come promised Mabel her face lighting up Then she suddenly threw both arms around Grace s neck and said I do love you and I feel that some one cares about me at last Then like a flash she darted across the square and was soon lost to Grace s view Well of all things Grace remarked softly to herself I think it s high time we organized a sorority for the purpose of aiding girls in distress You re a prompt person Did you really decide to come were the cries that greeted her from the porch as she opened the Bright s gate Save your caustic comments said Grace as she handed Jessica her hat I have a tale to tell Out with it was the cry and the girls surrounded Grace who began with her meeting with David and ended with the story of Mabel Allison You haven t heard anything of those boys yet have you she asked when she had finished Not yet said Nora but never fear the night is yet young Where is Eleanor Savell asked Grace noticing for the first time that Eleanor was not present You promised to go for her didn t you Anne I did go replied Anne but she wouldn t come She said she d come sometime when she felt like it She was playing on the violin when the maid let me in and how she can play She wanted me to stay there with her and didn t seem to understand why I couldn t break my engagement with you girls She said that she always kept her engagements unless the spirit moved her to do something else Is Eleanor Savell the girl who comes into the study hall every morning after opening exercises have begun asked Marian Barber Yes Grace answered I forgot for a moment that you and Eva and Miriam hadn t met her She is really very charming although her ideas about punctuality and school rules are somewhat hazy as yet She lives at Heartsease missus Gray s property I am disappointed because she will not be here to night She seemed delighted when I asked her to join our society As long as we know she isn t coming don t you think we should begin the initiation asked Nora It is after eight o clock and we can t stay out too late you know Very well said Grace Blindfold the candidates The three girls meekly submitted to the blindfolding and the chums were about to lead them to the initiation chamber when the ringing of the door bell caused them to start It s David and the boys said Jessica Shall I tell them that they can t come in Of course responded Nora You and Grace go to the door while Anne and I stay here with our victims Be careful they don t play you a trick The two girls cautiously approached the door opening it very slowly and saw not the three boys but Eleanor She smiled serenely and said Good evening I decided after all that I would come Come right in said Jessica cordially I am so glad you changed your mind and came The initiation is about to begin Have you ever belonged to a secret society Never replied Eleanor But now that I m here I am willing to try it Come this way Girls said Grace addressing the three blindfolded girls this is Eleanor Savell You can t see her yet but you may all shake hands with her She is to be your companion in misery Eleanor laughed shook hands with the others and graciously allowed Nora to tie a handkerchief over her eyes

none	none	called Grace and the eight girls solemnly proceeded to the initiation chamber CHAPTER V THE PHI SIGMA TAU At the door a halt was called Prepare to jump commanded Grace in a deep voice One two three Jump down Be careful The four candidates gave four uncertain jumps and experienced the disagreeable sensation usually felt in attempting to jump downward when on level ground This was one of the oldest and mildest forms of initiation but Nora had insisted upon it and giggled violently as the four girls prepared for a long leap Even Grace who was conducting the ceremony with the utmost seriousness laughed a little at the picture they made They ll do anything you tell them whispered Nora Which was perfectly true To show fear or reluctance in obeying the demands made upon one was to prove one s self unworthy of membership in the Phi Sigma Tau Let the music begin said Grace There was a faint snicker as Anne Nora and Jessica raised three combs wrapped in tissue paper to their lips and began the Merry Widow waltz with weird effect You must waltz around the room fifteen times without stopping continued Grace and then sit down in the four opposite corners of the room on the cushions provided for you The girl chums retreated to the doorway of the room that had previously been cleared of almost all the furniture to watch the movements of their victims as they endeavored to circle the room the required number of times They lost their count bumped each other at every turn and at last staggered dizzily toward what they thought were the corners of the room Miriam Nesbit made straight for the door in which the chums stood and Grace was obliged to take her by the shoulders and gently steer her in the opposite direction Eleanor after groping along one side of the room for a corner was the first to find one and sank with a sigh of relief upon the pile of cushions The other girls had not been so successful They all endeavored to sit in the same corner at once and Grace was obliged to go to the rescue and lead two of them to opposite sides of the initiation chamber In order to become successful members of this society it is necessary for you to sing You may all sing the first verse and the chorus of any song you know only be sure that you don t choose the same song and don t stop until you have finished directed Grace Begin after I have counted three I will wait for a minute while you choose your song The orchestra will accompany you There was considerable subdued laughter from the orchestra who had been instructed to play The Star Spangled Banner oblivious of whatever the candidates might sing One two three counted Grace and the concert began Eva Allen chose John Brown s Body Miriam Nesbit Old Kentucky Home Marian Barber Schooldays while Eleanor contributed The Marseillaise in French The orchestra dutifully burst forth with The Star Spangled Banner and the effect was indescribable The orchestra broke down before they reached their chorus and the accompaniment ended in a shriek of suppressed mirth but the candidates went stolidly on without a smile and finished almost together Very well done commended Grace I see you will be valuable additions to the society The girls were then put through a series of ridiculous tests that the four chums had devised They were made to dip their hands in water charged with electricity caress a mechanical rubber snake that wriggled realistically drink a cup of boneset tea apiece and were directed finally to bare their arms for the branding of the letters of the society The branding was done with a piece of ice pressed hard against their bare arms and the shock made the victims gasp for a second and wonder if they really were being burned You will now hold up your right hands and repeat after me said Grace I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute my duties as a member of the Phi Sigma Tau and will to the best of my ability preserve protect and defend its laws This done the girls received the grip of the society the handkerchiefs were removed from their eyes and they were pronounced full fledged members That oath has a rather familiar sound remarked Miriam Nesbit trying to recollect where she had heard it before I know she said at last It s the oath of office taken by the President of the United States at inauguration only you changed it to suit this sorority You ve guessed it exactly replied Grace I chose it because it sounded so much more expressive than to say May my bones be crushed and my heart cut out if ever I am unfaithful to my vows There was a general laugh at this the girls agreeing that Grace s choice was infinitely less blood thirsty Now that you have so bravely endured the trials of initiation you shall receive your reward declared Jessica Follow me She led the way to the dining room where a bountiful lunch awaited them to which after the manner of hungry school girls they did full justice By the way said Grace after they had returned to the sitting room and were comfortably settled you never said one word about my freshman prize girl I thought you would be awfully interested in her For the benefit of the new members I will say that this society was organized with a definite object that of helping others We are to look after girls who have no one to make things pleasant or happy for them Why do you know that there are quite a number of girls attending High School who come from other places and who have to spend the holidays at their boarding houses without any fun at all Look at this poor little Allison girl She works for her board in the winter and in the mill in the summer and now that miserable Miss Brant is going to take her out of school and she is getting along so well too Isn t it a pity said Anne that people like her can t understand that if a girl were allowed to finish her education she could earn so much more in the long run than she could by working year after year in a mill We might go to Miss Brant and explain that to her said Nora Perhaps she would listen to us I don t believe so replied Grace Besides she might be very angry and take her spite out on poor Mabel If we could only get Mabel away from her But if she has legally adopted her we couldn t do anything Besides where would she go if we did get her away I ll tell you what I ll do said Jessica thoughtfully I ll ask papa about it Lawyers always know everything about such things Maybe he could find out if Miss Brant has any real claim upon her That s a good idea said Miriam Nesbit If we can get her away from that hateful old wretch the sorority could adopt her She could stay with each one of us for a month That would be eight months and at the end of that time she would have finished her sophomore year Then she could get something pleasant to do through the summer vacation That would give her some money for clothes for next year Perhaps by that time we could find some nice people for her to stay with or if we liked her well enough we could go on having her with us I ll ask my mother to morrow and you girls might do the same Miriam Nesbit what a perfectly lovely plan exclaimed Grace Harlowe with rapture I feel sure mother would let me have her She can come here any time said Jessica Papa allows me to do as I like First catch your bird said Nora wisely Don t plan too much until you find out whether you can snatch her from the dragon s claws I feel sure we shall win replied Grace confidently What do you girls think of it she asked turning to Eva Marian and Eleanor who had so far expressed no opinion Count us in said Eva and Marian in a breath And you Eleanor asked Grace She can live at our house forever if she doesn t disturb me replied Eleanor lazily My aunt won t care either When we lived in Spain she used to help every beggar we came across and Spain is a land of beggars She never can resist an appeal for charity There was a sudden silence Then Grace said gently although she felt irritated at Eleanor s careless speech I don t think Mabel Allison could really be called a beggar and if we adopt her we ought never to let her think that we consider her a dependent Of course we know very little about her yet but I think she will prove worthy I am to see her to morrow and perhaps it would be better to talk a little more with her before we tell Jessica s father about it Eleanor looked at Grace with an amused smile How serious you girls are she said Is it school that makes you so If it is I don t think I shall stay long I like to drift along and do only what my inclination prompts me to do I hate responsibility of any sort Perhaps you will feel differently about school after a while said Anne quietly This is my third year in Oakdale High School and I never had any good times until I came here As for responsibility it is a good thing to learn to be responsible for one s self if for no one else Well perhaps you are right but I am sure that if you had never lived long enough in one country to become acclimated you wouldn t feel very responsible either said Eleanor in such rueful tones that the girls laughed although they secretly disapproved of Eleanor s inconsequential attitude Did you think the examinations hard asked Jessica of Eleanor Oh no replied Eleanor lightly I had an English governess who was with us for five years She drilled me thoroughly in English and mathematics I loathed them both but studied them merely to show her that I could master them Miss Thompson said my work was good and that if I were ambitious she would put me in the senior class but I held out for the juniors and finally got my own way If you are going to take such a serious view of this gay world however perhaps I ll wish I had joined the seniors after all No I don t mean that I m awfully glad to know you and feel honored at being a member of your sorority Only I don t expect to ever be a very useful one My aunt has spoiled me and I frankly admit it So you see there is no hope for me She spread out both hands in a deprecating manner and shrugged her shoulders exactly as a French woman might have done I am sure we like you just as you are said Eva Allen warmly She had been rather impressed with Eleanor Do you see the time said Nora suddenly pointing to the old fashioned clock in the corner Half past ten I must go this minute Sister will be worried She immediately made for her hat and coat the others following suit with the exception of Eleanor who was to wait until the coachman came for her Once the girls were outside the gate Marian Barber broke out with What a queer girl that Eleanor Savell is She is beautiful and fascinating but I don t know whether I like her or not You must like her said Grace You know the members of this society must stand by each other But why did you ask her to join Grace persisted Marian She is different from the rest of us I don t believe we shall get along with her very well I ll tell you girls a secret replied Grace Anne and Nora already know it missus Gray wants us to be nice to Eleanor for a number of reasons and of course we wish to please her Anne Jessica Nora and I were talking about it the other day and while we were laying plans for this sorority we decided to ask Eleanor to join We thought we could learn to know her better and she would eventually become a good comrade It sounds ridiculous to talk about helping a clever girl like Eleanor but from her conversation to night you can see that she needs some wholesome advice occasionally said Nora bluntly missus Gray seems to think we can be of some use in that direction so we are trying to carry out her theory I think I understand the situation said Miriam Nesbit and will do all I can to be nice to her if she doesn t attempt to patronize me I couldn t stand that I know I used to do it I suppose that s why it seems so unendurable to me now David Nesbit didn t disturb us after all remarked Eva Allen It s a wonder those boys didn t put tick tacks on the windows or do something like that The girls had come to the turn of the street and were about to pass the only really lonely spot during their walk It was an old colonial residence the surrounding grounds extending for a block It had been untenanted for some time as the owners were in Europe although both house and grounds were looked after by a care taker On the other side of the street was a field where the small fry of Oakdale usually held their ball games I always hate passing this old house said Marian Barber It is so terribly still back there among those pines I don t She stopped short an expression of terror overspreading her good natured face as she mutely pointed toward the old house Three ghostly figures swathed in white stole out from the shadow of the pines and glided down the wide graveled drive toward the gate Their appearance was terrifying Their faces were white as their robes and blue flames played about their eyes They carried out in every particular the description of the regulation churchyard ghost For an instant the six girls stood still regarding those strange apparitions with fascinated terror Then Eva Allen and Marian Barber shrieked in unison and fled down the street as fast as their legs would carry them Grace Nora Anne and Miriam stood their ground and awaited the oncoming spectres who halted when they saw that the girls did not intend to run High School boys on a lark whispered Grace to her friends Let s charge them in a body With a bound she reached the drive closely followed by the other girls The ghostly three evidently considering discretion the better part of valor left the drive and took to their heels across the lawn But Grace who was well in the lead caught the last fleeing ghost by its robe and held on for dear life There was a sound of rending cloth as the apparition bounded forward then it caught its spectre toe on a tuft of long grass and fell forward with a decidedly human thud The girls surrounded it in an instant Before it had time to rise Grace snatched off a white mask smeared around the eye holes with phosphorus which explained the flamelike effect and disclosed the sheepish face of James Gardiner one of the sophomore class Oh let a fellow up will you he said with a sickly grin You bad boy exclaimed Grace What do you mean by dressing up like this Don t you know you might frighten some timid person terribly Initiation said the youth with a grin rising on his elbow and looking as though he would like to make a sudden break for liberty Part of the sacred obligations of the Knights and Squires frat Three fellows of us were initiated to night This was the last stunt Well I suppose under those circumstances we shall have to forgive you Did you appear to any one else asked Grace Only to that old crank Miss Brant She was scared out of her wits replied James laughing Two of your crowd got out in a hurry too didn t they I suppose I shall have to confess that they did replied Grace If I were you James I d take off that costume and hurry away Miss Brant is liable to inform the police and they might not look at initiation stunts as we do That s right said James looking a trifle alarmed Wonder where the fellows went I d better put them on We never thought of that If you girls will excuse me I ll hunt them up Certainly said the girls Good night James Good night replied the youth You girls are all right Can t scare you With a nod to them he started across the grass on the run his ghostly garments trailing behind him I m glad that wasn t David said Anne as James disappeared I was afraid when first I saw them that they might be our boys I didn t feel frightened at all after what Grace had said about meeting David Eva and Marian didn t show any great amount of courage said Nora laughing I wonder if they ran all the way home There they are ahead of us said Anne True enough the two girls stood on the corner waiting for the others to come up Why don t you hurry on home called Nora The goblins will git you ef you don t watch out Don t tease said Marian Barber looking rather foolish We are awfully sorry we ran away but when I saw those awful white figures coming toward us I just had to run and so did Eva Who on earth were they and where did they go In a few words Grace told her what had happened That horrid James Gardiner I ll never speak to him again cried Eva Allen I hope he didn t recognize us He ll tell every one in school about it I don t think he did replied Grace Oh look girls Here comes Officer Donavan I was right when I said that Miss Brant would notify the police I hope she got a good scare remarked Nora wickedly As for the ghosts they are very likely at home by this time CHAPTER VI A VISIT TO ELEANOR The next day when Grace in company with her chums left the school building they beheld the shabby little figure of Mabel Allison waiting for them just outside the campus 
5480-41606-0000	train-other-500	She looked shy and embarrassed when she saw the four girls bearing down upon her and seemed half inclined to run away Grace greeted her cordially and introduced her to her chums whose simple and unaffected manners soon put her at her ease
5480-41606-0001	train-other-500	I am so glad you waited said Grace cordially I have told my three friends about you as I knew they would be as much interested in you as I am
none	none	 We have made a plan and if we can carry it out 
5480-41606-0002	train-other-500	you will be able to go to school until you graduate You are very good to take so much trouble for me said Mabel the tears springing to her eyes but I m afraid it won t do any good Don t be down hearted said Nora sympathetically
5480-41606-0003	train-other-500	You don t know Grace Harlowe She always does whatever she sets out to do She s a regular fairy godmother said Anne softly I know from experience Such flattery is overwhelming murmured Grace
5480-41606-0004	train-other-500	I regret that I m too busy to bow my thanks But to get down to the business of the hour tell me Mabel dear did this Miss Brant legally adopt you when she took you from the orphanage
none	none	 or are you bound to her in any way 
5480-41606-0005	train-other-500	I don t know said the girl her eyes growing big with wonder I never thought about it I don t believe however that she has any legal claim upon me Is there any way in which you can find out asked Anne
5480-41606-0006	train-other-500	Why yes replied Mabel I could write the woman at the orphanage who was good to me She is still there and several times she has written to me
none	none	 but Miss Brant read her letters first and then tore them up 
5480-41606-0007	train-other-500	Her name is Mary Stevens and she would surely know
none	none	 Then write to her at once said Grace and tell her to send her letter in an outside envelope addressed to me 
5480-41606-0008	train-other-500	Your whole future depends upon her answer Grace thereupon related to her their conversation of the previous night As soon as you find out about Miss Brant s claim we shall take the matter to Jessica s father who is a lawyer
5480-41606-0009	train-other-500	He will help us Grace concluded Then when you are free we shall have something else to tell you Just be patient for a few days and don t be afraid Everything will come right How can I ever thank you all said Mabel
5480-41606-0010	train-other-500	taking one of Grace s hands between hers and looking at her with a world of gratitude in her eyes I will write to night I must go now or I shall be home late Forgive me for hurrying away but I daren t stay she added piteously You know that I should like to
5480-41606-0011	train-other-500	Good bye and thank you again Good bye called Grace I ll let you know as soon as I hear from Mary Stevens What a sweet little girl she is said Jessica I should like to keep her with me all the time
5480-41606-0012	train-other-500	She is a nice child said Grace and she deserves something better than her present fate To change the subject said Nora has any one seen Eleanor to day She was not in English or geometry although she may have come in late
5480-41606-0013	train-other-500	I don t believe she was in school at all said Anne Maybe the initiation was too much for her Oh I don t know She didn t seem to mind it remarked Jessica She will hear from Miss Thompson if she makes a practice of staying out of school
none	none	 Attendance is one of the chief requisites in Miss Thompson s eyes 
5480-41606-0014	train-other-500	I suppose we ought to call on Eleanor before long mused Grace She has invited us and it s our duty to call on her first Anne has already been there Suppose we go over now that is unless you girls have something else to do
5480-41606-0015	train-other-500	It was decided at once that they could go and soon the four chums were walking briskly down the street in the direction of Heartsease
none	none	 It was an Indian summer day and the girls congratulated themselves on having taken advantage of it 
5480-41606-0016	train-other-500	As school had closed at half past two it was not yet four o clock They would have plenty of time for their call without hurrying themselves So they strolled along laughing and chatting in the care free manner that belongs alone to the school girl
5480-41606-0017	train-other-500	As they neared the house one and all exclaimed at the beauty of the grounds The lawn looked like a great stretch of green velvet while the trees were gorgeous in their autumn glory of crimson and gold with here and there a patch of russet by way of contrast
none	none	 Over at one side were clumps of pink and white anemones while all around the house and in the garden beds that dotted the lawn many colored chrysanthemums stood up in brave array What a delightful place Heartsease is cried Grace as she paused just inside the gate to feast her eyes upon its beauty Sometimes I think that autumn is the finest season of the year 
5480-41606-0018	train-other-500	and then again I like spring better What difference does the season make so long as we have a good time said Nora blithely I haven t any preference They re all good Eleanor will be surprised to see us remarked Grace as she rang the bell
5480-41606-0019	train-other-500	Let s hope she will appreciate the honor of having four such distinguished persons descend upon her at one time said Anne Is Miss Savell in
none	none	 asked Grace to the trim maid who answered her ring 
5480-41606-0020	train-other-500	Yes miss replied the maid Come in Who shall I say is here Say to Miss Savell that Grace Harlowe and her friends would like to see her The maid soon reappeared and led the girls down the wide old fashioned hall and
5480-41606-0021	train-other-500	somewhat to their surprise ushered them into the dining room where they beheld Eleanor arrayed in a dainty white house gown dining alone She arose as they entered and came forward with both hands outstretched How are the Phi Sigma Taus to day
5480-41606-0022	train-other-500	she asked It was awfully nice of you to come and see me We thought you might be ill said Nora We missed you at school to day Oh no replied Eleanor serenely I am perfectly well
5480-41606-0023	train-other-500	I really didn t feel like going to school to day so I stayed in bed until eleven o clock I am just having lunch now Won t you join me I am keeping house by myself this afternoon My aunt is dining with missus Gray
5480-41606-0024	train-other-500	Thank you said Grace speaking for the girls We all have supper at half past six and must save our appetites for that We usually dine about eight o clock said Eleanor We acquired the habit of dining late from living on the continent
5480-41606-0025	train-other-500	But come now I have finished my lunch I want you to see where I live almost entirely when in the house The girls followed her up the broad staircase and down the hall Every inch of the ground was familiar to Grace
5480-41606-0026	train-other-500	She had been there so often with missus Gray Oh you have the suite at the back she exclaimed I love those two rooms You will find them somewhat changed
5480-41606-0027	train-other-500	remarked Eleanor as she opened the door and ushered the girls into the most quietly luxurious apartment they had ever seen Even Miriam Nesbit s room could not compare with it What a beautiful room exclaimed Grace looking about her with delight
5480-41606-0028	train-other-500	I don t wonder you like to spend your time in it I see you have your own piano Yes replied Eleanor My aunt sent to New York for it The one downstairs in the drawing room is all right
none	none	 but I like to have this one handy so that I can play whenever the spirit moves me This is my bedroom she continued pushing aside the silken curtains that separated the two rooms The girls exclaimed over the Circassian walnut furniture and could not decide as to which room was the prettier 
5480-41606-0029	train-other-500	Eleanor said Grace solemnly you ought to be a very happy girl You have everything a heart can wish Think of poor little Mabel Allison Oh don t let s think about disagreeable things said Eleanor lightly
5480-41606-0030	train-other-500	Sit down and be comfy and I ll play for you What shall I play Do you know the Peer Gynt suite asked Grace I love Anitra s Dance
5480-41606-0031	train-other-500	Without answering Eleanor immediately began the Peer Gynt music and played the entire suite with remarkable expression How well you play exclaimed Jessica with eager admiration in her voice as Eleanor turned around on the stool after she had finished
5480-41606-0032	train-other-500	I should love to hear you play on the violin Anne heard you the other night and told us about it I love the violin better than the piano but it sounds better with a piano accompaniment Don t you girls play Jessica does
5480-41606-0033	train-other-500	chorused her friends Oh I never could play after hearing Eleanor said Jessica blushing Come on said Eleanor taking her by the arm and dragging her over to the piano You can accompany me What do you play
5480-41606-0034	train-other-500	Do you know Raff s Cavatina asked Jessica a trifle shyly By heart answered Eleanor I love it Wait and I ll get the music for you After a moment s search she produced the music picked up her violin
5480-41606-0035	train-other-500	and after tightening a string announced herself ready The girls listened spellbound It seemed as though Eleanor s very soul had entered into the violin They could not believe that this was the capricious Eleanor of half an hour before
none	none	 Whatever she may do in future 
5480-41606-0036	train-other-500	thought Grace as she listened to the last plaintive notes of the Cavatina I ll forgive her for her music s sake One has to make allowances for people like her It is the claim of the artistic temperament Please play once more
5480-41606-0037	train-other-500	begged Nora Then we must go It s almost six o clock Eleanor chose Nevin s Venetian Love Song and Jessica again accompanied her You play with considerable expression said Eleanor as Jessica rose from the piano stool
5480-41606-0038	train-other-500	How could I help it replied Jessica smiling You inspired me Eleanor accompanied the four girls down the walk to the gate and repeatedly invited them to come again It s your turn to come and see us now said Grace
5480-41606-0039	train-other-500	Do you think you will go to school to morrow Eleanor Miss Thompson dislikes having the girls stay out I can t help what Miss Thompson dislikes returned Eleanor laughing What I dislike is of more importance to me I dare say I shall go to morrow
5480-41606-0040	train-other-500	providing I get up in time What an irresponsible girl Eleanor is remarked Anne as they walked along I am afraid we can t do much for her She doesn t seem much interested in school and I don t think she is particularly impressed with our sorority
none	none	 Anne said Jessica you have seen Miss Nevin her aunt Tell us how she looks She is tall replied Anne and has beautiful dark eyes Her hair is very white but her face looks young 
5480-41606-0041	train-other-500	only she has the saddest expression I ever saw on any one s face I should think she would look sad after seventeen years of Eleanor s whims remarked Nora bluntly It would wear me out to be with her continually she is so changeable
5480-41606-0042	train-other-500	missus Gray told me remarked Anne
none	none	 that Miss Nevin s life had been one long sacrifice to the pleasure of others 
5480-41606-0043	train-other-500	First her father then her step sister and now Eleanor She was engaged to be married to a young English officer
none	none	 and he died of fever while stationed in India 
5480-41606-0044	train-other-500	So there is reason for her sad expression
none	none	 I once read somewhere said Jessica sentimentally 
5480-41606-0045	train-other-500	that Tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all Humph said Nora
none	none	 If I am ever foolish enough to fall in love I certainly don t want to lose the object of my devotion 
5480-41606-0046	train-other-500	You can t very well said Grace slyly
none	none	 for from all present indications I should say that he is too fat to get lost And Nora was obliged to explain elaborately to the laughing girls all the way home that the object of her future devotion would not be a fat man CHAPTER VII THE CLAIM OF THE ARTISTIC TEMPERAMENT When Eleanor returned to school the following morning she found that what Miss Thompson disliked was after all of considerable importance Directly after opening exercises the principal sent for her and asked the reason for her absence of the day before On finding that Eleanor had no plausible excuse but had absented herself merely because she felt like it Miss Thompson thereupon delivered a sharp little lecture on unnecessary absence informing Eleanor that it was the rule of the school to present a written excuse for absence and that a verbal excuse would not be accepted I will overlook it this time Miss Savell Miss Thompson said because you are not as yet thoroughly acquainted with the rules of this school but do not let it occur again And I must also insist upon punctuality in future You have been late a number of times With these words the principal turned to her desk and resumed the writing she had been engaged in when Eleanor entered For a second Eleanor stood regarding Miss Thompson with angry eyes No one had ever before dared to speak sharply to her She was about to tell the principal that she was not used to being addressed in that tone but the words would not come Something in the elder woman s quiet resolute face as she sat writing checked the wilful girl and though she felt deeply incensed at the reprimand she managed to control herself and walked out of the office with her head held high vowing to herself that Miss Thompson should pay for what Eleanor termed her insolence All morning she sulked through her classes and before closing time had managed to incur the displeasure of every teacher to whom she recited What ails her to day whispered Nora to Jessica It was geometry hour and Miss Ames the geometry teacher had just reproved Eleanor for inattention Nora shook her head She dared not answer as Miss Ames was very strict and she knew that to be caught whispering meant two originals to work out and Nora hated originals When the bell rang at the close of the hour Eleanor walked haughtily by Miss Ames giving her a contemptuous look as she passed that made the teacher tighten her lips and look severe Grace who was directly behind her saw both the look and the expression on the teacher s face She felt worried for Eleanor s sake because she saw trouble ahead for her unless she changed her tactics If Eleanor could only understand that she must respect the authority of her various teachers during recitation hours and cheerfully comply with their requests then all might be well Since Miss Leece had left the High School at the close of Grace s freshman year she could not conscientiously say that she disliked any of her teachers They had been both kind and just and if Eleanor defied them openly then she would have to take the consequences To be sure Eleanor might refuse to go to school but Grace had an idea that lenient as Miss Nevin was with her niece she would not allow Eleanor to go that far Grace decided that she would have a talk with Eleanor after school It would do no harm and it might possibly do some good She hurried down to the locker room that afternoon in order to catch Eleanor as she left school She had just reached there when Eleanor walked in looking extremely sulky She jerked her hat and coat from her locker hastily donned them and without looking at Grace left the room She looks awfully cross thought Grace Well here goes and she hurried after Eleanor overtaking her at the entrance to the school grounds What s the matter Eleanor she asked Didn t you care to wait for me Eleanor looked at her with lowering brows I hate school she said vehemently I hate the teachers and I hate Miss Thompson most of all Every one of those teachers are common low bred and impertinent As for your Miss Thompson she is a self satisfied prig You must not say such things of Miss Thompson Eleanor said Grace firmly She doesn t deserve them She is one of the finest women I have ever known and she takes a warm interest in every girl in school What has she done that you should speak of her as you do She called me into her office this morning and made a whole lot of fuss because I didn t have a written excuse for yesterday s absence said Eleanor angrily When I told her that I stayed at home because I felt inclined to do so she almost had a spasm and gave me another lecture then and there ending up by saying that it must not occur again I should like to know how she knew I was absent yesterday Miss Thompson always knows when a girl is absent replied Grace The special teachers report to her every day It is the rule of this school for a girl to present her excuse at the office as soon as she returns then her name is taken off the absent list If she is absent the second day then a messenger is sent to her home to find out the cause I suppose that when Miss Thompson looked over the list she remembered seeing you at opening exercises so of course sent for you She is a crabbed old maid said Eleanor contemptuously and I despise her I ll find some way to get even with her and all the rest of those teachers too You will never get along in school Eleanor answered Grace gently if you take that stand The only way to be happy is to Please don t preach to me said Eleanor haughtily It is of no use I am not a child and I understand my own business thoroughly When I saw you girls the first day of school I thought that you were full of life and spirit but really you are all goody goodies who allow those teachers to lead you around by the nose I had intended to ask Aunt Margaret to take me out of this ridiculous school for some of the people in it make me tired but I have changed my mind I shall stay for pure spite and show that stiff necked principal of yours that I am a law unto myself and won t stand her interference Stop a moment Eleanor I am going no farther with you said Grace flushing but I should just like to say before I leave you that you are taking the wrong view of things and you ll find it out sooner or later I am sorry that you have such a poor opinion of myself and my friends for we cherish nothing but the friendliest feelings toward you With this Grace walked away feeling more hurt over Eleanor s rudeness than she cared to show As she turned out of High School Street she heard a familiar call and glancing up the street saw her three chums waiting for her on the corner We saw you just as you tackled Eleanor said Nora so we kept away for we thought after to day s performances she wouldn t be in a very good humor What was the matter with her to day asked Jessica curiously She behaved like a bad child in English this morning followed it up in geometry and Anne says that in rhetoric class Miss Chester lost all patience with her and gave her a severe lecturing I might as well tell you at once that Eleanor s opinion of us is far from flattering said Grace half laughing although there was a hurt look on her face She says we are all goody goodies and that we make her tired She also requested me to mind my own business She said that to you Just wait until the next time I see her blustered Nora I ll tell her what I think of her On the contrary we must treat her better if anything than before said Anne quietly Don t you remember we promised missus Gray that we would try to help her Yes I remember all that but I can t bear to have any one say horrid things to Grace grumbled Nora What a queer girl she is said Jessica Yesterday she treated us as though we were her dearest friends while to day she scorns us utterly It s a case of blow hot blow cold That is because she has the artistic temperament replied Anne smiling You may say what you like about the artistic temperament said Nora but in my opinion it s nothing more nor less than just plain temper CHAPTER VIII ELEANOR THROWS DOWN THE GAUNTLET The Phi Sigma Tau is to have a special meeting to night at Jessica s called Grace Harlowe to Nora O Malley as the latter entered the locker room at the close of school one day about two weeks after the initiation at Jessica s Does Jessica know it inquired Nora Not yet replied Grace but she will as soon as she comes in I rushed down here the minute the last bell rang because I wanted to be here when the girls come in You are the first however Why are we to hold a meeting asked Nora her curiosity aroused Wait and see replied Grace smiling Of what use is it to hold a meeting if I tell you all the business beforehand All right said Nora you keep your secrets and I ll keep mine What have you heard that s new asked Grace Wait and see replied Nora with a grin of delight I am saving my news for the meeting By this time the remaining members of the Phi Sigma Tau with the exception of Eleanor Savell had come into the locker room and had been promptly hailed by Grace Marian Barber Miriam Nesbit and Eva Allen after agreeing to be at Jessica s at eight o clock had gone their separate ways Every one excepting Eleanor has been told said Grace I really don t know how to approach her She has been so distant of late Don t wait to ask her said Nora decidedly She won t attend the meeting How do you know asked Jessica I ll tell you to night answered Nora mysteriously but I know positively that she won t come because she is going to have company at Heartsease Now I ve told you more than I intended to and I shall not say another word until to night Come on then said Grace we won t wait any longer Jessica will you ask your father if he will be at liberty for a few minutes this evening Certainly replied Jessica Oh I know now whom it s all about cried Nora gleefully Mary Stevens You have guessed it said Grace but like yourself I decline to talk until to night Before eight o clock the seven girls had taken possession of the Bright s big comfortable sitting room and were impatiently waiting for Grace to tell her news Before I tell you what is on my mind said Grace we ought to have a president vice president and secretary for this worthy organization I move therefore that we choose Miriam Nesbit for president of this sorority Those in favor say aye We ll dispense with seconding the motion There was an instant s pause then a chorus of ayes burst forth Contrary no The only no was from Miriam We appreciate the fact that you are too polite to vote for yourself Miriam said Grace but your no doesn t amount to a row of pins You re elected so come over here and occupy the chair of state Long live the president of the Phi Sigma Tau Miriam flushed with pleasure then took the seat that Grace had vacated She had not expected this honor and was deeply touched by it Her summer with her girl chums at Lake George had made her an entirely different girl from the Miriam of old Admiration for Grace and her friends had taken the place of the old animosity Although the chums had not taken her into their inner circle still they made much of her and she came nearer to being one of them than any other girl in the junior class I am sure I thank you all began Miriam and now we must have a vice president and a secretary Grace and Anne were elected with enthusiasm to the respective offices then Miriam requested Grace to tell the other members what was on her mind After addressing the chair Grace began I know you will all be glad to hear that Mabel has received a letter from Mary Stevens It was addressed to me on the outside envelope and Mabel has given me permission to open and read it to you She is willing for us to do whatever we think best I won t attempt to read all the letter only that part that interests us Here it is I am so sorry about the way in which you are treated but glad to know that you have found friends at last Miss Brant has no claim on you whatever She took you from the orphanage with the understanding that if you did not suit her she was to be allowed to send you back The matron asked her why she did not adopt you or at least appoint herself your guardian and she said that under no circumstances would she do so that she wanted a good maid of all work not a daughter I enclose a statement from the matron to this effect I would have advised you before this to leave her but you are too young to drift about the world alone I hope that when I next hear from you you will be in happier surroundings I have always believed that your parents were people of means and that you were lost or stolen when a baby Perhaps if they are still living you will find them some day That is about all we need said Grace as she folded the letter and put it back in the envelope The next thing to do is to see mister Bright I ll go for him at once said Jessica and darted off to the library where her father sat reading He rose and tucking his daughter s arm in his walked out to the sitting room where the Phi Sigma Tau eagerly awaited him Well well he exclaimed smiling at the circle of girls What s all this Am I invited to be present at a suffragette s meeting or is Jessica simply anxious to show me what nice friends she has No compliments allowed laughed Grace We wish to ask your advice about something I am at your service said Jessica s father making her an elaborate bow Command me as you will Tis well most reverend sir I thank you said Grace with a curtsy Now sit you down I pray for presently I have a tale to tell Having conducted mister Bright with great ceremony to the arm chair in the corner Grace established him with many low bows much to the amusement of the girls with whom Jessica s father was a great favorite Then Grace began with her meeting with Mabel Allison and ended with the letter from Mary Stevens enclosing the matron s statement Now those are all the facts of the case mister Bright she concluded Will it be possible for us to get Mabel away from Miss Brant or can Miss Brant hold her against her will Miss Stevens letter and the matron s statement are sufficient answered mister Bright This woman cannot hold your little friend Miss Brant will in all probability be very angry and attempt to brave the matter out Suppose you and Jessica and I go down there together Grace and see what we can do O mister Bright cried Grace clasping her hands delightedly will you truly Then let s go to morrow and bring Mabel back with us Very well you and Jessica meet me at my office at four o clock to morrow afternoon said mister Bright But what do you girls intend to do with her once you get her You can t adopt her you know She is to take turns living with us papa said Jessica slipping her hand into her father s May she come here first I d love to have her mister Bright drew Jessica to his side My dear child you know that you may do as you please about it I feel sure that she must be the right sort of girl or you and your friends wouldn t have become interested in her Try her and if you like her then she is welcome to stay as long as she chooses I think it would do you good to have a girl of your own age in the house Three cheers for mister Bright cried Nora The cheers were given with a will then the girls joined hands and danced around Jessica s father sounding their class yell until he broke through the circle and made a rush for the library his fingers to his ears Now that we have that question settled said Miriam Nesbit after the girls were once more seated I think we ought to have a sorority pin I think began Eva Allen that my brother would design a pin for us He is very clever at that sort of thing Let s have a monogram exclaimed Grace Old English letters of gold on a dull green enamel background We can get them up for about two dollars and a half apiece Is that too expensive The girls who with the exception of Anne had small allowances of their own expressed themselves satisfied while Anne determined that for once she was justified in yielding to wild extravagance That s settled said Miriam The next thing to do is But a loud ring of the door bell interrupted her speech and caused the whole party to start Some one to see papa said Jessica Go on with what you were saying Miriam But before Miriam had a chance to continue the maid entered the room a letter in her hand Here s a letter Miss Jessica she said But it s such a quare name on the outside I be wondering if it s fur yerself and no other Jessica looked at the envelope It was addressed to the Phi Sigma Tau care of Miss Jessica Bright Why who in the world can this be from I thought no one outside knew the name of our society as yet said Jessica as she opened the end of the envelope Then she turned the page glanced at the signature and gave a little cry of surprise Just listen to this girls she exclaimed and read TO THE PHI SIGMA TAU After initiating me into your ridiculous society you have seen fit to call a meeting of the members without directly notifying me therefore I wish to withdraw from your sorority as I feel that I have been deeply insulted I have this satisfaction however that I would not have met with you to night at any rate I am entertaining some girls in your class this evening whom I find far more congenial than any previous acquaintances I have made in Oakdale We are about to organize a sorority of our own Our object will be to enjoy ourselves not to continually preach to other people I am deeply disappointed in all of you and assure you that I am not in the least desirous of continuing your acquaintance Yours sincerely ELEANOR SAVELL Well of all things exclaimed Nora O Malley She says she is deeply insulted because we didn t invite her but that she didn t intend to come at any rate There s a shining example of consistency for you Who on earth told her about the meeting said Jessica We didn t wait to ask her to day I shall have to confess that I am the guilty one said Eva Allen You didn t say anything to Miriam Marian and me about Eleanor and when I left the locker room I went back upstairs after a book I had forgotten I met Eleanor on the stairs and told her about the meeting and that you were waiting in the locker room for her You must have left before she got there and of course she thought you did it purposely Oh dear what a mess sighed Grace I didn t mean to slight her But Nora said she knew positively that Eleanor was entertaining some guests to night so I didn t wait By the way Nora what was that news of yours that you were so mysterious about this afternoon Just this replied Nora That Edna Wright told me that I needn t think we were the only people that could have a sorority I asked her what she meant and she said that she and Rose Lynton and Daisy Culver had been invited out to Eleanor s to night for the purpose of forming a very select club of their own I am sorry I didn t tell you while in the locker room but you would insist on having secrets so I thought I d have one too Well it can t be helped now said Grace It is a pity that Eleanor has taken up with Edna Wright She is the only girl in the class that I really dislike She is frivolous and empty headed and Eleanor is self willed and lawless Put them together and they will make a bad combination As to the other two girls they are sworn friends of Edna s I think said Nora that our reform movement is about to end in a glaring fizzle How can we reform a person who won t have anything to do with us asked Jessica scornfully Let us hold her place in this sorority open for her and let us make it our business to be ready to help her if she needs us said Anne thoughtfully Like all spoiled children she is sure to get into mischief and just as sure to come to grief Mark my words some day she ll be glad to come back to the Phi Sigma Tau CHAPTER IX THE RESCUE PARTY It was with mingled feelings of excitement and trepidation that Grace Harlowe and Jessica Bright hurried toward the office of the latter s father the following afternoon Now that they were fairly started on their mission of rescue they were not quite so confident as to the result To be sure they had unlimited faith in Jessica s father but it was so much easier to talk about taking Mabel away from Miss Brant than to do it I m terribly afraid of facing her confided Jessica to Grace She is the terror of Oakdale you know She can t hurt us said Grace Your father will do all the talking All we need to do is to take charge of Mabel after Miss Brant gives her up Well young ladies said mister Bright as the two girls entered his office I see you are prompt in keeping your appointment Let us go at once for I must be back here at five o clock What are you going to say to that terrible woman papa shuddered Jessica as they neared the Brant home I m afraid she ll scratch your eyes out Am I really in such serious danger asked mister Bright in mock alarm I am glad I brought you girls along to protect me 
4742-41609-0000	train-other-500	You haven t any idea what a crank she is mister Bright laughed Grace
none	none	 She fairly snarled at us the other day when we were coming from school 
4742-41609-0001	train-other-500	because she said we were taking up the whole sidewalk Poor little Mabel no wonder she has a scared look in her eyes all the time Well here we are responded mister Bright as he rang the bell Now for the tug of war
4742-41609-0002	train-other-500	As he spoke the door was opened by Mabel who positively shook in her shoes when she saw her visitors Don t be frightened whispered Grace taking her hand We have come for you
4742-41609-0003	train-other-500	May I speak with Miss Brant asked mister Bright courteously as they stepped into the narrow hall Before Mabel had time to answer
none	none	 a tall raw boned woman with a hard forbidding face 
4742-41609-0004	train-other-500	shoved her aside and confronted them It was Miss Brant herself Well what do you want
none	none	 she said rudely 
4742-41609-0005	train-other-500	Good afternoon said mister Bright courteously Am I speaking to Miss Brant
none	none	 I guess likely you are responded the woman 
4742-41609-0006	train-other-500	and you better state your business now for I ve no time to fool away on strangers You have a young girl with you by the name of Mabel Allison
none	none	 have you not 
4742-41609-0007	train-other-500	asked mister Bright Yes I have What s the matter with her Has she been gettin into mischief If she has I ll tan her hide said Miss Brant with a threatening gesture
4742-41609-0008	train-other-500	On the contrary replied mister Bright I hear very good reports of her Has she lived with you long
none	none	 That s none of your business snapped Miss Brant 
4742-41609-0009	train-other-500	If you ve come here to quiz me and pry around about her you can get right out for I m not answering any fool questions I will not trouble you with further questions replied mister Bright
4742-41609-0010	train-other-500	but will proceed at once to business I have come to take Miss Mabel away with me She has found friends who are willing to help her until she finishes her education and she wishes to go to them
none	none	 Oh she does does she sneered the woman mockingly 
4742-41609-0011	train-other-500	Well you just take her if you dare Have you legally adopted her asked mister Bright quietly That s none of your business either
none	none	 You get out of my house or I ll throw you out 
4742-41609-0012	train-other-500	and these two snips of girls with you almost screamed Miss Brant That will do said mister Bright sternly We will go but we shall take Miss Mabel with us
4742-41609-0013	train-other-500	I am a lawyer Miss Brant and I have positive proof that this child is not bound to you in any way You took her from the orphanage on trial exactly as you might hire a servant
4742-41609-0014	train-other-500	You did not even take the trouble to have yourself appointed her guardian You agreed to pay her for her work but blows and harsh words are the only payment
none	none	 she has ever received at your hands She wishes to leave you because she can no longer endure life with you You haven t the slightest claim upon her and she is perfectly free to do as she chooses She is not of age yet but as you are not her guardian you had no right to take money that she has earned from her 
4742-41609-0015	train-other-500	and she can call you to account for it if she chooses However you have imposed upon her for the last time
none	none	 for she shall not spend another hour under your roof 
4742-41609-0016	train-other-500	You touch her if you dare She shan t leave this house said the woman in a furious tone
none	none	 Mabel said mister Bright to the young girl who was cowering at one end of the hall get your things and come at once We will wait for you 
4742-41609-0017	train-other-500	As for you turning to Miss Brant if you try to stop her you will soon find yourself in a most unpleasant position
none	none	 I am certain that if you think back for an instant you will realize that you have forfeited all right to object For a moment Miss Brant stood speechless with anger then in her wrath she poured forth such a flood of abuse 
4742-41609-0018	train-other-500	that the rescue party stared in amazement Never had they seen such an exhibition of temper When Mabel appeared her shabby hat in her hand
none	none	 Miss Brant reached forward and tore the hat from her 
4742-41609-0019	train-other-500	Don t you dare leave my house with any of my property you baggage she hissed
none	none	 I paid for that hat and for the clothes you re wearing and you ll send every stitch you ve on back to me or I ll have you arrested for stealing Illustration Don t You Dare Leave This House With My Property Come on Mabel said Grace putting her arm around the shrinking little figure Don t pay any attention to her She isn t worth bothering over You can send her back her ridiculous things You are going to be happy now and forget all about this cruel terrible woman You brazen imp you screamed the woman and rushed at Grace who stood perfectly still looking the angry woman in the face with such open scorn in her gray eyes that Miss Brant drew back and stood scowling at her her hands working convulsively Come girls said mister Bright We have no more time to waste If you have anything to say to me Miss Brant you can always find me at my office on East Main Street The clothing now worn by Miss Mabel will be returned to you in due season Good afternoon mister Bright bowing politely motioned to the three young girls to precede him and the party went quietly down the walk leaving Miss Brant in the open door shaking her fist and uttering dire threats As for Mabel she collapsed utterly crying as though her heart would break Grace and Jessica exerted every effort to quiet her sobs and after a little she looked up and smiling through her tears said brokenly I can t believe that it s all true 
4742-41609-0020	train-other-500	that I shall never have to go back there again I m afraid that it s all a dream and that I ll wake up and find her standing over me Can she get me again she said turning piteously to mister Bright
4742-41609-0021	train-other-500	My dear little girl he said taking her hand she can t touch you I ll adopt you myself before I ll let you go back to her
none	none	 Now run along with Jessica and forget all about what has passed 
4742-41609-0022	train-other-500	Good bye Grace You see your rescue party proved a success Good bye daughter Take good care of Mabel
none	none	 I ll have to hurry now or miss my appointment mister Bright beamed on the three girls raised his hat and hurried down the street leaving them to proceed 
4742-41609-0023	train-other-500	slowly toward Jessica s home
none	none	 Passersby glanced curiously at the hatless shabby young girl 
4742-41609-0024	train-other-500	as she walked between Grace and Jessica clinging to their hands as though expecting every minute to be snatched from them Well girls said Grace here is my street I must leave you now Be good children and
4742-41609-0025	train-other-500	She was interrupted by an exultant shriek and a second later five girls appeared as by magic and gleefully surrounded the rescue party
none	none	 The Phi Sigma Tau was out in full force 
4742-41609-0026	train-other-500	Hurrah shrieked Nora waving her school bag We have met the enemy and they are ours Tell us about it quickly
none	none	 Why didn t you let me go along I was dying to cross swords with that old stone face 
4742-41609-0027	train-other-500	Then everyone talked at once surrounding Mabel and asking her questions until Grace said laughing Stop it girls let her get used to you gradually Don t come down on her like an avalanche
4742-41609-0028	train-other-500	Mabel however was equal to the occasion She answered their questions without embarrassment and seemed quietly pleased at their demonstrations
none	none	 You are the child of the sorority now Mabel 
4742-41609-0029	train-other-500	said Miriam Nesbit and we are your adopted mothers You will have your hands full trying to please all of us
none	none	 Stop teasing her said Anne or she ll run away before she is fairly adopted It is very uncertain as to whether she will ever go further than my house 
4742-41609-0030	train-other-500	said Jessica calmly I need Mabel more than
none	none	 do the rest of you 
4742-41609-0031	train-other-500	but perhaps if you re good I ll loan her to you occasionally Come on Mabel let s go home before they spoil you completely
none	none	 Considering the fact that the Bright family did two thirds of the rescuing 
4742-41609-0032	train-other-500	I suppose we shall have to respect your claim
none	none	 said Nora but remember Jessica that generosity is a beautiful virtue to cultivate CHAPTER X JULIA PERFORMS A SACRED DUTY
6054_41610_000003_000000	train-clean-360	 What have we ever done that we should be so neglected said David Nesbit swinging himself from his motorcycle and landing squarely in front of Grace Harlowe and Anne Pierson while they were out walking one afternoon 
6054_41610_000004_000000	train-clean-360	 Why David Nesbit how can you make such statements replied Grace looking at the young man in mock disapproval 
6054_41610_000004_000001	train-clean-360	 You know perfectly well that you ve been shut up in your old laboratory all fall 
6054_41610_000004_000002	train-clean-360	We have scarcely seen you since the walking party 
none	none	You have even given football the go by and I m so sorry for you were a star player last year I see you have discovered the secrets of my past life replied David laughing
6054_41610_000005_000001	train-clean-360	 That s what comes of having a sister who belongs to a sorority 
6054_41610_000005_000002	train-clean-360	However you folks are equally guilty you ve all gone mad over your sorority and left Hippy and Reddy and me to wander about Oakdale like lost souls 
6054_41610_000005_000003	train-clean-360	I hear you ve adopted a girl too 
6054_41610_000005_000004	train-clean-360	Reddy is horribly jealous of her 
6054_41610_000005_000005	train-clean-360	He says Jessica won t look at him any more 
6054_41610_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 Reddy is laboring under a false impression said Anne 
6054_41610_000006_000001	train-clean-360	 He is head over heels in football practice and has forgotten he ever knew Jessica As for Hippy Nora says that he is studying night and day and that he is actually wearing himself away by burning midnight oil 
6054_41610_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes Hippy is studying some this year replied David 
none	none	You see this is our senior year and we are going to enter the same college next year if all goes well 
6054_41610_000007_000002	train-clean-360	You know Hippy never bothered himself much about study just managed to scrape through 
6054_41610_000007_000003	train-clean-360	But now he ll have to hustle if he gets through with High School this year and he s wide awake to that fact 
none	none	Under those circumstances Hippy is forgiven but not you and Reddy said Grace severely
6054_41610_000008_000001	train-clean-360	 You ll have to have better excuses than football and experiments 
6054_41610_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 I ll tell you what we ll do to square ourselves said David smiling We ll take you girls to the football game next Thursday 
none	none	It s Thanksgiving Day you know and Oakdale is going to play Georgetown College 
6054_41610_000009_000002	train-clean-360	Reddy s on the team but Hippy and I will do the honors 
6054_41610_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 Fine replied Grace 
6054_41610_000010_000001	train-clean-360	 But are you willing to burden yourselves with some extra girls 
6054_41610_000010_000002	train-clean-360	You see it s this way 
6054_41610_000010_000003	train-clean-360	One of the things that our sorority has pledged itself to do this year is to look up the stray girls in High School and see that they are not lonely and homesick during holiday seasons 
none	none	I used to know nearly all the girls in school but ever so many new ones have crept in and some of them have come here from quite a distance on account of the excellence of our High School After we adopted Mabel Allison we began looking about us for other fish to fry and found out about these girls So every girl in the sorority has invited one or more of these lonely ones for Thanksgiving Day They are to come in the morning and stay until the lights go out which will be late for mother has consented to let me have a party and all those new girls are to be the guests of honor missus Gray is in it too She insists on having Anne with her on Thanksgiving although Anne had invited two girls to her house continued Grace
6054_41610_000011_000002	train-clean-360	 missus Gray had planned a party for us but when we told her what we were about to do she gave up her party and agreed to go to mine instead on condition that Anne s family plus Anne s two guests should have dinner with her 
6054_41610_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 Bless her dear heart said David she is always thinking of the pleasure of others 
6054_41610_000012_000001	train-clean-360	Now about the football game 
6054_41610_000012_000002	train-clean-360	Bring your girls along and I ll do my best to give them a good time although I m generally anything but a success with new girls 
6054_41610_000012_000003	train-clean-360	However Hippy makes up for what I lack 
6054_41610_000012_000004	train-clean-360	He can entertain a regiment of them and not even exert himself Now I must leave you for I have a very important engagement at home 
6054_41610_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 In the laboratory I suppose said Anne teasingly 
6054_41610_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 Just so replied David 
6054_41610_000014_000001	train-clean-360	 Good bye girls 
6054_41610_000014_000002	train-clean-360	Let me know how many tickets you want for the game He raised his cap mounted his machine and was off down the street 
none	none	It will seem good to have a frolic with the boys again won t it said Grace to Anne as they strolled along
6054_41610_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 We do seem to be getting awfully serious and settled of late replied Anne 
none	none	Why this sorority business has taken up all our spare time lately 
6054_41610_000016_000002	train-clean-360	We ve had so many special meetings 
none	none	I know it replied Grace but after Thanksgiving we ll only meet once in two weeks for I must get my basketball team in shape and you see all the members belong to the society You ought to do extra good work this year observed Anne for the team is absolutely harmonious 
6054_41610_000018_000001	train-clean-360	Last season seems like a dream to me now 
none	none	It was real enough then replied Grace grimly
6054_41610_000019_000001	train-clean-360	 I have forgiven long ago but I have not forgotten the way some of those girls performed last year 
6054_41610_000019_000002	train-clean-360	It was remarkable that things ever straightened themselves 
none	none	The clouds looked black for a while didn t they 
6054_41610_000020_000000	train-clean-360	Anne pressed Grace s hand by way of answer 
6054_41610_000020_000001	train-clean-360	The sophomore year had been crowded with many trials some of them positive school tragedies in which Anne and Grace had been the principal actors 
6054_41610_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 What are you two mooning over asked a gay voice and the two girls turned with a start to find Julia Crosby grinning cheerfully at them 
6054_41610_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 O Julia how glad I am to see you at close range exclaimed Grace Admiring you from a distance isn t a bit satisfactory 
none	none	Business children business said Julia briskly
6054_41610_000023_000001	train-clean-360	 That s the only thing that keeps me from your side 
6054_41610_000023_000002	train-clean-360	The duties of the class president are many and irksome 
6054_41610_000023_000003	train-clean-360	At the present moment I ve a duty on hand that I don t in the least relish and I want your august assistance 
none	none	Will you promise to help before I tell you
6054_41610_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 Why of course answered Grace and Anne in the same breath 
6054_41610_000024_000001	train-clean-360	 What is it you want us to do 
6054_41610_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 Well it seems that some of your juniors are still in need of discipline 
6054_41610_000025_000001	train-clean-360	You remember the hatchet that we buried last year with such pomp and ceremony 
6054_41610_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes yes was the answer 
6054_41610_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 This morning I overheard certain girls planning to go out to the Omnibus House after school to morrow and dig up the poor hatchet and flaunt it in the seniors faces the day of the opening basketball game simply to rattle us 
6054_41610_000027_000001	train-clean-360	Just as though it wouldn t upset your team as much as ours 
6054_41610_000027_000002	train-clean-360	It s an idiotic trick at any rate and anything but funny 
6054_41610_000027_000003	train-clean-360	Now I propose to take four of our class and you must select four of yours We ll hustle out there the minute school is over to morrow and be ready to receive the marauders when they arrive 
6054_41610_000027_000004	train-clean-360	Select your girls but don t tell them what you want or they may tell some one about it beforehand 
none	none	Well of all impudence exclaimed Anne
6054_41610_000028_000001	train-clean-360	 Who are the girls Julia 
6054_41610_000028_000002	train-clean-360	Are you sure they re juniors 
6054_41610_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 The two I heard talking are juniors 
none	none	I don t know who else is in it They ll be very much astonished to find us waiting at the church Omnibus House I mean said Julia and I imagine they ll feel rather silly too
6054_41610_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 Tell us who they are Julia said Grace 
6054_41610_000030_000001	train-clean-360	 We don t want to go into this blindfolded 
6054_41610_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 Wait and see replied Julia tantalizingly 
6054_41610_000031_000001	train-clean-360	 Then you ll feel more indignant and can help my cause along all the better 
6054_41610_000031_000002	train-clean-360	I give you my word that the girls I overheard talking are not particular friends of yours You aren t going to back out are you and leave me without proper support 
6054_41610_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 Of course not laughed Grace 
6054_41610_000032_000001	train-clean-360	 Don t worry 
6054_41610_000032_000002	train-clean-360	We ll support you only you must agree to do all the talking 
6054_41610_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 I shall endeavor to overcome their insane freshness with a few well chosen words Julia promised 
6054_41610_000033_000001	train-clean-360	 Be sure and be on hand early 
6054_41610_000034_000000	train-clean-360	Grace chose Anne Nora Jessica and Marian Barber the latter three being considerably mystified at her request but nevertheless agreeing to be on hand when school closed 
6054_41610_000034_000001	train-clean-360	They were met at the gate by Julia and four other seniors and the whole party set out for the Omnibus House without delay 
6054_41610_000035_000000	train-clean-360	Grace walked with Julia and the two girls found plenty to say to each other during the walk 
6054_41610_000035_000001	train-clean-360	Julia was studying hard she told Grace 
6054_41610_000035_000002	train-clean-360	She wanted to enter Smith next year 
6054_41610_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t know where I shall go after I finish High School said Grace Ethel Post wants me to go to Wellesley 
6054_41610_000036_000001	train-clean-360	She ll be a junior when I m a freshman 
none	none	You know she was graduated from High School last June and she could help me a lot in getting used to college 
6054_41610_000036_000003	train-clean-360	But I don t know whether I should like Wellesley 
6054_41610_000036_000004	train-clean-360	I shall not try to decide where I want to go for a while yet 
6054_41610_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 Wherever we are we ll write and always be friends said Julia and Grace warmly acquiesced 
6054_41610_000038_000000	train-clean-360	As they neared the old Omnibus House they could see no one about 
6054_41610_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 We re early exclaimed Julia 
6054_41610_000039_000001	train-clean-360	 The enemy has not arrived 
6054_41610_000039_000002	train-clean-360	Thank goodness it s not cold to day or we might have a chilly vigil 
6054_41610_000039_000003	train-clean-360	Now listen all ye faithful while I set forth the object of this walk She thereupon related what Grace and Anne already knew 
none	none	What a shame cried Marian Barber
5561_41615_000011_000001	train-clean-100	 It isn t 
6054_41610_000040_000001	train-clean-360	 It isn t the hatchet we care for it s the principle of the thing 
6054_41610_000040_000002	train-clean-360	Give them what they deserve Julia 
6054_41610_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 Never fear replied Julia 
6054_41610_000041_000001	train-clean-360	 I ll effectually attend to their case 
6054_41610_000041_000002	train-clean-360	Now we d better dodge around the corner and keep out of sight until they get here 
6054_41610_000041_000003	train-clean-360	Then we ll swoop down upon them unawares 
none	none	The avengers hurriedly concealed themselves at the side of the old house where they could not be seen by an approaching party 
6054_41610_000043_000000	train-clean-360	They had not waited long before they heard voices 
6054_41610_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 They re coming whispered Julia 
6054_41610_000044_000001	train-clean-360	 There are eight of them 
6054_41610_000044_000002	train-clean-360	Form in line and when they get nicely started we ll circle about them and hem them in 
none	none	I ll give you the signal 
6054_41610_000045_000000	train-clean-360	The girls waited in silence 
6054_41610_000045_000001	train-clean-360	 They have trowels Julia informed them from time to time 
6054_41610_000045_000002	train-clean-360	 They have a spade 
6054_41610_000045_000003	train-clean-360	They ve begun to dig and they are having their own troubles for the ground is hard 
none	none	All ready March 
6054_41610_000046_000000	train-clean-360	Softly the procession approached the spot where the marauders were energetically digging 
none	none	Grace gave a little gasp and reaching back caught Anne s hand 
6054_41610_000047_000000	train-clean-360	The girl using the spade was Eleanor 
6054_41610_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 Now I m in for it groaned Grace 
6054_41610_000048_000001	train-clean-360	 She s down on me now and she ll be sure to think I organized the whole thing For an instant Grace regretted making the promise to Julia before learning the situation then holding her head a trifle more erect she decided to make the best of her unfortunate predicament 
6054_41610_000049_000000	train-clean-360	 It isn t Julia s fault she thought 
6054_41610_000049_000001	train-clean-360	 She probably knows nothing about our acquaintance with Eleanor besides Eleanor has no business to play such tricks 
6054_41610_000049_000002	train-clean-360	Edna Wright must have told her all about last year 
6054_41610_000050_000000	train-clean-360	Her reflections were cut short for one of the girls glanced up from her digging with a sudden exclamation which drew all eyes toward Julia and her party 
6054_41610_000051_000000	train-clean-360	 Well little folks said Julia in mock surprise what sort of a party is this 
none	none	Are you making mud pies or are you pretending you are at the seashore 
6054_41610_000052_000000	train-clean-360	At Julia s first words Eleanor dropped the small spade she held and straightened up the picture of defiance 
none	none	Her glance traveled from girl to girl and she curled her lip contemptuously as her eye rested on Grace and Anne 
6054_41610_000052_000002	train-clean-360	The other diggers looked sheepishly at Julia who stood eyeing them in a way that made them feel too foolish for anything as one of them afterwards expressed it 
6054_41610_000053_000000	train-clean-360	 Why don t you answer me little girls asked Julia 
none	none	Has the kitty stolen your tongue 
6054_41610_000054_000000	train-clean-360	This was too much for Eleanor 
6054_41610_000055_000000	train-clean-360	 How dare you speak to us in that manner and treat us as though we were children she burst forth 
6054_41610_000055_000001	train-clean-360	 What business is it of yours why we are here 
none	none	Do you own this property Mercy no replied Julia composedly Do you
6054_41610_000057_000000	train-clean-360	 No replied Eleanor a trifle less rudely but we have as much right here as you have 
6054_41610_000058_000000	train-clean-360	 Granted replied Julia calmly 
6054_41610_000058_000001	train-clean-360	 However there is this difference You are here to make mischief and we are here to prevent it and furthermore are going to do so 
none	none	What do you mean retorted Eleanor her eyes flashing
6054_41610_000060_000000	train-clean-360	 Just this replied Julia 
6054_41610_000060_000001	train-clean-360	 Last year the girls belonging to the present senior and junior classes met on this very spot and amicably disposed of a two year old class grudge 
6054_41610_000060_000002	train-clean-360	Emblematic of this they buried a hatchet once occupying a humble though honorable position in the Crosby family but cheerfully sacrificed for the good of the cause 
6054_41610_000061_000000	train-clean-360	 Yesterday continued Julia I overheard two juniors plotting to get possession of this same hatchet for the purpose of flaunting it in the faces of the seniors at the opening basketball game 
6054_41610_000061_000001	train-clean-360	Therefore I decided to take a hand in things and here I am backed by girls from both classes who are of the self same mind 
6054_41610_000062_000000	train-clean-360	 Really Miss Crosby said Edna Wright you are very amusing 
6054_41610_000063_000000	train-clean-360	 My friends all think so returned Julia sweetly but never mind now about my amusing qualities Edna 
6054_41610_000063_000001	train-clean-360	Let s talk about the present situation 
6054_41610_000064_000000	train-clean-360	She looked at Edna with the old time aggravating smile that was always warranted to further incense her opponent 
6054_41610_000064_000001	train-clean-360	It had its desired effect for Edna fairly bristled with indignation and was about to make a furious reply when she was pushed aside by Eleanor who said loftily Allow me to talk to this person Edna 
6054_41610_000065_000000	train-clean-360	 No said Julia resolutely every vestige of a smile leaving her face at Eleanor s words 
none	none	It would be useless for you to attempt to be spokesman in this matter because you are a new girl in High School and know nothing of past class matters except from hearsay 
6054_41610_000065_000002	train-clean-360	But you have with you seven girls who do know all about the enmity that was buried here last spring and who ought to have enough good sense to know that this afternoon s performance is liable to bring it to life again 
6054_41610_000066_000000	train-clean-360	 If you girls carry this hatchet to school and exhibit it to the seniors on the day of the game you are apt to start bad feeling all over again she said turning to the others 
none	none	There are sure to be some girls in the senior class who would resent it Neither class has played tricks on the other since peace was declared and we don t want to begin now
6054_41610_000067_000000	train-clean-360	 That s the reason I asked Grace to appoint a committee of juniors and come out here with me 
6054_41610_000067_000001	train-clean-360	I feel sure that under the circumstances the absent members of both classes would agree with us if they were present Digging up a rusty old hatchet is nothing but digging up a rusty old grudge is quite another matter 
6054_41610_000067_000002	train-clean-360	We didn t come here to quarrel but I appeal to you as members of the junior class to think before you do something that is bound to cause us all annoyance and perhaps unhappiness 
6054_41610_000068_000000	train-clean-360	There was complete silence after Julia finished speaking 
none	none	What she had said evidently impressed them 
6054_41610_000068_000002	train-clean-360	Eleanor alone looked belligerent 
6054_41610_000069_000000	train-clean-360	 Perhaps we d better let the old hatchet alone Daisy Culver said sullenly 
6054_41610_000069_000001	train-clean-360	 The fun is all spoiled now and everyone will know about it before school begins to morrow 
6054_41610_000070_000000	train-clean-360	 Daisy how can you say so exclaimed Grace who fearing a scene with Eleanor had hitherto remained silent 
6054_41610_000070_000001	train-clean-360	 You know perfectly well that none of us will say anything about it 
none	none	Why we came out here simply to try to prevent your doing something that might stir up trouble again between the senior and junior classes There isn t a girl here who would be so contemptible as to tell any one outside about what has happened to day 
6054_41610_000071_000000	train-clean-360	This was Eleanor s opportunity 
6054_41610_000071_000001	train-clean-360	Turning furiously on Grace her eyes flashing she exclaimed Yes there is one girl who would tell anything and that girl is you 
6054_41610_000071_000002	train-clean-360	You pretend to be honorable and high principled but you are nothing but a hypocrite and a sneak I would not trust you as far as I could see you 
none	none	I have no doubt Miss Crosby obtained her information about this affair to day from you and that everyone in school will hear it from the same source 
6054_41610_000071_000004	train-clean-360	You seem determined to meddle with matters that do not concern you and I warn you that if you do not change your tactics you may regret it 
6054_41610_000072_000000	train-clean-360	 You seem to think yourself the idol of your class but there are some of the girls who are too clever to be deceived 
6054_41610_000072_000001	train-clean-360	They do not belong among the number who trail tamely after you either 
6054_41610_000072_000002	train-clean-360	And now I wish to say that I despise you and all your friends and wish never to speak to any of you again 
none	none	Come on girls she said turning to the members of her party who had listened in silent amazement to her attack upon Grace Let us go 
6054_41610_000072_000004	train-clean-360	Let them keep their trumpery hatchet 
6054_41610_000073_000000	train-clean-360	With these words she turned and stalked across the field to the road where her runabout stood 
6054_41610_000073_000001	train-clean-360	After an instant s hesitation she was followed by Edna Daisy Culver and those who had come with her Henceforth there would again be two distinct factions in the junior class 
6054_41610_000074_000000	train-clean-360	 Good gracious exclaimed Julia Crosby 
none	none	Talk about your human whirlwinds 
6054_41610_000074_000002	train-clean-360	What on earth did you ever do to her Grace 
6054_41610_000075_000000	train-clean-360	But Grace could not answer 
6054_41610_000075_000001	train-clean-360	She was winking hard to keep back the tears Twice she attempted to speak and failed 
none	none	Never mind her dear said Julia slipping her arm about Grace while the other girls gathered round with many expressions of displeasure at Eleanor s cruel speech
6054_41610_000076_000000	train-clean-360	 I can t help feeling badly said Grace with a sob 
6054_41610_000076_000001	train-clean-360	 She said such dreadful things 
6054_41610_000077_000000	train-clean-360	 No one who knows you would believe them replied Julia 
6054_41610_000077_000001	train-clean-360	 By the way who is she 
none	none	I know her name is Savell and that she s a recent arrival in Oakdale but considering the plain and uncomplimentary manner in which she addressed you you must have seriously offended her ladyship
6054_41610_000078_000000	train-clean-360	 I ll tell you about her as we walk along replied Grace wiping her eyes and smiling a little 
none	none	Yes we had better be moving said Julia
6054_41610_000079_000001	train-clean-360	 The battle is over 
6054_41610_000079_000002	train-clean-360	No one has been killed and only one wounded 
none	none	Nevertheless the enemy has retired in confusion CHAPTER XI WORRIES AND PLANS Although the girls belonging to Julia s party were silent concerning what happened at the Omnibus House the story leaked out creating considerable discussion among the members of the two upper classes Julia Crosby had a shrewd suspicion that Edna Wright had been the original purveyor of the news and in this she was right Edna had under pledge of secrecy told it to a sophomore who immediately told it to her dearest friend and so the tale traveled until it reached Eleanor with numerous additions far from pleasing to her She was thoroughly angry and at once laid the matter at Grace s door while her animosity toward Grace grew daily But Grace was not the only person that Eleanor disliked From the day that Miss Thompson had taken her to task for absence she had entertained a supreme contempt for the principal of which Miss Thompson was wholly unaware until encountering Eleanor one morning in the corridor the latter had stared at her with an expression of such open scorn and dislike that Miss Thompson felt her color rise A direct slap in the face could scarcely have conveyed greater insult than did that one insolent glance The principal was at a loss as to its import She wisely decided to ignore it but stored it up in her memory for future reference The sorority that Eleanor had mentioned in her letter to the Phi Sigma Tau was now in full flower The seven girls who had accompanied her to the Omnibus House were the chosen members They wore pins in the shape of skulls and cross bones and went about making mysterious signs to each other whenever they met The very name of the society was shrouded in mystery though Nora O Malley was heard to declare that she had no doubt it was a branch of the Black Hand Eleanor was the acknowledged leader but Edna Wright became a close second and between them they managed to disseminate a spirit of mischief throughout the school that the teachers found hard to combat Grace Harlowe watched the trend that affairs were taking with considerable anxiety Like herself there were plenty of girls in school to whom mischief did not appeal but Eleanor s beauty wealth and fascinating personality were found to dazzle some of the girls who would follow her about like sheep and it was over these girls that Grace felt worried If Eleanor were to organize and carry out any malicious piece of mischief and they were implicated they would all have to suffer for what she would be directly responsible Grace s heart was with her class She wished it to be a class among classes and felt an almost motherly anxiety for its success What does ail some of our class she exclaimed to Anne and Nora one day as they left the school building They seem possessed with imps The Phi Sigma Tau girls and a few of the grinds are really the only ones who behave lately It s largely due to Eleanor I think replied Anne She seems to have become quite a power among some of the girls in the class She is helping to destroy that spirit of earnestness that you have tried so hard to cultivate 
587_41611_000009_000003	train-clean-100	I think it s a shame too 
none	none	The upper class girls ought to set the example for the two lower classes That s just what worries me said Grace earnestly Hardly a recitation passes in my class without some kind of disturbance and it is always traced to one of the girls in that crowd The juniors will get the reputation among the teachers this year that the junior class had last and it seems such a pity I overheard Miss Chester tell Miss Kane the other day that her junior classes were the most trying of the day because she had to work harder to maintain discipline than to teach her subject That s a nice reputation to carry around isn t it remarked Nora indignantly But all we can do is to try harder than ever to make things go smoothly I don t believe their society will last long at any rate Those girls are sure to quarrel among themselves and that will end the whole thing Or they may go too far and have Miss Thompson to reckon with and that would probably cool their ardor O girls exclaimed Grace Speaking of Miss Thompson reminds me that I have something to tell you What do you suppose the latest is If you know anything new it is your duty to tell us at once without making us beg for it said Nora reprovingly All right I accept the reproof said Grace Now for my news There is talk of giving a Shakespearian play with Miss Tebbs to engineer it and the cast to be chosen from the three lower classes The seniors of course will give their own play later How did you find out asked Anne Miss Thompson herself told me about it replied Grace She called on mother yesterday afternoon and for a wonder I was at home She said that it was not positively decided yet but if the girls did well with the mid year tests then directly after there would be a try out for parts and rehearsals would begin without delay How splendid exclaimed Anne clasping her hands How I would love to take part in it You will without doubt if there is a try out replied Grace There is no one in school who can recite as you do besides you have been on the stage I shall try awfully hard for a part even if it is only two lines said Anne earnestly I wonder what play is to be chosen and if it is to be given for the school only The play hasn t been decided upon yet replied Grace but the object of it is to get some money for new books for the school library The plan is to charge fifty cents a piece for the tickets and to give each girl a certain number of them to sell However I m not going to bother much about the play now for the senior team has just sent me a challenge to play them Saturday December twelfth So I ll have to get the team together and go to work We re awfully late this year about starting Don t you think so asked Nora Yes admitted Grace I am just as enthusiastic over basketball as ever only I haven t had the time to devote to it that I did last year Never mind you ll make up for lost time after Thanksgiving said Anne soothingly As for me I m going to dream about the play Anne I believe you have more love for the stage than you will admit said Grace laughing You are all taken up with the idea of this play If one could live in the same atmosphere as that of home then there could be no profession more delightful than that of the actor replied Anne thoughtfully It is wonderful to feel that one is able to forget one s self and become some one else But it is more wonderful to make one s audience feel it too To have them forget that one is anything except the living breathing person whose character one is trying to portray I suppose it s the sense of power that one has over people s emotions that makes acting so fascinating It is the other side that I hate she added with a slight shudder I suppose theatrical people do undergo many hardships said Grace who now that the subject had been opened wanted to hear more of Anne s views of the stage Unless any girl has remarkable talent I should advise her to keep off the stage said Anne decidedly Of course when a girl comes of a theatrical family for generations like Maud Adams or Ethel Barrymore then that is different She is practically born bred and brought up in the theatre She is as carefully guarded as though she lived in a little village simply because she knows from babyhood all the unpleasant features of the profession and how to avoid them There is some chance of her becoming great too Of course real stars do appear once in a while who are too talented to be kept down However the really great ones are few and far between When I compare my life before I came here with the good times I have had since I met you girls I hate the very idea of the stage Only she concluded with a shame faced air there are times when the desire to act is irresistible and it did make my heart beat a little bit faster when I heard about the play You dear little mouse said Grace putting her arm around Anne I was only jesting when I spoke about your love for the stage I think I understand how you feel and I hope you get the best part in the play I know you ll make good She certainly will said Nora But to give the play a rest and come down to everyday affairs where shall we meet to go to the football game Let me see said Grace The game is to be called at three o clock I suppose we shall all be through dinner by half past two You had better bring your girls to my house Each of you is to have two and Jessica has one besides Mabel I am to have three I found another yesterday 
587_41611_000031_000005	train-clean-100	David promised to get me the tickets 
none	none	I wonder how he and Hippy will enjoy chaperoning thirteen girls I won t have the slightest chance to talk to Hippy grumbled Nora and he has neglected us shamefully of late too Never mind you can have him all to yourself at my party consoled Grace By the way girls do you think it would be of any use to invite Eleanor
587_41611_000034_000000	train-clean-100	 Eleanor exclaimed Nora 
587_41611_000034_000001	train-clean-100	 After what she has said to you 
none	none	You might as well throw your invitation into the fire for it s safe to say that she will do so when she receives it Nevertheless Grace wrote a cordial little note to Eleanor that evening and two days later she received Eleanor s reply through the mail On opening the envelope the pieces of her own note fell out with a half sheet of paper containing the words Declined with thanks CHAPTER XII A RECKLESS CHAUFFEUR Thanksgiving Day dawned bright and clear with just enough frost in the air to make one s blood tingle It had been a mild fall with a late Indian summer and only one or two snow flurries that had lasted but a few hours This was unusual for Oakdale as winter generally came with a rush before the middle of November and treated the inhabitants of that northern city to a taste of zero weather long before the Christmas holidays It was with a light heart that Grace Harlowe ate her breakfast and flitted about the house putting a final touch here and there before receiving her guests Before eleven o clock everything was finished and as she arranged the last flower in its vase she felt a little thrill of pride as she looked about the pretty drawing room Before going upstairs to dress she ran into the reception hall for the fourth time to feast her eyes upon a huge bunch of tall chrysanthemums in the beautiful Japanese vase that stood in the alcove under the stairs They had come about an hour before with a note from Tom Gray saying that he had arrived in Oakdale that morning had seen the boys and would be around to help David and Reddy at the girl convention as he termed it Grace was overjoyed at the idea of seeing Tom Gray again They had been firm friends since her freshman year and had entertained a wholesome boy and girl preference for each other untinged by any trace of foolish sentimentality As she dressed for dinner Grace felt perfectly happy except for one thing She still smarted a little at Eleanor s rude reply to her invitation She was one of those tender hearted girls who disliked being on bad terms with any one and she really liked Eleanor still in spite of the fact that Eleanor did not in the least return the sentiment Grace sighed a little over the rebuff and then completely forgot her trouble as she donned the new gown that had just come from the dressmaker It was of Italian cloth in a beautiful shade of dark red made in one piece with a yoke of red and gold net and trimmed with tiny enameled buttons It fitted her straight slender figure perfectly and she decided that for once she had been wise in foregoing her favorite blue and choosing red The party that evening was to be a strictly informal affair Grace had suspected that the girls whom the members of the Phi Sigma Tau were to entertain were not likely to possess evening gowns In order to avoid any possibility of hurt feelings she had quietly requested those invited to wear the afternoon gowns in which they would appear at the game Before one o clock her guests had arrived They were three shy quiet girls who had worshiped Grace from a distance and who had been surprised almost to tears by her invitation Two of them were from Portville a small town about seventy miles from Oakdale and had begun High School with Grace who had been too busy with her own affairs up to the present to find out much about them The other girl Marie Bateman had entered the class that year She had come from a little village forty miles south of Oakdale was the oldest of a large family her mother being a widow of very small means As her mother was unable to send her away to school she had done clerical work for the only lawyer in the home town for the previous two years studying between whiles She had entered the High School in the junior class determining to graduate and then to work her way through Normal School By dint of questioning Grace had discovered that she lived in a shabby little room in the suburbs never went anywhere and did anything honest in the way of earning money that she could find to do The realization of what some of these girls were willing to endure for the sake of getting an education made Grace feel guilty at being so comfortably situated She determined that the holidays that year should not find them without friends and cheer After a rousing Thanksgiving dinner in which the inevitable turkey with all its toothsome accompaniments played a prominent part the girls retired to Grace s room for a final adjustment of hair and a last survey in the mirror before going to the game High School matters formed the principal theme of conversation and Grace was not surprised to learn that Eleanor had been carrying things with a high hand in third year French class in which Ellen Holt one of the Portville girls recited She speaks French as well as Professor La Roche said Miss Holt but she nearly drives him crazy sometimes She will pretend she doesn t understand him and will make him explain the construction of a sentence over and over again or she will argue with him about a point until he loses his temper completely She makes perfectly ridiculous caricatures of him and leaves them on his desk when class is over and she asks him to translate impertinent slang phrases which he does sometimes before he realizes how they are going to sound Then the whole class laughs at him She certainly makes things lively in that class The sound of the bell cut short the chat and the four girls hurried downstairs to greet Jessica Mabel and the girls who were the Bright s guests Nora and Anne with their charges came next and last of all David Tom and Hippy paraded up the walk in single file blowing lustily on tin horns and waving blue and white banners A brief season of introduction followed then Grace distributed blue and white rosettes with long streamers that she had made for the occasion to each member of the party Well supplied with Oakdale colors they set out for the football grounds where an immense crowd of people had gathered to see the big game of the season I shall never forget the first football game I saw in Oakdale said Anne to David as they made their way to the grandstand It ended very sensationally for me I should say it did replied David smiling Confidentially Anne do you ever hear from your father Not very often replied Anne He is not liable to trouble me again however because he knows that I will not go back to the stage no matter what he says He was with the western company of True Hearts last year but I don t know where he is now and I don t care Don t think I m unfeeling but it is impossible for me to care for him even though he is my father I understand said David sympathetically Now let s forget him and have a good time Hurrah Here comes the band shouted Hippy The Oakdale Military Band took their places in the improvised bandstand and began a short concert before the game with the Stars and Stripes while the spectators unconsciously kept time with their feet to the inspiring strains When the two teams appeared on the field there were shouts of enthusiasm from the friends of the players and the band burst forth with the High School song in which the students joined After the usual preliminaries the game began and for the next hour everything else was forgotten save the battle that waged between the two teams Miriam Nesbit Eva Allen and Marian Barber with their guests joined Grace s party and soon the place they occupied became the very center of enthusiasm Reddy who was playing left end on the home team received an ovation every time he made a move and when towards the end of the game he made a touchdown his friends nearly split their loyal throats in expressing their approval It was over at last and Oakdale had won a complete victory over the Georgetown foe who took their defeat with becoming grace As soon as Reddy could free himself from the grasp of his school fellows who would have borne him from the field in triumph if he had not stoutly resisted he hurried to his friends who showered him with congratulations O you Titian haired star cried Hippy clasping his hands in mock admiration You are the rarest jewel in the casket Words fail to express my feelings O joy O bliss O rapture Let happiness now hap I am a sea of gurgling glee with ecstacy on tap Hippy recited this effusion in a killing falsetto voice and endeavored to embrace Reddy fervently but was dragged back by Tom and David to Reddy s visible relief He s the idol of the hour Don t put your irreverent hands on him was David s injunction But I adore idols persisted Hippy Let me at him Quit it fat one growled Reddy with a grin I ll settle with you later With gay laughter and jest the young folks made their way from the grounds and started down the road toward home The whole party walking four abreast had just turned the curve where the road ended and Main Street began when there was a hoarse honk honk and a runabout decorated in blue and white containing Eleanor and Edna Wright bore down upon them at lightning speed The girls uttering little cries of alarm scattered to both sides of the road with the exception of Mabel Allison who in her hurry to get out of the way stumbled and fell directly in the path of the oncoming machine CHAPTER XIII A THANKSGIVING FROLIC But sudden as had been Mabel s fall Grace Harlowe was equal to the emergency With a bound she reached the middle of the road seized Mabel and dragged her back just as the runabout passed over the place where she had fallen It almost grazed her outstretched hand then shot on down the road without slackening its speed for an instant There was a cry of horror from the young folks that ended in a sigh of relief David and Tom Gray quickly raised Mabel to her feet and turned to Grace whose face was ghastly while she trembled like a leaf The reaction had set in the moment she realized that Mabel was safe Jessica and Nora had both begun to cry while the faces of the others fully expressed their feelings Grace said Tom in a husky voice that was the quickest move I ever saw any one make Grace drew a long breath the color returned to her pale face and in a measure she recovered herself Some one had to do something she said weakly I was the nearest to her that s all Are you hurt Mabel dear she asked turning to the young girl who stood by Jessica looking white and dazed It came so suddenly she faltered I couldn t get up It was awful She shuddered then burst into tears burying her face in Jessica s shoulder There there soothed Jessica wiping her own eyes It s all right now Stand up straight and let me brush your coat You are all mud Here come the would be murderesses now cried Hippy They actually managed to stop and turn around and now they are coming this way One of them is my pet abomination Miss Wright She used to call me fatty when I was little and I ve never forgiven her But who is the reckless young person playing chauffeur She ought to be put in jail for exceeding the speed limit Hush said Grace Here she is The runabout had stopped and Eleanor alighted Ignoring the four chums she walked up to Miriam Nesbit Will you please tell me if any one is hurt she asked pettishly I saw some one fall but couldn t stop the machine I supposed the highway was for vehicles not pedestrians four abreast Miss Savell you have just missed running over Miss Allison said Miriam coldly Had it not been for Miss Harlowe there would have been a serious accident I should advise you to drive more carefully in future or you may not escape so easily another time Eleanor flushed at these words and said haughtily I did not ask for advice I asked for information Very true replied Miriam calmly but you see I have given you both You are the most ill bred lot of girls I have ever seen returned Eleanor crossly and I think you are making a great deal of unnecessary fuss over a small matter Why didn t your prize orphan get out of the way with the rest of you Besides you have no right to block a public highway as you did I am very sorry I came back at all Turning on her heel she walked back to the runabout climbed in and drove down the road like the wind apparently indifferent as to what comment her heartless behavior might create Who on earth is that girl inquired Reddy Brooks She has about as much sympathy as a stone That is Eleanor Savell replied Anne Pierson and she can be nice if she wishes but she doesn t like us very well That s why she was so hateful So that s the famous Eleanor said Tom Gray in a low tone to Grace Aunt Rose was telling me about her this morning at breakfast I supposed she was a great friend of yours She was but she isn t returned Grace That s rather indefinite However I ll tell you about it as we go back She certainly can t complain as far as looks are concerned said Hippy She must have yards of blue ribbon that she won at baby shows when but a mere infant Attention boys and girls cried Grace Let us forget what has happened and have just as good a time to night as we can We mustn t spoil the party I move that we give Grace Harlowe a special round of applause for being a heroine cried Hippy Hurrah His example was quickly followed and the noise of the cheering brought people to their doors to see what the excitement was about Do stop protested Grace People will begin asking all sorts of questions Don t interfere with our simple pleasures expostulated Hippy Let us howl in peace High School yell next please By the time the party had reached the center of the town where their ways parted the shadow cast by the near accident had almost disappeared By eight o clock that evening the last guest had arrived and the Harlowe s hospitable home was the scene of radiant good cheer missus Gray enthroned in a big chair in one corner of the drawing room was in her element and the young folks vied with each other in doing her homage The sprightly old lady was never so happy as when surrounded by young folks She had a word or smile for each one and the new girls who had at first felt rather timid about meeting her were soon entirely at ease in her presence The greater part of the furniture had been removed from the big living room and the floor had been crashed while a string orchestra that made a specialty of playing for parties had been hired for the pleasure of those who cared to dance As dancing was the chief amusement at nearly all of the young people s parties in Oakdale the floor was filled from the beginning of the first waltz until supper was announced This was served at two long tables in the dining room missus Gray occupying the seat of honor at the head of one and Miss Thompson who was a favorite at High School parties the other There were miniature ears of corn turkeys pumpkins and various other favors appropriate to Thanksgiving at each one s place In the center of one table stood two dolls dressed in the style of costume worn by the Pilgrim fathers and mothers They held a scroll between them on which was printed the Thanksgiving Proclamation In the center of the other table were two dolls one dressed in football uniform a miniature football under its arm while the other dressed as a High School girl held up a blue banner with O H S on it in big white letters This had been Grace s idea She had dressed the dolls with the idea of contrasting the first Thanksgiving with that of to day There was a great craning of necks from those at the one table to see the central figures on the other but soon every one settled down to the discussion of the dainties provided for them The supper ended with a toast to their young hostess which was drunk standing and then the guests repaired to the drawing room where impromptu stunts were in order Every one was obliged to do something if only to make a remark appropriate to the occasion Nora sang Anne recited Grace and Miriam did a Spanish dance that they had practised during vacation with remarkable spirit and effect Jessica was then detailed to play and under cover of her music Tom Reddy David and Hippy left the room Tom returning presently to announce solemnly that an original one act drama entitled The Suffragette written by mister Wingate and presented by a notable cast would be the next offering After a moment s wait Hippy Reddy and David appeared and were greeted with shouts of laughter Reddy minced along in a bonnet and skirt belonging to missus Harlowe while Hippy wore a long sleeved gingham pinafore of Grace s which lacked considerable of meeting in the back and was kept on by means of a sash After deliberately setting their stage in full view of the audience at one end of the room the play began with David as the meek hen pecked husband Hippy as the neglected child who wept and howled continuously while Reddy played the unnatural wife and mother who neglected her family and held woman s suffrage meetings in the street The dialogue was clever and the action of the sketch so ridiculous that the audience laughed from the first line until the climax especially when the suffragette was hustled off to jail by Tom Gray in the role of a policeman for disturbing the peace while her husband and child executed a wild dance of joy as she was hauled off the scene protesting vigorously The applause was tremendous and the cast were obliged to bow their thanks several times before it subsided Songs speeches and recitations followed rapidly until everyone had contributed something in the way of a stunt Then the guests formed two long lines from the living room straight through the big archway into the drawing room and soon a Virginia reel was in full swing led off by mister Harlowe and missus Gray who took her steps as daintily as when she had danced at her first party so many years before After the reel the young folks romped through Paul Jones and then the party broke up all declaring that never before had they had quite such a good time As Grace sleepily prepared for bed she felt a little thrill of pride at the success of her party and her only regret was the fact that of all those invited Eleanor was the only one who had refused to be present

6054_41614_000004_000000	train-clean-360	Now that Thanksgiving was past basketball became the topic of the hour The juniors had accepted the challenge of the senior class and had agreed to play them on Saturday December twelve at two o clock in the gymnasium 
6054_41614_000004_000001	train-clean-360	Only two weeks remained in which to practise 
6054_41614_000004_000002	train-clean-360	Their sorority enthusiasm had so completely run away with them that they had even neglected basketball until now 
6054_41614_000004_000003	train-clean-360	Therefore Grace Harlowe lost no time in getting Miss Thompson s permission to use the gymnasium and promptly notified her team and the subs to meet there in gymnasium suits prepared to play that afternoon 
6054_41614_000005_000000	train-clean-360	The instant the last bell sounded on lessons ten girls made for their lockers and fifteen minutes later the first team and the subs were moving toward the gymnasium deep in the discussion of the coming game and their chances for success over their opponents 
6054_41614_000006_000000	train-clean-360	A brief meeting was held and the girls were assigned to their positions 
6054_41614_000006_000001	train-clean-360	Grace had fully intended that Miriam should play center but when she proposed it Miriam flatly refused to do so and asked for her old position of right forward 
6054_41614_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 You are our captain she declared to Grace and the best center I ever saw on a girls team 
none	none	It would be folly to change now 
6054_41614_000007_000002	train-clean-360	Don t you agree with me girls 
6054_41614_000008_000000	train-clean-360	Nora was detailed as left forward while Marian Barber and Eva Allen played right and left guards 
6054_41614_000008_000001	train-clean-360	The substitutes were also assigned their positions and practice began 
none	none	Before they had been on the floor twenty minutes the girls were thoroughly alive to the joy of the game and worked with the old time dash and spirit that had won them the championship the previous year Now that they were in harmony with each other they played with remarkable unity and after an hour s practice Grace decided that they were in a fair way to whip the seniors off the face of the earth
6054_41614_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 I never saw you girls work better she exclaimed 
6054_41614_000010_000001	train-clean-360	 It will be a sorry day for the seniors when we line up on the twelfth 
6054_41614_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 There ll be a great gnashing of senior teeth after the game remarked Nora confidently 
6054_41614_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 Do you know girls said Grace as they left the gymnasium that afternoon I am sorry that Eleanor won t be peaceable 
none	none	I wanted her to like every bit of our school life and thought she d surely be interested in basketball 
6054_41614_000012_000002	train-clean-360	I suppose she will stay away from the game merely because we are on the team 
none	none	It is really a shame for her to be so unreasonable
6054_41614_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 Grace Harlowe are you ever going to stop mourning over Eleanor cried Miriam impatiently 
6054_41614_000013_000001	train-clean-360	 She doesn t deserve your regret and is too selfish to appreciate it 
6054_41614_000013_000002	train-clean-360	I know what I am talking about because I used to be just as ridiculous as she is and knowing what you suffered through me I can t bear to see you unhappy again over some one who is too trivial to be taken seriously 
6054_41614_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 You re a dear Miriam exclaimed Nora impulsively 
none	none	It was the first time that the once haughty Miriam had ever referred publicly to past shortcomings although from the time she and Grace had settled their difficulties at the close of the sophomore year she had been a changed girl Where are Anne and Jessica to day asked Eva Allen Anne and Jessica have refused point blank to honor us with their presence during practice announced Nora I asked Jessica to day and she said that they didn t want to know how we intended to play for then they could wax enthusiastic and make a great deal more noise 
6054_41614_000017_000002	train-clean-360	It is their ambition to become loud and loyal fans 
none	none	What a worthy ambition said Marian Barber with a giggle They are such noisy creatures already There was more laughing at this as Anne and Jessica were by far the quietest members of the sorority Remember we practise to morrow after school called Grace as she separated from her team at her street As she walked slowly down the quiet street deep in thought her ear caught the sound of an approaching automobile and she looked up just in time to see Eleanor drive by in her machine 
6054_41614_000021_000001	train-clean-360	Grace nodded to her but her salutation met with a chilly stare 
none	none	How childish she is thought Grace
6054_41614_000022_000001	train-clean-360	 I suppose she thinks that hurts me 
6054_41614_000022_000002	train-clean-360	Of course it isn t exactly pleasant but I m going to keep on speaking to her just the same 
6054_41614_000022_000003	train-clean-360	I am not angry even if she is although I have far greater cause to be 
6054_41614_000023_000000	train-clean-360	But before the close of the week Grace was destined to cross swords with Eleanor in earnest and the toleration she had felt was swallowed up in righteous indignation 
6054_41614_000024_000000	train-clean-360	During the winter theatrical companies sometimes visited Oakdale for a week at a time presenting at popular prices old worn out plays and cheap melodramas 
none	none	These companies gave daily matinees as well as evening performances and the more frivolous element of High School girls had in time past occasionally skipped school to spend the afternoon in the theatre By the girls this form of truancy was considered a lark but Miss Thompson did not look at the matter in the same light and disciplined the culprit so severely whenever she found this to be the cause of an afternoon s absence that the girls were slow to offend in this respect 
6054_41614_000025_000000	train-clean-360	All this Eleanor had heard among other things from Edna Wright but had paid little attention to it when Edna had told her 
6054_41614_000025_000001	train-clean-360	Directly after cutting Grace Harlowe she had turned her runabout into Main Street where a billboard had caught her eye displaying in glaring red and blue lettering the fact that the Peerless Dramatic Company would open a week s engagement in Oakdale with daily matinees 
6054_41614_000026_000000	train-clean-360	Eleanor s eyes sparkled 
6054_41614_000026_000001	train-clean-360	She halted her machine scanning curiously the list of plays on the billboard 
6054_41614_000026_000002	train-clean-360	 The Nihilist s Daughter was scheduled for Thursday afternoon and Eleanor decided to go 
6054_41614_000026_000003	train-clean-360	She wasn t afraid of Miss Thompson 
6054_41614_000026_000004	train-clean-360	Then possessed with a sudden idea she laughed gleefully 
none	none	At last she had found a way to effectually annoy the principal CHAPTER XV A WOULD BE LARK Eleanor Savell and the seven girls who formed their sorority were the first to enter the study hall on Tuesday morning As soon as a girl from any of the three lower classes appeared she was approached by some of the former and a great deal of whispering and subdued laughter went on A few girls were seen to shake their heads dubiously and a number of those termed grinds were not interviewed 
5561_41615_000002_000002	train-clean-100	The majority however appeared to be highly delighted over what they heard one group standing near one of the windows of which Eleanor was the center laughed so loudly that they were sent to their seats 
none	none	Among the number to whom nothing was said were the members of the Phi Sigma Tau and as the morning advanced they became fully aware that something unusual was in the wind 
5561_41615_000003_000001	train-clean-100	Several times they caught sight of a folded paper being stealthily passed from one desk to another but as to its contents they had no idea as it was not handed to any one of them 
5561_41615_000004_000000	train-clean-100	At recess there was more grouping and whispering and Grace was puzzled and not a little hurt over the way in which she and her friends were ignored 
5561_41615_000004_000001	train-clean-100	Such a thing had not happened since the basketball trouble the previous year 
none	none	Eleanor started that paper whatever it is said Nora O Malley to the Phi Sigma Tau who stood in a group around her desk She was here when I came in this morning and I was early too It is some masterpiece of mischief on her part or she wouldn t take the trouble to get here on time
5561_41615_000006_000000	train-clean-100	 Here comes Mabel said Jessica 
none	none	Maybe she has seen the paper Mabel dear did you see that paper that has been going the rounds this morning Mabel nodded What was written on it Mabel asked Grace curiously 
5561_41615_000009_000000	train-clean-100	Mabel looked distressed for a moment then she said I wish I might tell you all about it but I gave my word of honor before I read it that I wouldn t mention the contents to any one 
5561_41615_000010_000000	train-clean-100	 Then of course we won t ask you said Anne Pierson quickly 
5561_41615_000010_000001	train-clean-100	 But tell us this much is it about any of us 
5561_41615_000011_000000	train-clean-100	 No replied Mabel 
none	none	It isn t 
5561_41615_000011_000002	train-clean-100	It is something I was asked to sign 
5561_41615_000012_000000	train-clean-100	 And did you sign it asked Jessica 
5561_41615_000013_000000	train-clean-100	 I certainly did not responded Mabel 
5561_41615_000013_000001	train-clean-100	 It was she stopped then flushed 
5561_41615_000013_000002	train-clean-100	She had been on the point of telling 
none	none	I am sorry I ever saw it she continued
5561_41615_000013_000004	train-clean-100	 I can t bear to have secrets and not tell you 
none	none	That s all right Mabel said Marian Barber patting her on the shoulder
5561_41615_000014_000001	train-clean-100	 We don t want you to tell 
5561_41615_000014_000002	train-clean-100	If it doesn t concern us we don t care do we girls 
5561_41615_000015_000000	train-clean-100	 No indeed was the reply 
5561_41615_000016_000000	train-clean-100	Just then the bell sounded and the girls returned to their seats with the riddle still unsolved 
none	none	Nothing more was seen of the mysterious paper and Grace came to the conclusion that it had been nothing important after all 
5561_41615_000017_000000	train-clean-100	On Wednesday aside from a little more whispering and significant glances exchanged among the pupils not a ripple disturbed the calm of the study hall 
5561_41615_000017_000001	train-clean-100	It was therefore a distinct and not altogether pleasant surprise when Miss Thompson walked into the room dismissed the senior class and requested the three lower classes to remain in their seats 
5561_41615_000018_000000	train-clean-100	After the seniors had quietly left the study hall Miss Thompson stood gravely regarding the rows of girls before her 
5561_41615_000018_000001	train-clean-100	Her eyes wandered toward where Eleanor sat looking bored and indifferent and then she looked toward Grace whose steady gray eyes were fixed on the principal s face with respectful attention 
5561_41615_000019_000000	train-clean-100	 I don t believe Grace is guilty at any rate thought Miss Thompson then she addressed the assembled girls 
none	none	Something has come to my ears girls said the principal that I find hard to credit but before you leave here this afternoon I must know who is innocent and who is guilty 
5561_41615_000021_000000	train-clean-100	Miss Thompson paused and a number of girls stirred uneasily in their seats while a few glanced quickly toward Eleanor who was looking straight ahead the picture of innocence 
5561_41615_000022_000000	train-clean-100	 You all know continued the principal that it is strictly forbidden for any pupil to absent herself from school for the purpose of attending a circus matinee or any public performance of this nature 
5561_41615_000022_000001	train-clean-100	I have so severely disciplined pupils for this offence that for a long time no one has disobeyed me 
none	none	I was therefore astonished to learn that a number of girls regardless of rules have taken matters into their own hands and have decided to absent themselves from school to morrow in order to attend the matinee to be given in the theatre 
5561_41615_000022_000003	train-clean-100	Such a decision is worse than disobedience it is lawlessness 
none	none	Unless a severe example is made of the offenders the standard of the school will be lowered 
5561_41615_000022_000005	train-clean-100	Therefore I intend to sift this matter to the bottom and find out what mischievous influence prompted this act of insubordination 
5561_41615_000023_000000	train-clean-100	 Report says that this movement originated in the junior class and that a paper has been circulated and signed by certain pupils who pledged themselves to play truant and attend the matinee to morrow 
5561_41615_000024_000000	train-clean-100	The eyes of Grace and her chums turned questioningly toward Mabel Allison who nodded slightly in the affirmative 
none	none	So that was what all the whispering and mystery had meant Grace inwardly congratulated herself on having kept clear of the whole thing None of her friends were implicated either 
5561_41615_000025_000002	train-clean-100	Even Mabel had refused to sign 
5561_41615_000026_000000	train-clean-100	 I have dismissed the senior class because I have been assured of their entire ignorance of the plot 
5561_41615_000026_000001	train-clean-100	What I insist upon knowing now is who are the real culprits beginning with the girl who originated the paper to the last one who signed it 
5561_41615_000026_000002	train-clean-100	I am going to put every girl on her honor and I expect absolutely truthful answers 
5561_41615_000026_000003	train-clean-100	The girls who signed the paper I have mentioned will rise 
5561_41615_000027_000000	train-clean-100	There was a moment of suspense then Eleanor Savell proudly rose from her seat 
5561_41615_000027_000001	train-clean-100	Her example was followed until two thirds of the girls present were standing 
5561_41615_000027_000002	train-clean-100	The principal stood silently regarding them with an expression of severity that was decidedly discomfitting 
5561_41615_000028_000000	train-clean-100	 That will do she said curtly after they had stood for what seemed to them an age but was really only a couple of minutes 
none	none	You may be seated 
5561_41615_000029_000001	train-clean-100	The girl who composed and wrote that agreement will now rise and explain herself 
5561_41615_000030_000000	train-clean-100	Without hesitating Eleanor rose and regarded the principal with an insolent smile 
5561_41615_000030_000001	train-clean-100	 I wrote it Miss Thompson she said clearly 
none	none	I wrote it because I wished to 
5561_41615_000030_000003	train-clean-100	I am sorry you found out about it because it has spoiled all our fun 
5561_41615_000031_000000	train-clean-100	There was a gasp of horror at Eleanor s assertion 
5561_41615_000031_000001	train-clean-100	No one had ever before spoken so disrespectfully to their revered principal 
5561_41615_000032_000000	train-clean-100	 Miss Savell said the principal quietly although her flashing eyes and set lips showed that she was very angry if you have that paper in your possession bring it to me at once and never answer me again as you did just now 
5561_41615_000032_000001	train-clean-100	You are both disrespectful and impertinent 
5561_41615_000033_000000	train-clean-100	But Miss Thompson s anger toward Eleanor was nothing compared with the tempest that the principal had aroused in Eleanor 
5561_41615_000033_000001	train-clean-100	The latter flushed then turned perfectly white with rage 
5561_41615_000033_000002	train-clean-100	Still standing she reached down picked up a book from her desk and took from it a paper 
5561_41615_000033_000003	train-clean-100	 This she said in a low tense voice is the paper you wish to see 
5561_41615_000033_000004	train-clean-100	I do not choose to let you see it therefore I shall destroy it 
none	none	Illustration I Do Not Choose to Let You See This Paper 
5561_41615_000035_000000	train-clean-100	Then she deliberately tore the offending paper into shreds and scattered them broadcast 
5561_41615_000036_000000	train-clean-100	 I hope you understand that I am not afraid of you or any other teacher in this school she continued 
5561_41615_000036_000001	train-clean-100	 I have never been punished in my life therefore I am not liable to give you the first opportunity 
none	none	I despise you because you are a ridiculous prig and I am glad of an opportunity to tell you so 
5561_41615_000036_000003	train-clean-100	As for the persons who told you about our plan words cannot express my contempt for them and right here I accuse Grace Harlowe and her sorority of getting the information from Mabel Allison yesterday and carrying it to you 
none	none	They are all tale bearers and sneaks 
5561_41615_000037_000000	train-clean-100	With these words Eleanor angrily flung the book she held on the desk and walked down the aisle toward the door but Miss Thompson barred her way 
5561_41615_000038_000000	train-clean-100	 Stop Miss Savell she commanded 
none	none	You shall not leave this room until you have apologized to the girls whom you have unjustly accused and to me 
5561_41615_000038_000002	train-clean-100	I will not tolerate such behavior 
none	none	Eleanor glared at the principal whose face was rigid in its purpose then sank into the nearest vacant seat saying defiantly You may keep me here all night if you like but I meant what I said and I shall retract nothing Nevertheless she did not again attempt to leave the room She had met with a will stronger than her own and she realized it Ignoring Eleanor s final remark Miss Thompson once more turned her attention to the matter in hand
5561_41615_000042_000000	train-clean-100	 Those girls who are not in any way implicated in this matter are dismissed she said 
5561_41615_000043_000000	train-clean-100	About one third of the girls arose and prepared to leave the study hall the Phi Sigma Tau being among the number 
5561_41615_000043_000001	train-clean-100	Grace motioned the girls to hurry 
none	none	She wished to leave the room with her friends before Miss Thompson noticed them She knew the principal would insist on an apology from Eleanor and neither she nor her friends wished it 
5561_41615_000043_000004	train-clean-100	For the first time since Eleanor had chosen to cut their acquaintance Grace was thoroughly angry with her 
5561_41615_000043_000005	train-clean-100	She could not forgive Eleanor for having accused her and her friends of carrying tales before almost the entire school therefore a forced apology would not appease her wounded pride She drew a breath of relief when the eight girls were safely outside the study hall door 
5561_41615_000044_000000	train-clean-100	 Hurry up she said 
5561_41615_000044_000001	train-clean-100	 We ll talk when we get outside school 
5561_41615_000044_000002	train-clean-100	Don t stop for a minute 
none	none	If Miss Thompson notices that we are gone she ll send after us 
5561_41615_000045_000000	train-clean-100	The girls silently donned their wraps and fled from the building like fugitives from justice 
5561_41615_000045_000001	train-clean-100	Once on the street a lively confab ensued all talking at once 
5561_41615_000046_000000	train-clean-100	 Let s take turns talking cried Grace laughing 
5561_41615_000046_000001	train-clean-100	 We shall understand each other a little better 
5561_41615_000047_000000	train-clean-100	 Now what do you think of Miss Eleanor cried Nora 
none	none	She has certainly shown her true colors this time I never heard of anything more unjust than the way she accused us when we knew nothing about her old plan said Marian Barber
5561_41615_000049_000000	train-clean-100	 It was abominable said Eva Allen 
5561_41615_000050_000000	train-clean-100	The other girls expressed their disapproval in equally frank terms 
5561_41615_000051_000000	train-clean-100	 I suppose it did look as though I told you girls said Mabel Allison who had joined them at the gate 
none	none	You know I was with you at recess right after the paper had been passed to me I don t think Miss Savell intended me to see it 
5561_41615_000051_000003	train-clean-100	It was passed to me by mistake 
5561_41615_000052_000000	train-clean-100	 Very likely agreed Grace 
none	none	I wonder who did tell Miss Thompson I saw several girls with the paper but hadn t the remotest idea what it was all about You know Miss Thompson is awfully down on skipping school She threatened last year to suspend Edna Wright for it There will be weeping and wailing in the Skull and Crossbones crowd exclaimed Nora They are all in this mix up and if they aren t suspended they ll be lucky Are you going to stand up for Eleanor now in the face of what she said about all of us before those girls Grace asked Marian Barber hotly No said Grace shortly
5561_41615_000055_000001	train-clean-100	 She deserves to be punished 
5561_41615_000055_000002	train-clean-100	The things she said to Miss Thompson were disgraceful and I shall never forgive her for the way she spoke of us 
5561_41615_000056_000000	train-clean-100	 I wouldn t say that Grace remarked Anne 
none	none	You can never tell what may happen to change your views
5561_41615_000057_000000	train-clean-100	 It will have to be something remarkable in this instance replied Grace grimly as she bade the girls good bye 
5561_41615_000057_000001	train-clean-100	 Remember girls basketball practice again to morrow and the rest of the week 
5561_41615_000057_000002	train-clean-100	Miss Thompson has promised me the gymnasium 
5561_41615_000057_000003	train-clean-100	Please make it a point to be on hand 
none	none	Good bye Grace chorused her friends and went on down the street discussing the probable fate of the would be truants To return to those youthful transgressors 
5561_41615_000059_000001	train-clean-100	They were spending a most uncomfortable half hour with Miss Thompson 
none	none	She was merciless in her denunciation of their conduct and the terror of suspension arose in more than one mind as they listened to her scathing remarks It had all seemed a huge joke when they planned it but there was nothing funny about it now When with the exception of Eleanor the principal dismissed them they filed decorously out very uneasy in mind 
5561_41615_000059_000005	train-clean-100	Miss Thompson had taken their names but had not stated their punishment and it was certain that they would be made to feel the full weight of her displeasure 
none	none	When the last girl had disappeared the principal turned to Eleanor I will listen to your apology Miss Savell she said coldly 
5561_41615_000061_000000	train-clean-100	Eleanor looked scornfully at the principal and was silent 
5561_41615_000062_000000	train-clean-100	 Do you intend to obey me Miss Savell asked Miss Thompson 
5561_41615_000063_000000	train-clean-100	Still there was no answer 
5561_41615_000064_000000	train-clean-100	 Very well continued Miss Thompson 
5561_41615_000064_000001	train-clean-100	 Your silence indicates that you are still insubordinate 
5561_41615_000064_000002	train-clean-100	You may therefore choose between two things You may apologize to me now and to morrow to the girls you have accused of treachery or you may leave this school not to return to it unless permitted to do so by the Board of Education 
5561_41615_000065_000000	train-clean-100	Without a word Eleanor rose and walked haughtily out of the room 
5561_41616_000001_000000	train-clean-100	CHAPTER XVI
none	none	 THE JUNIORS FOREVER 
5561_41616_000003_000000	train-clean-100	When the four classes assembled Thursday morning every girl with the exception of Eleanor was in her seat 
none	none	Her absence created considerable comment and it was a matter of speculation as to whether she had purposely absented herself or really had been suspended 
5561_41616_000004_000000	train-clean-100	After conducting opening exercises Miss Thompson pronounced sentence on the culprits 
5561_41616_000004_000001	train-clean-100	They were to forfeit their recess library and all other privileges until the end of the term 
5561_41616_000004_000002	train-clean-100	They must turn in two themes every week of not less than six hundred words on certain subjects to be assigned to them 
5561_41616_000004_000003	train-clean-100	If during this time any one of them should be reported for a misdemeanor they were to be suspended without delay 
5561_41616_000005_000000	train-clean-100	Their penalty was far from light but they had not been suspended and so they resolved to endure it as best they might 
5561_41616_000006_000000	train-clean-100	Grace Harlowe felt a load lifted from her mind when Miss Thompson publicly announced that she had not received any information from either Mabel Allison or the Phi Sigma Tau 
5561_41616_000007_000000	train-clean-100	 Thank goodness none of us were concerned in that affair she told the members of her basketball team at recess 
5561_41616_000007_000001	train-clean-100	 There are two girls on the sophomore and three on the freshman team whose basketball ardor will have to cool until after the mid year exams 
none	none	You might know that some of those silly freshmen would get into trouble said Nora scornfully Twas many and many a year ago In an age beyond recall That Nora the freshman lowly sat At one end of the study hall recited Anne Pierson in dramatic tones 
5561_41616_000011_000000	train-clean-100	There was a burst of laughter from the girls at this effusion in which Nora herself joined 
5561_41616_000012_000000	train-clean-100	 What a delicate way of reminding me that I once was a freshman she exclaimed 
none	none	Anne has a new accomplishment said Grace
5561_41616_000013_000001	train-clean-100	 She can spout poetry without trying 
5561_41616_000014_000000	train-clean-100	 Small credit is due me said Anne smiling 
5561_41616_000014_000001	train-clean-100	 Anyone can twist Annabel Lee to suit the occasion 
5561_41616_000015_000000	train-clean-100	 By the way Anne said Grace as you are a poet you must compose a basketball song to day and I ll see that the juniors all have copies It s time we had one 
5561_41616_000015_000001	train-clean-100	Let me see what would be a good tune 
5561_41616_000016_000000	train-clean-100	 Rally Round the Flag suggested Miriam Nesbit 
5561_41616_000016_000001	train-clean-100	 That has a dandy swing to it 
5561_41616_000017_000000	train-clean-100	Grace hummed a few bars 
5561_41616_000018_000000	train-clean-100	 The very thing she exclaimed 
5561_41616_000018_000001	train-clean-100	 Now Anne get busy at once 
none	none	You d better sing the tune to yourself all the time you re writing it then you ll be sure to put more dash and spirit into it I wish the day of the game were here said Jessica plaintively I have been practising a most encouraging howl 
5561_41616_000019_000001	train-clean-100	Hippy David and Reddy have a new one too 
5561_41616_000019_000002	train-clean-100	Reddy says it s marvelously extraordinary and appallingly great 
none	none	I can imagine it to be all that and more if Hippy had anything to do with its origin said Nora
5561_41616_000021_000000	train-clean-100	 Wasn t it nice of Miss Thompson to exonerate us publicly asked Anne 
5561_41616_000022_000000	train-clean-100	 She is always just replied Grace 
5561_41616_000022_000001	train-clean-100	 I can t understand how Eleanor could be so rude and disagreeable to her 
5561_41616_000022_000002	train-clean-100	She has disliked Miss Thompson from the first 
5561_41616_000023_000000	train-clean-100	 I wonder whether she apologized to Miss Thompson last night mused Grace 
5561_41616_000024_000000	train-clean-100	 I feel sure that she didn t and I am just as sure that she won t get back until she does 
5561_41616_000025_000000	train-clean-100	 We shall manage to exist if she doesn t said Jessica dryly 
5561_41616_000025_000001	train-clean-100	She felt a personal grudge against Eleanor for her accusation against Mabel who had grown very dear to her and whom she mothered like a hen with one chicken 
none	none	She ll probably appear at the game in all her glory said Miriam Nesbit
5561_41616_000026_000001	train-clean-100	 She can go to that even though she is on bad terms with the school 
5561_41616_000027_000000	train-clean-100	The recess bell cut short the conversation and the girls returned to their desks with far better ideas of the coming game than of the afternoon s lessons 
none	none	Saturday December twelve dawned cold and clear and the girls on both teams were in high spirits as they hustled into their respective locker rooms and rapidly donned their gymnasium suits 
5561_41616_000028_000001	train-clean-100	The spectators had not yet begun to arrive as it was still early so the girls indulged in a little warming up practice did a few stunts and skipped about overflowing with animal spirits 
5561_41616_000029_000000	train-clean-100	Julia Crosby and Grace took turns sprinting around the gymnasium three times in succession while Miriam Nesbit timed them Grace finishing just two seconds ahead of Julia 
5561_41616_000030_000000	train-clean-100	By a quarter of two the gallery was fairly well filled and by five minutes of two it was crowded 
none	none	The juniors with the exception of Eleanor Savell s faction arrived in a body gave the High School yell the moment they spied their team and then burst forth with the basketball song led by Ruth Deane a tall junior who stood up and beat time with both hands Anne had composed the song the week before 
5561_41616_000030_000003	train-clean-100	The juniors had all received copies of the words and had learned them by heart 
5561_41616_000030_000004	train-clean-100	They now sang with the utmost glee and came out particularly strong on the chorus which ran 
5561_41616_000031_000000	train-clean-100	 The juniors forever hurrah fans hurrah Our team is a winner our captain s a star And we ll drive the senior foe from the basket every time Shouting the war cry of the juniors 
5561_41616_000032_000000	train-clean-100	There was a great clapping of hands from the admirers of the juniors at this effort but the seniors promptly responded from the other end of the gallery to the tune of Dixie with 
5561_41616_000033_000000	train-clean-100	 The seniors are the real thing Hurrah 
5561_41616_000033_000001	train-clean-100	Hurrah Our gallant team now takes its stand And all the baskets soon will land We shout we sing the praises of the seniors 
5561_41616_000034_000000	train-clean-100	Hardly had the last notes died away when the referee blew the whistle and the teams hustled to their positions 
5561_41616_000034_000001	train-clean-100	Grace and Julia Crosby faced each other beamed amiably and shook hands then stood vigilant eyes on the ball that the referee balanced in her hands 
5561_41616_000034_000002	train-clean-100	Up it went the whistle sounded and the two captains sprang straight for it 
5561_41616_000034_000003	train-clean-100	Grace captured it however and sent it flying toward Miriam who was so carefully guarded that she dared not attempt to make the basket and after a feint managed to throw it to Nora who tried for the basket at long range and missed 
5561_41616_000035_000000	train-clean-100	There was a general scramble for the ball and for five minutes neither team scored then Marian Barber dropped a neat field goal and soon after Grace scored on a foul 
5561_41616_000035_000001	train-clean-100	The junior fans howled joyfully at the good work of their team 
5561_41616_000035_000002	train-clean-100	The seniors did not intend to allow them to score again in a hurry 
5561_41616_000035_000003	train-clean-100	They played such a close guarding game that try as they might the juniors made no headway 
none	none	Then Julia Crosby scored on a field goal making the score three to two 
5561_41616_000035_000005	train-clean-100	This spurred the junior team on to greater effort and Miriam made a brilliant throw to basket that brought forth an ovation from the gallery 
5561_41616_000035_000006	train-clean-100	This ended the first half with the score five to two in favor of the juniors 
none	none	They ll have to work to catch up with us now said Nora O Malley triumphantly to the members of the team who sat resting in the little side room off the gymnasium We have the lead but we can t afford to boast yet replied Grace The seniors played a fine game last half and they ll strain every nerve to pile up their score next half
5561_41616_000038_000000	train-clean-100	 We shall win said Miriam Nesbit confidently 
5561_41616_000038_000001	train-clean-100	 I feel it in my bones 
5561_41616_000039_000000	train-clean-100	 Let s hope that your bones are true prophets laughed Marian Barber 
5561_41616_000040_000000	train-clean-100	 O girls exclaimed Eva Allen from the open door in which she had been standing looking up at the gallery 
5561_41616_000040_000001	train-clean-100	 Eleanor is here 
5561_41616_000040_000002	train-clean-100	She and her satellites are sitting away up on the back seat of the gallery 
5561_41616_000041_000000	train-clean-100	 Where asked Nora going to the door 
5561_41616_000041_000001	train-clean-100	 Oh yes I see her 
5561_41616_000041_000002	train-clean-100	She looks as haughty as ever 
5561_41616_000041_000003	train-clean-100	It s a wonder she d condescend to come and watch her mortal enemies play 
5561_41616_000042_000000	train-clean-100	 I suppose she hopes we ll lose said Marian Barber 
5561_41616_000042_000001	train-clean-100	 That would fill her with joy 
5561_41616_000043_000000	train-clean-100	 Then we ll see that she goes away in a gloomy frame of mind said Nora for we re going to win and don t you forget to remember it 
5561_41616_000044_000000	train-clean-100	Just then the whistle blew and there was a scramble for places 
none	none	This time Julia Crosby won the toss up and followed it up with a field goal Then the seniors scored twice on fouls tying the score The juniors set their teeth and waded in with all their might and main setting a whirlwind pace that caused their fans to shout with wild enthusiasm and fairly dazed their opponents Grace alone netted four foul goals and the sensational playing of Nora and Miriam was a matter of wonder to the spectators who conceded it to be the fastest most brilliant half ever played by an Oakdale team The game ended with the score fifteen to six in favor of the juniors whose loyal supporters swooped down upon them the moment the whistle blew and pranced about whooping like savages That was the greatest game I ever saw played under this roof cried David wringing Grace s hand while Hippy hopped about uttering little yelps of joy 
5561_41616_000045_000001	train-clean-100	Reddy circled about the victors almost too delighted for words 
5561_41616_000045_000002	train-clean-100	He was filled with profound admiration for them 
5561_41616_000046_000000	train-clean-100	 The boys crack team couldn t have played a better game he said solemnly and the girls knew that he could pay them no higher compliment for this team was considered invincible by the High School boys 
5561_41616_000047_000000	train-clean-100	 Perhaps we ll challenge you some day Reddy said Grace mischievously 
none	none	I believe you d win at that he said so earnestly that every one laughed It was a great triumph said Jessica proudly as she stood with Mabel and Anne in the locker room while the girls resumed street clothing And my new howl was a success too
5561_41616_000050_000000	train-clean-100	 Glad to know that said Grace 
5561_41616_000050_000001	train-clean-100	 There were so many different kinds of noises I couldn t distinguish it 
none	none	There was one noise that started that was promptly hushed said Anne You heard it too didn t you Jessica
5561_41616_000052_000000	train-clean-100	 Oh yes girls I intended telling you before this replied Jessica Just before the last half started Miss Thompson and Miss Kane came in and walked to the other end of the gallery 
none	none	Well Eleanor and her crowd saw them and what do you suppose they did
5561_41616_000053_000000	train-clean-100	 Hard to tell said Nora 
5561_41616_000054_000000	train-clean-100	 They hissed Miss Thompson 
5561_41616_000054_000001	train-clean-100	Very softly you may be sure continued Jessica but it was hissing just the same 
5561_41616_000054_000002	train-clean-100	For a wonder she didn t hear it but every girl in the junior class did 
5561_41616_000054_000003	train-clean-100	They were sitting down front on the same side as Eleanor s crowd 
5561_41616_000054_000004	train-clean-100	You know what a temper Ruth Deane has and how ferocious she can look 
none	none	Well the minute she heard it she went back there like a flash looking for all the world like a thunder cloud 
5561_41616_000054_000006	train-clean-100	She talked for a moment to Edna and Eleanor 
5561_41616_000054_000007	train-clean-100	They tossed their heads but they didn t hiss any more 
5561_41616_000055_000000	train-clean-100	 What did Ruth say to them asked Grace curiously 
5561_41616_000055_000001	train-clean-100	 It must have been something remarkable or they wouldn t have subsided so suddenly 
5561_41616_000056_000000	train-clean-100	 It was giggled Jessica 
5561_41616_000056_000001	train-clean-100	 She told them that if they didn t stop it instantly the juniors would pick them up bodily carry them downstairs to the classroom and lock them in until the game was over 
5561_41616_000057_000000	train-clean-100	 How absurd exclaimed Grace 
none	none	They would never have dared to go that far
5561_41616_000058_000000	train-clean-100	 I don t know about that said Nora O Malley 
5561_41616_000058_000001	train-clean-100	 Ruth Deane is a terror when she gets fairly started 
5561_41616_000058_000002	train-clean-100	Besides she would have had both High Schools on her side 
5561_41616_000058_000003	train-clean-100	Even the boys like Miss Thompson 
5561_41616_000059_000000	train-clean-100	 It was an effectual threat at any rate said Jessica 
5561_41616_000059_000001	train-clean-100	 They left before the game was over 
5561_41616_000059_000002	train-clean-100	Perhaps they were afraid of being waylaid 
5561_41616_000060_000000	train-clean-100	 I suppose they couldn t bear to see us win said Grace 
5561_41616_000060_000001	train-clean-100	 But O girls I am so proud of our invincible team 
5561_41616_000060_000002	train-clean-100	It was a great game and a well earned victory 
5561_41616_000061_000000	train-clean-100	 We ought to celebrate said Miriam 
none	none	Come on 
5561_41616_000061_000002	train-clean-100	Here we are at Stillman s 
none	none	Without waiting for a second invitation the Phi Sigma Tau trooped joyfully into the drug store CHAPTER XVII THE LAST STRAW The days glided by rapidly The Christmas holidays came bringing with them the usual round of gayeties Thanks to the Phi Sigma Tau the lonely element of High School girls did not lack for good cheer As at Thanksgiving each member of the sorority entertained two or more girls on Christmas and New Year s and were amply repaid for their good deed by the warm appreciation of their guests Tom Gray came down for the holidays bringing with him his roommate Arnold Evans a fair haired blue eyed young man of twenty who proved himself thoroughly likable in every respect He lost no time in cultivating Miriam s acquaintance and the two soon became firm friends Tom gave a dinner to his roommate inviting the seven originals as he expressed it and Miriam who felt that at last she really belonged in the charmed circle David was even more pleased than his sister over the turn affairs had taken To have Miriam a member of his own particular crowd had always been David s dearest wish and the advent of Arnold Evans had done away with Miriam being the odd one So the circle was enlarged to ten young people who managed to crowd the two weeks vacation with all sorts of healthful pleasures There were coasting and sleighing parties and on one occasion a walk to old Jean s hut in Upton Wood where they were hospitably entertained by the old hunter who had smilingly pointed to the wolf skins on the wall asking them if they remembered the winter day two years before when those same skins held wolves who were far too lively for comfort Then the story of their escape had to be gone over again for Arnold s benefit They had stayed until the moon came up and accompanied by the old hunter had walked back to Oakdale in the moonlight After the holidays came the brief period of hard study before the dreaded mid year examinations Basketball enthusiasm declined rapidly and a remarkable devotion to study ensued that lasted until examinations began By the last week in January the ordeal was past Eleanor Savell had not yet returned to school Whether or not she would be allowed to return was a question that occasioned a great deal of discussion among three lower classes of girls Edna Wright and the other members of the sorority organized by Eleanor were loud in their expressions of disapproval as to Miss Thompson s severity toward Eleanor They talked so freely about it that it reached the principal s ears She lost no time in sending for them and after a session in the office they emerged looking subdued and crestfallen and after that it was noted that when in conversation with their schoolmates they made no further allusion to Miss Thompson s methods of discipline There was a faint murmur of surprise around the study hall one morning however when Miss Thompson walked in to conduct the opening exercises accompanied by Eleanor who without looking at the school seated herself at the desk nearest to where the principal stood When the morning exercises were concluded Miss Thompson nodded slightly to Eleanor who turned rather pale then rose and facing the school said in a clear voice I wish to apologize to Miss Thompson for impertinence and insubordination I also wish to publicly apologize to the members of the Phi Sigma Tau for having accused them of treachery concerning a certain matter that recently came up in this school Your apology is accepted Miss Savell You may take your own seat said the principal Without looking to the right or left Eleanor walked proudly up the aisle to her seat followed by the gaze of those girls who could not refrain from watching her The Phi Sigma Tau to a member sat with eyes straight to the front They had no desire to increase Eleanor s discomfiture for they realized what this public apology must have cost her although they were all equally puzzled as to what had prompted her to humble herself Eleanor s apology was not due however to a change of heart She still despised Miss Thompson as thoroughly as on the day that she had manifested her open scorn and dislike for the principal As for Grace and her friends Eleanor was particularly bitter against them and laid at their door a charge of which they were entirely innocent Eleanor had told her aunt nothing of her recent trouble in school but had feigned illness as an excuse for remaining at home After attending the basketball game her aunt had told her rather sharply that if she were able to attend basketball games she was certainly able to continue her studies Eleanor had agreed to return to school the following Monday and had started from home at the usual time with no intention whatever of honoring the High School with her presence She passed the morning in the various stores lunched in town and went to a matinee in the afternoon In this manner she idled the days away until the holiday vacation came congratulating herself upon her success in pulling wool over the eyes of her long suffering aunt But a day of reckoning was at hand for just before the close of vacation Miss Thompson chanced to call at missus Gray s home while missus Gray was entertaining Miss Nevin and the truth came out When Miss Nevin confronted her niece with the deception Eleanor had practised upon her a stormy scene had followed and Eleanor had accused Grace Harlowe of telling tales to missus Gray and missus Gray of carrying them to her aunt This had angered Miss Nevin to the extent that she had immediately ordered Eleanor to her room without telling her from whom she had received her information For three days Eleanor had remained in her room refusing to speak to her aunt who at the end of that time decreed that if she did not at once apologize roundly and return to school her violin and piano would both be taken from her until she should again become reasonable In the face of this new punishment which was the severest penalty that could be imposed upon her Eleanor remained obdurate Her violin and piano were removed from her room and the piano in the drawing room was closed Still she stubbornly held out and it was not until the day before the beginning of the new term that she went to her aunt and coldly agreed to comply with her wishes providing she might have her violin and piano once more Aside from this conversation they had exchanged no words and Eleanor therefore entered school that morning still believing the Phi Sigma Tau to be at the bottom of her misfortune In spite of her recent assertion that she could not forgive Eleanor Grace s resentment vanished at sight of her enemy s humiliation A public apology was the last thing that either she or her friends desired Her promise to missus Gray loomed up before her If Eleanor really did believe the Phi Sigma Tau innocent then perhaps this would be the opportunity for reconciliation After a little thought she tore a sheet of paper from her notebook and wrote DEAR ELEANOR The members of the Phi Sigma Tau are very sorry about your having to make an apology We did not wish it We think you showed a great deal of the right kind of courage in making the public apology you did both to Miss Thompson and to us Won t you come back to the Phi Sigma Tau YOUR SINCERE FRIENDS At recess Grace showed the note to her friends She had signed her name to the note and requested the others to do the same Here she met with some opposition Nora Marian Barber and Eva Allen were strongly opposed to sending it But Jessica Anne and Miriam agreed with Grace that it would be in fulfillment of the original promise to missus Gray to help Eleanor whenever they could do so So the Phi Sigma Tau signed their names and the note was passed to Eleanor directly after recess She opened it read it through and an expression of such intense scorn passed over her face that Nora who sat near her and who was covertly watching her knew at once that Grace s flag of truce had been trampled in the dust Picking up her pen Eleanor wrote rapidly for a brief space underlined what she had written signed her name with a flourish and folding and addressing her note sent it to Grace Rather surprised at receiving an answer so quickly Grace unfolded the note Then she colored looked grave and putting the note in the back of the text book she was holding went on studying By the time school was over for the day the girls of the Phi Sigma Tau knew that Eleanor had once more repudiated their overtures of friendship and were curious to see what she had written Don t keep us in suspense Let us see what she wrote exclaimed Nora O Malley as the seven girls crossed the campus together Here it is said Grace handing Nora the note Nora eagerly unfolded the paper and the girls crowded around reading over her shoulder Grace walking a little apart from them Then Nora read aloud TO THE PHI SIGMA TAU Your kind appreciation of my conduct in the matter of apology is really remarkable coupled with the fact that your inability to refrain from discussing my personal affairs with missus Gray forced this recent humiliation upon me To ask me to return to your society is only adding insult to injury I am not particularly surprised at this however It merely proves you to be greater hypocrites than you at first seemed ELEANOR SAVELL Well of all things exclaimed Marian Barber Grace Harlowe if you ever attempt to conciliate her again I ll disown you What does she mean by saying that we discussed her affairs with missus Gray cried Jessica impatiently We have always tried to put her best side out to dear missus Gray and you all know it The best thing to do said Anne smiling a little is to tell missus Gray all about it We might as well live up to the reputation Eleanor has thrust upon us It isn t pleasant to admit that we have failed with Eleanor but it isn t our fault at any rate I am going there this afternoon I ll tell her May I go with you Anne asked Grace You know I d love to have you Anne replied As long as I was the first to agree to look out for Eleanor I have decided I had better be with you at the finish said Grace as the two girls walked slowly up the drive The finish asked Anne Why do you say that Grace You ve heard about the last straw that broke the camel s back haven t you asked Grace Well Eleanor s note is the last straw I know I said that once before and I broke my word I don t intend to break it again however I am going to ask missus Gray to release me from my promise CHAPTER XVIII THE PLAY S THE THING Excitement ran high in the three lower classes one morning in early February when Miss Thompson requested that those interested in the production of a Shakespearian play go to the library directly after school there to discuss the situation When the gong sounded dismissal about sixty girls with dramatic aspirations made for the library The Phi Sigma Tau entered in a body They had decided at recess to carry away as many laurels as possible providing they could get into the cast Miss Tebbs teacher of elocution Miss Kane teacher of gymnastics and Miss Thompson stood at one side of the library talking earnestly as they noted each newcomer Oh look whispered Jessica clutching Nora s arm There s Eleanor and her crowd Then look out for squalls replied Nora She ll try to be the whole cast and will get a magnificent case of sulks if she can t have her own way Sh h h warned Eva Allen She ll hear you Besides Miss Thompson is going to speak The principal held up her hand for silence and the groups of girls engaged in subdued conversation ceased talking and turned their attention toward her You are all aware that each year the senior class gives a play which they choose manage and produce with no assistance save that given by Miss Tebbs said the principal So far the three lower classes have never given a play Some time ago Miss Tebbs suggested that as we need money for special books in the library which our yearly appropriation does not cover we might present a Shakespearian play with good effect choosing the cast from the freshman sophomore and junior classes The first thing to be thought of is the play itself After due consideration we decided that As You Like It is better suited to our needs than any of the other Shakespearian dramas In it are twenty one speaking characters besides numerous lords pages and attendants We shall probably use about fifty girls thus making it an elaborate production By the attendance this afternoon I should imagine that you are heartily in favor of our project and that we shall have no trouble in making up the cast As Miss Tebbs has charge of the situation I yield the floor to her She will explain to you about the giving out of the parts There was an enthusiastic clapping of hands as Miss Thompson smiled and nodded to the girls then left the room Miss Tebbs then stated that on Friday afternoon after school there would be a try out for parts in the gymnasium in order to find out what girls were most capable of doing good work in the cast Just what the test would be had not been decided It would be well however to study the chosen play and become familiar with it also each girl must bring a copy of the play with her If the girls wished to ask any questions she would answer them as far as possible Miss Kane would help with the posing and coaching when the thing was fairly started The girls crowded around Miss Tebbs and Miss Kane asking all sorts of questions One at a time girls laughed Miss Tebbs I have not asked you to enact a mob scene Under cover of the confusion Grace and her three friends slipped out of the library The play s the thing quoted Nora and me for it That is for the judges to decide said Jessica sagely Perhaps they won t even look at you Do you think any one could see my Irish countenance and fail to be impressed demanded Nora Really and truly Nora the more you travel with Hippy the more you talk like him remarked Grace I consider that a compliment replied Nora laughing Hippy says awfully funny things Look at our little Anne said Jessica She is actually dreaming Tell us about it dear I was thinking of the play said Anne dreamily I do so want a part if only a little one You ll be chosen for Rosalind see if you aren t predicted Grace Oh no said Anne Some one else will be sure to get that Besides I m too short But Anne you ve had stage experience said Jessica You ought to get it Not in a Shakespearian play replied Anne shaking her head I might not do well at all with that kind of part Never fear you ll be the star before you know it said Nora By Friday there was nothing on the school horizon save the cherished play Before school at recess and even in classes it was the topic of the hour To the eager girls the day seemed particularly long and a heartfelt sigh went up when the dismissal gong rang As the four chums hurried toward the gymnasium Anne suddenly caught Grace by the arm with a faint gasp of surprise Glancing quickly down at her friend to ascertain the cause of Anne s sudden agitation Grace saw her friend s eyes following the figure of a tall distinguished looking man who was just disappearing down the corridor leading to the gymnasium What s the matter Anne asked Grace Do you know that man No replied Anne but I know who he is He must be a remarkable person considering the way you gasped and clutched me laughed Grace That man is Everett Southard the great Shakespearian actor said Anne almost reverently I saw him in Hamlet and his acting is wonderful No wonder you were surprised said Grace It fairly takes my breath I ve seen ever so many pictures of him and read magazine articles about him What do you suppose he is doing in Oakdale and at the High School of all places Time will tell said Nora Then she suddenly clasped her hands O girls I know He s here for the try out Why of course he is exclaimed Grace Now I remember Miss Tebbs showed me a magazine picture of him one day last year and told me that she had known him since childhood Besides he is playing a three night engagement in Albany I read it in the paper last night It s as plain as can be Miss Tebbs has asked him to run up here and pick out the cast Good gracious said Jessica I shall retire in confusion if he looks at me I won t dare aspire to a part now and I had designs on the part of Phebe Don t be a goose said Nora He s only a man He can t hurt you I think having him here will be a lark Won t some of those girls put on airs though There he is talking with Miss Tebbs now The girls entered the gymnasium to find there nearly all of those who had attended the first meeting in the library increased by about a score of girls who had decided at the last minute to try for parts Eleanor stood at one end of the great room with Edna Wright and Daisy Culver Grace thought she had never seen Eleanor looking more beautiful She was wearing a fur coat and hat far too costly for a school girl and carried a huge muff Her coat was thrown open disclosing a perfectly tailored gown of brown with trimmings of dull gold braid She was talking animatedly and her two friends were apparently hanging on every word she uttered No wonder Eleanor has an opinion of herself said Nora Look at Daisy and Edna They act as though Eleanor were the Sultan of Turkey or the Shah of Persia or some other high and mighty dignitary They almost grovel before her Never mind Nora said Grace As long as you retain your Irish independence what do you care about what other girls do I don t care Only they do act so silly said Nora with a sniff of contempt Sh h h said Jessica softly Miss Tebbs is going to call the meeting to order A hush fell over the assembled girls as Miss Tebbs stepped forward to address them I am very glad to see so many girls here she said It shows that you are all interested in the coming play Although you cannot all have parts I hope that you will feel satisfied with the selection made this afternoon In order that each member of the cast may be chosen on her merit alone my old friend mister Southard kindly consented to come from Albany for the sole purpose of giving us the benefit of his great Shakespearian experience Allow me to introduce mister Everett Southard He was greeted with a round of applause and after bowing his thanks the eminent actor plunged at once into the business at hand He spoke favorably of the idea of an all girl cast saying that each year many girls colleges presented Shakespearian plays with marked success The main thing to be considered was the intelligent delivery of the great dramatist s lines The thing to do would be to find out what girls could most ably portray the various characters it would be necessary to try each girl separately with a few lines from the play In order to facilitate matters he suggested that those girls who really desired speaking parts step to one side of the room while those who wished merely to make the stage pictures step to the other Out of the eighty girls about thirty five only stepped over to the side from which the principal characters were to be chosen Many of the girls had no serious intentions whatever regarding the play and the awe inspired by mister Southard s presence made them too timid to venture to open their mouths before him Jessica whose courage had fled would have been among the latter if Nora had not seized her firmly by the arm as she prepared to flee and marched her over with the rest of the Phi Sigma Tau Eleanor and Edna Wright were among the junior contestants while there was a good showing of sophomores and freshmen mister Southard took in the aspirants with keen comprehensive glance His eyes rested a shade longer on Eleanor She made a striking picture as she stood looking with apparent indifference at the girls about her Then his quick eye traveled to Grace s fine face and graceful figure and then on to Anne whose small face was alive with the excitement of the moment A breathless silence had fallen over the room Every eye was fixed on the actor who stood with a small leather covered edition of As You Like It in his hand Miss Tebbs stood by with a pencil and pad The great try out was about to begin CHAPTER XIX THE TRY OUT Will the young lady on the extreme right please come forward said mister Southard pleasantly indicating Marian Barber who rather timidly obeyed taking the book he held out to her At his request she began to read from Orlando s entrance in the first scene of the fourth act She faltered a little on the first two lines but shortly regained her courage and read on in her best manner When she had read about a dozen lines he motioned for her to cease reading said something to Miss Tebbs who made an entry on her pad and beckoned to the girl next to Marian to come forward Straight down the line he went sometimes stopping a girl at her third or fourth line rarely allowing them to read farther than the eleventh or twelfth Nora was the second Phi Sigma Tau to undergo the ordeal As she briskly delivered the opening lines the actor stopped her Taking the book from her he turned to the part where Touchstone quaintly humorous holds forth upon the lie seven times removed Read this he said briefly holding out the book to Nora Nora began and read glibly on unconsciously emphasizing as she did so Down one page she read and half way through the next before mister Southard seemed satisfied Then he again held conversation with Miss Tebbs who nodded and looked smilingly toward Nora who stood scowling faintly rather ill pleased at attracting so much attention It looks as though Nora had made an impression doesn t it whispered Jessica to Grace who was about to reply when mister Southard motioned to her Grace who knew the scene by heart went fearlessly forward and read the lines with splendid emphasis Marian and Eva Allen followed her and acquitted themselves with credit Then Eleanor s turn came Handing her coat which she had taken off and carried upon her arm to Edna Wright she walked proudly over then without a trace of self consciousness began the reading of the designated lines Her voice sounded unusually clear and sweet yet lacked something of the power of expression displayed by Grace in her rendering of the same scene When she had finished she handed the book back with an air of studied indifference she was far from feeling She had decided in her own mind that Rosalind was the part best suited to her and felt that the honor now lay between herself and Grace No other girls with the exception of Nora had been allowed to read as much of any scene as they two had been requested to read But Eleanor had reckoned without her host for there was one girl who had not as yet come to the front The girl was Anne Pierson who in some mysterious manner had been all but overlooked until Miss Tebbs spied her standing between Grace and Nora Can you spare us a moment more mister Southard said Miss Tebbs to the actor who was preparing to leave You have almost missed hearing one of my best girls Come here Anne and prove the truth of my words Grace drew a long breath of relief She had eagerly awaited Anne s turn and was about to call Miss Tebbs s attention to Anne just as that teacher had observed her As most of the girls present had heard Anne recite there was a great craning of necks and a faint murmur of expectancy as she took her place They expected her to live up to her reputation and she had scarcely delivered the opening line before they realized that she would not disappoint them Her musical voice vibrated with expression and the mock serious bantering tones in which she delivered Rosalind s witty speeches caused mister Southard to smile and nod approvingly as she gave full value to the immortal lines Her change of voice from Rosalind to Orlando was wholly delightful and so charmingly did she depict both characters that when she ended with Orlando s exit she received a little ovation from the listening girls in which mister Southard and Miss Tebbs joined She s won She s won I m so glad Grace said softly to Nora and Jessica I wanted her to play Rosalind and I knew she could do it Look girls 
587_41619_000015_000004	train-clean-100	mister Southard is shaking hands with her 
none	none	True enough Anne was shyly shaking hands with the great actor who was congratulating her warmly upon her recent effort I have never before heard an amateur read those lines as well as you have to day Miss Pierson he said I am sure Rosalind will be safe with you for few professional women could have done better If I am anywhere near here when your play is enacted I shall make it a point to come and see it Shaking hands warmly with Miss Tebbs and bowing to the admiring girls mister Southard hurriedly departed leaving his audience devoured with curiosity as to the chosen ones Anne stood perfectly still looking rather dazed The unexpected had happened She was to have not only a part but the best part at that The girls gathered eagerly about her congratulating her on her success but she was too overcome to thank them and smiled at them through a mist of tears Look at Eleanor whispered Nora to Grace She s so angry she can t see straight She must have wanted to play Rosalind herself I told you she d sulk if she couldn t be the leading lady Grace glanced over toward Eleanor who stood biting her lip her hands clenched and her face set in angry lines
587_41619_000022_000000	train-clean-100	 She looks like the Vendetta or the Camorra or some other Italian vengeance agency doesn t she said Nora with a giggle 
587_41619_000023_000000	train-clean-100	Grace laughed in spite of herself at Nora s remark but regretted it the next moment for Eleanor saw the glances directed toward her and heard Nora s giggle 
587_41619_000023_000001	train-clean-100	She turned white and half started toward Grace then stopped and turning her back upon the Phi Sigma Tau began talking to Edna Wright 
none	none	Just then Miss Tebbs who had been busy with her list announced that she would now name the cast and all conversation ceased as by magic Miriam Nesbit was intrusted with the Duke while Marian Barber was to play Frederick his brother Jessica was in raptures over Phebe while Nora had captured Touchstone Eva Allen Audrey and to her great delight Grace was told that she was to play Orlando with Eleanor as Celia The other parts were assigned among the sophomores and freshmen who had made the best showing Mabel Allison getting the part of Jaques You will report for rehearsal next Tuesday afternoon after school when typewritten copies of your parts will be handed you said Miss Tebbs as she was about to leave the room The moment Miss Tebbs ceased talking the girls began as they gathered in little groups around the lucky ones and gave vent to their feelings with many exclamations of approval and congratulation Several girls approached Eleanor but she fairly ran from them and hurried out of the gymnasium after Miss Tebbs with Edna Wright and Daisy Culver at her heels There goes Eleanor after Miss Tebbs observed Marian Barber
587_41619_000028_000001	train-clean-100	 What do you suppose she s up to now 
none	none	Oh never mind her said Nora impatiently You ll see enough of her during rehearsal It will be so pleasant to rehearse with her considering that she isn t on speaking terms with any of us Had the girl chums known then what Eleanor was up to it would have been a matter of surprise and indignation to all of them After imperiously commanding her satellites to wait for her in the corridor Eleanor overtook Miss Tebbs just outside Miss Thompson s office I want to speak to you Miss Tebbs said Eleanor as the teacher paused her hand on the doorknob Well what can I do for you Miss Savell I want to speak to you about the play I wish to play Rosalind said Eleanor with calm assurance But my dear child Anne Pierson is to play Rosalind replied Miss Tebbs mister Southard particularly commended her work Did you not hear what he said Oh yes I heard him complimenting her replied Eleanor complacently but I feel sure that I can do more with it than she can I did not do my best work to day 
587_41619_000035_000002	train-clean-100	Besides Miss Pierson is too short 
none	none	I am certain of making a better appearance
587_41619_000036_000000	train-clean-100	 What you say about appearance is quite true Miss Savell replied Miss Tebbs frankly 
none	none	Beyond a doubt you would make a beautiful Rosalind but I am convinced that no other girl can enact the part with the spirit and dash that Miss Pierson can Your part of Celia is very well suited to you and you can win plenty of applause playing it You must understand however that once having given out a part I should not attempt to take it from the girl I had given it to simply because some other girl desired it That would be both unfair and unjust The only thing I could promise you would be to allow you to understudy Rosalind in case anything happened to Miss Pierson Would you care to understudy the part Eleanor was silent for a moment Miss Tebbs looking a trifle impatient stood awaiting her reply I should like to do that Eleanor said slowly a curious light in her eyes Thank you very much Miss Tebbs You are welcome replied the teacher Be sure and be prompt at rehearsal next Tuesday As Miss Tebbs entered the office Eleanor turned and walked slowly down the corridor So Miss Tebbs thinks I ought to be satisfied with Celia she muttered Very well I ll rehearse Celia but I ll understudy Rosalind and it will be very strange if something doesn t happen to Miss Pierson CHAPTER XX THE ANONYMOUS LETTER After the parts had been given out rehearsals for the play went merrily on There were many hitches at first but finally things settled down to smooth running order and as the time for its presentation approached Miss Tebbs had good reason to feel jubilant Each girl seemed bent on distinguishing herself and that teacher was heard laughingly to declare that she had an all star cast In spite of rehearsals Grace Harlowe s team found time for a few basketball games and whipped the senior team twice in succession much to the disgust of Captain Julia Crosby who threatened to go into deep mourning over what she called her dead and gone team She even composed a mournful ditty which she sang in their ears in a wailing minor key whenever she passed any of them and practically tormented them until they actually did win one hard fought victory over the juniors just to keep Julia from perpetrating her eternal chant as one of them remarked Eleanor had outwardly settled down to the routine of school work in a way that surprised even her aunt But inwardly she was seething with rebellion toward Miss Thompson and hatred of the Phi Sigma Tau She had fully determined that Anne Pierson should never play Rosalind and had hit upon a plan by which she hoped to accomplish her ends The Phi Sigma Tau were completely carried away with Anne s impersonation of Shakespeare s heroine and any blow struck at Anne would be equally felt by the others Anne had been absent from one rehearsal and thus Eleanor had had an opportunity to show her ability She had done very well and Miss Tebbs had praised her work though in her secret heart Eleanor knew that Anne s work was finer than her own But the means of gratifying her own personal vanity blinded her to everything except the fact that she wanted to play Rosalind regardless of Anne s superior ability To settle Miss Thompson was not so easy a matter and though Eleanor racked her brain for some telling method of vengeance no inspiration came until one afternoon in early March Professor La Roche irritated to the point of frenzy ordered her from his class with instructions to report herself to Miss Thompson As she entered the open door of the principal s office she noticed that the room was empty of occupants She stopped hesitated then went softly in a half formed idea in her mind that did not at first assume definite shape If Miss Thompson comes in I suppose I shall have to report myself thought Eleanor While I m here I ll just look about and see if I can t find some way to even up that public apology she made me make Gliding over to the open desk she ran her eye hastily over the various papers spread out upon it At first she found nothing of importance but suddenly she began to laugh softly her face lighted with malicious glee Here s the wonderful paper that Miss Tabby Cat Thompson is going to read before the Arts and Crafts Club to morrow she murmured I heard her telling Miss Chester about it yesterday She said it took her six weeks to prepare it on account of the time she spent in looking up her facts It will take me less than six minutes to dispose of it Seizing the essay with both hands she tore it across and then tore it again and again until it was literally reduced to shreds These she gathered into a heap and left in the middle of the desk Glancing about to see that no one was near she was about to step into the corridor when she heard the sound of approaching footsteps Quick as a flash she flung open the door of the little lavatory just outside the office and concealed herself just as a girl turned from the main corridor into the short passage leading to the principal s office Eleanor holding the door slightly ajar peered stealthily out at the new comer who was none other than Grace Harlowe Having no recitation that hour Grace had run up to the office to obtain Miss Thompson s permission to use the gymnasium that afternoon for basketball practice A hasty glance inside the office revealed to Grace that the principal was not there She hesitated a moment walked toward the desk then turned and went out again The moment she turned the corner Eleanor darted out of the lavatory and fled down the corridor just as the bell rang for the end of the period In a moment the main corridor was filled with girls from the various classrooms and joining them Eleanor entered the study hall without reporting her dismissal from French class She was somewhat nervous and trembled a little at the thought of her near discovery but felt not the slightest qualm of conscience at her ruthless destruction of another s property On the contrary she experienced a wicked satisfaction and smiled to herself as she pictured Miss Thompson s consternation when the latter should discover her loss Best of all the principal would never find out who did it for Eleanor vowed never to admit her guilt She decided to go at once to Professor La Roche and apologize so that he would not report her to Miss Thompson Without a doubt an effort would be made to find the culprit and if it were proven that she did not return to the study hall as soon as dismissed from French she might be asked to account for it and thus call down suspicion upon herself On her way to rhetoric recitation she stopped at Professor La Roche s door greatly astonishing him by a prettily worded apology which he readily accepted and beamed upon her with forgiving good nature Feeling that she had bridged that difficulty Eleanor entered the classroom to find Miss Thompson talking in low guarded tones to Miss Chester who looked both shocked and surprised She caught the words entirely destroyed serious offence and investigate at once Then the principal left the room and Miss Chester turned to the class and began the recitation To Eleanor s surprise nothing was said of the matter that day School was dismissed as usual and the girls went out without dreaming that on the morrow they would all be placed under suspicion until the person guilty of the outrage was found The following morning after opening exercises Miss Thompson stated briefly the destruction of her paper I was out of my office barely ten minutes she said yet when I returned some one had ruthlessly torn the essay to bits and left the pieces piled in the middle of my desk As I had spent considerable time and research in getting the subject matter together the destruction of the paper is particularly annoying Whoever was contemptible enough to engage in such mischief must have known this It looks like a deliberate attempt to insult me It is hard to believe one of my girls guilty yet it is not probable that any one outside could be responsible A girl who would wilfully do such a thing is a menace to the school and should be removed from it I am not going to any extreme measures to find the miscreant Were I to question each girl in turn I fear the offender might perjure herself rather than admit her guilt But I am confident that sooner or later I shall know the truth of the matter As Miss Thompson concluded she looked over the roomful of girls who sat watching her with serious faces Which one of them was guilty Time alone would tell At recess that morning the subject of the play was for once forgotten in the excitement occasioned by the principal s recent disclosure Groups of girls indignantly denied even the thought of such mischief I don t believe Miss Thompson would ever suspect us of any such thing remarked Jessica to her friends Of course not goose replied Grace She knows us too well for that But it was with a peculiar apprehension of something unpleasant that Grace answered a summons to the principal s office just before school closed for the day Grace she said as the young girl entered the office were you in my office yesterday afternoon between half past one and a quarter of two Why yes Miss Thompson I came to ask permission to use the gymnasium but you were out so I came back and asked you just before school closed Yes I remember that you did replied the principal However I want you to read this Grace took the paper looking rather perplexed and read Ask Miss Harlowe what she was doing in your office between half past one and a quarter of two yesterday A PASSERBY Why why stammered Grace her eyes growing large with wonder I don t understand I came here at that time for I looked at the clock as I came in but I was only here for a second Then the truth dawned upon her Why Miss Thompson she cried you surely don t think I tore up your essay No Grace I don t replied the principal But I believe that the one who wrote this note is the one who did do it and evidently wishes to fasten the guilt upon you It looks to me as though we had a common enemy Do you recognize either the paper or the writing No replied Grace slowly shaking her head Vertical writing all looks alike The paper is peculiar It is note paper but different from any I ever saw before It looks like She stopped suddenly a shocked look creeping into her eyes What is it Grace said Miss Thompson who had been closely watching her I just had a queer idea faltered Grace If you suspect any one Grace it is your duty to tell me said the principal I cannot pass lightly over such a piece of wanton destruction To clear up this mystery should be a matter of vital interest to you too as this letter is really an insinuation against you Grace was silent I am waiting for you Grace said the principal Will you do as I wish The tears rushed to Grace s eyes Forgive me Miss Thompson she said tremulously but I can tell you nothing You are doing wrong Grace in withholding your knowledge said the older woman rather sternly and I am greatly displeased at your stubbornness Ordinarily I would not ask you to betray any of your schoolmates but in this instance I am justified and you are making a serious mistake in sacrificing your duty upon the altar of school girl honor I am sorry Miss Thompson said Grace striving to steady her voice I value your good opinion above everything but I can tell you nothing you wish to know Please please don t ask me Very well responded the principal in a tone of cold dismissal turning to her desk With a half stifled sob Grace hurried from the room For the first time since entering High School she had incurred the displeasure of her beloved principal and all for the sake of a girl who was unworthy of the sacrifice For Grace had recognized the paper It was precisely the same style of paper on which Eleanor Savell had declined her Thanksgiving invitation CHAPTER XXI BREAKERS AHEAD The dress rehearsal for As You Like It was over It had been well nigh perfect The costumes had for the most part been on hand as the senior class of five years previous had given the same play and bequeathed their paraphernalia to those who should come after Rosalind s costumes had to be altered to fit Anne however on account of her lack of stature Also the lines in the text where Rosalind refers to her height underwent some changes The final details having been attended to Miss Tebbs and Miss Kane found time to congratulate each other on the smoothness of the production which bade fair to surpass anything of the kind ever before given There was not a weak spot in the cast Anne s work had seemed to grow finer with every rehearsal She had won the repeated applause of the group of teachers who had been invited to witness this trial performance Grace Nora Eleanor and Miriam had ably supported her and there had been tears of proud joy in Miss Tebbs s eyes as she had watched the clever and spirited acting of these girls Be sure and put your costumes exactly where they belong called Miss Tebbs as the girls filed off the stage into the dressing room after the final curtain Then you will have no trouble to morrow night We want to avoid all eleventh hour scrambling and exciting costume hunts Laughing merrily the girls began choosing places to hang their costumes in the big room off the stage where they were to dress Anne careful little soul that she was piled her paraphernalia neatly in one corner and taking a slip of paper from her bag wrote Rosalind upon it pinning it to her first act costume The eternal labeler said Nora with her ever ready giggle as she watched Anne Are you afraid it will run away little Miss Fussbudget No of course not said Anne smiling I just marked it because You have the marking habit finished Jessica Come on girls Don t tease Anne Let her put tags on herself if she wants to Then a certain young man who is waiting outside for her will be sure to recognize her Has anyone seen that Allison child It s time she put in an appearance Just listen to Grandmother Bright teased Anne She is hunting her lost chick as usual With merry laugh and jest the girls prepared for the street Grace and her friends were among the first to leave and hurried to the street where the boys awaited them Hurrah for the only original ranters and barnstormers on exhibition in this country cried Hippy waving his hat in the air Cease Hippopotamus said Nora You are mistaken We are stars but we shall refuse to twinkle in your sky unless you suddenly become more respectful He doesn t know the definition of the word said David How cruelly you misjudge me said Hippy I meant no disrespect It was a sudden attack of enthusiasm I get them spasmodically So we have observed said Nora dryly Let s not stand here discussing you all night Come on up to my house and we ll make fudge and have things to eat I have my car here said David Pile into it and we ll be up there in a jiffy It s awfully late demurred Grace After ten o clock Never mind that said Nora Your mother knows you can take care of yourself You can phone to her from my house In another minute the young people had seated themselves in the big car and were off Did you see Eleanor s runabout standing there Nora asked Grace Yes replied Grace I was rather surprised too She hasn t used it much of late How beautiful she looked to night didn t she interposed Jessica Are you talking of the would be murderess who froze us all out Thanksgiving Day asked Hippy What is her latest crime Grace felt like saying Destroying other people s property and getting innocent folks disliked but refrained She had told no one of her interview with Miss Thompson Grace knew that the principal was still displeased with her She was no longer on the old terms of intimacy with Miss Thompson A barrier seemed to have sprung up between them that only one thing could remove but Grace was resolved not to expose Eleanor not that she felt that Eleanor did not richly deserve it but she knew that it would mean instant expulsion from school She believed that Eleanor had acted on the impulse of the moment and was without doubt bitterly sorry for it and she felt that as long as Eleanor had at last begun to be interested in school the thing to do was to keep her there particularly as missus Gray had recently told her of Miss Nevin s pleasure at the change that the school had apparently wrought in Eleanor Could Grace have known what Eleanor was engaged in at the moment she would have felt like exposing her without mercy During the first rehearsals Grace secretly fearing an outbreak on Eleanor s part had been on the alert but as rehearsals progressed and Eleanor kept strictly to herself Grace relaxed her vigilance Directly after the chums had hurried out of the hall to meet the boys Miss Tebbs had decided that opening the dressing room on the other side of the stage would relieve the congestion and insure a better chance for all to dress Calling to the girls who still remained to move their belongings to that side Miss Tebbs hurried across the stage to find the janitor and see that the door was at once unlocked By the time the door was opened and the lights turned on the remaining girls flocked in their arms piled high with costumes Foremost among them was Eleanor Hastily depositing her own costumes in one corner of the dressing room she darted across the stage and into the room from which she had just moved her effects It was empty She glanced quickly about Like a flash she gathered up a pile of costumes marked Rosalind covered them with her long fur coat and ran through the hall and down the steps to where her runabout was stationed Crowding them hastily into the bottom of the machine she slipped on her coat made ready her runabout and drove down the street like the wind not lessening her speed until she reached the drive at Heartsease The young people passed a merry hour at Nora s indulging in one of their old time frolics that only lacked Tom Gray s presence to make the original octette complete We ll be in the front row to morrow night said Hippy as the young folks trooped out to the car I have engaged a beautiful bunch of green onions from the truck florist Reddy has put all his money into carrots of a nice lively color the exact shade of his hair while I have advised Davy here to invest in turnips They are nice and round and hard and will hit the stage with a resounding whack providing he can throw straight enough to hit anything He can carry them in a paper bag and But before he could say more he was seized by David and Reddy and rushed unceremoniously into the street while the girls signified their approbation by cries of good enough for him and make him promise to behave to morrow night I will I swear it panted Hippy Only don t rush me over the ground so fast I might lose my breath and never never catch it again Oh let him go said Nora who had accompanied them down the walk I ll have a private interview with him to morrow and that will insure his good behavior Thank you angel Nora replied Hippy gratefully You will be spared any obnoxious vegetables even though the others may suffer For that you walk said David who had dropped Hippy and was engaged in helping the girls into the machine Never replied Hippy making a dive for the automobile I shall sit at the feet of the fair Jessica Reddy will be so pleased Every one ready sang out David as he took his place at the wheel after cranking up the machine All ready let her go was the chorus and the machine whizzed down the street CHAPTER XXII AS YOU LIKE IT The big dressing rooms on each side of the stage at Assembly Hall were ablaze with light There was a hum of girlish voices and gay laughter and all the pleasant excitement attending an amateur production prevailed The dressing had been going on for the last hour and now a goodly company of courtiers and dames stood about waiting while Miss Tebbs and Miss Kane rapidly made up their faces with rouge and powder This being done to prevent them from looking too pale when in the white glare of the footlights Miriam Nesbit as the Duke looked particularly fine and the girls gathered around her with many exclamations of admiration Nora s roguish face looked out from her fool s cap in saucy fashion as she flitted about jingling her bells Grace made a handsome Orlando while Jessica looked an ideal shepherdess Where s Anne said Grace as Nora paused in front of her I haven t see her to night I suppose she s over in the other dressing room Miss Tebbs said that some of the costumes were moved over there after we left last night What time is it I didn t wear my watch to night because I didn t want to risk losing it It s almost half past seven said Jessica I asked Miss Tebbs for the time just a few minutes ago Let s go and find Anne at once then said Nora It s getting late and she surely is dressed by this time Then we ll look through the hole in the curtain at the house People are beginning to arrive Wait a minute said Jessica There s Mabel Doesn t she look great as Jaques Come here dear called Jessica Mabel Allison joined the three girls who hurried across the stage to the other dressing room in search of Anne Pierson Why I don t see her here cried Grace making a quick survey of the room She must be somewhere about for There she goes now exclaimed Nora who stood in the door looking out on the stage and she has her hat and coat on How strange I wonder if she knows how late it is Sure enough Anne was hurrying toward the opposite dressing room The three girls made a rush for her Why Anne said Grace What is the matter We thought you had dressed over here and were looking for you Girls replied Anne I ve been on a wild goose chase I can t stop to tell you about it now but you shall hear as soon as I have a chance Will you help me with my costume and make up I m awfully late and haven t a minute to spare Why of course we will said Grace Give me your hat and coat dear Where did you put your costumes It won t take you long to dress for most of the girls are dressed and over on the other side so you have the place to yourself Over in that corner replied Anne taking off her collar and unfastening her white shirt waist Don t you remember I labeled them and you laughed at me for doing so Of course we do said Nora making a dive for the corner where Anne had piled her costumes the previous night They re not here she announced after a brief but thorough search Miss Tebbs must have had them moved to the other room She opened it last night after we left Grace you help Anne and Jessica and Mabel and I will run across and look for them With these words Nora was off the other two girls at her heels Tell me what kept you Anne said Grace as the latter began arranging her hair for the first act Grace said Anne rather tremulously I won t wait until the others come back to tell you why I came so late Just after I had finished my supper and was putting on my wraps a boy came to the door with this note Anne went over to where her coat hung and took out an envelope Drawing a note from it she silently handed it to Grace who read MY DEAR ANNE Will you come up to my house before going to the hall I wish to give you something to wear in the play Yours affectionately ROSE R GRAY Why how unlike missus Gray to send for you at the eleventh hour said Grace in a puzzled tone No wonder you were late What did she give you Nothing replied Anne It was a trick She never wrote the note although the writing looks like hers and so does the paper She was very indignant over it and sent me back in the carriage telling the coachman to return for her for of course she will be here to night I would have arrived much later if I had been obliged to walk I ran almost all the way up there You know Chapel Hill is quite a distance from my house I should say so replied Grace Who could have been so mean Anne why do you suppose Grace stopped suddenly and stared at Anne Anne do you think that Eleanor could have written it she said slowly as though reluctant to give voice to her suspicion I am afraid so replied Anne She is the only one who could profit by my being late Yet if she did write the note she should have realized that going to missus Gray s would scarcely keep me away long enough to miss my first entrance You know I don t come on until the second scene There is something more behind this said Grace and I m going to find out too She darted to the door and opened it upon Nora and Jessica who were on the threshold We can t find them they cried in alarm but we told Miss Tebbs and she ll be here in a minute We didn t say a word to any one else said Nora because they must be somewhere about and there is no use in stirring up a lot of unnecessary excitement Wise little Nora said Grace patting her on the shoulder Here comes Miss Tebbs now She stepped courteously aside to allow the teacher to enter the dressing room then following her closed the door What is this I hear about losing your costumes Anne asked Miss Tebbs rather impatiently I cautioned the girls last night about taking care of their things Anne flushed at the teacher s curt tones I put them all in that corner plainly marked before I left here last night she answered When I came here to night they were gone That is strange said the elder woman Have you made a thorough search for them in the other room We ve gone over every inch of the ground exclaimed Jessica and we can t find a trace of them We didn t ask any of the girls about them because if we couldn t find them we feel sure the others couldn t So we just kept quiet I don t know what is to be done I m sure said Miss Tebbs in an anxious tone It is eight o clock now and the curtain is supposed to run up at eight point fifteen I can hold it until eight point thirty but no longer The house is already well filled You might get through the first act in a borrowed gown Anne but what can you do in the second You know how that costume had to be altered to fit you If it can be found before the second act all will be well but suppose you go on in the first act and it can t be found what then You will spoil the whole production by appearing in an incorrect or misfit costume besides bitterly disappointing the two girls who will have to give up their costumes to you It is doubly provoking because mister Southard is here to night and is particularly anxious to see your work Miss Tebbs exclaimed Grace Eleanor Savell has a complete Rosalind outfit She had it made purposely One of the girls told me so You know she understudies Anne Couldn t Anne use that Impossible Grace said Miss Tebbs Eleanor is taller than Anne Anne s lack of height is her one drawback If she had not shown such exceptional talent Rosalind would have certainly fallen to Miss Savell or yourself I am very sorry but it looks as though Miss Savell will have to play Rosalind after all and she must be notified at once The three chums turned to Anne who was biting her lip and trying hard to keep back her tears Nora and Jessica looked their silent sympathy but Grace stood apparently wrapped in thought Miss Tebbs moved toward the door but as she placed her hand on the knob Grace sprang eagerly forward Miss Tebbs she cried don t ask Miss Savell I believe I can find those costumes yet Wait here and in five minutes I ll tell you whether I have succeeded Please don t ask me what I am going to do Just trust me and wait You will let me try won t you she pleaded Certainly my child said Miss Tebbs but remember time is precious I ll give you five minutes but if I ll be back in that time cried Grace and was gone leaving Miss Tebbs and the three chums mystified but faintly hopeful Across the stage she flew and into the other dressing room The object of her search was not there Out she rushed and collided with a girl who was about to enter Pardon me said Grace glancing up then seized the girl by the arm Eleanor Savell she exclaimed sternly You know where Anne s costumes are Don t attempt to deny it Eleanor looked contemptuously at Grace and tried to shake herself free but Grace s grasp tightened Answer me she said Where are they Illustration Where Are Anne s Costumes Cried Grace Let me go said Eleanor angrily You are hurting my arm What do I care about Miss Pierson s costumes You will care replied Grace For if you don t instantly tell me where they are I shall call the whole cast and expose you If you do you will merely make yourself ridiculous hissed Eleanor her eyes blazing What grounds have you for such an accusation I can t prove that you are responsible for their disappearance but I do know that you shall not play Rosalind if the costumes are never found How can you prevent me asked Eleanor in insolent tones You are not running this production I have no time to waste in arguing the matter returned Grace with admirable self control What I want is the truth about the costumes and you must answer me Must repeated Eleanor raising her eyebrows That is putting it rather strongly No one ever says must to me I say it to you now Eleanor and I mean it said Grace I am fully convinced that you have hidden Anne s costumes and I am equally certain that you are going to produce them at once Then you are laboring under a delusion replied Eleanor with a disagreeable laugh and I should advise you to devote that tireless energy of yours to minding your own business This is my business replied Grace evenly and if you wish to avoid any unpleasantness you will make it yours Your threats do not alarm me sneered Eleanor I am not easily frightened Very well replied Grace looking steadily at her enemy I see that I shall be obliged to call Miss Thompson back here and tell her who destroyed her essay Knowing that do you suppose you can make her believe that you did not hide Anne s costumes Eleanor s insolent expression turned to one of fear No she gasped don t call Miss Thompson You know she hates me and will disgrace me in the eyes of the girls And you richly deserve it Eleanor replied Grace but if you produce Anne s costumes at once I ll agree to say nothing Hurry for every second is precious I can t get them wailed Eleanor What shall I do Where are they asked Grace with compressed lips At Heartsease said Eleanor and burst into tears Oh what a mess groaned Grace It will take an hour to go there and back Oh I must act quickly Let me think missus Gray s coachman would drive me out but those horses are so slow Eleanor she exclaimed turning to the weeping girl is your runabout outside Yes sobbed Eleanor Then that settles it cried Grace I will go after the things Tell me where to find them Have you a latch key I can t bother to ring after I get there I ll go and get my key said Eleanor wiping her eyes They re in the wardrobe in my bedroom All right wait for me at the door and don t say a word Here come some of the girls Though the time had seemed hours to Grace her interview with Eleanor had lasted barely five minutes She hurried back to where Miss Tebbs and the three chums awaited her followed by the curious eyes of a number of the cast who wondered vaguely why Grace Harlowe was rushing around at such a rate Borrow a gown for Anne Miss Tebbs for the first act she cried I ll have the missing costumes here in time for the second Only I can t play Orlando Miriam will have to play it she s my understudy you know Ethel Dumont can play Miriam s part They ve rehearsed both parts and will be all right Please don t refuse me Miss Tebbs but let me go It s for Anne s sake Nora please bring me my street clothes As she spoke Grace began rapidly divesting herself of her costume Very well Grace have your own way replied the teacher reluctantly I ll go at once and get a gown for Anne But don t dare to fail me Thank you Miss Tebbs I ll not fail Slipping into her long coat and seizing her fur hat Grace made for the street stopping for an instant to take the key from Eleanor who stood waiting at the door Can you manage the machine faltered Eleanor Yes said Grace curtly Go in at once If you are seen the girls are apt to ask questions that you may find hard to answer truthfully Thank goodness David and Tom taught me something about automobiles last summer thought Grace as she prepared to start or I should have been powerless to help Anne to night I am going to exceed the speed limit that s certain A moment later she was well into the street and on her way to Heartsease It was a memorable ride to Grace It seemed as though the runabout fairly flew over the ground I ve only been ten minutes on the way she breathed as she neared her destination Leaving the runabout outside the grounds she ran up the drive and inserting her key in the door opened it softly and entered the wide old fashioned hall Up the steps she hurried meeting no one for Miss Nevin was at Assembly Hall and the servants quarters were at the back of the house Knowing the house as she did Grace went straight to Eleanor s room and to the wardrobe Sure enough Anne s missing costumes were lying in a neat heap on the floor Assuring herself that everything was there Grace piled them up in her arms and sped softly down the stairs opened the door and in a twinkling was down the drive and into the runabout She drove back even faster than she had come As she passed the city hall clock she drew a breath of relief It was ten minutes of nine The first act was hardly half over Leaping from the machine with the lost costumes she ran triumphantly into the dressing room Here she is shrieked Nora in delight I knew she d make good Are they all there Grace anxiously inquired Miss Tebbs You dear good child Where did you find them That is a mystery which even Sherlock Holmes can never solve replied Grace laughing Where s Anne She s on just now with Celia replied Miss Tebbs and is playing up to her usual form but she is very nervous and almost broke down after you left She feels that you made too great a sacrifice for her in giving up your part Nonsense said Grace Why should I have sacrificed the star to my own personal vanity Miriam Nesbit can play Orlando as well as I and makes a more striking appearance at that I don t agree with you Grace for you were an ideal Orlando replied Miss Tebbs However it s too late for regret and the best I can do now is to make you assistant stage manager Some of those girls need looking after Miss Savell had a bad case of stage fright and almost had to be dragged on She forgot her lines and had to be prompted She s all right now but I am devoutly thankful she didn t play Rosalind for she certainly would not have done justice to it Grace smiled grimly as she listened to Miss Tebbs She could not feel sorry at Eleanor s recent agitation Now that the excitement was over Grace felt her anger rising Eleanor s thirst for glory and revenge had been the means of losing Grace the part that she had so eagerly looked forward to playing not to mention the narrow escape Anne had run Still on the whole Grace felt glad that so far no one knew the truth I think I ll go into the wings It s almost time for the curtain she said to Miss Tebbs But before she could reach there the curtain had rung down and the audience were calling for Celia and Rosalind who took the call hand in hand Then Rosalind took two calls and bowed herself into the wings and straight into Grace s arms O Grace how could you do it said Anne with a half sob You gave up your part for me It s too much I shan t You shall replied Grace hugging her Run along and put on male attire I found your stuff and some time I ll tell you where but not now The play progressed with remarkable smoothness and the various actors received unstinted applause from the audience but from first to last Anne was the star Her portrayal of Rosalind left little to be desired Time after time mister Southard led the applause and was ably seconded by Hippy Reddy David and Tom who fairly wriggled with enthusiasm Next to Anne Nora perhaps came second Her delivery of Touchstone s lines was delightful and she kept the audience in a gale of mirth whenever she appeared It was over at last The closing line of the Epilogue had been spoken by Rosalind and she had taken five curtain calls and retired with her arms full of flowers The principal actors in the play had been well remembered by friends and the dressing rooms looked like a florist s shop I m so sorry I d like to begin all over again said Nora as she rubbed her face with cold cream to take off her make up There s an end to all things said Jessica practically and really I m glad to get back into everyday clothes Hurry up slowpokes said Grace Harlowe popping her head in the door Tom Gray is here He and David are waiting outside with their cars We are all going up to Nesbit s for a jollification given in honor of Rosalind who is at present dressed in everyday clothes and shaking hands with the great Southard He and Miss Tebbs are going too and so is missus Gray Come in Grace and tell us where you found Anne s costumes said Nora giving her cheeks a final rub We re devoured with curiosity Thereby hangs a tale replied Grace but I refuse to be interviewed to night I ll see you outside If you re not there in three minutes I ll put Hippy on your trail Closing the door Grace walked slowly toward the entrance The majority of the girls had gone Anne still stood talking with mister Southard and Miss Tebbs Grace come here and speak to mister Southard called Miss Tebbs Has Nora gone mister Southard wishes to congratulate her and you too She ll be out in a couple of minutes said Grace as she advanced to greet the great actor But I am not in line for congratulations as I was not in the play I am very sorry that you could not play Orlando to night I remember your work at the try out said mister Southard in his deep musical voice Miss Tebbs has told me of the sacrifice you made You deserve double congratulations for the part you played behind the scenes It was nothing murmured Grace her color rising If you are ready suppose we go missus Gray wishes you and mister Southard to go in her carriage Miss Tebbs The rest of us will go in the two automobiles As they moved toward the door Grace left them Going back to the dressing room she rapped sharply on the door Last call Look out for Hippy she cried then hurried to catch up with the others But before she reached them she was confronted by Eleanor I ve been waiting to see you ever since the play was over said Eleanor sullenly Grace looked at her in silence Well she said coldly What are you going to do about to night and everything asked Eleanor Are you going to tell Miss Thompson So far I have told nothing Eleanor said Grace sternly You deserve no clemency at my hands however for you have repeatedly accused myself and my friends of carrying tales Something we are above doing You have refused our friendship and have been the means of estranging Miss Thompson and myself When first you came to High School I promised missus Gray that I would help you to like High School life For that reason I have overlooked lots of things but to night caps the climax and I tell you frankly that I thoroughly despise your conduct and if ever again you do anything to injure myself or my friends I shall not hesitate to bring you to book for it Eleanor stood clenching her hands in impotent rage Grace s plain speaking had roused a tempest in her I hate you Grace Harlowe fifty times more than ever before she said her voice shaking with anger I intended to leave this miserable school at the end of the year but now I shall stay and show you that you cannot trample upon me with impunity Without answering Grace walked away leaving Eleanor to stare moodily after her CHAPTER XXIII THE JUNIOR PICNIC With the first days of spring the longing to throw down her books and fairly live in the open returned to Grace Harlowe with renewed force I do wish school were over she said with a sigh to her three chums as they strolled home one afternoon in May I don t mind studying in the winter but when the spring comes then it s another matter I long to golf and play tennis and picnic in the woods and That reminds me said Nora interrupting her that last fall the juniors talked about giving a picnic instead of a ball We didn t give the ball so it s up to us to go picnicking That s a fine suggestion Nora said Jessica I move we post a notice in the locker room and have a meeting to morrow after school I can t be there said Anne regretfully To morrow is one of my days at missus Gray s but whatever you do will suit me Awfully sorry Anne said Grace We might call it for the day after to morrow No no protested Anne Please don t postpone it on my account The notice was duly posted in a conspicuous place in the locker room the next day and the entire class with the exception of Anne met in one of the smaller rooms off the gymnasium at the close of the afternoon session Esteemed juniors and fellow citizens said Grace after calling the meeting to order It is true that no one has particularly requested me to take charge of this meeting but as I posted the notice I feel that I am responsible for your presence here to day We have before us two matters that need attention One is the annual entertainment that the junior class always gives the other the election of class officers Last year we gave a ball but this year so far we have done nothing I move that we proceed at once to elect our president vice president secretary and treasurer and then decide what form of entertainment would be advisable Second the motion said Nora All those in favor say aye contrary no Carried said Grace as no dissenting voices arose Nominations for president are now in order I nominate Grace Harlowe for president exclaimed Miriam Nesbit springing from her seat Second the motion said Eva Allen It was carried with enthusiasm before Grace had time to protest I nominate Miriam Nesbit for president said Grace This was also seconded and carried Then Edna Wright rose and nominated Eleanor Savell This closed the nominations for president and the matter when put to vote resulted in Grace s election by a majority of ten votes over Miriam Eleanor having received only five It was plain to be seen that in spite of the rival faction Grace held first place in the hearts of most of her class Miriam Nesbit was elected vice president Marian Barber treasurer and rather to Grace s surprise Eleanor was chosen as secretary Edna Wright again nominating her after doing some vigorous whispering among the two back rows of girls The only other girl proposed being one who was not particularly popular in the class I always suspected Edna Wright s lack of sense whispered Nora to Jessica The idea of nominating Eleanor for secretary when she knows how Eleanor hates the Phi Sigma Tau and doesn t speak to any of us I certainly didn t vote for her Nor I responded Jessica Funny Grace would never tell us about that costume business I know Eleanor was mixed up in it Of course nodded Nora and turned her attention to the meeting just in time to hear Grace put the motion for the picnic and say aye with the others The date for the affair was set for the following Saturday the weather permitting and it was generally agreed that Forest Park a natural park about twelve miles from Oakdale would be an ideal place to picnic A refreshment committee was appointed also a transportation committee The girls were requested to pay fifty cents apiece to the treasurer If we find that this is not enough we will levy another tax Grace announced I m not positive about the first collection muttered Nora I m perpetually broke So am I said Jessica My allowance lasts about two days and then I am penniless for the rest of the month The details having been disposed of the members decided to meet in front of the High School the following Saturday morning at nine o clock The transportation committee was to have two big picnic wagons in readiness and the juniors went home with pleasant anticipations of a day in the woods Won t it be fun exclaimed Grace joyously as she walked down the street the center of the Phi Sigma Tau Great said Miriam Nesbit I suppose we could all squeeze into David s automobile I believe we d better not replied Grace It might create bad feeling among the girls We don t want them to feel that we think ourselves too exclusive to ride with them I ll wager anything Eleanor and Edna won t go with the crowd said Eva Allen I don t know about that remarked Nora O Malley Eleanor has just been elected secretary therefore it behooves her to keep on the right side of those who elected her She owes her office to Edna Wright said Marian Barber and also to the fact that her opponent Miss Wells is not popular For my part I think Miss Wells would have been a better secretary We could at least have gotten along peaceably with her I can t see why Eleanor accepted knowing she would have to act with us in class matters I have noticed that ever since the play she has been trying to gain a footing in the class said Miriam Nesbit thoughtfully She has gone out of her way to be nice to girls that she used to snub unmercifully We are the only ones she keeps away from I believe she will try to influence the rest of the class against us She ll have to hurry up if she does it this term said Nora Perhaps she won t come back to school next year she is so changeable said Jessica hopefully Yes she will said Grace taking part in the discussion for the first time since it had touched on Eleanor How do you know was the question She told me so the night of the play was Grace s answer Girls I have never told you about what happened that night Anne knows but you see it particularly concerned her I was too angry at the time to trust myself to tell any one else As members of the same sorority I know that you can be trusted not to repeat what I shall tell you In a few words Grace told the story of Eleanor s treachery omitting however the part concerning Miss Thompson She had decided to reveal that to no one Well of all things said Nora O Malley I knew she was to blame So she threatened revenge did she Yes replied Grace That is why I have told you this Be careful what you do Never give her a chance to take advantage of you in any way for she is determined to make mischief Now let us forget her and talk about the picnic With the talk of the picnic Grace s warning soon passed from the girls minds They had no knowledge of the trials that their senior year was to bring them or how fully the truth of Grace s words was to be proved The day of the picnic dawned fair and cloudless By nine o clock a merry party of laughing chattering girls had gathered in front of the High School where the two immense wagons generally used by Oakdale picnickers each drawn by four horses awaited them For a wonder every one was on time and the start was made with a great fluttering of handkerchiefs accompanied by enthusiastic cheers and High School yells As they rattled down the street people paused and looked smilingly after them Oakdale was very proud of her High School boys and girls and enjoyed seeing them happy The Phi Sigma Tau were seated in one end of the second wagon with the exception of Grace who had perched herself on the driver s seat and was holding an animated conversation with the driver old Jerry Flynn whom every one knew and liked Grace always cultivated old Jerry s acquaintance whenever she had the chance To day he was allowing her to drive while with folded hands he directed her management of the lines Grace was in her element and gave a sigh of regret as they sighted the park I could go on driving four horses forever mister Flynn she exclaimed Do let me drive going back Sure yez can miss said the good natured Irishman and it s meself ll hellup yez and show yez how to do it The committee on entertainment had provided a series of races and contests for the morning After lunch there would be a tennis match and then the girls could amuse themselves as they chose the start home to be made about six o clock Grace and Nora decided to enter the hundred yard dash The prize is a box of stationery bought at the ten cent store so I am anxious to win it Nora informed them In fact all the prizes came from that useful and overworked place I was on the purchasing committee I shall enter the one legged race I always could stand on one foot like a crane announced Jessica and hopping is my specialty There was an egg and spoon race a walking match an apple eating contest with the apples suspended by strings from the low branch of a tree to be eaten without aid from the hands and various other stunts of a similar nature The morning passed like magic Each new set of contestants seemed funnier than the preceding one Nora won the coveted box of stationery Jessica ably demonstrated her ability to outhop her competitors while Eva Allen covered herself with glory in the apple contest Grace after losing the hundred yard dash laughingly refused to enter the other contests I mean to win at tennis this afternoon she said so I m not going to waste my precious energy on such little stunts After the midday luncheon had been disposed of the entire class repaired to the tennis court at the east end of the park A match had been arranged in which Grace and Miriam Nesbit were to play against Ruth Deane and Edna Wright who was an indefatigable tennis player and therefore figured frequently in tennis matches held in Oakdale At the last minute however Edna pleaded a severe headache and recommended Eleanor in her place But I never have played with her protested Ruth Deane and how do I know whether she can play Try her begged Edna I have played with her and she is a wonder It was with considerable surprise and some misgiving that Grace discovered that Eleanor was to play I seem fated to oppose her Grace thought I wonder at her consenting to play against us I ll keep my eye on her at any rate for I don t trust her Grace s fears were in this instance groundless for Eleanor played a perfectly fair game from start to finish and proved herself a powerful antagonist Her serves were as straight and accurate as a boy s and she played with great spirit and agility Indeed the sides were so evenly matched that junior excitement rose high and numerous boxes of Huyler s were wagered against the result The game stood forty all Two vantages scored in succession were needed by one side to win Grace forgot everything but the fact that she desired the victory With her going into a game meant winning it Five minutes later the match was over She and Miriam had won against worthy opponents That was an evenly matched game exclaimed Nora as Grace and Miriam strolled to where their friends were seated upon the grass You played like professionals Eleanor is a better player than Edna Wright said Grace Her serves are wonderful We had all we could do to hold our own There s a trout brook over there said Nora and I had forethought enough to borrow a fishing rod and line from Hippy It is jointed so it didn t get in any one s way I left it with the lunch baskets Therefore as I m not afraid of angle worms I m going to dig some bait and fish Want to come Not I laughed Anne Miriam and I are going up under the trees and read Browning The idea of going to a picnic and reading exclaimed Jessica Come on girls let s go with Nora She hastily rose brushed off her gown and followed in Nora s wake accompanied by Eva and Marian Come with us dear said Anne to Grace who stood looking dreamily toward a patch of woods to the left No indeed replied Grace I m going to explore a little in those woods yonder Don t go far called Anne anxiously as Grace turned to go I won t she answered See you later As she reached the cool shadows of the little strip of woods she drew a long breath How delightful it was to hear the rustle of the leaves over her head and tread upon Nature s green carpet of soft thick moss Forgetful of her promise Grace wandered farther and farther on gathering the wild flowers as she went She found plenty of trilliums and violets and pounced with a cry of delight upon some wild pink honeysuckle just opening After stripping the bush she turned into a bypath that led straight up a little hill which rose before her Scrambling up the hill Grace reached the top and looked about her Nestling at the foot of the elevation on the side opposite to the one she had climbed stood a small one story cottage How funny thought Grace I didn t know there was a house anywhere near here I m going down there for a drink of water I m awfully thirsty Suiting the action to the words Grace hurried toward the cottage As she neared it she noticed that the door was wide open Some one is at home that s certain she said to herself I hope they won t be cross at my asking for a drink Why she exclaimed there s no one living here at all I think I ll venture in perhaps there s a well at the back of the house Entering she found that the cottage consisted of but two rooms The front one was absolutely bare but the back one contained an old stove a broken down sink and a rickety chair At one side was a good sized closet Opening it Grace found nothing save a dilapidated old coat Just then she caught the sound of rough voices just outside the cottage I tell ye Bill we ve got to do the job to night and hike for the West on that train that goes through Oakdale at three point fifteen in the morning said a voice that was almost a growl I m wid yer Jim answered another voice in correspondingly savage tones Even to layin a few out stiff if dey gets in de way Grace listened She heard heavy footsteps and peeping into the room she saw a burly figure outlined in the front door in the act of entering She glanced toward the back door It was closed and fastened with a bolt If she could slip out that way she could make a run for the picnic grounds but she dared not try to pass the two men who had just appeared The few words of their conversation proved them to be lawless Noiselessly she slipped into the closet and drew the door almost shut She would hide until they had gone They were not likely to linger long in the cottage Minute after minute went by but the intruders showed no signs of leaving What shall I do Grace breathed wringing her hands They re real downright burglars of the worst sort and they re planning a robbery It s getting late too and the girls will soon be going back Oh I must get out of here but I won t try to go until I find out whose house they re going to rob The men talked on but listen as she might Grace could get no clue There ain t a soul on the joint except the judge and one old servant growled Bill The rest o the bunch ll be at the weddin of one o the girls I laid low and heard em talkin about it to day The judge s got money in the house too He always keeps it around and that old Putnam place is pretty well back from the road Grace waited to hear no more She had obtained the information she sought They were going to rob and perhaps murder good old Judge Putnam Slipping quietly out of the closet she approached the back door and cautiously took hold of the bolt To her joy it moved easily Exercising the greatest care in sliding it back she lifted the latch It made no sound and holding her breath she softly swung open the door and ran on tiptoe around the corner of the house Throwing away her bouquet as she ran she made for a clump of underbrush at one side of the cottage Here she paused and hearing no disturbance from inside she continued her flight But she had lost her sense of direction and after fifteen minutes wandering was about to despair of finding her way when she espied the honeysuckle bush that she had stripped earlier in the afternoon This put her on the right track but she was farther away from the picnic grounds than she had supposed and when tired and breathless she at last reached them it was only to find them deserted The party had gone back to town without her Grace stood staring about her in blank dismay It was nearing seven o clock and she was twelve miles from Oakdale Why hadn t the girls waited Grace felt ready to cry then the vision of the poor old judge alone and at the mercy of the two ruffians flashed before her I ll walk to Oakdale she said with a determined nod of her head And I ll not stop for an instant until I notify the police Grace never forgot that lonely walk The darkness of a moonless night settled down upon her before she had gone three miles but she would not allow herself to think of fear She stumbled frequently as she neared her journey s end and her tired body cried out for rest but she pushed resolutely on almost sobbing with relief as she entered the suburbs of the town It was nearly eleven by the city hall clock when she hurried up the steps of the police station Well well said Chief Burroughs as Grace rushed unceremoniously into his office Here s the lost girl now I just received word that you were missing Your father and one of my men left here not five minutes ago They went to the livery to hire a rig Oh try and stop them mister Burroughs cried Grace excitedly Phone the livery and tell them that I m here Then listen to me for I ve walked all the way from Forest Park and there s no time to lose Walked from Forest Park exclaimed the chief as he turned to the phone Why that s a good twelve miles and I know interrupted Grace then was silent for the chief had begun talking to the livery It s all right he said hanging up They ll be here directly Caught them just in the nick of time however Now what s on your mind Grace They re going to rob old Judge Putnam Grace burst forth incoherently He s all alone Oh do send some one out there quickly or it may be too late Isn t there a telephone in the judge s house He ought to be warned Who s going to rob the judge What are you talking about my child asked the chief No the judge has no phone He thinks them a nuisance Grace rapidly told of her adventure in the woods and her escape from the cottage Before she had finished Chief Burroughs had begun to act Summoning three special policemen he narrated briefly what he had just heard and five minutes later Grace had the satisfaction of knowing that fully armed they were well on their way to the Putnam estate I can t understand why the girls didn t miss me she said to the chief as she sat awaiting her father s appearance Miss Bright and Miss O Malley who were in the second wagon thought you were in the first with Miss Pierson and Miss Nesbit and vice versa replied the chief The second wagon broke down when about half way home It took over half an hour to get it fixed so when it did arrive the girls in the head wagon had all gone home Your mother grew uneasy when ten o clock came so she telephoned your friends and on comparing notes you were found to be among the missing What a mix up laughed Grace No wonder I wasn t missed I m sorry mother was uneasy but she ll forgive me when she hears my tale Oh I hope nothing has happened to the poor old judge Well we ll soon know replied the chief Now you just take it easy and rest until your father comes You need it after a twelve mile walk Of all the brave little girls The ringing of the telephone cut the chief short Grace gave a long sigh and leaned back in the big chair She was so tired Her eyelids drooped Well I declare said the chief as he turned from the telephone for Grace was fast asleep CHAPTER XXIV CONCLUSION The special policemen sent out to the Putnam estate were not doomed to disappointment After an hour s waiting their patience was rewarded and the two housebreakers appeared upon the scene Before they could do any damage they were apprehended and a bag containing a complete outfit of burglar s tools was taken away from them They fought desperately but without avail and were marched to jail to await their hearing Judge Putnam was greatly agitated over the affair He had a large sum of money in the house not to mention old family silver and other valuables I realize I ve had a narrow escape he exclaimed to the chief the next day I might have been murdered in cold blood I ll have a burglar alarm put in at once and a telephone too I had no business to let all the servants except old James go for the night Who did you say brought the news Tom Harlowe s little girl She always was a wide awake youngster I wonder what I can do for her to show her that I appreciate her bravery I don t believe she d accept anything Judge replied the chief She s not that sort We shall see We shall see said the judge rubbing his hands I have a plan I think she ll listen to In the meantime on reaching home Grace had been cried over by her mother and put to bed as though she were a baby The story had been told by her chums throughout the school the next day and Grace found herself the observed of all observers Any of you would have done the same she said when surrounded by a bevy of admiring schoolmates That s what you always say exclaimed Nora But let me tell you I should have been in hysterics if I had been left alone in the dark twelve miles from nowhere Judge Putnam did not at once make his plan known to Grace He called thanking her and complimenting her on her bravery and presence of mind I shall have something to ask you when school closes my dear child he said as he rose to go Something that concerns you and your friends and you mustn t say no to an old man What on earth does he mean said Grace to her chums as she repeated the judge s words I shall be eaten up with curiosity until school closes Wish to goodness it was over now growled Nora O Malley I don t believe the last of June will ever come The morning after commencement eight highly excited girls gathered on the Harlowe s veranda Grace had received a note from Judge Putnam requesting that the Phi Sigma Tau call upon him at ten o clock that morning Do hurry said Jessica as they neared the judge s beautiful home The sooner we get there the sooner we ll know Good morning young ladies said the judge bowing with old time gallantry as James ushered the eight girls into the library You look like a garden of roses There s nothing like youth nothing like it Sit down and make yourselves comfortable while I tell you why I asked you to come and see an old man You are just like missus Gray Judge said Grace always imagining yourself old when you know you re just a great big boy Very pretty my dear chuckled the judge But if I am as young as you say then I must do something to keep young Now the way I propose doing it is this I have a camp up in the Adirondacks that needs attention so I wrote my youngest sister about it and she agrees with me She is going up there this week with a couple of servants to open the bungalow and put it in readiness for eight girls who call themselves the Phi Sigma Tau providing their fathers and mothers can spare them for a few weeks Do you think they will care to go Oh h h h How lovely breathed the eight girls in concert Care to go Well I should say so It will be the greatest lark ever cried Grace If you know any young men who can make themselves useful we might invite them I don t like the idea of being the only boy you know David and Tom said Grace and Anne Hippy can go I m sure said Nora Not to mention Reddy and Arnold Evans murmured Jessica with a glance at Miriam It looks as though I shall not lack masculine company remarked the judge with twinkling eyes Tell your parents that my sister will write them I move that we give three cheers and the High School yell for Judge Putnam and then go straight home and get proper permission cried Grace The cheers were given with a will and after shaking hands with the judge the girls said good bye How did Judge Putnam know about the Phi Sigma Tau even to its name asked Marian Barber curiously Lots of people know of it remarked Eva Allen Girls said Grace earnestly don t you think our society has been a success so far Yes indeed was the united answer Our sorority has made us fast friends loyal to each other through good and evil report she continued Let us resolve now that during our senior year we will stand firmly together and make the Phi Sigma Tau represent all that is best and most worthy in High School life When next we meet Grace Harlowe and her girl chums they will have entered upon their senior year at High School In GRACE HARLOWE S SENIOR YEAR AT HIGH SCHOOL Or The Parting of the Ways we shall learn how the Phi Sigma Tau kept their sorority pledge Eleanor Savell will again seek revenge and Grace Harlowe will once more prove herself equal to the occasion Those who have followed the High School Girls through three years of school life cannot fail to be interested in what befell these lovable everyday girls during their senior year THE END HENRY ALTEMUS COMPANY S CATALOGUE OF The Best and Least Expensive Books for
