the original a style not preserved here Accents and diphthongs have also been left out INTRODUCTION Dead Souls first published in eighteen forty two is the great prose classic of Russia That amazing institution the Russian novel not only began its career with this unfinished masterpiece by Nikolai Vasil evich Gogol but practically all the Russian masterpieces that have come since have grown out of it like the limbs of a single tree Dostoieffsky goes so far as to bestow this tribute upon an earlier work by the same author a short story entitled The Cloak this idea has been wittily expressed by another compatriot who says We have all issued out of Gogol s Cloak Dead Souls which bears the word Poem upon the title page of the original has been generally compared to Don Quixote and to the Pickwick Papers while E M Vogue places its author somewhere between Cervantes and Le Sage However considerable the influences of Cervantes and Dickens may have been the first in the matter of structure the other in background humour and detail of characterisation the predominating and distinguishing quality of the work is undeniably something foreign to both and quite peculiar to itself something which for want of a better term might be called the quality of the Russian soul The English reader familiar with the works of Dostoieffsky Turgenev and Tolstoi need hardly be told what this implies it might be defined in the words of the French critic just named as a tendency to pity One might indeed go further and say that it implies a certain tolerance of one s characters even though they be in the conventional sense knaves products as the case might be of conditions or circumstance which after all is the thing to be criticised and not the man But pity and tolerance are rare in satire even in clash with it producing in the result a deep sense of tragic humour It is this that makes of Dead Souls a unique work peculiarly Gogolian peculiarly Russian and distinct from its author s Spanish and English masters Still more profound are the contradictions to be seen in the author s personal character and unfortunately they prevented him from completing his work The trouble is that he made his art out of life and when in his final years he carried his struggle as Tolstoi did later back into life he repented of all he had written and in the frenzy of a wakeful night burned all his manuscripts including the second part of Dead Souls only fragments of which were saved There was yet a third part to be written Indeed the second part had been written and burned twice Accounts differ as to why he had burned it finally Religious remorse fury at adverse criticism and despair at not reaching ideal perfection are among the reasons given Again it is said that he had destroyed the manuscript with the others inadvertently The poet Pushkin who said of Gogol that behind his laughter you feel the unseen tears was his chief friend and inspirer It was he who suggested the plot of Dead Souls as well as the plot of the earlier work The Revisor which is almost the only comedy in Russian The importance of both is their introduction of the social element in Russian literature as Prince Kropotkin points out Both hold up the mirror to Russian officialdom and the effects it has produced on the national character The plot of Dead Souls is simple enough and is said to have been suggested by an actual episode It was the day of serfdom in Russia and a man s standing was often judged by the numbers of souls he possessed There was a periodical census of serfs say once every ten or twenty years This being the case an owner had to pay a tax on every soul registered at the last census though some of the serfs might have died in the meantime Nevertheless the system had its material advantages inasmuch as an owner might borrow money from a bank on the dead souls no less than on the living ones The plan of Chichikov Gogol s hero villain was therefore to make a journey through Russia and buy up the dead souls at reduced rates of course saving their owners the government tax and acquiring for himself a list of fictitious serfs which he meant to mortgage to a bank for a considerable sum With this money he would buy an estate and some real life serfs and make the beginning of a fortune Obviously this plot which is really no plot at all but merely a ruse to enable Chichikov to go across Russia in a troika with Selifan the coachman as a sort of Russian Sancho Panza gives Gogol a magnificent opportunity to reveal his genius as a painter of Russian panorama peopled with characteristic native types commonplace enough but drawn in comic relief The comic explained the author yet at the beginning of his career is hidden everywhere only living in the midst of it we are not conscious of it but if the artist brings it into his art on the stage say we shall roll about with laughter and only wonder we did not notice it before But the comic in Dead Souls is merely external Let us see how Pushkin who loved to laugh regarded the work As Gogol read it aloud to him from the manuscript the poet grew more and more gloomy and at last cried out God What a sad country Russia is And later he said of it Gogol invents nothing it is the simple truth the terrible truth The work on one hand was received as nothing less than an exposure of all Russia what would foreigners think of it The liberal elements however the critical Belinsky among them welcomed it as a revelation as an omen of a freer future Gogol who had meant to do a service to Russia and not to heap ridicule upon her took the criticisms of the Slavophiles to heart and he palliated his critics by promising to bring about in the succeeding parts of his novel the redemption of Chichikov and the other knaves and blockheads But the Westerner Belinsky and others of the liberal camp were mistrustful It was about this time eighteen forty seven that Gogol published his Correspondence with Friends and aroused a literary controversy that is alive to this day Tolstoi is to be found among his apologists Opinions as to the actual significance of Gogol s masterpiece differ Some consider the author a realist who has drawn with meticulous detail a picture of Russia others Merejkovsky among them see in him a great symbolist the very title Dead Souls is taken to describe the living of Russia as well as its dead Chichikov himself is now generally regarded as a universal character We find an American professor William Lyon Phelps one of Yale holding the opinion that no one can travel far in America without meeting scores of Chichikovs indeed he is an accurate portrait of the American promoter of the successful commercial traveller whose success depends entirely not on the real value and usefulness of his stock in trade but on his knowledge of human nature and of the persuasive power of his tongue This is also the opinion held by Prince Kropotkin two who says Chichikov may buy dead souls or railway shares or he may collect funds for some charitable institution or look for a position in a bank but he is an immortal international type we meet him everywhere he is of all lands and of all times he but takes different forms to suit the requirements of nationality and time Again the work bears an interesting relation to Gogol himself A romantic writing of realities he was appalled at the commonplaces of life at finding no outlet for his love of colour derived from his Cossack ancestry He realised that he had drawn a host of heroes one more commonplace than another that there was not a single palliating circumstance that there was not a single place where the reader might find pause to rest and to console himself and that when he had finished the book it was as though he had walked out of an oppressive cellar into the open air He felt perhaps inward need to redeem Chichikov in Merejkovsky s opinion he really wanted to save his own soul but had succeeded only in losing it His last years were spent morbidly he suffered torments and ran from place to place like one hunted but really always running from himself Rome was his favourite refuge and he returned to it again and again In eighteen forty eight he made a pilgrimage to the Holy Land but he could find no peace for his soul Something of this mood had reflected itself even much earlier in the Memoirs of a Madman Oh little mother save your poor son Look how they are tormenting him There s no place for him on earth He s being driven Oh little mother take pity on thy poor child All the contradictions of Gogol s character are not to be disposed of in a brief essay Such a strange combination of the tragic and the comic was truly seldom seen in one man He for one realised that it is dangerous to jest with laughter Everything that I laughed at became sad And terrible adds Merejkovsky But earlier his humour was lighter less tinged with the tragic in those days Pushkin never failed to be amused by what Gogol had brought to read to him Even Revizor eighteen thirty five with its tragic undercurrent was a trifle compared to Dead Souls so that one is not astonished to hear that not only did the Tsar Nicholas I give permission to have it acted in spite of its being a criticism of official rottenness but laughed uproariously and led the applause Moreover he gave Gogol a grant of money and asked that its source should not be revealed to the author lest he might feel obliged to write from the official point of view Gogol was born at Sorotchinetz Little Russia in March eighteen oh nine He left college at nineteen and went to saint Petersburg where he secured a position as copying clerk in a government department He did not keep his position long yet long enough to store away in his mind a number of bureaucratic types which proved useful later He quite suddenly started for America with money given to him by his mother for another purpose but when he got as far as Lubeck he turned back He then wanted to become an actor but his voice proved not strong enough Later he wrote a poem which was unkindly received As the copies remained unsold he gathered them all up at the various shops and burned them in his room His next effort Evenings at the Farm of Dikanka eighteen thirty one was more successful It was a series of gay and colourful pictures of Ukraine the land he knew and loved and if he is occasionally a little over romantic here and there he also achieves some beautifully lyrical passages Then came another even finer series called Mirgorod which won the admiration of Pushkin Next he planned a History of Little Russia and a History of the Middle Ages this last work to be in eight or nine volumes The result of all this study was a beautiful and short Homeric epic in prose called Taras Bulba His appointment to a professorship in history was a ridiculous episode in his life After a brilliant first lecture in which he had evidently said all he had to say he settled to a life of boredom for himself and his pupils When he resigned he said joyously I am once more a free Cossack Between eighteen thirty four and eighteen thirty five he produced a new series of stories including his famous Cloak which may be regarded as the legitimate beginning of the Russian novel Gogol knew little about women who played an equally minor role in his life and in his books This may be partly because his personal appearance was not prepossessing He is described by a contemporary as a little man with legs too short for his body He walked crookedly he was clumsy ill dressed and rather ridiculous looking with his long lock of hair flapping on his forehead and his large prominent nose From eighteen thirty five Gogol spent almost his entire time abroad some strange unrest possibly his Cossack blood possessed him like a demon and he never stopped anywhere very long After his pilgrimage in eighteen forty eight to Jerusalem he returned to Moscow his entire possessions in a little bag these consisted of pamphlets critiques and newspaper articles mostly inimical to himself He wandered about with these from house to house Everything he had of value he gave away to the poor He ceased work entirely According to all accounts he spent his last days in praying and fasting Visions came to him His death which came in eighteen fifty two was extremely fantastic His last words uttered in a loud frenzy were A ladder Quick a ladder This call for a ladder a spiritual ladder in the words of Merejkovsky had been made on an earlier occasion by a certain Russian saint who used almost the same language I shall laugh my bitter laugh three was the inscription placed on Gogol s grave JOHN COURNOS Evenings on the Farm near the Dikanka eighteen twenty nine thirty

the Reader Reader whosoever or wheresoever you be and whatsoever be your station whether that of a member of the higher ranks of society or that of a member of the plainer walks of life I beg of you if God shall have given you any skill in letters and my book shall fall into your hands to extend to me your assistance For in the book which lies before you and which probably you have read in its first edition there is portrayed a man who is a type taken from our Russian Empire This man travels about the Russian land and meets with folk of every condition from the nobly born to the humble toiler Him I have taken as a type to show forth the vices and the failings rather than the merits and the virtues of the commonplace Russian individual and the characters which revolve around him have also been selected for the purpose of demonstrating our national weaknesses and shortcomings As for men and women of the better sort I propose to portray them in subsequent volumes Probably much of what I have described is improbable and does not happen as things customarily happen in Russia and the reason for that is that for me to learn all that I have wished to do has been impossible in that human life is not sufficiently long to become acquainted with even a hundredth part of what takes place within the borders of the Russian Empire Also carelessness inexperience and lack of time have led to my perpetrating numerous errors and inaccuracies of detail with the result that in every line of the book there is something which calls for correction For these reasons I beg of you my reader to act also as my corrector Do not despise the task for however superior be your education and however lofty your station and however insignificant in your eyes my book and however trifling the apparent labour of correcting and commenting upon that book I implore you to do as I have said And you too O reader of lowly education and simple status I beseech you not to look upon yourself as too ignorant to be able in some fashion however small to help me Every man who has lived in the world and mixed with his fellow men will have remarked something which has remained hidden from the eyes of others and therefore I beg of you not to deprive me of your comments seeing that it cannot be that should you read my book with attention you will have NOTHING to say at some point therein For example how excellent it would be if some reader who is sufficiently rich in experience and the knowledge of life to be acquainted with the sort of characters which I have described herein would annotate in detail the book without missing a single page and undertake to read it precisely as though laying pen and paper before him he were first to peruse a few pages of the work and then to recall his own life and the lives of folk with whom he has come in contact and everything which he has seen with his own eyes or has heard of from others and to proceed to annotate in so far as may tally with his own experience or otherwise what is set forth in the book and to jot down the whole exactly as it stands pictured to his memory and lastly to send me the jottings as they may issue from his pen and to continue doing so until he has covered the entire work Yes he would indeed do me a vital service Of style or beauty of expression he would need to take no account for the value of a book lies in its truth and its actuality rather than in its wording Nor would he need to consider my feelings if at any point he should feel minded to blame or to upbraid me or to demonstrate the harm rather than the good which has been done through any lack of thought or verisimilitude of which I have been guilty In short for anything and for everything in the way of criticism I should be thankful Also it would be an excellent thing if some reader in the higher walks of life some person who stands remote both by life and by education from the circle of folk which I have pictured in my book but who knows the life of the circle in which he himself revolves would undertake to read my work in similar fashion and methodically to recall to his mind any members of superior social classes whom he has met and carefully to observe whether there exists any resemblance between one such class and another and whether at times there may not be repeated in a higher sphere what is done in a lower and likewise to note any additional fact in the same connection which may occur to him that is to say any fact pertaining to the higher ranks of society which would seem to confirm or to disprove his conclusions and lastly to record that fact as it may have occurred within his own experience while giving full details of persons of individual manners tendencies and customs and also of inanimate surroundings of dress furniture fittings of houses and so forth For I need knowledge of the classes in question which are the flower of our people In fact this very reason the reason that I do not yet know Russian life in all its aspects and in the degree to which it is necessary for me to know it in order to become a successful author is what has until now prevented me from publishing any subsequent volumes of this story Again it would be an excellent thing if some one who is endowed with the faculty of imagining and vividly picturing to himself the various situations wherein a character may be placed and of mentally following up a character s career in one field and another by this I mean some one who possesses the power of entering into and developing the ideas of the author whose work he may be reading would scan each character herein portrayed and tell me how each character ought to have acted at a given juncture and what to judge from the beginnings of each character ought to have become of that character later and what new circumstances might be devised in connection therewith and what new details might advantageously be added to those already described Honestly can I say that to consider these points against the time when a new edition of my book may be published in a different and a better form would give me the greatest possible pleasure One thing in particular would I ask of any reader who may be willing to give me the benefit of his advice That is to say I would beg of him to suppose while recording his remarks that it is for the benefit of a man in no way his equal in education or similar to him in tastes and ideas or capable of apprehending criticisms without full explanation appended that he is doing so Rather would I ask such a reader to suppose that before him there stands a man of incomparably inferior enlightenment and schooling a rude country bumpkin whose life throughout has been passed in retirement a bumpkin to whom it is necessary to explain each circumstance in detail while never forgetting to be as simple of speech as though he were a child and at every step there were a danger of employing terms beyond his understanding Should these precautions be kept constantly in view by any reader undertaking to annotate my book that reader s remarks will exceed in weight and interest even his own expectations and will bring me very real advantage Thus provided that my earnest request be heeded by my readers and that among them there be found a few kind spirits to do as I desire the following is the manner in which I would request them to transmit their notes for my consideration Inscribing the package with my name let them then enclose that package in a second one addressed either to the Rector of the University of saint Petersburg or to Professor Shevirev of the University of Moscow according as the one or the other of those two cities may be the nearer to the sender Lastly while thanking all journalists and litterateurs for their previously published criticisms of my book criticisms which in spite of a spice of that intemperance and prejudice which is common to all humanity have proved of the greatest use both to my head and to my heart I beg of such writers again to favour me with their reviews For in all sincerity I can assure them that whatsoever they may be pleased to say for my improvement and my instruction will be received by me with naught but gratitude DEAD SOULS PART I CHAPTER I To the door of an inn in the provincial town of N there drew up a smart britchka a light spring carriage of the sort affected by bachelors retired lieutenant colonels staff captains land owners possessed of about a hundred souls and in short all persons who rank as gentlemen of the intermediate category In the britchka was seated such a gentleman a man who though not handsome was not ill favoured not over fat and not over thin Also though not over elderly he was not over young His arrival produced no stir in the town and was accompanied by no particular incident beyond that a couple of peasants who happened to be standing at the door of a dramshop exchanged a few comments with reference to the equipage rather than to the individual who was seated in it Look at that carriage one of them said to the other Think you it will be going as far as Moscow I think it will replied his companion But not as far as Kazan eh No not as far as Kazan With that the conversation ended Presently as the britchka was approaching the inn it was met by a young man in a pair of very short very tight breeches of white dimity a quasi fashionable frockcoat and a dickey fastened with a pistol shaped bronze tie pin The young man turned his head as he passed the britchka and eyed it attentively after which he clapped his hand to his cap which was in danger of being removed by the wind and resumed his way On the vehicle reaching the inn door its occupant found standing there to welcome him the polevoi or waiter of the establishment an individual of such nimble and brisk movement that even to distinguish the character of his face was impossible Running out with a napkin in one hand and his lanky form clad in a tailcoat reaching almost to the nape of his neck he tossed back his locks and escorted the gentleman upstairs along a wooden gallery and so to the bedchamber which God had prepared for the gentleman s reception The said bedchamber was of quite ordinary appearance since the inn belonged to the species to be found in all provincial towns the species wherein for two roubles a day travellers may obtain a room swarming with black beetles and communicating by a doorway with the apartment adjoining True the doorway may be blocked up with a wardrobe yet behind it in all probability there will be standing a silent motionless neighbour whose ears are burning to learn every possible detail concerning the latest arrival The inn s exterior corresponded with its interior Long and consisting only of two storeys the building had its lower half destitute of stucco with the result that the dark red bricks originally more or less dingy had grown yet dingier under the influence of atmospheric changes As for the upper half of the building it was of course painted the usual tint of unfading yellow Within on the ground floor there stood a number of benches heaped with horse collars rope and sheepskins while the window seat accommodated a sbitentshik four cheek by jowl with a samovar five the latter so closely resembling the former in appearance that but for the fact of the samovar possessing a pitch black lip the samovar and the sbitentshik might have been two of a pair During the traveller s inspection of his room his luggage was brought into the apartment First came a portmanteau of white leather whose raggedness indicated that the receptacle had made several previous journeys The bearers of the same were the gentleman s coachman Selifan a little man in a large overcoat and the gentleman s valet Petrushka the latter a fellow of about thirty clad in a worn over ample jacket which formerly had graced his master s shoulders and possessed of a nose and a pair of lips whose coarseness communicated to his face rather a sullen expression Behind the portmanteau came a small dispatch box of redwood lined with birch bark a boot case and wrapped in blue paper a roast fowl all of which having been deposited the coachman departed to look after his horses and the valet to establish himself in the little dark anteroom or kennel where already he had stored a cloak a bagful of livery and his own peculiar smell Pressing the narrow bedstead back against the wall he covered it with the tiny remnant of mattress a remnant as thin and flat perhaps also as greasy as a pancake which he had managed to beg of the landlord of the establishment While the attendants had been thus setting things straight the gentleman had repaired to the common parlour The appearance of common parlours of the kind is known to every one who travels Always they have varnished walls which grown black in their upper portions with tobacco smoke are in their lower grown shiny with the friction of customers backs more especially with that of the backs of such local tradesmen as on market days make it their regular practice to resort to the local hostelry for a glass of tea Also parlours of this kind invariably contain smutty ceilings an equally smutty chandelier a number of pendent shades which jump and rattle whenever the waiter scurries across the shabby oilcloth with a trayful of glasses the glasses looking like a flock of birds roosting by the seashore and a selection of oil paintings In short there are certain objects which one sees in every inn In the present case the only outstanding feature of the room was the fact that in one of the paintings a nymph was portrayed as possessing breasts of a size such as the reader can never in his life have beheld A similar caricaturing of nature is to be noted in the historical pictures of unknown origin period and creation which reach us sometimes through the instrumentality of Russian magnates who profess to be connoisseurs of art from Italy owing to the said magnates having made such purchases solely on the advice of the couriers who have escorted them To resume however our traveller removed his cap and divested his neck of a parti coloured woollen scarf of the kind which a wife makes for her husband with her own hands while accompanying the gift with interminable injunctions as to how best such a garment ought to be folded True bachelors also wear similar gauds but in their case God alone knows who may have manufactured the articles For my part I cannot endure them Having unfolded the scarf the gentleman ordered dinner and whilst the various dishes were being got ready cabbage soup a pie several weeks old a dish of marrow and peas a dish of sausages and cabbage a roast fowl some salted cucumber and the sweet tart which stands perpetually ready for use in such establishments whilst I say these things were either being warmed up or brought in cold the gentleman induced the waiter to retail certain fragments of tittle tattle concerning the late landlord of the hostelry the amount of income which the hostelry produced and the character of its present proprietor To the last mentioned inquiry the waiter returned the answer invariably given in such cases namely My master is a terribly hard man sir Curious that in enlightened Russia so many people cannot even take a meal at an inn without chattering to the attendant and making free with him Nevertheless not ALL the questions which the gentleman asked were aimless ones for he inquired who was Governor of the town who President of the Local Council and who Public Prosecutor In short he omitted no single official of note while asking also though with an air of detachment the most exact particulars concerning the landowners of the neighbourhood Which of them he inquired possessed serfs and how many of them How far from the town did those landowners reside What was the character of each landowner and was he in the habit of paying frequent visits to the town The gentleman also made searching inquiries concerning the hygienic condition of the countryside Was there he asked much sickness about whether sporadic fever fatal forms of ague smallpox or what not Yet though his solicitude concerning these matters showed more than ordinary curiosity his bearing retained its gravity unimpaired and from time to time he blew his nose with portentous fervour Indeed the manner in which he accomplished this latter feat was marvellous in the extreme for though that member emitted sounds equal to those of a trumpet in intensity he could yet with his accompanying air of guileless dignity evoke the waiter s undivided respect so much so that whenever the sounds of the nose reached that menial s ears he would shake back his locks straighten himself into a posture of marked solicitude and inquire afresh with head slightly inclined whether the gentleman happened to require anything further After dinner the guest consumed a cup of coffee and then seating himself upon the sofa with behind him one of those wool covered cushions which in Russian taverns resemble nothing so much as a cobblestone or a brick fell to snoring whereafter returning with a start to consciousness he ordered himself to be conducted to his room flung himself at full length upon the bed and once more slept soundly for a couple of hours Aroused eventually by the waiter he at the latter s request inscribed a fragment of paper with his name his surname and his rank for communication in accordance with the law to the police and on that paper the waiter leaning forward from the corridor read syllable by syllable Paul Ivanovitch Chichikov Collegiate Councillor Landowner Travelling on Private Affairs The waiter had just time to accomplish this feat before Paul Ivanovitch Chichikov set forth to inspect the town Apparently the place succeeded in satisfying him and to tell the truth it was at least up to the usual standard of our provincial capitals Where the staring yellow of stone edifices did not greet his eye he found himself confronted with the more modest grey of wooden ones which consisting for the most part of one or two storeys added to the range of attics which provincial architects love so well looked almost lost amid the expanses of street and intervening medleys of broken or half finished partition walls At other points evidence of more life and movement was to be seen and here the houses stood crowded together and displayed dilapidated rain blurred signboards whereon boots of cakes or pairs of blue breeches inscribed Arshavski Tailor and so forth were depicted Over a shop containing hats and caps was written Vassili Thedorov Foreigner while at another spot a signboard portrayed a billiard table and two players the latter clad in frockcoats of the kind usually affected by actors whose part it is to enter the stage during the closing act of a piece even though with arms sharply crooked and legs slightly bent the said billiard players were taking the most careful aim but succeeding only in making abortive strokes in the air Each emporium of the sort had written over it This is the best establishment of its kind in the town Also al fresco in the streets there stood tables heaped with nuts soap and gingerbread the latter but little distinguishable from the soap and at an eating house there was displayed the sign of a plump fish transfixed with a gaff But the sign most frequently to be discerned was the insignia of the State the double headed eagle now replaced in this connection with the laconic inscription Dramshop As for the paving of the town it was uniformly bad The gentleman peered also into the municipal gardens which contained only a few sorry trees that were poorly selected requiring to be propped with oil painted triangular green supports and able to boast of a height no greater than that of an ordinary walking stick Yet recently the local paper had said apropos of a gala that Thanks to the efforts of our Civil Governor the town has become enriched with a pleasaunce full of umbrageous spaciously branching trees Even on the most sultry day they afford agreeable shade and indeed gratifying was it to see the hearts of our citizens panting with an impulse of gratitude as their eyes shed tears in recognition of all that their Governor has done for them Next after inquiring of a gendarme as to the best ways and means of finding the local council the local law courts and the local Governor should he Chichikov have need of them the gentleman went on to inspect the river which ran through the town En route he tore off a notice affixed to a post in order that he might the more conveniently read it after his return to the inn Also he bestowed upon a lady of pleasant exterior who escorted by a footman laden with a bundle happened to be passing along a wooden sidewalk a prolonged stare Lastly he threw around him a comprehensive glance as though to fix in his mind the general topography of the place and betook himself home There gently aided by the waiter he ascended the stairs to his bedroom drank a glass of tea and seating himself at the table called for a candle which having been brought him he produced from his pocket the notice held it close to the flame and conned its tenour slightly contracting his right eye as he did so Yet there was little in the notice to call for remark All that it said was that shortly one of Kotzebue s six plays would be given and that one of the parts in the play was to be taken by a certain Monsieur Poplevin and another by a certain Mademoiselle Ziablova while the remaining parts were to be filled by a number of less important personages Nevertheless the gentleman perused the notice with careful attention and even jotted down the prices to be asked for seats for the performance Also he remarked that the bill had been printed in the press of the Provincial Government Next he turned over the paper in order to see if anything further was to be read on the reverse side but finding nothing there he refolded the document placed it in the box which served him as a receptacle for odds and ends and brought the day to a close with a portion of cold veal a bottle of pickles and a sound sleep The following day he devoted to paying calls upon the various municipal officials a first and a very respectful visit being paid to the Governor This personage turned out to resemble Chichikov himself in that he was neither fat nor thin Also he wore the riband of the order of Saint Anna about his neck and was reported to have been recommended also for the star For the rest he was large and good natured and had a habit of amusing himself with occasional spells of knitting Next Chichikov repaired to the Vice Governor s and thence to the house of the Public Prosecutor to that of the President of the Local Council to that of the Chief of Police to that of the Commissioner of Taxes and to that of the local Director of State Factories True the task of remembering every big wig in this world of ours is not a very easy one but at least our visitor displayed the greatest activity in his work of paying calls seeing that he went so far as to pay his respects also to the Inspector of the Municipal Department of Medicine and to the City Architect Thereafter he sat thoughtfully in his britchka plunged in meditation on the subject of whom else it might be well to visit However not a single magnate had been neglected and in conversation with his hosts he had contrived to flatter each separate one For instance to the Governor he had hinted that a stranger on arriving in his the Governor s province would conceive that he had reached Paradise so velvety were the roads Governors who appoint capable subordinates had said Chichikov are deserving of the most ample meed of praise Again to the Chief of Police our hero had passed a most gratifying remark on the subject of the local gendarmery while in his conversation with the Vice Governor and the President of the Local Council neither of whom had as yet risen above the rank of State Councillor he had twice been guilty of the gaucherie of addressing his interlocutors with the title of Your Excellency a blunder which had not failed to delight them In the result the Governor had invited him to a reception the same evening and certain other officials had followed suit by inviting him one of them to dinner a second to a tea party and so forth and so forth Of himself however the traveller had spoken little or if he had spoken at any length he had done so in a general sort of way and with marked modesty Indeed at moments of the kind his discourse had assumed something of a literary vein in that invariably he had stated that being a worm of no account in the world he was deserving of no consideration at the hands of his fellows that in his time he had undergone many strange experiences that subsequently he had suffered much in the cause of Truth that he had many enemies seeking his life and that being desirous of rest he was now engaged in searching for a spot wherein to dwell wherefore having stumbled upon the town in which he now found himself he had considered it his bounden duty to evince his respect for the chief authorities of the place This and no more was all that for the moment the town succeeded in learning about the new arrival Naturally he lost no time in presenting himself at the Governor s evening party First however his preparations for that function occupied a space of over two hours and necessitated an attention to his toilet of a kind not commonly seen That is to say after a brief post grandial nap he called for soap and water and spent a considerable period in the task of scrubbing his cheeks which for the purpose he supported from within with his tongue and then of drying his full round face from the ears downwards with a towel which he took from the waiter s shoulder Twice he snorted into the waiter s countenance as he did this and then he posted himself in front of the mirror donned a false shirt front plucked out a couple of hairs which were protruding from his nose and appeared vested in a frockcoat of bilberry coloured check Thereafter driving through broad streets sparsely lighted with lanterns he arrived at the Governor s residence to find it illuminated as for a ball Barouches with gleaming lamps a couple of gendarmes posted before the doors a babel of postillions cries nothing of a kind likely to be impressive was wanting and on reaching the salon the visitor actually found himself obliged to close his eyes for a moment so strong was the mingled sheen of lamps candles and feminine apparel Everything seemed suffused with light and everywhere flitting and flashing were to be seen black coats even as on a hot summer s day flies revolve around a sugar loaf while the old housekeeper is cutting it into cubes before the open window and the children of the house crowd around her to watch the movements of her rugged hands as those members ply the smoking pestle and airy squadrons of flies borne on the breeze enter boldly as though free of the house and taking advantage of the fact that the glare of the sunshine is troubling the old lady s sight disperse themselves over broken and unbroken fragments alike even though the lethargy induced by the opulence of summer and the rich shower of dainties to be encountered at every step has induced them to enter less for the purpose of eating than for that of showing themselves in public of parading up and down the sugar loaf of rubbing both their hindquarters and their fore against one another of cleaning their bodies under the wings of extending their forelegs over their heads and grooming themselves and of flying out of the window again to return with other predatory squadrons Indeed so dazed was Chichikov that scarcely did he realise that the Governor was taking him by the arm and presenting him to his the Governor s lady Yet the newly arrived guest kept his head sufficiently to contrive to murmur some such compliment as might fittingly come from a middle aged individual of a rank neither excessively high nor excessively low Next when couples had been formed for dancing and the remainder of the company found itself pressed back against the walls Chichikov folded his arms and carefully scrutinised the dancers Some of the ladies were dressed well and in the fashion while the remainder were clad in such garments as God usually bestows upon a provincial town Also here as elsewhere the men belonged to two separate and distinct categories one of which comprised slender individuals who flitting around the ladies were scarcely to be distinguished from denizens of the metropolis so carefully so artistically groomed were their whiskers so presentable their oval clean shaven faces so easy the manner of their dancing attendance upon their womenfolk so glib their French conversation as they quizzed their female companions As for the other category it comprised individuals who stout or of the same build as Chichikov that is to say neither very portly nor very lean backed and sidled away from the ladies and kept peering hither and thither to see whether the Governor s footmen had set out green tables for whist Their features were full and plump some of them had beards and in no case was their hair curled or waved or arranged in what the French call the devil may care style On the contrary their heads were either close cropped or brushed very smooth and their faces were round and firm This category represented the more respectable officials of the town In passing I may say that in business matters fat men always prove superior to their leaner brethren which is probably the reason why the latter are mostly to be found in the Political Police or acting as mere ciphers whose existence is a purely hopeless airy trivial one Again stout individuals never take a back seat but always a front one and wheresoever it be they sit firmly and with confidence and decline to budge even though the seat crack and bend with their weight For comeliness of exterior they care not a rap and therefore a dress coat sits less easily on their figures than is the case with figures of leaner individuals Yet invariably fat men amass the greater wealth In three years time a thin man will not have a single serf whom he has left unpledged whereas well pray look at a fat man s fortunes and what will you see First of all a suburban villa and then a larger suburban villa and then a villa close to a town and lastly a country estate which comprises every amenity That is to say having served both God and the State the stout individual has won universal respect and will end by retiring from business reordering his mode of life and becoming a Russian landowner in other words a fine gentleman who dispenses hospitality lives in comfort and luxury and is destined to leave his property to heirs who are purposing to squander the same on foreign travel That the foregoing represents pretty much the gist of Chichikov s reflections as he stood watching the company I will not attempt to deny And of those reflections the upshot was that he decided to join himself to the stouter section of the guests among whom he had already recognised several familiar faces namely those of the Public Prosecutor a man with beetling brows over eyes which seemed to be saying with a wink Come into the next room my friend for I have something to say to you though in the main their owner was a man of grave and taciturn habit of the Postmaster an insignificant looking individual yet a would be wit and a philosopher and of the President of the Local Council a man of much amiability and good sense These three personages greeted Chichikov as an old acquaintance and to their salutations he responded with a sidelong yet a sufficiently civil bow Also he became acquainted with an extremely unctuous and approachable landowner named Manilov and with a landowner of more uncouth exterior named Sobakevitch the latter of whom began the acquaintance by treading heavily upon Chichikov s toes and then begging his pardon Next Chichikov received an offer of a cut in at whist and accepted the same with his usual courteous inclination of the head Seating themselves at a green table the party did not rise therefrom till supper time and during that period all conversation between the players became hushed as is the custom when men have given themselves up to a really serious pursuit Even the Postmaster a talkative man by nature had no sooner taken the cards into his hands than he assumed an expression of profound thought pursed his lips and retained this attitude unchanged throughout the game Only when playing a court card was it his custom to strike the table with his fist and to exclaim if the card happened to be a queen Now old popadia seven and if the card happened to be a king Now peasant of Tambov To which ejaculations invariably the President of the Local Council retorted Ah I have him by the ears I have him by the ears And from the neighbourhood of the table other strong ejaculations relative to the play would arise interposed with one or another of those nicknames which participants in a game are apt to apply to members of the various suits I need hardly add that the game over the players fell to quarrelling and that in the dispute our friend joined though so artfully as to let every one see that in spite of the fact that he was wrangling he was doing so only in the most amicable fashion possible Never did he say outright You played the wrong card at such and such a point No he always employed some such phrase as You permitted yourself to make a slip and thus afforded me the honour of covering your deuce Indeed the better to keep in accord with his antagonists he kept offering them his silver enamelled snuff box at the bottom of which lay a couple of violets placed there for the sake of their scent In particular did the newcomer pay attention to landowners Manilov and Sobakevitch so much so that his haste to arrive on good terms with them led to his leaving the President and the Postmaster rather in the shade At the same time certain questions which he put to those two landowners evinced not only curiosity but also a certain amount of sound intelligence for he began by asking how many peasant souls each of them possessed and how their affairs happened at present to be situated and then proceeded to enlighten himself also as their standing and their families Indeed it was not long before he had succeeded in fairly enchanting his new friends In particular did Manilov a man still in his prime and possessed of a pair of eyes which sweet as sugar blinked whenever he laughed find himself unable to make enough of his enchanter Clasping Chichikov long and fervently by the hand he besought him to do him Manilov the honour of visiting his country house which he declared to lie at a distance of not more than fifteen versts from the boundaries of the town and in return Chichikov averred with an exceedingly affable bow and a most sincere handshake that he was prepared not only to fulfil his friend s behest but also to look upon the fulfilling of it as a sacred duty In the same way Sobakevitch said to him laconically And do you pay ME a visit and then proceeded to shuffle a pair of boots of such dimensions that to find a pair to correspond with them would have been indeed difficult more especially at the present day when the race of epic heroes is beginning to die out in Russia Next day Chichikov dined and spent the evening at the house of the Chief of Police a residence where three hours after dinner every one sat down to whist and remained so seated until two o clock in the morning On this occasion Chichikov made the acquaintance of among others a landowner named Nozdrev a dissipated little fellow of thirty who had no sooner exchanged three or four words with his new acquaintance than he began to address him in the second person singular Yet although he did the same to the Chief of Police and the Public Prosecutor the company had no sooner seated themselves at the card table than both the one and the other of these functionaries started to keep a careful eye upon Nozdrev s tricks and to watch practically every card which he played The following evening Chichikov spent with the President of the Local Council who received his guests even though the latter included two ladies in a greasy dressing gown Upon that followed an evening at the Vice Governor s a large dinner party at the house of the Commissioner of Taxes a smaller dinner party at the house of the Public Prosecutor a very wealthy man and a subsequent reception given by the Mayor In short not an hour of the day did Chichikov find himself forced to spend at home and his return to the inn became necessary only for the purposes of sleeping Somehow or other he had landed on his feet and everywhere he figured as an experienced man of the world No matter what the conversation chanced to be about he always contrived to maintain his part in the same Did the discourse turn upon horse breeding upon horse breeding he happened to be peculiarly well qualified to speak Did the company fall to discussing well bred dogs at once he had remarks of the most pertinent kind possible to offer Did the company touch upon a prosecution which had recently been carried out by the Excise Department instantly he showed that he too was not wholly unacquainted with legal affairs Did an opinion chance to be expressed concerning billiards on that subject too he was at least able to avoid committing a blunder Did a reference occur to virtue concerning virtue he hastened to deliver himself in a way which brought tears to every eye Did the subject in hand happen to be the distilling of brandy well that was a matter concerning which he had the soundest of knowledge Did any one happen to mention Customs officials and inspectors from that moment he expatiated as though he too had been both a minor functionary and a major Yet a remarkable fact was the circumstance that he always contrived to temper his omniscience with a certain readiness to give way a certain ability so to keep a rein upon himself that never did his utterances become too loud or too soft or transcend what was perfectly befitting In a word he was always a gentleman of excellent manners and every official in the place felt pleased when he saw him enter the door Thus the Governor gave it as his opinion that Chichikov was a man of excellent intentions the Public Prosecutor that he was a good man of business the Chief of Gendarmery that he was a man of education the President of the Local Council that he was a man of breeding and refinement and the wife of the Chief of Gendarmery that his politeness of behaviour was equalled only by his affability of bearing Nay even Sobakevitch who as a rule never spoke well of ANY ONE said to his lanky wife when on returning late from the town he undressed and betook himself to bed by her side My dear this evening after dining with the Chief of Police I went on to the Governor s and met there among others a certain Paul Ivanovitch Chichikov who is a Collegiate Councillor and a very pleasant fellow To this his spouse replied Hm and then dealt him a hearty kick in the ribs Such were the flattering opinions earned by the newcomer to the town and these opinions he retained until the time when a certain speciality of his a certain scheme of his the reader will learn presently what it was plunged the majority of the townsfolk into a sea of perplexity CHAPTER II For more than two weeks the visitor lived amid a round of evening parties and dinners wherefore he spent as the saying goes a very pleasant time Finally he decided to extend his visits beyond the urban boundaries by going and calling upon landowners Manilov and Sobakevitch seeing that he had promised on his honour to do so Yet what really incited him to this may have been a more essential cause a matter of greater gravity a purpose which stood nearer to his heart than the motive which I have just given and of that purpose the reader will learn if only he will have the patience to read this prefatory narrative which lengthy though it be may yet develop and expand in proportion as we approach the denouement with which the present work is destined to be crowned One evening therefore Selifan the coachman received orders to have the horses harnessed in good time next morning while Petrushka received orders to remain behind for the purpose of looking after the portmanteau and the room In passing the reader may care to become more fully acquainted with the two serving men of whom I have spoken Naturally they were not persons of much note but merely what folk call characters of secondary or even of tertiary importance Yet despite the fact that the springs and the thread of this romance will not DEPEND upon them but only touch upon them and occasionally include them the author has a passion for circumstantiality and like the average Russian such a desire for accuracy as even a German could not rival To what the reader already knows concerning the personages in hand it is therefore necessary to add that Petrushka usually wore a cast off brown jacket of a size too large for him as also that he had according to the custom of individuals of his calling a pair of thick lips and a very prominent nose In temperament he was taciturn rather than loquacious and he cherished a yearning for self education That is to say he loved to read books even though their contents came alike to him whether they were books of heroic adventure or mere grammars or liturgical compendia As I say he perused every book with an equal amount of attention and had he been offered a work on chemistry would have accepted that also Not the words which he read but the mere solace derived from the act of reading was what especially pleased his mind even though at any moment there might launch itself from the page some devil sent word whereof he could make neither head nor tail For the most part his task of reading was performed in a recumbent position in the anteroom which circumstance ended by causing his mattress to become as ragged and as thin as a wafer In addition to his love of poring over books he could boast of two habits which constituted two other essential features of his character namely a habit of retiring to rest in his clothes that is to say in the brown jacket above mentioned and a habit of everywhere bearing with him his own peculiar atmosphere his own peculiar smell a smell which filled any lodging with such subtlety that he needed but to make up his bed anywhere even in a room hitherto untenanted and to drag thither his greatcoat and other impedimenta for that room at once to assume an air of having been lived in during the past ten years Nevertheless though a fastidious and even an irritable man Chichikov would merely frown when his nose caught this smell amid the freshness of the morning and exclaim with a toss of his head The devil only knows what is up with you Surely you sweat a good deal do you not The best thing you can do is to go and take a bath To this Petrushka would make no reply but approaching brush in hand the spot where his master s coat would be pendent or starting to arrange one and another article in order would strive to seem wholly immersed in his work Yet of what was he thinking as he remained thus silent Perhaps he was saying to himself My master is a good fellow but for him to keep on saying the same thing forty times over is a little wearisome Only God knows and sees all things wherefore for a mere human being to know what is in the mind of a servant while his master is scolding him is wholly impossible However no more need be said about Petrushka On the other hand Coachman Selifan But here let me remark that I do not like engaging the reader s attention in connection with persons of a lower class than himself for experience has taught me that we do not willingly familiarise ourselves with the lower orders that it is the custom of the average Russian to yearn exclusively for information concerning persons on the higher rungs of the social ladder In fact even a bowing acquaintance with a prince or a lord counts in his eyes for more than do the most intimate of relations with ordinary folk For the same reason the author feels apprehensive on his hero s account seeing that he has made that hero a mere Collegiate Councillor a mere person with whom Aulic Councillors might consort but upon whom persons of the grade of full General eight would probably bestow one of those glances proper to a man who is cringing at their august feet Worse still such persons of the grade of General are likely to treat Chichikov with studied negligence and to an author studied negligence spells death However in spite of the distressfulness of the foregoing possibilities it is time that I returned to my hero After issuing overnight the necessary orders he awoke early washed himself rubbed himself from head to foot with a wet sponge a performance executed only on Sundays and the day in question happened to be a Sunday shaved his face with such care that his cheeks issued of absolutely satin like smoothness and polish donned first his bilberry coloured spotted frockcoat and then his bearskin overcoat descended the staircase attended throughout by the waiter and entered his britchka With a loud rattle the vehicle left the inn yard and issued into the street A passing priest doffed his cap and a few urchins in grimy shirts shouted Gentleman please give a poor orphan a trifle Presently the driver noticed that a sturdy young rascal was on the point of climbing onto the splashboard wherefore he cracked his whip and the britchka leapt forward with increased speed over the cobblestones At last with a feeling of relief the travellers caught sight of macadam ahead which promised an end both to the cobblestones and to sundry other annoyances And sure enough after his head had been bumped a few more times against the boot of the conveyance Chichikov found himself bowling over softer ground On the town receding into the distance the sides of the road began to be varied with the usual hillocks fir trees clumps of young pine trees with old scarred trunks bushes of wild juniper and so forth Presently there came into view also strings of country villas which with their carved supports and grey roofs the latter looking like pendent embroidered tablecloths resembled rather bundles of old faggots Likewise the customary peasants dressed in sheepskin jackets could be seen yawning on benches before their huts while their womenfolk fat of feature and swathed of bosom gazed out of upper windows and the windows below displayed here a peering calf and there the unsightly jaws of a pig In short the view was one of the familiar type After passing the fifteenth verst stone Chichikov suddenly recollected that according to Manilov fifteen versts was the exact distance between his country house and the town but the sixteenth verst stone flew by and the said country house was still nowhere to be seen In fact but for the circumstance that the travellers happened to encounter a couple of peasants they would have come on their errand in vain To a query as to whether the country house known as Zamanilovka was anywhere in the neighbourhood the peasants replied by doffing their caps after which one of them who seemed to boast of a little more intelligence than his companion and who wore a wedge shaped beard made answer Perhaps you mean Manilovka not ZAmanilovka Yes yes Manilovka Manilovka eh Well you must continue for another verst and then you will see it straight before you on the right On the right re echoed the coachman Yes on the right affirmed the peasant You are on the proper road for Manilovka but ZAmanilovka well there is no such place The house you mean is called Manilovka because Manilovka is its name but no house at all is called ZAmanilovka The house you mean stands there on that hill and is a stone house in which a gentleman lives and its name is Manilovka but ZAmanilovka does not stand hereabouts nor ever has stood So the travellers proceeded in search of Manilovka and after driving an additional two versts arrived at a spot whence there branched off a by road Yet two three or four versts of the by road had been covered before they saw the least sign of a two storied stone mansion Then it was that Chichikov suddenly recollected that when a friend has invited one to visit his country house and has said that the distance thereto is fifteen versts the distance is sure to turn out to be at least thirty Not many people would have admired the situation of Manilov s abode for it stood on an isolated rise and was open to every wind that blew On the slope of the rise lay closely mown turf while disposed here and there after the English fashion were flower beds containing clumps of lilac and yellow acacia Also there were a few insignificant groups of slender leaved pointed tipped birch trees with under two of the latter an arbour having a shabby green cupola some blue painted wooden supports and the inscription This is the Temple of Solitary Thought Lower down the slope lay a green coated pond green coated ponds constitute a frequent spectacle in the gardens of Russian landowners and lastly from the foot of the declivity there stretched a line of mouldy log built huts which for some obscure reason or another our hero set himself to count Up to two hundred or more did he count but nowhere could he perceive a single leaf of vegetation or a single stick of timber The only thing to greet the eye was the logs of which the huts were constructed Nevertheless the scene was to a certain extent enlivened by the spectacle of two peasant women who with clothes picturesquely tucked up were wading knee deep in the pond and dragging behind them with wooden handles a ragged fishing net in the meshes of which two crawfish and a roach with glistening scales were entangled The women appeared to have cause of dispute between themselves to be rating one another about something In the background and to one side of the house showed a faint dusky blur of pinewood and even the weather was in keeping with the surroundings since the day was neither clear nor dull but of the grey tint which may be noted in uniforms of garrison soldiers which have seen long service To complete the picture a cock the recognised harbinger of atmospheric mutations was present and in spite of the fact that a certain connection with affairs of gallantry had led to his having had his head pecked bare by other cocks he flapped a pair of wings appendages as bare as two pieces of bast and crowed loudly As Chichikov approached the courtyard of the mansion he caught sight of his host clad in a green frock coat standing on the verandah and pressing one hand to his eyes to shield them from the sun and so get a better view of the approaching carriage In proportion as the britchka drew nearer and nearer to the verandah the host s eyes assumed a more and more delighted expression and his smile a broader and broader sweep Paul Ivanovitch he exclaimed when at length Chichikov leapt from the vehicle Never should I have believed that you would have remembered us The two friends exchanged hearty embraces and Manilov then conducted his guest to the drawing room During the brief time that they are traversing the hall the anteroom and the dining room let me try to say something concerning the master of the house But such an undertaking bristles with difficulties it promises to be a far less easy task than the depicting of some outstanding personality which calls but for a wholesale dashing of colours upon the canvas the colours of a pair of dark burning eyes a pair of dark beetling brows a forehead seamed with wrinkles a black or a fiery red cloak thrown backwards over the shoulder and so forth and so forth Yet so numerous are Russian serf owners that though careful scrutiny reveals to one s sight a quantity of outre peculiarities they are as a class exceedingly difficult to portray and one needs to strain one s faculties to the utmost before it becomes possible to pick out their variously subtle their almost invisible features In short one needs before doing this to carry out a prolonged probing with the aid of an insight sharpened in the acute school of research Only God can say what Manilov s real character was A class of men exists whom the proverb has described as men unto themselves neither this nor that neither Bogdan of the city nor Selifan of the village And to that class we had better assign also Manilov Outwardly he was presentable enough for his features were not wanting in amiability but that amiability was a quality into which there entered too much of the sugary element so that his every gesture his every attitude seemed to connote an excess of eagerness to curry favour and cultivate a closer acquaintance On first speaking to the man his ingratiating smile his flaxen hair and his blue eyes would lead one to say What a pleasant good tempered fellow he seems yet during the next moment or two one would feel inclined to say nothing at all and during the third moment only to say The devil alone knows what he is And should thereafter one not hasten to depart one would inevitably become overpowered with the deadly sense of ennui which comes of the intuition that nothing in the least interesting is to be looked for but only a series of wearisome utterances of the kind which are apt to fall from the lips of a man whose hobby has once been touched upon For every man HAS his hobby One man s may be sporting dogs another man s may be that of believing himself to be a lover of music and able to sound the art to its inmost depths another s may be that of posing as a connoisseur of recherche cookery another s may be that of aspiring to play roles of a kind higher than nature has assigned him another s though this is a more limited ambition may be that of getting drunk and of dreaming that he is edifying both his friends his acquaintances and people with whom he has no connection at all by walking arm in arm with an Imperial aide de camp another s may be that of possessing a hand able to chip corners off aces and deuces of diamonds another s may be that of yearning to set things straight in other words to approximate his personality to that of a stationmaster or a director of posts In short almost every man has his hobby or his leaning yet Manilov had none such for at home he spoke little and spent the greater part of his time in meditation though God only knows what that meditation comprised Nor can it be said that he took much interest in the management of his estate for he never rode into the country and the estate practically managed itself Whenever the bailiff said to him It might be well to have such and such a thing done he would reply Yes that is not a bad idea and then go on smoking his pipe a habit which he had acquired during his service in the army where he had been looked upon as an officer of modesty delicacy and refinement Yes it is NOT a bad idea he would repeat Again whenever a peasant approached him and rubbing the back of his neck said Barin may I have leave to go and work for myself in order that I may earn my obrok nine he would snap out with pipe in mouth as usual Yes go and never trouble his head as to whether the peasant s real object might not be to go and get drunk True at intervals he would say while gazing from the verandah to the courtyard and from the courtyard to the pond that it would be indeed splendid if a carriage drive could suddenly materialise and the pond as suddenly become spanned with a stone bridge and little shops as suddenly arise whence pedlars could dispense the petty merchandise of the kind which peasantry most need And at such moments his eyes would grow winning and his features assume an expression of intense satisfaction Yet never did these projects pass beyond the stage of debate Likewise there lay in his study a book with the fourteenth page permanently turned down It was a book which he had been reading for the past two years In general something seemed to be wanting in the establishment For instance although the drawing room was filled with beautiful furniture and upholstered in some fine silken material which clearly had cost no inconsiderable sum two of the chairs lacked any covering but bast and for some years past the master had been accustomed to warn his guests with the words Do not sit upon these chairs they are not yet ready for use Another room contained no furniture at all although a few days after the marriage it had been said My dear to morrow let us set about procuring at least some TEMPORARY furniture for this room Also every evening would see placed upon the drawing room table a fine bronze candelabrum a statuette representative of the Three Graces a tray inlaid with mother of pearl and a rickety lop sided copper invalide Yet of the fact that all four articles were thickly coated with grease neither the master of the house nor the mistress nor the servants seemed to entertain the least suspicion At the same time Manilov and his wife were quite satisfied with each other More than eight years had elapsed since their marriage yet one of them was for ever offering his or her partner a piece of apple or a bonbon or a nut while murmuring some tender something which voiced a whole hearted affection Open your mouth dearest thus ran the formula and let me pop into it this titbit You may be sure that on such occasions the dearest mouth parted its lips most graciously For their mutual birthdays the pair always contrived some surprise present in the shape of a glass receptacle for tooth powder or what not and as they sat together on the sofa he would suddenly and for some unknown reason lay aside his pipe and she her work if at the moment she happened to be holding it in her hands and husband and wife would imprint upon one another s cheeks such a prolonged and languishing kiss that during its continuance you could have smoked a small cigar In short they were what is known as a very happy couple Yet it may be remarked that a household requires other pursuits to be engaged in than lengthy embracings and the preparing of cunning surprises Yes many a function calls for fulfilment For instance why should it be thought foolish or low to superintend the kitchen Why should care not be taken that the storeroom never lacks supplies Why should a housekeeper be allowed to thieve Why should slovenly and drunken servants exist Why should a domestic staff be suffered in indulge in bouts of unconscionable debauchery during its leisure time Yet none of these things were thought worthy of consideration by Manilov s wife for she had been gently brought up and gentle nurture as we all know is to be acquired only in boarding schools and boarding schools as we know hold the three principal subjects which constitute the basis of human virtue to be the French language a thing indispensable to the happiness of married life piano playing a thing wherewith to beguile a husband s leisure moments and that particular department of housewifery which is comprised in the knitting of purses and other surprises Nevertheless changes and improvements have begun to take place since things now are governed more by the personal inclinations and idiosyncracies of the keepers of such establishments For instance in some seminaries the regimen places piano playing first and the French language second and then the above department of housewifery while in other seminaries the knitting of surprises heads the list and then the French language and then the playing of pianos so diverse are the systems in force None the less I may remark that Madame Manilov But let me confess that I always shrink from saying too much about ladies Moreover it is time that we returned to our heroes who during the past few minutes have been standing in front of the drawing room door and engaged in urging one another to enter first Pray be so good as not to inconvenience yourself on my account said Chichikov I will follow YOU No Paul Ivanovitch no You are my guest And Manilov pointed towards the doorway Make no difficulty about it I pray urged Chichikov I beg of you to make no difficulty about it but to pass into the room Pardon me I will not Never could I allow so distinguished and so welcome a guest as yourself to take second place Why call me distinguished my dear sir I beg of you to proceed Nay be YOU pleased to do so And why For the reason which I have stated And Manilov smiled his very pleasantest smile Finally the pair entered simultaneously and sideways with the result that they jostled one another not a little in the process Allow me to present to you my wife continued Manilov My dear Paul Ivanovitch Upon that Chichikov caught sight of a lady whom hitherto he had overlooked but who with Manilov was now bowing to him in the doorway Not wholly of unpleasing exterior she was dressed in a well fitting high necked morning dress of pale coloured silk and as the visitor entered the room her small white hands threw something upon the table and clutched her embroidered skirt before rising from the sofa where she had been seated Not without a sense of pleasure did Chichikov take her hand as lisping a little she declared that she and her husband were equally gratified by his coming and that of late not a day had passed without her husband recalling him to mind Yes affirmed Manilov and every day SHE has said to ME Why does not your friend put in an appearance Wait a little dearest I have always replied Twill not be long now before he comes And you HAVE come you HAVE honoured us with a visit you HAVE bestowed upon us a treat a treat destined to convert this day into a gala day a true birthday of the heart The intimation that matters had reached the point of the occasion being destined to constitute a true birthday of the heart caused Chichikov to become a little confused wherefore he made modest reply that as a matter of fact he was neither of distinguished origin nor distinguished rank Ah you ARE so interrupted Manilov with his fixed and engaging smile You are all that and more How like you our town queried Madame Have you spent an agreeable time in it Very replied Chichikov The town is an exceedingly nice one and I have greatly enjoyed its hospitable society And what do you think of our Governor Yes IS he not a most engaging and dignified personage added Manilov He is all that assented Chichikov Indeed he is a man worthy of the greatest respect And how thoroughly he performs his duty according to his lights Would that we had more like him And the tactfulness with which he greets every one added Manilov smiling and half closing his eyes like a cat which is being tickled behind the ears Quite so assented Chichikov He is a man of the most eminent civility and approachableness And what an artist Never should I have thought he could have worked the marvellous household samplers which he has done Some specimens of his needlework which he showed me could not well have been surpassed by any lady in the land And the Vice Governor too he is a nice man is he not inquired Manilov with renewed blinkings of the eyes Who The Vice Governor Yes a most worthy fellow replied Chichikov And what of the Chief of Police Is it not a fact that he too is in the highest degree agreeable Very agreeable indeed And what a clever well read individual With him and the Public Prosecutor and the President of the Local Council I played whist until the cocks uttered their last morning crow He is a most excellent fellow And what of his wife queried Madame Manilov Is she not a most gracious personality One of the best among my limited acquaintance agreed Chichikov Nor were the President of the Local Council and the Postmaster overlooked until the company had run through the whole list of urban officials And in every case those officials appeared to be persons of the highest possible merit Do you devote your time entirely to your estate asked Chichikov in his turn Well most of it replied Manilov though also we pay occasional visits to the town in order that we may mingle with a little well bred society One grows a trifle rusty if one lives for ever in retirement Quite so agreed Chichikov Yes quite so capped Manilov At the same time it would be a different matter if the neighbourhood were a GOOD one if for example one had a friend with whom one could discuss manners and polite deportment or engage in some branch of science and so stimulate one s wits For that sort of thing gives one s intellect an airing It it At a loss for further words he ended by remarking that his feelings were apt to carry him away after which he continued with a gesture What I mean is that were that sort of thing possible I for one could find the country and an isolated life possessed of great attractions But as matters stand such a thing is NOT possible All that I can manage to do is occasionally to read a little of A Son of the Fatherland With these sentiments Chichikov expressed entire agreement adding that nothing could be more delightful than to lead a solitary life in which there should be comprised only the sweet contemplation of nature and the intermittent perusal of a book Nay but even THAT were worth nothing had not one a friend with whom to share one s life remarked Manilov True true agreed Chichikov Without a friend what are all the treasures in the world Possess not money a wise man has said but rather good friends to whom to turn in case of need Yes Paul Ivanovitch said Manilov with a glance not merely sweet but positively luscious a glance akin to the mixture which even clever physicians have to render palatable before they can induce a hesitant patient to take it Consequently you may imagine what happiness what PERFECT happiness so to speak the present occasion has brought me seeing that I am permitted to converse with you and to enjoy your conversation But WHAT of my conversation replied Chichikov I am an insignificant individual and beyond that nothing Oh Paul Ivanovitch cried the other Permit me to be frank and to say that I would give half my property to possess even a PORTION of the talents which you possess On the contrary I should consider it the highest honour in the world if The lengths to which this mutual outpouring of soul would have proceeded had not a servant entered to announce luncheon must remain a mystery I humbly invite you to join us at table said Manilov Also you will pardon us for the fact that we cannot provide a banquet such as is to be obtained in our metropolitan cities We partake of simple fare according to Russian custom we confine ourselves to shtchi ten but we do so with a single heart Come I humbly beg of you After another contest for the honour of yielding precedence Chichikov succeeded in making his way in zigzag fashion to the dining room where they found awaiting them a couple of youngsters These were Manilov s sons and boys of the age which admits of their presence at table but necessitates the continued use of high chairs Beside them was their tutor who bowed politely and smiled after which the hostess took her seat before her soup plate and the guest of honour found himself esconsed between her and the master of the house while the servant tied up the boys necks in bibs What charming children said Chichikov as he gazed at the pair And how old are they The eldest is eight replied Manilov and the younger one attained the age of six yesterday Themistocleus went on the father turning to his first born who was engaged in striving to free his chin from the bib with which the footman had encircled it On hearing this distinctly Greek name to which for some unknown reason Manilov always appended the termination eus Chichikov raised his eyebrows a little but hastened the next moment to restore his face to a more befitting expression Themistocleus repeated the father tell me which is the finest city in France Upon this the tutor concentrated his attention upon Themistocleus and appeared to be trying hard to catch his eye Only when Themistocleus had muttered Paris did the preceptor grow calmer and nod his head And which is the finest city in Russia continued Manilov Again the tutor s attitude became wholly one of concentration saint Petersburg replied Themistocleus And what other city Moscow responded the boy Clever little dear burst out Chichikov turning with an air of surprise to the father Indeed I feel bound to say that the child evinces the greatest possible potentialities You do not know him fully replied the delighted Manilov The amount of sharpness which he possesses is extraordinary Our younger one Alkid is not so quick whereas his brother well no matter what he may happen upon whether upon a cowbug or upon a water beetle or upon anything else his little eyes begin jumping out of his head and he runs to catch the thing and to inspect it For HIM I am reserving a diplomatic post Themistocleus added the father again turning to his son do you wish to become an ambassador Yes I do replied Themistocleus chewing a piece of bread and wagging his head from side to side At this moment the lacquey who had been standing behind the future ambassador wiped the latter s nose and well it was that he did so since otherwise an inelegant and superfluous drop would have been added to the soup After that the conversation turned upon the joys of a quiet life though occasionally it was interrupted by remarks from the hostess on the subject of acting and actors Meanwhile the tutor kept his eyes fixed upon the speakers faces and whenever he noticed that they were on the point of laughing he at once opened his mouth and laughed with enthusiasm Probably he was a man of grateful heart who wished to repay his employers for the good treatment which he had received Once however his features assumed a look of grimness as fixing his eyes upon his vis a vis the boys he tapped sternly upon the table This happened at a juncture when Themistocleus had bitten Alkid on the ear and the said Alkid with frowning eyes and open mouth was preparing himself to sob in piteous fashion until recognising that for such a proceeding he might possibly be deprived of his plate he hastened to restore his mouth to its original expression and fell tearfully to gnawing a mutton bone the grease from which had soon covered his cheeks Every now and again the hostess would turn to Chichikov with the words You are eating nothing you have indeed taken little but invariably her guest replied Thank you I have had more than enough A pleasant conversation is worth all the dishes in the world At length the company rose from table Manilov was in high spirits and laying his hand upon his guest s shoulder was on the point of conducting him to the drawing room when suddenly Chichikov intimated to him with a meaning look that he wished to speak to him on a very important matter That being so said Manilov allow me to invite you into my study And he led the way to a small room which faced the blue of the forest This is my sanctum he added What a pleasant apartment remarked Chichikov as he eyed it carefully And indeed the room did not lack a certain attractiveness The walls were painted a sort of blueish grey colour and the furniture consisted of four chairs a settee and a table the latter of which bore a few sheets of writing paper and the book of which I have before had occasion to speak But the most prominent feature of the room was tobacco which appeared in many different guises in packets in a tobacco jar and in a loose heap strewn about the table Likewise both window sills were studded with little heaps of ash arranged not without artifice in rows of more or less tidiness Clearly smoking afforded the master of the house a frequent means of passing the time Permit me to offer you a seat on this settee said Manilov Here you will be quieter than you would be in the drawing room But I should prefer to sit upon this chair I cannot allow that objected the smiling Manilov The settee is specially reserved for my guests Whether you choose or no upon it you MUST sit Accordingly Chichikov obeyed And also let me hand you a pipe No I never smoke answered Chichikov civilly and with an assumed air of regret And why inquired Manilov equally civilly but with a regret that was wholly genuine Because I fear that I have never quite formed the habit owing to my having heard that a pipe exercises a desiccating effect upon the system Then allow me to tell you that that is mere prejudice Nay I would even go so far as to say that to smoke a pipe is a healthier practice than to take snuff Among its members our regiment numbered a lieutenant a most excellent well educated fellow who was simply INCAPABLE of removing his pipe from his mouth whether at table or pardon me in other places He is now forty yet no man could enjoy better health than he has always done Chichikov replied that such cases were common since nature comprised many things which even the finest intellect could not compass But allow me to put to you a question he went on in a tone in which there was a strange or at all events RATHER a strange note For some unknown reason also he glanced over his shoulder For some equally unknown reason Manilov glanced over HIS How long is it inquired the guest since you last rendered a census return Oh a long long time In fact I cannot remember when it was And since then have many of your serfs died I do not know To ascertain that I should need to ask my bailiff Footman go and call the bailiff I think he will be at home to day Before long the bailiff made his appearance He was a man of under forty clean shaven clad in a smock and evidently used to a quiet life seeing that his face was of that puffy fullness and the skin encircling his slit like eyes was of that sallow tint which shows that the owner of those features is well acquainted with a feather bed In a trice it could be seen that he had played his part in life as all such bailiffs do that originally a young serf of elementary education he had married some Agashka of a housekeeper or a mistress s favourite and then himself become housekeeper and subsequently bailiff after which he had proceeded according to the rules of his tribe that is to say he had consorted with and stood in with the more well to do serfs on the estate and added the poorer ones to the list of forced payers of obrok while himself leaving his bed at nine o clock in the morning and when the samovar had been brought drinking his tea at leisure Look here my good man said Manilov How many of our serfs have died since the last census revision How many of them have died Why a great many The bailiff hiccoughed and slapped his mouth lightly after doing so Yes I imagined that to be the case corroborated Manilov In fact a VERY great many serfs have died He turned to Chichikov and repeated the words How many for instance asked Chichikov Yes how many re echoed Manilov HOW many re echoed the bailiff Well no one knows the exact number for no one has kept any account Quite so remarked Manilov I supposed the death rate to have been high but was ignorant of its precise extent Then would you be so good as to have it computed for me said Chichikov And also to have a detailed list of the deaths made out Yes I will a detailed list agreed Manilov 
1987_144135_000002_000014	train-clean-360	Very well 
none	none	The bailiff departed For what purpose do you want it inquired Manilov when the bailiff had gone The question seemed to embarrass the guest for in Chichikov s face there dawned a sort of tense expression and it reddened as though its owner were striving to express something not easy to put into words True enough Manilov was now destined to hear such strange and unexpected things as never before had greeted human ears You ask me said Chichikov for what purpose I want the list Well my purpose in wanting it is this that I desire to purchase a few peasants And he broke off in a gulp But may I ask HOW you desire to purchase those peasants asked Manilov With land or merely as souls for transferment that is to say by themselves and without any land I want the peasants themselves only replied Chichikov And I want dead ones at that What Excuse me but I am a trifle deaf Really your words sound most strange All that I am proposing to do replied Chichikov is to purchase the dead peasants who at the last census were returned by you as alive Manilov dropped his pipe on the floor and sat gaping Yes the two friends who had just been discussing the joys of camaraderie sat staring at one another like the portraits which of old used to hang on opposite sides of a mirror At length Manilov picked up his pipe and while doing so glanced covertly at Chichikov to see whether there was any trace of a smile to be detected on his lips whether in short he was joking But nothing of the sort could be discerned On the contrary Chichikov s face looked graver than usual Next Manilov wondered whether for some unknown reason his guest had lost his wits wherefore he spent some time in gazing at him with anxious intentness But the guest s eyes seemed clear they contained no spark of the wild restless fire which is apt to wander in the eyes of madmen All was as it should be Consequently in spite of Manilov s cogitations he could think of nothing better to do than to sit letting a stream of tobacco smoke escape from his mouth So continued Chichikov what I desire to know is whether you are willing to hand over to me to resign these actually non living but legally living peasants or whether you have any better proposal to make Manilov felt too confused and confounded to do aught but continue staring at his interlocutor I think that you are disturbing yourself unnecessarily was Chichikov s next remark I Oh no Not at all stammered Manilov Only pardon me I do not quite comprehend you You see never has it fallen to my lot to acquire the brilliant polish which is so to speak manifest in your every movement Nor have I ever been able to attain the art of expressing myself well Consequently although there is a possibility that in the er utterances which have just fallen from your lips there may lie something else concealed it may equally be that er you have been pleased so to express yourself for the sake of the beauty of the terms wherein that expression found shape Oh no asserted Chichikov I mean what I say and no more My reference to such of your pleasant souls as are dead was intended to be taken literally Manilov still felt at a loss though he was conscious that he MUST do something he MUST propound some question But what question The devil alone knew In the end he merely expelled some more tobacco smoke this time from his nostrils as well as from his mouth So went on Chichikov if no obstacle stands in the way we might as well proceed to the completion of the purchase What Of the purchase of the dead souls Of the dead souls Oh dear no Let us write them down as LIVING ones seeing that that is how they figure in the census returns Never do I permit myself to step outside the civil law great though has been the harm which that rule has wrought me in my career In my eyes an obligation is a sacred thing In the presence of the law I am dumb These last words reassured Manilov not a little yet still the meaning of the affair remained to him a mystery By way of answer he fell to sucking at his pipe with such vehemence that at length the pipe began to gurgle like a bassoon It was as though he had been seeking of it inspiration in the present unheard of juncture But the pipe only gurgled et praeterea nihil Perhaps you feel doubtful about the proposal said Chichikov Not at all replied Manilov But you will I know excuse me if I say and I say it out of no spirit of prejudice nor yet as criticising yourself in any way you will I know excuse me if I say that possibly this er this er SCHEME of yours this er TRANSACTION of yours may fail altogether to accord with the Civil Statutes and Provisions of the Realm And Manilov with a slight gesture of the head looked meaningly into Chichikov s face while displaying in his every feature including his closely compressed lips such an expression of profundity as never before was seen on any human countenance unless on that of some particularly sapient Minister of State who is debating some particularly abstruse problem Nevertheless Chichikov rejoined that the kind of scheme or transaction which he had adumbrated in no way clashed with the Civil Statutes and Provisions of Russia to which he added that the Treasury would even BENEFIT by the enterprise seeing it would draw therefrom the usual legal percentage What then do you propose asked Manilov I propose only what is above board and nothing else Then that being so it is another matter and I have nothing to urge against it said Manilov apparently reassured to the full Very well remarked Chichikov Then we need only to agree as to the price As to the price began Manilov and then stopped Presently he went on Surely you cannot suppose me capable of taking money for souls which in one sense at least have completed their existence Seeing that this fantastic whim of yours if I may so call it has seized upon you to the extent that it has I on my side shall be ready to surrender to you those souls UNCONDITIONALLY and to charge myself with the whole expenses of the sale I should be greatly to blame if I were to omit that as soon as Manilov had pronounced these words the face of his guest became replete with satisfaction Indeed grave and prudent a man though Chichikov was he had much ado to refrain from executing a leap that would have done credit to a goat an animal which as we all know finds itself moved to such exertions only during moments of the most ecstatic joy Nevertheless the guest did at least execute such a convulsive shuffle that the material with which the cushions of the chair were covered came apart and Manilov gazed at him with some misgiving Finally Chichikov s gratitude led him to plunge into a stream of acknowledgement of a vehemence which caused his host to grow confused to blush to shake his head in deprecation and to end by declaring that the concession was nothing and that his one desire being to manifest the dictates of his heart and the psychic magnetism which his friend exercised he in short looked upon the dead souls as so much worthless rubbish Not at all replied Chichikov pressing his hand after which he heaved a profound sigh Indeed he seemed in the right mood for outpourings of the heart for he continued not without a ring of emotion in his tone If you but knew the service which you have rendered to an apparently insignificant individual who is devoid both of family and kindred For what have I not suffered in my time I a drifting barque amid the tempestuous billows of life What harryings what persecutions have I not known Of what grief have I not tasted And why Simply because I have ever kept the truth in view because ever I have preserved inviolate an unsullied conscience because ever I have stretched out a helping hand to the defenceless widow and the hapless orphan After which outpouring Chichikov pulled out his handkerchief and wiped away a brimming tear Manilov s heart was moved to the core Again and again did the two friends press one another s hands in silence as they gazed into one another s tear filled eyes Indeed Manilov COULD not let go our hero s hand but clasped it with such warmth that the hero in question began to feel himself at a loss how best to wrench it free until quietly withdrawing it he observed that to have the purchase completed as speedily as possible would not be a bad thing wherefore he himself would at once return to the town to arrange matters Taking up his hat therefore he rose to make his adieus What Are you departing already said Manilov suddenly recovering himself and experiencing a sense of misgiving At that moment his wife sailed into the room Is Paul Ivanovitch leaving us so soon dearest Lizanka she said with an air of regret Yes Surely it must be that we have wearied him her spouse replied By no means asserted Chichikov pressing his hand to his heart In this breast madam will abide for ever the pleasant memory of the time which I have spent with you Believe me I could conceive of no greater blessing than to reside if not under the same roof as yourselves at all events in your immediate neighbourhood Indeed exclaimed Manilov greatly pleased with the idea How splendid it would be if you DID come to reside under our roof so that we could recline under an elm tree together and talk philosophy and delve to the very root of things Yes it WOULD be a paradisaical existence agreed Chichikov with a sigh Nevertheless he shook hands with Madame Farewell sudarina he said And farewell to YOU my esteemed host Do not forget what I have requested you to do Rest assured that I will not responded Manilov Only for a couple of days will you and I be parted from one another With that the party moved into the drawing room Farewell dearest children Chichikov went on as he caught sight of Alkid and Themistocleus who were playing with a wooden hussar which lacked both a nose and one arm Farewell dearest pets Pardon me for having brought you no presents but to tell you the truth I was not until my visit aware of your existence However now that I shall be coming again I will not fail to bring you gifts Themistocleus to you I will bring a sword You would like that would you not I should replied Themistocleus And to you Alkid I will bring a drum That would suit you would it not And he bowed in Alkid s direction Zeth a drum lisped the boy hanging his head Good Then a drum it shall be SUCH a beautiful drum What a tur r r ru ing and a tra ta ta ta ing you will be able to kick up Farewell my darling And kissing the boy s head he turned to Manilov and Madame with the slight smile which one assumes before assuring parents of the guileless merits of their offspring But you had better stay Paul Ivanovitch said the father as the trio stepped out on to the verandah See how the clouds are gathering They are only small ones replied Chichikov And you know your way to Sobakevitch s No I do not and should be glad if you would direct me If you like I will tell your coachman And in very civil fashion Manilov did so even going so far as to address the man in the second person plural On hearing that he was to pass two turnings and then to take a third Selifan remarked We shall get there all right sir and Chichikov departed amid a profound salvo of salutations and wavings of handkerchiefs on the part of his host and hostess who raised themselves on tiptoe in their enthusiasm For a long while Manilov stood following the departing britchka with his eyes In fact he continued to smoke his pipe and gaze after the vehicle even when it had become lost to view Then he re entered the drawing room seated himself upon a chair and surrendered his mind to the thought that he had shown his guest most excellent entertainment Next his mind passed imperceptibly to other matters until at last it lost itself God only knows where He thought of the amenities of a life of friendship and of how nice it would be to live with a comrade on say the bank of some river and to span the river with a bridge of his own and to build an enormous mansion with a facade lofty enough even to afford a view to Moscow On that facade he and his wife and friend would drink afternoon tea in the open air and discuss interesting subjects after which in a fine carriage they would drive to some reunion or other where with their pleasant manners they would so charm the company that the Imperial Government on learning of their merits would raise the pair to the grade of General or God knows what that is to say to heights whereof even Manilov himself could form no idea Then suddenly Chichikov s extraordinary request interrupted the dreamer s reflections and he found his brain powerless to digest it seeing that turn and turn the matter about as he might he could not properly explain its bearing Smoking his pipe he sat where he was until supper time CHAPTER III Meanwhile Chichikov seated in his britchka and bowling along the turnpike was feeling greatly pleased with himself From the preceding chapter the reader will have gathered the principal subject of his bent and inclinations wherefore it is no matter for wonder that his body and his soul had ended by becoming wholly immersed therein To all appearances the thoughts the calculations and the projects which were now reflected in his face partook of a pleasant nature since momentarily they kept leaving behind them a satisfied smile Indeed so engrossed was he that he never noticed that his coachman elated with the hospitality of Manilov s domestics was making remarks of a didactic nature to the off horse of the troika eleven a skewbald This skewbald was a knowing animal and made only a show of pulling whereas its comrades the middle horse a bay and known as the Assessor owing to his having been acquired from a gentleman of that rank and the near horse a roan would do their work gallantly and even evince in their eyes the pleasure which they derived from their exertions Ah you rascal you rascal I ll get the better of you ejaculated Selifan as he sat up and gave the lazy one a cut with his whip YOU know your business all right you German pantaloon The bay is a good fellow and does his duty and I will give him a bit over his feed for he is a horse to be respected and the Assessor too is a good horse But what are YOU shaking your ears for You are a fool so just mind when you re spoken to Tis good advice I m giving you you blockhead Ah You CAN travel when you like And he gave the animal another cut and then shouted to the trio Gee up my beauties and drew his whip gently across the backs of the skewbald s comrades not as a punishment but as a sign of his approval That done he addressed himself to the skewbald again Do you think he cried that I don t see what you are doing You can behave quite decently when you like and make a man respect you With that he fell to recalling certain reminiscences They were NICE folk those folk at the gentleman s yonder he mused I DO love a chat with a man when he is a good sort With a man of that kind I am always hail fellow well met and glad to drink a glass of tea with him or to eat a biscuit One CAN T help respecting a decent fellow For instance this gentleman of mine why every one looks up to him for he has been in the Government s service and is a Collegiate Councillor Thus soliloquising he passed to more remote abstractions until had Chichikov been listening he would have learnt a number of interesting details concerning himself However his thoughts were wholly occupied with his own subject so much so that not until a loud clap of thunder awoke him from his reverie did he glance around him The sky was completely covered with clouds and the dusty turnpike beginning to be sprinkled with drops of rain At length a second and a nearer and a louder peal resounded and the rain descended as from a bucket Falling slantwise it beat upon one side of the basketwork of the tilt until the splashings began to spurt into his face and he found himself forced to draw the curtains fitted with circular openings through which to obtain a glimpse of the wayside view and to shout to Selifan to quicken his pace Upon that the coachman interrupted in the middle of his harangue bethought him that no time was to be lost wherefore extracting from under the box seat a piece of old blanket he covered over his sleeves resumed the reins and cheered on his threefold team which it may be said had so completely succumbed to the influence of the pleasant lassitude induced by Selifan s discourse that it had taken to scarcely placing one leg before the other Unfortunately Selifan could not clearly remember whether two turnings had been passed or three Indeed on collecting his faculties and dimly recalling the lie of the road he became filled with a shrewd suspicion that A VERY LARGE NUMBER of turnings had been passed But since at moments which call for a hasty decision a Russian is quick to discover what may conceivably be the best course to take our coachman put away from him all ulterior reasoning and turning to the right at the next cross road shouted Hi my beauties and set off at a gallop Never for a moment did he stop to think whither the road might lead him It was long before the clouds had discharged their burden and meanwhile the dust on the road became kneaded into mire and the horses task of pulling the britchka heavier and heavier Also Chichikov had taken alarm at his continued failure to catch sight of Sobakevitch s country house According to his calculations it ought to have been reached long ago He gazed about him on every side but the darkness was too dense for the eye to pierce Selifan he exclaimed leaning forward in the britchka What is it barin replied the coachman Can you see the country house anywhere No barin After which with a flourish of the whip the man broke into a sort of endless drawling song In that song everything had a place By everything I mean both the various encouraging and stimulating cries with which Russian folk urge on their horses and a random unpremeditated selection of adjectives Meanwhile Chichikov began to notice that the britchka was swaying violently and dealing him occasional bumps Consequently he suspected that it had left the road and was being dragged over a ploughed field Upon Selifan s mind there appeared to have dawned a similar inkling for he had ceased to hold forth You rascal what road are you following inquired Chichikov I don t know retorted the coachman What can a man do at a time of night when the darkness won t let him even see his whip And as Selifan spoke the vehicle tilted to an angle which left Chichikov no choice but to hang on with hands and teeth At length he realised the fact that Selifan was drunk Stop stop or you will upset us he shouted to the fellow No no barin replied Selifan HOW could I upset you To upset people is wrong I know that very well and should never dream of such conduct Here he started to turn the vehicle round a little and kept on doing so until the britchka capsized on to its side and Chichikov landed in the mud on his hands and knees Fortunately Selifan succeeded in stopping the horses although they would have stopped of themselves seeing that they were utterly worn out This unforeseen catastrophe evidently astonished their driver Slipping from the box he stood resting his hands against the side of the britchka while Chichikov tumbled and floundered about in the mud in a vain endeavour to wriggle clear of the stuff Ah you said Selifan meditatively to the britchka To think of upsetting us like this You are as drunk as a lord exclaimed Chichikov No no barin Drunk indeed Why I know my manners too well A word or two with a friend that is all that I have taken Any one may talk with a decent man when he meets him There is nothing wrong in that Also we had a snack together There is nothing wrong in a snack especially a snack with a decent man What did I say to you when last you got drunk asked Chichikov Have you forgotten what I said then No no barin HOW could I forget it I know what is what and know that it is not right to get drunk All that I have been having is a word or two with a decent man for the reason that Well if I lay the whip about you you ll know then how to talk to a decent fellow I ll warrant As you please barin replied the complacent Selifan Should you whip me you will whip me and I shall have nothing to complain of Why should you not whip me if I deserve it Tis for you to do as you like Whippings are necessary sometimes for a peasant often plays the fool and discipline ought to be maintained If I have deserved it beat me Why should you not This reasoning seemed at the moment irrefutable and Chichikov said nothing more Fortunately fate had decided to take pity on the pair for from afar their ears caught the barking of a dog Plucking up courage Chichikov gave orders for the britchka to be righted and the horses to be urged forward and since a Russian driver has at least this merit that owing to a keen sense of smell being able to take the place of eyesight he can if necessary drive at random and yet reach a destination of some sort Selifan succeeded though powerless to discern a single object in directing his steeds to a country house near by and that with such a certainty of instinct that it was not until the shafts had collided with a garden wall and thereby made it clear that to proceed another pace was impossible that he stopped All that Chichikov could discern through the thick veil of pouring rain was something which resembled a verandah So he dispatched Selifan to search for the entrance gates and that process would have lasted indefinitely had it not been shortened by the circumstance that in Russia the place of a Swiss footman is frequently taken by watchdogs of which animals a number now proclaimed the travellers presence so loudly that Chichikov found himself forced to stop his ears Next a light gleamed in one of the windows and filtered in a thin stream to the garden wall thus revealing the whereabouts of the entrance gates whereupon Selifan fell to knocking at the gates until the bolts of the house door were withdrawn and there issued therefrom a figure clad in a rough cloak Who is that knocking What have you come for shouted the hoarse voice of an elderly woman We are travellers good mother said Chichikov Pray allow us to spend the night here Out upon you for a pair of gadabouts retorted the old woman A fine time of night to be arriving We don t keep an hotel mind you This is a lady s residence But what are we to do mother We have lost our way and cannot spend the night out of doors in such weather No we cannot The night is dark and cold added Selifan Hold your tongue you fool exclaimed Chichikov Who ARE you then inquired the old woman A dvorianin twelve good mother Somehow the word dvorianin seemed to give the old woman food for thought Wait a moment she said and I will tell the mistress Two minutes later she returned with a lantern in her hand the gates were opened and a light glimmered in a second window Entering the courtyard the britchka halted before a moderate sized mansion The darkness did not permit of very accurate observation being made but apparently the windows only of one half of the building were illuminated while a quagmire in front of the door reflected the beams from the same Meanwhile the rain continued to beat sonorously down upon the wooden roof and could be heard trickling into a water butt nor for a single moment did the dogs cease to bark with all the strength of their lungs One of them throwing up its head kept venting a howl of such energy and duration that the animal seemed to be howling for a handsome wager while another cutting in between the yelpings of the first animal kept restlessly reiterating like a postman s bell the notes of a very young puppy Finally an old hound which appeared to be gifted with a peculiarly robust temperament kept supplying the part of contrabasso so that his growls resembled the rumbling of a bass singer when a chorus is in full cry and the tenors are rising on tiptoe in their efforts to compass a particularly high note and the whole body of choristers are wagging their heads before approaching a climax and this contrabasso alone is tucking his bearded chin into his collar and sinking almost to a squatting posture on the floor in order to produce a note which shall cause the windows to shiver and their panes to crack Naturally from a canine chorus of such executants it might reasonably be inferred that the establishment was one of the utmost respectability To that however our damp cold hero gave not a thought for all his mind was fixed upon bed Indeed the britchka had hardly come to a standstill before he leapt out upon the doorstep missed his footing and came within an ace of falling To meet him there issued a female younger than the first but very closely resembling her and on his being conducted to the parlour a couple of glances showed him that the room was hung with old striped curtains and ornamented with pictures of birds and small antique mirrors the latter set in dark frames which were carved to resemble scrolls of foliage Behind each mirror was stuck either a letter or an old pack of cards or a stocking while on the wall hung a clock with a flowered dial More however Chichikov could not discern for his eyelids were as heavy as though smeared with treacle Presently the lady of the house herself entered an elderly woman in a sort of nightcap hastily put on and a flannel neck wrap She belonged to that class of lady landowners who are for ever lamenting failures of the harvest and their losses thereby to the class who drooping their heads despondently are all the while stuffing money into striped purses which they keep hoarded in the drawers of cupboards Into one purse they will stuff rouble pieces into another half roubles and into a third tchetvertachki thirteen although from their mien you would suppose that the cupboard contained only linen and nightshirts and skeins of wool and the piece of shabby material which is destined should the old gown become scorched during the baking of holiday cakes and other dainties or should it fall into pieces of itself to become converted into a new dress But the gown never does get burnt or wear out for the reason that the lady is too careful wherefore the piece of shabby material reposes in its unmade up condition until the priest advises that it be given to the niece of some widowed sister together with a quantity of other such rubbish Chichikov apologised for having disturbed the household with his unexpected arrival Not at all not at all replied the lady But in what dreadful weather God has brought you hither What wind and what rain You could not help losing your way Pray excuse us for being unable to make better preparations for you at this time of night Suddenly there broke in upon the hostess words the sound of a strange hissing a sound so loud that the guest started in alarm and the more so seeing that it increased until the room seemed filled with adders On glancing upwards however he recovered his composure for he perceived the sound to be emanating from the clock which appeared to be in a mind to strike To the hissing sound there succeeded a wheezing one until putting forth its best efforts the thing struck two with as much clatter as though some one had been hitting an iron pot with a cudgel That done the pendulum returned to its right left right left oscillation Chichikov thanked his hostess kindly and said that he needed nothing and she must not put herself about only for rest was he longing though also he should like to know whither he had arrived and whether the distance to the country house of land owner Sobakevitch was anything very great To this the lady replied that she had never so much as heard the name since no gentleman of the name resided in the locality But at least you are acquainted with landowner Manilov continued Chichikov No Who is he Another landed proprietor madam Well neither have I heard of him No such landowner lives hereabouts Then who ARE your local landowners Bobrov Svinin Kanapatiev Khapakin Trepakin and Plieshakov Are they rich men No none of them One of them may own twenty souls and another thirty but of gentry who own a hundred there are none Chichikov reflected that he had indeed fallen into an aristocratic wilderness At all events is the town far away he inquired About sixty versts How sorry I am that I have nothing for you to eat Should you care to drink some tea I thank you good mother but I require nothing beyond a bed Well after such a journey you must indeed be needing rest so you shall lie upon this sofa Fetinia bring a quilt and some pillows and sheets What weather God has sent us And what dreadful thunder Ever since sunset I have had a candle burning before the ikon in my bedroom My God Why your back and sides are as muddy as a boar s However have you managed to get into such a state That I am nothing worse than muddy is indeed fortunate since but for the Almighty I should have had my ribs broken Dear dear To think of all that you must have been through Had I not better wipe your back I thank you I thank you but you need not trouble Merely be so good as to tell your maid to dry my clothes Do you hear that Fetinia said the hostess turning to a woman who was engaged in dragging in a feather bed and deluging the room with feathers Take this coat and this vest and after drying them before the fire just as we used to do for your late master give them a good rub and fold them up neatly Very well mistress said Fetinia spreading some sheets over the bed and arranging the pillows Now your bed is ready for you said the hostess to Chichikov Good night dear sir I wish you good night Is there anything else that you require Perhaps you would like to have your heels tickled before retiring to rest Never could my late husband get to sleep without that having been done But the guest declined the proffered heel tickling and on his hostess taking her departure hastened to divest himself of his clothing both upper and under and to hand the garments to Fetinia She wished him good night and removed the wet trappings after which he found himself alone Not without satisfaction did he eye his bed which reached almost to the ceiling Clearly Fetinia was a past mistress in the art of beating up such a couch and as the result he had no sooner mounted it with the aid of a chair than it sank well nigh to the floor and the feathers squeezed out of their proper confines flew hither and thither into every corner of the apartment Nevertheless he extinguished the candle covered himself over with the chintz quilt snuggled down beneath it and instantly fell asleep Next day it was late in the morning before he awoke Through the window the sun was shining into his eyes and the flies which overnight had been roosting quietly on the walls and ceiling now turned their attention to the visitor One settled on his lip another on his ear a third hovered as though intending to lodge in his very eye and a fourth had the temerity to alight just under his nostrils In his drowsy condition he inhaled the latter insect sneezed violently and so returned to consciousness He glanced around the room and perceived that not all the pictures were representative of birds since among them hung also a portrait of Kutuzov fourteen and an oil painting of an old man in a uniform with red facings such as were worn in the days of the Emperor Paul fifteen At this moment the clock uttered its usual hissing sound and struck ten while a woman s face peered in at the door but at once withdrew for the reason that with the object of sleeping as well as possible Chichikov had removed every stitch of his clothing Somehow the face seemed to him familiar and he set himself to recall whose it could be At length he recollected that it was the face of his hostess His clothes he found lying clean and dry beside him so he dressed and approached the mirror meanwhile sneezing again with such vehemence that a cock which happened at the moment to be near the window which was situated at no great distance from the ground chuckled a short sharp phrase Probably it meant in the bird s alien tongue Good morning to you Chichikov retorted by calling the bird a fool and then himself approached the window to look at the view It appeared to comprise a poulterer s premises At all events the narrow yard in front of the window was full of poultry and other domestic creatures of game fowls and barn door fowls with among them a cock which strutted with measured gait and kept shaking its comb and tilting its head as though it were trying to listen to something Also a sow and her family were helping to grace the scene First she rooted among a heap of litter then in passing she ate up a young pullet lastly she proceeded carelessly to munch some pieces of melon rind To this small yard or poultry run a length of planking served as a fence while beyond it lay a kitchen garden containing cabbages onions potatoes beetroots and other household vegetables Also the garden contained a few stray fruit trees that were covered with netting to protect them from the magpies and sparrows flocks of which were even then wheeling and darting from one spot to another For the same reason a number of scarecrows with outstretched arms stood reared on long poles with surmounting one of the figures a cast off cap of the hostess s Beyond the garden again there stood a number of peasants huts Though scattered instead of being arranged in regular rows these appeared to Chichikov s eye to comprise well to do inhabitants since all rotten planks in their roofing had been replaced with new ones and none of their doors were askew and such of their tiltsheds as faced him evinced evidence of a presence of a spare waggon in some cases almost a new one This lady owns by no means a poor village said Chichikov to himself wherefore he decided then and there to have a talk with his hostess and to cultivate her closer acquaintance Accordingly he peeped through the chink of the door whence her head had recently protruded and on seeing her seated at a tea table entered and greeted her with a cheerful kindly smile Good morning dear sir she responded as she rose How have you slept She was dressed in better style than she had been on the previous evening That is to say she was now wearing a gown of some dark colour and lacked her nightcap and had swathed her neck in something stiff I have slept exceedingly well replied Chichikov seating himself upon a chair And how are YOU good madam But poorly my dear sir And why so Because I cannot sleep A pain has taken me in my middle and my legs from the ankles upwards are aching as though they were broken That will pass that will pass good mother You must pay no attention to it God grant that it MAY pass However I have been rubbing myself with lard and turpentine What sort of tea will you take In this jar I have some of the scented kind Excellent good mother Then I will take that Probably the reader will have noticed that for all his expressions of solicitude Chichikov s tone towards his hostess partook of a freer a more unceremonious nature than that which he had adopted towards Madam Manilov And here I should like to assert that howsoever much in certain respects we Russians may be surpassed by foreigners at least we surpass them in adroitness of manner In fact the various shades and subtleties of our social intercourse defy enumeration A Frenchman or a German would be incapable of envisaging and understanding all its peculiarities and differences for his tone in speaking to a millionaire differs but little from that which he employs towards a small tobacconist and that in spite of the circumstance that he is accustomed to cringe before the former With us however things are different In Russian society there exist clever folk who can speak in one manner to a landowner possessed of two hundred peasant souls and in another to a landowner possessed of three hundred and in another to a landowner possessed of five hundred In short up to the number of a million souls the Russian will have ready for each landowner a suitable mode of address For example suppose that somewhere there exists a government office and that in that office there exists a director I would beg of you to contemplate him as he sits among his myrmidons Sheer nervousness will prevent you from uttering a word in his presence so great are the pride and superiority depicted on his countenance Also were you to sketch him you would be sketching a veritable Prometheus for his glance is as that of an eagle and he walks with measured stately stride Yet no sooner will the eagle have left the room to seek the study of his superior officer than he will go scurrying along papers held close to his nose like any partridge But in society and at the evening party should the rest of those present be of lesser rank than himself the Prometheus will once more become Prometheus and the man who stands a step below him will treat him in a way never dreamt of by Ovid seeing that each fly is of lesser account than its superior fly and becomes in the presence of the latter even as a grain of sand Surely that is not Ivan Petrovitch you will say of such and such a man as you regard him Ivan Petrovitch is tall whereas this man is small and spare Ivan Petrovitch has a loud deep voice and never smiles whereas this man whoever he may be is twittering like a sparrow and smiling all the time Yet approach and take a good look at the fellow and you will see that is IS Ivan Petrovitch Alack alack will be the only remark you can make Let us return to our characters in real life We have seen that on this occasion Chichikov decided to dispense with ceremony wherefore taking up the teapot he went on as follows You have a nice little village here madam How many souls does it contain A little less than eighty dear sir But the times are hard and I have lost a great deal through last year s harvest having proved a failure But your peasants look fine strong fellows May I enquire your name Through arriving so late at night I have quite lost my wits Korobotchka the widow of a Collegiate Secretary I humbly thank you And your Christian name and patronymic Nastasia Petrovna Nastasia Petrovna Those are excellent names I have a maternal aunt named like yourself And YOUR name queried the lady May I take it that you are a Government Assessor No madam replied Chichikov with a smile I am not an Assessor but a traveller on private business Then you must be a buyer of produce How I regret that I have sold my honey so cheaply to other buyers Otherwise YOU might have bought it dear sir I never buy honey Then WHAT do you buy pray Hemp I have a little of that by me but not more than half a pood sixteen or so No madam It is in other wares that I deal Tell me have you of late years lost many of your peasants by death Yes no fewer than eighteen responded the old lady with a sigh Such a fine lot too all good workers True others have since grown up but of what use are THEY Mere striplings When the Assessor last called upon me I could have wept for though those workmen of mine are dead I have to keep on paying for them as though they were still alive And only last week my blacksmith got burnt to death Such a clever hand at his trade he was What A fire occurred at your place No no God preserve us all It was not so bad as that You must understand that the blacksmith SET HIMSELF on fire he got set on fire in his bowels through overdrinking Yes all of a sudden there burst from him a blue flame and he smouldered and smouldered until he had turned as black as a piece of charcoal Yet what a clever blacksmith he was And now I have no horses to drive out with for there is no one to shoe them In everything the will of God madam said Chichikov with a sigh Against the divine wisdom it is not for us to rebel Pray hand them over to me Nastasia Petrovna Hand over whom The dead peasants But how could I do that Quite simply Sell them to me and I will give you some money in exchange But how am I to sell them to you I scarcely understand what you mean Am I to dig them up again from the ground Chichikov perceived that the old lady was altogether at sea and that he must explain the matter wherefore in a few words he informed her that the transfer or purchase of the souls in question would take place merely on paper that the said souls would be listed as still alive And what good would they be to you asked his hostess staring at him with her eyes distended That is MY affair But they are DEAD souls Who said they were not The mere fact of their being dead entails upon you a loss as dead as the souls for you have to continue paying tax upon them whereas MY plan is to relieve you both of the tax and of the resultant trouble NOW do you understand And I will not only do as I say but also hand you over fifteen roubles per soul Is that clear enough Yes but I do not know said his hostess diffidently You see never before have I sold dead souls Quite so It would be a surprising thing if you had But surely you do not think that these dead souls are in the least worth keeping Oh no indeed Why should they be worth keeping I am sure they are not so The only thing which troubles me is the fact that they are DEAD She seems a truly obstinate old woman was Chichikov s inward comment Look here madam he added aloud You reason well but you are simply ruining yourself by continuing to pay the tax upon dead souls as though they were still alive Oh good sir do not speak of it the lady exclaimed Three weeks ago I took a hundred and fifty roubles to that Assessor and buttered him up and Then you see how it is do you not Remember that according to my plan you will never again have to butter up the Assessor seeing that it will be I who will be paying for those peasants I not YOU for I shall have taken over the dues upon them and have transferred them to myself as so many bona fide serfs Do you understand AT LAST However the old lady still communed with herself She could see that the transaction would be to her advantage yet it was one of such a novel and unprecedented nature that she was beginning to fear lest this purchaser of souls intended to cheat her Certainly he had come from God only knew where and at the dead of night too But sir I have never in my life sold dead folk only living ones Three years ago I transferred two wenches to Protopopov for a hundred roubles apiece and he thanked me kindly for they turned out splendid workers able to make napkins or anything else Yes but with the living we have nothing to do damn it I am asking you only about DEAD folk Yes yes of course But at first sight I felt afraid lest I should be incurring a loss lest you should be wishing to outwit me good sir You see the dead souls are worth rather more than you have offered for them See here madam What a woman it is HOW could they be worth more Think for yourself They are so much loss to you so much loss do you understand Take any worthless rubbishy article you like a piece of old rag for example That rag will yet fetch its price for it can be bought for paper making But these dead souls are good for NOTHING AT ALL Can you name anything that they ARE good for True true they ARE good for nothing But what troubles me is the fact that they are dead What a blockhead of a creature said Chichikov to himself for he was beginning to lose patience Bless her heart I may as well be going She has thrown me into a perfect sweat the cursed old shrew He took a handkerchief from his pocket and wiped the perspiration from his brow Yet he need not have flown into such a passion More than one respected statesman reveals himself when confronted with a business matter to be just such another as Madam Korobotchka in that once he has got an idea into his head there is no getting it out of him you may ply him with daylight clear arguments yet they will rebound from his brain as an india rubber ball rebounds from a flagstone Nevertheless wiping away the perspiration Chichikov resolved to try whether he could not bring her back to the road by another path Madam he said either you are declining to understand what I say or you are talking for the mere sake of talking If I hand you over some money fifteen roubles for each soul do you understand it is MONEY not something which can be picked up haphazard on the street For instance tell me how much you sold your honey for For twelve roubles per pood Ah Then by those words madam you have laid a trifling sin upon your soul for you did NOT sell the honey for twelve roubles By the Lord God I did Well well Never mind Honey is only honey Now you had collected that stuff it may be for a year and with infinite care and labour You had fussed after it you had trotted to and fro you had duly frozen out the bees and you had fed them in the cellar throughout the winter But these dead souls of which I speak are quite another matter for in this case you have put forth no exertions it was merely God s will that they should leave the world and thus decrease the personnel of your establishment In the former case you received so you allege twelve roubles per pood for your labour but in this case you will receive money for having done nothing at all Nor will you receive twelve roubles per item but FIFTEEN and roubles not in silver but roubles in good paper currency That these powerful inducements would certainly cause the old woman to yield Chichikov had not a doubt True his hostess replied But how strangely business comes to me as a widow Perhaps I had better wait a little longer seeing that other buyers might come along and I might be able to compare prices For shame madam For shame Think what you are saying Who else I would ask would care to buy those souls What use could they be to any one If that is so they might come in useful to ME mused the old woman aloud after which she sat staring at Chichikov with her mouth open and a face of nervous expectancy as to his possible rejoinder Dead folk useful in a household he exclaimed Why what could you do with them Set them up on poles to frighten away the sparrows from your garden The Lord save us but what things you say she ejaculated crossing herself Well WHAT could you do with them By this time they are so much bones and earth That is all there is left of them Their transfer to myself would be ON PAPER only Come come At least give me an answer Again the old woman communed with herself What are you thinking of Nastasia Petrovna inquired Chichikov I am thinking that I scarcely know what to do Perhaps I had better sell you some hemp What do I want with hemp Pardon me but just when I have made to you a different proposal altogether you begin fussing about hemp Hemp is hemp and though I may want some when I NEXT visit you I should like to know what you have to say to the suggestion under discussion Well I think it a very queer bargain Never have I heard of such a thing Upon this Chichikov lost all patience upset his chair and bid her go to the devil of which personage even the mere mention terrified her extremely Do not speak of him I beg of you she cried turning pale May God rather bless him Last night was the third night that he has appeared to me in a dream You see after saying my prayers I bethought me of telling my fortune by the cards and God must have sent him as a punishment He looked so horrible and had horns longer than a bull s I wonder you don t see SCORES of devils in your dreams Merely out of Christian charity he had come to you to say I perceive a poor widow going to rack and ruin and likely soon to stand in danger of want Well go to rack and ruin yes you and all your village together The insults exclaimed the old woman glancing at her visitor in terror I should think so continued Chichikov Indeed I cannot find words to describe you To say no more about it you are like a dog in a manger You don t want to eat the hay yourself yet you won t let anyone else touch it All that I am seeking to do is to purchase certain domestic products of yours for the reason that I have certain Government contracts to fulfil This last he added in passing and without any ulterior motive save that it came to him as a happy thought Nevertheless the mention of Government contracts exercised a powerful influence upon Nastasia Petrovna and she hastened to say in a tone that was almost supplicatory Why should you be so angry with me Had I known that you were going to lose your temper in this way I should never have discussed the matter No wonder that I lose my temper An egg too many is no great matter yet it may prove exceedingly annoying Well well I will let you have the souls for fifteen roubles each Also with regard to those contracts do not forget me if at any time you should find yourself in need of rye meal or buckwheat or groats or dead meat No I shall NEVER forget you madam he said wiping his forehead where three separate streams of perspiration were trickling down his face Then he asked her whether in the town she had any acquaintance or agent whom she could empower to complete the transference of the serfs and to carry out whatsoever else might be necessary Certainly replied Madame Korobotchka The son of our archpriest Father Cyril himself is a lawyer Upon that Chichikov begged her to accord the gentleman in question a power of attorney while to save extra trouble he himself would then and there compose the requisite letter It would be a fine thing if he were to buy up all my meal and stock for the Government thought Madame to herself I must encourage him a little There has been some dough standing ready since last night so I will go and tell Fetinia to try a few pancakes Also it might be well to try him with an egg pie We make then nicely here and they do not take long in the making So she departed to translate her thoughts into action as well as to supplement the pie with other products of the domestic cuisine while for his part Chichikov returned to the drawing room where he had spent the night in order to procure from his dispatch box the necessary writing paper The room had now been set in order the sumptuous feather bed removed and a table set before the sofa Depositing his dispatch box upon the table he heaved a gentle sigh on becoming aware that he was so soaked with perspiration that he might almost have been dipped in a river Everything from his shirt to his socks was dripping May she starve to death the cursed old harridan he ejaculated after a moment s rest Then he opened his dispatch box In passing I may say that I feel certain that at least SOME of my readers will be curious to know the contents and the internal arrangements of that receptacle Why should I not gratify their curiosity To begin with the centre of the box contained a soap dish with disposed around it six or seven compartments for razors Next came square partitions for a sand box seventeen and an inkstand as well as scooped out in their midst a hollow of pens sealing wax and anything else that required more room Lastly there were all sorts of little divisions both with and without lids for articles of a smaller nature such as visiting cards memorial cards theatre tickets and things which Chichikov had laid by as souvenirs This portion of the box could be taken out and below it were both a space for manuscripts and a secret money box the latter made to draw out from the side of the receptacle Chichikov set to work to clean a pen and then to write Presently his hostess entered the room What a beautiful box you have got my dear sir she exclaimed as she took a seat beside him Probably you bought it in Moscow Yes in Moscow replied Chichikov without interrupting his writing I thought so One CAN get good things there Three years ago my sister brought me a few pairs of warm shoes for my sons and they were such excellent articles To this day my boys wear them And what nice stamped paper you have she had peered into the dispatch box where sure enough there lay a further store of the paper in question Would you mind letting me have a sheet of it I am without any at all although I shall soon have to be presenting a plea to the land court and possess not a morsel of paper to write it on Upon this Chichikov explained that the paper was not the sort proper for the purpose that it was meant for serf indenturing and not for the framing of pleas Nevertheless to quiet her he gave her a sheet stamped to the value of a rouble Next he handed her the letter to sign and requested in return a list of her peasants Unfortunately such a list had never been compiled let alone any copies of it and the only way in which she knew the peasants names was by heart However he told her to dictate them Some of the names greatly astonished our hero so still more did the surnames Indeed frequently on hearing the latter he had to pause before writing them down Especially did he halt before a certain Peter Saveliev Neuvazhai Korito What a string of titles involuntarily he ejaculated To the Christian name of another serf was appended Korovi Kirpitch and to that of a third Koleso Ivan However at length the list was compiled and he caught a deep breath which latter proceeding caused him to catch also the attractive odour of something fried in fat I beseech you to have a morsel murmured his hostess Chichikov looked up and saw that the table was spread with mushrooms pies and other viands Try this freshly made pie and an egg continued Madame Chichikov did so and having eaten more than half of what she offered him praised the pie highly Indeed it was a toothsome dish and after his difficulties and exertions with his hostess it tasted even better than it might otherwise have done And also a few pancakes suggested Madame For answer Chichikov folded three together and having dipped them in melted butter consigned the lot to his mouth and then wiped his mouth with a napkin Twice more was the process repeated and then he requested his hostess to order the britchka to be got ready In dispatching Fetinia with the necessary instructions she ordered her to return with a second batch of hot pancakes Your pancakes are indeed splendid said Chichikov applying himself to the second consignment of fried dainties when they had arrived Yes we make them well here replied Madame Yet how unfortunate it is that the harvest should have proved so poor as to have prevented me from earning anything on my But why should you be in such a hurry to depart good sir She broke off on seeing Chichikov reach for his cap The britchka is not yet ready Then it is being got so madam it is being got so and I shall need a moment or two to pack my things As you please dear sir but do not forget me in connection with those Government contracts No I have said that NEVER shall I forget you replied Chichikov as he hurried into the hall And would you like to buy some lard continued his hostess pursuing him Lard Oh certainly Why not Only only I will do so ANOTHER time I shall have some ready at about Christmas Quite so madam THEN I will buy anything and everything the lard included And perhaps you will be wanting also some feathers I shall be having some for sale about saint Philip s Day Very well very well madam There you see she remarked as they stepped out on to the verandah The britchka is NOT yet ready But it soon will be it soon will be Only direct me to the main road How am I to do that said Madame Twould puzzle a wise man to do so for in these parts there are so many turnings However I will send a girl to guide you You could find room for her on the box seat could you not Yes of course Then I will send her She knows the way thoroughly Only do not carry her off for good Already some traders have deprived me of one of my girls Chichikov reassured his hostess on the point and Madame plucked up courage enough to scan first of all the housekeeper who happened to be issuing from the storehouse with a bowl of honey and next a young peasant who happened to be standing at the gates and while thus engaged she became wholly absorbed in her domestic pursuits But why pay her so much attention The Widow Korobotchka Madame Manilov domestic life non domestic life away with them all How strangely are things compounded In a trice may joy turn to sorrow should one halt long enough over it in a trice only God can say what ideas may strike one You may fall even to thinking After all did Madame Korobotchka stand so very low in the scale of human perfection Was there really such a very great gulf between her and Madame Manilov between her and the Madame Manilov whom we have seen entrenched behind the walls of a genteel mansion in which there were a fine staircase of wrought metal and a number of rich carpets the Madame Manilov who spent most of her time in yawning behind half read books and in hoping for a visit from some socially distinguished person in order that she might display her wit and carefully rehearsed thoughts thoughts which had been de rigeur in town for a week past yet which referred not to what was going on in her household or on her estate both of which properties were at odds and ends owing to her ignorance of the art of managing them but to the coming political revolution in France and the direction in which fashionable Catholicism was supposed to be moving But away with such things Why need we speak of them Yet how comes it that suddenly into the midst of our careless frivolous unthinking moments there may enter another and a very different tendency that the smile may not have left a human face before its owner will have radically changed his or her nature though not his or her environment with the result that the face will suddenly become lit with a radiance never before seen there Here is the britchka here is the britchka exclaimed Chichikov on perceiving that vehicle slowly advancing Ah you blockhead he went on to Selifan Why have you been loitering about I suppose last night s fumes have not yet left your brain To this Selifan returned no reply Good bye madam added the speaker But where is the girl whom you promised me Here Pelagea called the hostess to a wench of about eleven who was dressed in home dyed garments and could boast of a pair of bare feet which from a distance might almost have been mistaken for boots so encrusted were they with fresh mire Here Pelagea Come and show this gentleman the way Selifan helped the girl to ascend to the box seat Placing one foot upon the step by which the gentry mounted she covered the said step with mud and then ascending higher attained the desired position beside the coachman Chichikov followed in her wake causing the britchka to heel over with his weight as he did so and then settled himself back into his place with an All right Good bye madam as the horses moved away at a trot Selifan looked gloomy as he drove but also very attentive to his business This was invariably his custom when he had committed the fault of getting drunk Also the horses looked unusually well groomed In particular the collar on one of them had been neatly mended although hitherto its state of dilapidation had been such as perennially to allow the stuffing to protrude through the leather The silence preserved was well nigh complete Merely flourishing his whip Selifan spoke to the team no word of instruction although the skewbald was as ready as usual to listen to conversation of a didactic nature seeing that at such times the reins hung loosely in the hands of the loquacious driver and the whip wandered merely as a matter of form over the backs of the troika This time however there could be heard issuing from Selifan s sullen lips only the uniformly unpleasant exclamation Now then you brutes Get on with you get on with you The bay and the Assessor too felt put out at not hearing themselves called my pets or good lads while in addition the skewbald came in for some nasty cuts across his sleek and ample quarters What has put master out like this thought the animal as it shook its head Heaven knows where he does not keep beating me across the back and even where I am tenderer still Yes he keeps catching the whip in my ears and lashing me under the belly To the right eh snapped Selifan to the girl beside him as he pointed to a rain soaked road which trended away through fresh green fields No no she replied I will show you the road when the time comes Which way then he asked again when they had proceeded a little further This way And she pointed to the road just mentioned Get along with you retorted the coachman That DOES go to the right You don t know your right hand from your left The weather was fine but the ground so excessively sodden that the wheels of the britchka collected mire until they had become caked as with a layer of felt a circumstance which greatly increased the weight of the vehicle and prevented it from clearing the neighbouring parishes before the afternoon was arrived Also without the girl s help the finding of the way would have been impossible since roads wiggled away in every direction like crabs released from a net and but for the assistance mentioned Selifan would have found himself left to his own devices Presently she pointed to a building ahead with the words THERE is the main road And what is the building asked Selifan A tavern she said Then we can get along by ourselves he observed Do you get down and be off home With that he stopped and helped her to alight muttering as he did so Ah you blackfooted creature Chichikov added a copper groat and she departed well pleased with her ride in the gentleman s carriage CHAPTER IV On reaching the tavern Chichikov called a halt His reasons for this were twofold namely that he wanted to rest the horses and that he himself desired some refreshment In this connection the author feels bound to confess that the appetite and the capacity of such men are greatly to be envied Of those well to do folk of saint Petersburg and Moscow who spend their time in considering what they shall eat on the morrow and in composing a dinner for the day following and who never sit down to a meal without first of all injecting a pill and then swallowing oysters and crabs and a quantity of other monsters while eternally departing for Karlsbad or the Caucasus the author has but a small opinion Yes THEY are not the persons to inspire envy Rather it is the folk of the middle classes folk who at one posthouse call for bacon and at another for a sucking pig and at a third for a steak of sturgeon or a baked pudding with onions and who can sit down to table at any hour as though they had never had a meal in their lives and can devour fish of all sorts and guzzle and chew it with a view to provoking further appetite these I say are the folk who enjoy heaven s most favoured gift To attain such a celestial condition the great folk of whom I have spoken would sacrifice half their serfs and half their mortgaged and non mortgaged property with the foreign and domestic improvements thereon if thereby they could compass such a stomach as is possessed by the folk of the middle class But unfortunately neither money nor real estate whether improved or non improved can purchase such a stomach The little wooden tavern with its narrow but hospitable curtain suspended from a pair of rough hewn doorposts like old church candlesticks seemed to invite Chichikov to enter True the establishment was only a Russian hut of the ordinary type but it was a hut of larger dimensions than usual and had around its windows and gables carved and patterned cornices of bright coloured wood which threw into relief the darker hue of the walls and consorted well with the flowered pitchers painted on the shutters Ascending the narrow wooden staircase to the upper floor and arriving upon a broad landing Chichikov found himself confronted with a creaking door and a stout old woman in a striped print gown This way if you please she said Within the apartment designated Chichikov encountered the old friends which one invariably finds in such roadside hostelries to wit a heavy samovar four smooth bescratched walls of white pine a three cornered press with cups and teapots egg cups of gilded china standing in front of ikons suspended by blue and red ribands a cat lately delivered of a family a mirror which gives one four eyes instead of two and a pancake for a face and beside the ikons some bunches of herbs and carnations of such faded dustiness that should one attempt to smell them one is bound to burst out sneezing Have you a sucking pig Chichikov inquired of the landlady as she stood expectantly before him Yes And some horse radish and sour cream Yes Then serve them The landlady departed for the purpose and returned with a plate a napkin the latter starched to the consistency of dried bark a knife with a bone handle beginning to turn yellow a two pronged fork as thin as a wafer and a salt cellar incapable of being made to stand upright Following the accepted custom our hero entered into conversation with the woman and inquired whether she herself or a landlord kept the tavern how much income the tavern brought in whether her sons lived with her whether the oldest was a bachelor or married whom the eldest had taken to wife whether the dowry had been large whether the father in law had been satisfied and whether the said father in law had not complained of receiving too small a present at the wedding In short Chichikov touched on every conceivable point Likewise of course he displayed some curiosity as to the landowners of the neighbourhood Their names he ascertained were Blochin Potchitaev Minoi Cheprakov and Sobakevitch Then you are acquainted with Sobakevitch he said whereupon the old woman informed him that she knew not only Sobakevitch but also Manilov and that the latter was the more delicate eater of the two since whereas Manilov always ordered a roast fowl and some veal and mutton and then tasted merely a morsel of each Sobakevitch would order one dish only but consume the whole of it and then demand more at the same price Whilst Chichikov was thus conversing and partaking of the sucking pig until only a fragment of it seemed likely to remain the sound of an approaching vehicle made itself heard Peering through the window he saw draw up to the tavern door a light britchka drawn by three fine horses From it there descended two men one flaxen haired and tall and the other dark haired and of slighter build While the flaxen haired man was clad in a dark blue coat the other one was wrapped in a coat of striped pattern Behind the britchka stood a second but an empty turn out drawn by four long coated steeds in ragged collars and rope harnesses The flaxen haired man lost no time in ascending the staircase while his darker friend remained below to fumble at something in the britchka talking as he did so to the driver of the vehicle which stood hitched behind Somehow the dark haired man s voice struck Chichikov as familiar and as he was taking another look at him the flaxen haired gentleman entered the room The newcomer was a man of lofty stature with a small red moustache and a lean hard bitten face whose redness made it evident that its acquaintance if not with the smoke of gunpowder at all events with that of tobacco was intimate and extensive Nevertheless he greeted Chichikov civilly and the latter returned his bow Indeed the pair would have entered into conversation and have made one another s acquaintance since a beginning was made with their simultaneously expressing satisfaction at the circumstance that the previous night s rain had laid the dust on the roads and thereby made driving cool and pleasant when the gentleman s darker favoured friend also entered the room and throwing his cap upon the table pushed back a mass of dishevelled black locks from his brow The latest arrival was a man of medium height but well put together and possessed of a pair of full red cheeks a set of teeth as white as snow and coal black whiskers Indeed so fresh was his complexion that it seemed to have been compounded of blood and milk while health danced in his every feature Ha ha ha he cried with a gesture of astonishment at the sight of Chichikov What chance brings YOU here Upon that Chichikov recognised Nozdrev the man whom he had met at dinner at the Public Prosecutor s and who within a minute or two of the introduction had become so intimate with his fellow guest as to address him in the second person singular in spite of the fact that Chichikov had given him no opportunity for doing so Where have you been to day Nozdrev inquired and without waiting for an answer went on For myself I am just from the fair and completely cleaned out Actually I have had to do the journey back with stage horses Look out of the window and see them for yourself And he turned Chichikov s head so sharply in the desired direction that he came very near to bumping it against the window frame Did you ever see such a bag of tricks The cursed things have only just managed to get here In fact on the way I had to transfer myself to this fellow s britchka He indicated his companion with a finger By the way don t you know one another He is Mizhuev my brother in law He and I were talking of you only this morning Just you see said I to him if we do not fall in with Chichikov before we have done Heavens how completely cleaned out I am Not only have I lost four good horses but also my watch and chain Chichikov perceived that in very truth his interlocutor was minus the articles named as well as that one of Nozdrev s whiskers was less bushy in appearance than the other one Had I had another twenty roubles in my pocket went on Nozdrev I should have won back all that I have lost as well as have pouched a further thirty thousand Yes I give you my word of honour on that But you were saying the same thing when last I met you put in the flaxen haired man Yet even though I lent you fifty roubles you lost them all But I should not have lost them THIS time Don t try to make me out a fool I should NOT have lost them I tell you Had I only played the right card I should have broken the bank But you did NOT break the bank remarked the flaxen haired man No That was because I did not play my cards right But what about your precious major s play Is THAT good Good or not at least he beat you Splendid of him Nevertheless I will get my own back Let him play me at doubles and we shall soon see what sort of a player he is Friend Chichikov at first we had a glorious time for the fair was a tremendous success Indeed the tradesmen said that never yet had there been such a gathering I myself managed to sell everything from my estate at a good price In fact we had a magnificent time I can t help thinking of it devil take me But what a pity YOU were not there Three versts from the town there is quartered a regiment of dragoons and you would scarcely believe what a lot of officers it has Forty at least there are and they do a fine lot of knocking about the town and drinking In particular Staff Captain Potsieluev is a SPLENDID fellow You should just see his moustache Why he calls good claret trash Bring me some of the usual trash is his way of ordering it And Lieutenant Kuvshinnikov too He is as delightful as the other man In fact I may say that every one of the lot is a rake I spent my whole time with them and you can imagine that Ponomarev the wine merchant did a fine trade indeed All the same he is a rascal you know and ought not to be dealt with for he puts all sorts of rubbish into his liquor Indian wood and burnt cork and elderberry juice the villain Nevertheless get him to produce a bottle from what he calls his special cellar and you will fancy yourself in the seventh heaven of delight And what quantities of champagne we drank Compared with it provincial stuff is kvass eighteen Try to imagine not merely Clicquot but a sort of blend of Clicquot and Matradura Clicquot of double strength Also Ponomarev produced a bottle of French stuff which he calls Bonbon Had it a bouquet ask you Why it had the bouquet of a rose garden of anything else you like What times we had to be sure Just after we had left Pnomarev s place some prince or another arrived in the town and sent out for some champagne but not a bottle was there left for the officers had drunk every one Why I myself got through seventeen bottles at a sitting Come come You CAN T have got through seventeen remarked the flaxen haired man But I did I give my word of honour retorted Nozdrev Imagine what you like but you didn t drink even TEN bottles at a sitting Will you bet that I did not No for what would be the use of betting about it Then at least wager the gun which you have bought No I am not going to do anything of the kind Just as an experiment No It is as well for you that you don t since otherwise you would have found yourself minus both gun and cap However friend Chichikov it is a pity you were not there Had you been there I feel sure you would have found yourself unable to part with Lieutenant Kuvshinnikov You and he would have hit it off splendidly You know he is quite a different sort from the Public Prosecutor and our other provincial skinflints fellows who shiver in their shoes before they will spend a single kopeck HE will play faro or anything else and at any time Why did you not come with us instead of wasting your time on cattle breeding or something of the sort But never mind Embrace me I like you immensely Mizhuev see how curiously things have turned out Chichikov has nothing to do with me or I with him yet here is he come from God knows where and landed in the very spot where I happen to be living I may tell you that no matter how many carriages I possessed I should gamble the lot away Recently I went in for a turn at billiards and lost two jars of pomade a china teapot and a guitar Then I staked some more things and like a fool lost them all and six roubles in addition What a dog is that Kuvshinnikov He and I attended nearly every ball in the place In particular there was a woman decolletee and such a swell I merely thought to myself The devil take her but Kuvshinnikov is such a wag that he sat down beside her and began paying her strings of compliments in French However I did not neglect the damsels altogether although HE calls that sort of thing going in for strawberries By the way I have a splendid piece of fish and some caviare with me Tis all I HAVE brought back In fact it is a lucky chance that I happened to buy the stuff before my money was gone Where are you for I am about to call on a friend On what friend Let him go to the devil and come to my place instead I cannot I cannot I have business to do Oh business again I thought so But I HAVE business to do and pressing business at that I wager that you re lying If not tell me whom you re going to call upon Upon Sobakevitch Instantly Nozdrev burst into a laugh compassable only by a healthy man in whose head every tooth still remains as white as sugar By this I mean the laugh of quivering cheeks the laugh which causes a neighbour who is sleeping behind double doors three rooms away to leap from his bed and exclaim with distended eyes Hullo Something HAS upset him What is there to laugh at asked Chichikov a trifle nettled but Nozdrev laughed more unrestrainedly than ever ejaculating Oh spare us all The thing is so amusing that I shall die of it I say that there is nothing to laugh at repeated Chichikov It is in fulfilment of a promise that I am on my way to Sobakevitch s Then you will scarcely be glad to be alive when you ve got there for he is the veriest miser in the countryside Oh I know you However if you think to find there either faro or a bottle of Bonbon you are mistaken Look here my good friend Let Sobakevitch go to the devil and come to MY place where at least I shall have a piece of sturgeon to offer you for dinner Ponomarev said to me on parting This piece is just the thing for you Even if you were to search the whole market you would never find a better one But of course he is a terrible rogue I said to him outright You and the Collector of Taxes are the two greatest skinflints in the town But he only stroked his beard and smiled Every day I used to breakfast with Kuvshinnikov in his restaurant Well what I was nearly forgetting is this that though I am aware that you can t forgo your engagement I am not going to give you up no not for ten thousand roubles of money I tell you that in advance Here he broke off to run to the window and shout to his servant who was holding a knife in one hand and a crust of bread and a piece of sturgeon in the other he had contrived to filch the latter while fumbling in the britchka for something else Hi Porphyri Bring here that puppy you rascal What a puppy it is Unfortunately that thief of a landlord has given it nothing to eat even though I have promised him the roan filly which as you may remember I swopped from Khvostirev As a matter of act Chichikov had never in his life seen either Khvostirev or the roan filly Barin do you wish for anything to eat inquired the landlady as she entered No nothing at all Ah friend Chichikov what times we had Yes give me a glass of vodka old woman What sort to you keep Aniseed Then bring me a glass of it repeated Nozdrev And one for me as well added the flaxen haired man At the theatre went on Nozdrev there was an actress who sang like a canary Kuvshinnikov who happened to be sitting with me said My boy you had better go and gather that strawberry As for the booths at the fair they numbered I should say fifty At this point he broke off to take the glass of vodka from the landlady who bowed low in acknowledgement of his doing so At the same moment Porphyri a fellow dressed like his master that is to say in a greasy wadded overcoat entered with the puppy Put the brute down here commanded Nozdrev and then fasten it up Porphyri deposited the animal upon the floor whereupon it proceeded to act after the manner of dogs THERE S a puppy for you cried Nozdrev catching hold of it by the back and lifting it up The puppy uttered a piteous yelp I can see that you haven t done what I told you to do he continued to Porphyri after an inspection of the animal s belly You have quite forgotten to brush him I DID brush him protested Porphyri Then where did these fleas come from I cannot think Perhaps they have leapt into his coat out of the britchka You liar As a matter of fact you have forgotten to brush him Nevertheless look at these ears Chichikov Just feel them Why should I Without doing that I can see that he is well bred Nevertheless catch hold of his ears and feel them To humour the fellow Chichikov did as he had requested remarking Yes he seems likely to turn out well And feel the coldness of his nose Just take it in your hand Not wishing to offend his interlocutor Chichikov felt the puppy s nose saying Some day he will have an excellent scent Yes will he not Tis the right sort of muzzle for that I must say that I have long been wanting such a puppy Porphyri take him away again Porphyri lifted up the puppy and bore it downstairs Look here Chichikov resumed Nozdrev You MUST come to my place It lies only five versts away and we can go there like the wind and you can visit Sobakevitch afterwards Shall I or shall I not go to Nozdrev s reflected Chichikov Is he likely to prove any more useful than the rest Well at least he is as promising even though he has lost so much at play But he has a head on his shoulders and therefore I must go carefully if I am to tackle him concerning my scheme With that he added aloud Very well I WILL come with you but do not let us be long for my time is very precious That s right that s right cried Nozdrev Splendid splendid Let me embrace you And he fell upon Chichikov s neck All three of us will go No no put in the flaxen haired man You must excuse me for I must be off home Rubbish rubbish I am NOT going to excuse you But my wife will be furious with me You and Monsieur Chichikov must change into the other britchka Come come The thing is not to be thought of The flaxen haired man was one of those people in whose character at first sight there seems to lurk a certain grain of stubbornness so much so that almost before one has begun to speak they are ready to dispute one s words and to disagree with anything that may be opposed to their peculiar form of opinion For instance they will decline to have folly called wisdom or any tune danced to but their own Always however will there become manifest in their character a soft spot and in the end they will accept what hitherto they have denied and call what is foolish sensible and even dance yes better than any one else will do to a tune set by some one else In short they generally begin well but always end badly Rubbish said Nozdrev in answer to a further objection on his brother in law s part And sure enough no sooner had Nozdrev clapped his cap upon his head than the flaxen haired man started to follow him and his companion But the gentleman has not paid for the vodka put in the old woman All right all right good mother Look here brother in law Pay her will you for I have not a kopeck left How much inquired the brother in law What sir Eighty kopecks if you please replied the old woman A lie Give her half a rouble That will be quite enough No it will NOT barin protested the old woman However she took the money gratefully and even ran to the door to open it for the gentlemen As a matter of fact she had lost nothing by the transaction since she had demanded fully a quarter more than the vodka was worth The travellers then took their seats and since Chichikov s britchka kept alongside the britchka wherein Nozdrev and his brother in law were seated it was possible for all three men to converse together as they proceeded Behind them came Nozdrev s smaller buggy with its team of lean stage horses and Porphyri and the puppy But inasmuch as the conversation which the travellers maintained was not of a kind likely to interest the reader I might do worse than say something concerning Nozdrev himself seeing that he is destined to play no small role in our story Nozdrev s face will be familiar to the reader seeing that every one must have encountered many such Fellows of the kind are known as gay young sparks and even in their boyhood and school days earn a reputation for being bons camarades though with it all they come in for some hard knocks for the reason that their faces evince an element of frankness directness and enterprise which enables them soon to make friends and almost before you have had time to look around to start addressing you in the second person singular Yet while cementing such friendships for all eternity almost always they begin quarrelling the same evening since throughout they are a loquacious dissipated high spirited over showy tribe Indeed at thirty five Nozdrev was just what he had been an eighteen and twenty he was just such a lover of fast living Nor had his marriage in any way changed him and the less so since his wife had soon departed to another world and left behind her two children whom he did not want and who were therefore placed in the charge of a good looking nursemaid Never at any time could he remain at home for more than a single day for his keen scent could range over scores and scores of versts and detect any fair which promised balls and crowds Consequently in a trice he would be there quarrelling and creating disturbances over the gaming table like all men of his type he had a perfect passion for cards yet playing neither a faultless nor an over clean game since he was both a blunderer and able to indulge in a large number of illicit cuts and other devices The result was that the game often ended in another kind of sport altogether That is to say either he received a good kicking or he had his thick and very handsome whiskers pulled with the result that on certain occasions he returned home with one of those appendages looking decidedly ragged Yet his plump healthy looking cheeks were so robustly constituted and contained such an abundance of recreative vigour that a new whisker soon sprouted in place of the old one and even surpassed its predecessor Again and the following is a phenomenon peculiar to Russia a very short time would have elapsed before once more he would be consorting with the very cronies who had recently cuffed him and consorting with them as though nothing whatsoever had happened no reference to the subject being made by him and they too holding their tongues In short Nozdrev was as it were a man of incident Never was he present at any gathering without some sort of a fracas occurring thereat Either he would require to be expelled from the room by gendarmes or his friends would have to kick him out into the street At all events should neither of those occurrences take place at least he did something of a nature which would not otherwise have been witnessed That is to say should he not play the fool in a buffet to such an extent as to make very one smile you may be sure that he was engaged in lying to a degree which at times abashed even himself Moreover the man lied without reason For instance he would begin telling a story to the effect that he possessed a blue coated or a red coated horse until in the end his listeners would be forced to leave him with the remark You are giving us some fine stuff old fellow Also men like Nozdrev have a passion for insulting their neighbours without the least excuse afforded For that matter even a man of good standing and of respectable exterior a man with a star on his breast may unexpectedly press your hand one day and begin talking to you on subjects of a nature to give food for serious thought Yet just as unexpectedly may that man start abusing you to your face and do so in a manner worthy of a collegiate registrar rather than of a man who wears a star on his breast and aspires to converse on subjects which merit reflection All that one can do in such a case is to stand shrugging one s shoulders in amazement Well Nozdrev had just such a weakness The more he became friendly with a man the sooner would he insult him and be ready to spread calumnies as to his reputation Yet all the while he would consider himself the insulted one s friend and should he meet him again would greet him in the most amicable style possible and say You rascal why have you given up coming to see me Thus taken all round Nozdrev was a person of many aspects and numerous potentialities In one and the same breath would he propose to go with you whithersoever you might choose even to the very ends of the world should you so require or to enter upon any sort of an enterprise with you or to exchange any commodity for any other commodity which you might care to name Guns horses dogs all were subjects for barter though not for profit so far as YOU were concerned Such traits are mostly the outcome of a boisterous temperament as is additionally exemplified by the fact that if at a fair he chanced to fall in with a simpleton and to fleece him he would then proceed to buy a quantity of the very first articles which came to hand horse collars cigar lighters dresses for his nursemaid foals raisins silver ewers lengths of holland wheatmeal tobacco revolvers dried herrings pictures whetstones crockery boots and so forth until every atom of his money was exhausted Yet seldom were these articles conveyed home since as a rule the same day saw them lost to some more skilful gambler in addition to his pipe his tobacco pouch his mouthpiece his four horsed turn out and his coachman with the result that stripped to his very shirt he would be forced to beg the loan of a vehicle from a friend Such was Nozdrev Some may say that characters of his type have become extinct that Nozdrevs no longer exist Alas such as say this will be wrong for many a day must pass before the Nozdrevs will have disappeared from our ken Everywhere they are to be seen in our midst the only difference between the new and the old being a difference of garments Persons of superficial observation are apt to consider that a man clad in a different coat is quite a different person from what he used to be To continue The three vehicles bowled up to the steps of Nozdrev s house and their occupants alighted But no preparations whatsoever had been made for the guest s reception for on some wooden trestles in the centre of the dining room a couple of peasants were engaged in whitewashing the ceiling and drawling out an endless song as they splashed their stuff about the floor Hastily bidding peasants and trestles to be gone Nozdrev departed to another room with further instructions Indeed so audible was the sound of his voice as he ordered dinner that Chichikov who was beginning to feel hungry once more was enabled to gather that it would be at least five o clock before a meal of any kind would be available On his return Nozdrev invited his companions to inspect his establishment even though as early as two o clock he had to announce that nothing more was to be seen The tour began with a view of the stables where the party saw two mares the one a grey and the other a roan and a colt which latter animal though far from showy Nozdrev declared to have cost him ten thousand roubles You NEVER paid ten thousand roubles for the brute exclaimed the brother in law He isn t worth even a thousand By God I DID pay ten thousand asserted Nozdrev You can swear that as much as you like retorted the other Will you bet that I did not asked Nozdrev but the brother in law declined the offer Next Nozdrev showed his guests some empty stalls where a number of equally fine animals so he alleged had lately stood Also there was on view the goat which an old belief still considers to be an indispensable adjunct to such places even though its apparent use is to pace up and down beneath the noses of the horses as though the place belonged to it Thereafter the host took his guests to look at a young wolf which he had got tied to a chain He is fed on nothing but raw meat he explained for I want him to grow up as fierce as possible Then the party inspected a pond in which there were fish of such a size that it would take two men all their time to lift one of them out This piece of information was received with renewed incredulity on the part of the brother in law Now Chichikov went on Nozdrev let me show you a truly magnificent brace of dogs The hardness of their muscles will surprise you and they have jowls as sharp as needles So saying he led the way to a small but neatly built shed surrounded on every side with a fenced in run Entering this run the visitors beheld a number of dogs of all sorts and sizes and colours In their midst Nozdrev looked like a father lording it over his family circle Erecting their tails their stems as dog fanciers call those members the animals came bounding to greet the party and fully a score of them laid their paws upon Chichikov s shoulders Indeed one dog was moved with such friendliness that standing on its hind legs it licked him on the lips and so forced him to spit That done the visitors duly inspected the couple already mentioned and expressed astonishment at their muscles True enough they were fine animals Next the party looked at a Crimean bitch which though blind and fast nearing her end had two years ago been a truly magnificent dog At all events so said Nozdrev Next came another bitch also blind then an inspection of the water mill which lacked the spindle socket wherein the upper stone ought to have been revolving fluttering to use the Russian peasant s quaint expression But never mind said Nozdrev Let us proceed to the blacksmith s shop So to the blacksmith s shop the party proceeded and when the said shop had been viewed Nozdrev said as he pointed to a field In this field I have seen such numbers of hares as to render the ground quite invisible Indeed on one occasion I with my own hands caught a hare by the hind legs You never caught a hare by the hind legs with your hands remarked the brother in law But I DID reiterated Nozdrev However let me show you the boundary where my lands come to an end So saying he started to conduct his guests across a field which consisted mostly of moleheaps and in which the party had to pick their way between strips of ploughed land and of harrowed Soon Chichikov began to feel weary for the terrain was so low lying that in many spots water could be heard squelching underfoot and though for a while the visitors watched their feet and stepped carefully they soon perceived that such a course availed them nothing and took to following their noses without either selecting or avoiding the spots where the mire happened to be deeper or the reverse At length when a considerable distance had been covered they caught sight of a boundary post and a narrow ditch That is the boundary said Nozdrev Everything that you see on this side of the post is mine as well as the forest on the other side of it and what lies beyond the forest WHEN did that forest become yours asked the brother in law It cannot be long since you purchased it for it never USED to be yours Yes it isn t long since I purchased it said Nozdrev How long How long Why I purchased it three days ago and gave a pretty sum for it as the devil knows Indeed Why three days ago you were at the fair Wiseacre Cannot one be at a fair and buy land at the same time Yes I WAS at the fair and my steward bought the land in my absence Oh your STEWARD bought it The brother in law seemed doubtful and shook his head The guests returned by the same route as that by which they had come whereafter on reaching the house Nozdrev conducted them to his study which contained not a trace of the things usually to be found in such apartments such things as books and papers On the contrary the only articles to be seen were a sword and a brace of guns the one of them worth three hundred roubles and the other about eight hundred The brother in law inspected the articles in question and then shook his head as before Next the visitors were shown some real Turkish daggers of which one bore the inadvertent inscription Saveli Sibiriakov nineteen Master Cutler Then came a barrel organ on which Nozdrev started to play some tune or another For a while the sounds were not wholly unpleasing but suddenly something seemed to go wrong for a mazurka started to be followed by Marlborough has gone to the war and to this again there succeeded an antiquated waltz Also long after Nozdrev had ceased to turn the handle one particularly shrill pitched pipe which had throughout refused to harmonise with the rest kept up a protracted whistling on its own account Then followed an exhibition of tobacco pipes pipes of clay of wood of meerschaum pipes smoked and non smoked pipes wrapped in chamois leather and not so wrapped an amber mounted hookah a stake won at cards and a tobacco pouch worked it was alleged by some countess who had fallen in love with Nozdrev at a posthouse and whose handiwork Nozdrev averred to constitute the sublimity of superfluity a term which in the Nozdrevian vocabulary purported to signify the acme of perfection Finally after some hors d oeuvres of sturgeon s back they sat down to table the time being then nearly five o clock But the meal did not constitute by any means the best of which Chichikov had ever partaken seeing that some of the dishes were overcooked and others were scarcely cooked at all Evidently their compounder had trusted chiefly to inspiration she had laid hold of the first thing which had happened to come to hand For instance had pepper represented the nearest article within reach she had added pepper wholesale Had a cabbage chanced to be so encountered she had pressed it also into the service And the same with milk bacon and peas In short her rule seemed to have been Make a hot dish of some sort and some sort of taste will result For the rest Nozdrev drew heavily upon the wine Even before the soup had been served he had poured out for each guest a bumper of port and another of haut sauterne Never in provincial towns is ordinary vulgar sauterne even procurable Next he called for a bottle of madeira as fine a tipple as ever a field marshall drank but the madeira only burnt the mouth since the dealers familiar with the taste of our landed gentry who love good madeira invariably doctor the stuff with copious dashes of rum and Imperial vodka in the hope that Russian stomachs will thus be enabled to carry off the lot After this bottle Nozdrev called for another and a very special brand a brand which he declared to consist of a blend of burgundy and champagne and of which he poured generous measures into the glasses of Chichikov and the brother in law as they sat to right and left of him But since Chichikov noticed that after doing so he added only a scanty modicum of the mixture to his own tumbler our hero determined to be cautious and therefore took advantage of a moment when Nozdrev had again plunged into conversation and was yet a third time engaged in refilling his brother in law s glass to contrive to upset his Chichikov s glass over his plate In time there came also to table a tart of mountain ashberries berries which the host declared to equal in taste ripe plums but which curiously enough smacked more of corn brandy Next the company consumed a sort of pasty of which the precise name has escaped me but which the host rendered differently even on the second occasion of its being mentioned The meal over and the whole tale of wines tried the guests still retained their seats a circumstance which embarrassed Chichikov seeing that he had no mind to propound his pet scheme in the presence of Nozdrev s brother in law who was a complete stranger to him No that subject called for amicable and PRIVATE conversation Nevertheless the brother in law appeared to bode little danger seeing that he had taken on board a full cargo and was now engaged in doing nothing of a more menacing nature than picking his nose At length he himself noticed that he was not altogether in a responsible condition wherefore he rose and began to make excuses for departing homewards though in a tone so drowsy and lethargic that to quote the Russian proverb he might almost have been pulling a collar on to a horse by the clasps No no cried Nozdrev I am NOT going to let you go But I MUST go replied the brother in law Don t dry to hinder me You are annoying me greatly Rubbish We are going to play a game of banker No no You must play it without me my friend My wife is expecting me at home and I must go and tell her all about the fair Yes I MUST go if I am to please her Do not try to detain me Your wife be But have you REALLY an important piece of business with her No no my friend The real reason is that she is a good and trustful woman and that she does a great deal for me The tears spring to my eyes as I think of it Do not detain me As an honourable man I say that I must go Of that I do assure you in all sincerity Oh let him go put in Chichikov under his breath What use will he be here Very well said Nozdrev though damn it I do not like fellows who lose their heads Then he added to his brother in law All right Thetuk twenty Off you go to your wife and your woman s talk and may the devil go with you Do not insult me with the term Thetuk retorted the brother in law To her I owe my life and she is a dear good woman and has shown me much affection At the very thought of it I could weep You see she will be asking me what I have seen at the fair and tell her about it I must for she is such a dear good woman Then off you go to her with your pack of lies Here is your cap No good friend you are not to speak of her like that By so doing you offend me greatly I say that she is a dear good woman Then run along home to her Yes I am just going Excuse me for having been unable to stay Gladly would I have stayed but really I cannot The brother in law repeated his excuses again and again without noticing that he had entered the britchka that it had passed through the gates and that he was now in the open country Permissibly we may suppose that his wife succeeded in gleaning from him few details of the fair What a fool said Nozdrev as standing by the window he watched the departing vehicle Yet his off horse is not such a bad one For a long time past I have been wanting to get hold of it A man like that is simply impossible Yes he is a Thetuk a regular Thetuk With that they repaired to the parlour where on Porphyri bringing candles Chichikov perceived that his host had produced a pack of cards I tell you what said Nozdrev pressing the sides of the pack together and then slightly bending them so that the pack cracked and a card flew out How would it be if to pass the time I were to make a bank of three hundred Chichikov pretended not to have heard him but remarked with an air of having just recollected a forgotten point By the way I had omitted to say that I have a request to make of you What request First give me your word that you will grant it What is the request I say Then you give me your word do you Certainly Your word of honour My word of honour This then is my request I presume that you have a large number of dead serfs whose names have not yet been removed from the revision list I have But why do you ask Because I want you to make them over to me Of what use would they be to you Never mind I have a purpose in wanting them What purpose A purpose which is strictly my own affair In short I need them You seem to have hatched a very fine scheme Out with it now What is in the wind How could I have hatched such a scheme as you say One could not very well hatch a scheme out of such a trifle as this Then for what purpose do you want the serfs Oh the curiosity of the man He wants to poke his fingers into and smell over every detail Why do you decline to say what is in your mind At all events until you DO say I shall not move in the matter But how would it benefit you to know what my plans are A whim has seized me That is all Nor are you playing fair You have given me your word of honour yet now you are trying to back out of it No matter what you desire me to do I decline to do it until you have told me your purpose What am I to say to the fellow thought Chichikov He reflected for a moment and then explained that he wanted the dead souls in order to acquire a better standing in society since at present he possessed little landed property and only a handful of serfs You are lying said Nozdrev without even letting him finish Yes you are lying my good friend Chichikov himself perceived that his device had been a clumsy one and his pretext weak I must tell him straight out he said to himself as he pulled his wits together Should I tell you the truth he added aloud I must beg of you not to repeat it The truth is that I am thinking of getting married But unfortunately my betrothed s father and mother are very ambitious people and do not want me to marry her since they desire the bridegroom to own not less than three hundred souls whereas I own but a hundred and fifty and that number is not sufficient Again you are lying said Nozdrev Then look here I have been lying only to this extent And Chichikov marked off upon his little finger a minute portion Nevertheless I will bet my head that you have been lying throughout Come come That is not very civil of you Why should I have been lying Because I know you and know that you are a regular skinflint I say that in all friendship If I possessed any power over you I should hang you to the nearest tree This remark hurt Chichikov for at any time he disliked expressions gross or offensive to decency and never allowed any one no not even persons of the highest rank to behave towards him with an undue measure of familiarity Consequently his sense of umbrage on the present occasion was unbounded By God I WOULD hang you repeated Nozdrev I say this frankly and not for the purpose of offending you but simply to communicate to you my friendly opinion To everything there are limits retorted Chichikov stiffly If you want to indulge in speeches of that sort you had better return to the barracks However after a pause he added If you do not care to give me the serfs why not SELL them SELL them I know you you rascal You wouldn t give me very much for them WOULD you A nice fellow Look here What are they to you So many diamonds eh I thought so I know you Pardon me but I could wish that you were a member of the Jewish persuasion You would give them to me fast enough then On the contrary to show you that I am not a usurer I will decline to ask of you a single kopeck for the serfs All that you need do is to buy that colt of mine and then I will throw in the serfs in addition But what should I want with your colt said Chichikov genuinely astonished at the proposal What should YOU want with him Why I have bought him for ten thousand roubles and am ready to let you have him for four I ask you again of what use could the colt possibly be to me I am not the keeper of a breeding establishment Ah I see that you fail to understand me Let me suggest that you pay down at once three thousand roubles of the purchase money and leave the other thousand until later But I do not mean to buy the colt damn him Then buy the roan mare No nor the roan mare Then you shall have both the mare and the grey horse which you have seen in my stables for two thousand roubles I require no horses at all But you would be able to sell them again You would be able to get thrice their purchase price at the very first fair that was held Then sell them at that fair yourself seeing that you are so certain of making a triple profit Oh I should make it fast enough only I want YOU to benefit by the transaction Chichikov duly thanked his interlocutor but continued to decline either the grey horse or the roan mare Then buy a few dogs said Nozdrev I can sell you a couple of hides a quiver ears well pricked coats like quills ribs barrel shaped and paws so tucked up as scarcely to graze the ground when they run Of what use would those dogs be to me I am not a sportsman But I WANT you to have the dogs Listen If you won t have the dogs then buy my barrel organ Tis a splendid instrument As a man of honour I can tell you that when new it cost me fifteen hundred roubles Well you shall have it for nine hundred Come come What should I want with a barrel organ I am not a German to go hauling it about the roads and begging for coppers But this is quite a different kind of organ from the one which Germans take about with them You see it is a REAL organ Look at it for yourself It is made of the best wood I will take you to have another view of it And seizing Chichikov by the hand Nozdrev drew him towards the other room where in spite of the fact that Chichikov with his feet planted firmly on the floor assured his host again and again that he knew exactly what the organ was like he was forced once more to hear how Marlborough went to the war Then since you don t care to give me any money for it persisted Nozdrev listen to the following proposal I will give you the barrel organ and all the dead souls which I possess and in return you shall give me your britchka and another three hundred roubles into the bargain Listen to the man In that case what should I have left to drive in Oh I would stand you another britchka Come to the coach house and I will show you the one I mean It only needs repainting to look a perfectly splendid britchka The ramping incorrigible devil thought Chichikov to himself as at all hazards he resolved to escape from britchkas organs and every species of dog however marvellously barrel ribbed and tucked up of paw And in exchange you shall have the britchka the barrel organ and the dead souls repeated Nozdrev I must decline the offer said Chichikov And why Because I don t WANT the things I am full up already I can see that you don t know how things should be done between good friends and comrades Plainly you are a man of two faces What do you mean you fool Think for yourself Why should I acquire articles which I don t want Say no more about it if you please I have quite taken your measure But see here Should you care to play a game of banker I am ready to stake both the dead souls and the barrel organ at cards No to leave an issue to cards means to submit oneself to the unknown said Chichikov covertly glancing at the pack which Nozdrev had got in his hands Somehow the way in which his companion had cut that pack seemed to him suspicious Why to the unknown asked Nozdrev There is no such thing as the unknown Should luck be on your side you may win the devil knows what a haul Oh luck luck he went on beginning to deal in the hope of raising a quarrel Here is the cursed nine upon which the other night I lost everything All along I knew that I should lose my money Said I to myself The devil take you you false accursed card Just as Nozdrev uttered the words Porphyri entered with a fresh bottle of liquor but Chichikov declined either to play or to drink Why do you refuse to play asked Nozdrev Because I feel indisposed to do so Moreover I must confess that I am no great hand at cards WHY are you no great hand at them Chichikov shrugged his shoulders Because I am not he replied You are no great hand at ANYTHING I think What does that matter God has made me so The truth is that you are a Thetuk and nothing else Once upon a time I believed you to be a good fellow but now I see that you don t understand civility One cannot speak to you as one would to an intimate for there is no frankness or sincerity about you You are a regular Sobakevitch just such another as he For what reason are you abusing me Am I in any way at fault for declining to play cards Sell me those souls if you are the man to hesitate over such rubbish The foul fiend take you I was about to have given them to you for nothing but now you shan t have them at all not if you offer me three kingdoms in exchange Henceforth I will have nothing to do with you you cobbler you dirty blacksmith Porphyri go and tell the ostler to give the gentleman s horses no oats but only hay This development Chichikov had hardly expected And do you added Nozdrev to his guest get out of my sight Yet in spite of this host and guest took supper together even though on this occasion the table was adorned with no wines of fictitious nomenclature but only with a bottle which reared its solitary head beside a jug of what is usually known as vin ordinaire When supper was over Nozdrev said to Chichikov as he conducted him to a side room where a bed had been made up This is where you are to sleep I cannot very well wish you good night Left to himself on Nozdrev s departure Chichikov felt in a most unenviable frame of mind Full of inward vexation he blamed himself bitterly for having come to see this man and so wasted valuable time but even more did he blame himself for having told him of his scheme for having acted as carelessly as a child or a madman Of a surety the scheme was not one which ought to have been confided to a man like Nozdrev for he was a worthless fellow who might lie about it and append additions to it and spread such stories as would give rise to God knows what scandals This is indeed bad Chichikov said to himself I have been an absolute fool Consequently he spent an uneasy night this uneasiness being increased by the fact that a number of small but vigorous insects so feasted upon him that he could do nothing but scratch the spots and exclaim The devil take you and Nozdrev alike Only when morning was approaching did he fall asleep On rising he made it his first business after donning dressing gown and slippers to cross the courtyard to the stable for the purpose of ordering Selifan to harness the britchka Just as he was returning from his errand he encountered Nozdrev clad in a dressing gown and holding a pipe between his teeth Host and guest greeted one another in friendly fashion and Nozdrev inquired how Chichikov had slept Fairly well replied Chichikov but with a touch of dryness in his tone The same with myself said Nozdrev The truth is that such a lot of nasty brutes kept crawling over me that even to speak of it gives me the shudders Likewise as the effect of last night s doings a whole squadron of soldiers seemed to be camping on my chest and giving me a flogging Ugh And whom also do you think I saw in a dream You would never guess Why it was Staff Captain Potsieluev and Lieutenant Kuvshinnikov Yes though Chichikov to himself and I wish that they too would give you a public thrashing I felt so ill went on Nozdrev And just after I had fallen asleep something DID come and sting me Probably it was a party of hag fleas Now dress yourself and I will be with you presently First of all I must give that scoundrel of a bailiff a wigging Chichikov departed to his own room to wash and dress which process completed he entered the dining room to find the table laid with tea things and a bottle of rum Clearly no broom had yet touched the place for there remained traces of the previous night s dinner and supper in the shape of crumbs thrown over the floor and tobacco ash on the tablecloth The host himself when he entered was still clad in a dressing gown exposing a hairy chest and as he sat holding his pipe in his hand and drinking tea from a cup he would have made a model for the sort of painter who prefers to portray gentlemen of the less curled and scented order What think you he asked of Chichikov after a short silence Are you willing NOW to play me for those souls I have told you that I never play cards If the souls are for sale I will buy them I decline to sell them Such would not be the course proper between friends But a game of banker would be quite another matter Let us deal the cards I have told you that I decline to play And you will not agree to an exchange No Then look here Suppose we play a game of chess If you win the souls shall be yours There are lot which I should like to see crossed off the revision list Hi Porphyri Bring me the chessboard You are wasting your time I will play neither chess nor cards But chess is different from playing with a bank In chess there can be neither luck nor cheating for everything depends upon skill In fact I warn you that I cannot possibly play with you unless you allow me a move or two in advance The same with me thought Chichikov Shall I or shall I not play this fellow I used not to be a bad chess player and it is a sport in which he would find it more difficult to be up to his tricks Very well he added aloud I WILL play you at chess And stake the souls for a hundred roubles asked Nozdrev No Why for a hundred Would it not be sufficient to stake them for fifty No What would be the use of fifty Nevertheless for the hundred roubles I will throw in a moderately old puppy or else a gold seal and watch chain Very well assented Chichikov Then how many moves are you going to allow me Is THAT to be part of the bargain Why none of course At least allow me two No none I myself am only a poor player I know you and your poor play said Nozdrev moving a chessman In fact it is a long time since last I had a chessman in my hand replied Chichikov also moving a piece Ah I know you and your poor play repeated Nozdrev moving a second chessman I say again that it is a long time since last I had a chessman in my hand And Chichikov in his turn moved Ah I know you and your poor play repeated Nozdrev for the third time as he made a third move At the same moment the cuff of one of his sleeves happened to dislodge another chessman from its position Again I say said Chichikov that tis a long time since last But hi look here Put that piece back in its place What piece This one And almost as Chichikov spoke he saw a third chessman coming into view between the queens God only knows whence that chessman had materialised No no shouted Chichikov as he rose from the table It is impossible to play with a man like you People don t move three pieces at once How three pieces All that I have done is to make a mistake to move one of my pieces by accident If you like I will forfeit it to you And whence has the third piece come What third piece The one now standing between the queens Tis one of your own pieces Surely you are forgetting No no my friend I have counted every move and can remember each one That piece has only just become added to the board Put it back in its place I say Its place Which IS its place But Nozdrev had reddened a good deal I perceive you to be a strategist at the game No no good friend YOU are the strategist though an unsuccessful one as it happens Then of what are you supposing me capable Of cheating you I am not supposing you capable of anything All that I say is that I will not play with you any more But you can t refuse to said Nozdrev growing heated You see the game has begun Nevertheless I have a right not to continue it seeing that you are not playing as an honest man should do You are lying you cannot truthfully say that Tis you who are lying But I have NOT cheated Consequently you cannot refuse to play but must continue the game to a finish You cannot force me to play retorted Chichikov coldly as turning to the chessboard he swept the pieces into confusion Nozdrev approached Chichikov with a manner so threatening that the other fell back a couple of paces I WILL force you to play said Nozdrev It is no use you making a mess of the chessboard for I can remember every move We will replace the chessmen exactly as they were No no my friend The game is over and I play you no more You say that you will not Yes Surely you can see for yourself that such a thing is impossible That cock won t fight Say at once that you refuse to play with me And Nozdrev approached a step nearer Very well I DO say that replied Chichikov and at the same moment raised his hands towards his face for the dispute was growing heated Nor was the act of caution altogether unwarranted for Nozdrev also raised his fist and it may be that one of her hero s plump pleasant looking cheeks would have sustained an indelible insult had not he Chichikov parried the blow and seizing Nozdrev by his whirling arms held them fast Porphyri Pavlushka shouted Nozdrev as madly he strove to free himself On hearing the words Chichikov both because he wished to avoid rendering the servants witnesses of the unedifying scene and because he felt that it would be of no avail to hold Nozdrev any longer let go of the latter s arms but at the same moment Porphyri and Pavlushka entered the room a pair of stout rascals with whom it would be unwise to meddle Do you or do you not intend to finish the game said Nozdrev Give me a direct answer No it will not be possible to finish the game replied Chichikov glancing out of the window He could see his britchka standing ready for him and Selifan evidently awaiting orders to draw up to the entrance steps But from the room there was no escape since in the doorway was posted the couple of well built serving men Then it is as I say You refuse to finish the game repeated Nozdrev his face as red as fire I would have finished it had you played like a man of honour But as it is I cannot You cannot eh you villain You find that you cannot as soon as you find that you are not winning Thrash him you fellows And as he spoke Nozdrev grasped the cherrywood shank of his pipe Chichikov turned as white as a sheet He tried to say something but his quivering lips emitted no sound Thrash him again shouted Nozdrev as he rushed forward in a state of heat and perspiration more proper to a warrior who is attacking an impregnable fortress Thrash him again he shouted in a voice like that of some half demented lieutenant whose desperate bravery has acquired such a reputation that orders have had to be issued that his hands shall be held lest he attempt deeds of over presumptuous daring Seized with the military spirit however the lieutenant s head begins to whirl and before his eye there flits the image of Suvorov twenty one He advances to the great encounter and impulsively cries Forward my sons cries it without reflecting that he may be spoiling the plan of the general attack that millions of rifles may be protruding their muzzles through the embrasures of the impregnable towering walls of the fortress that his own impotent assault may be destined to be dissipated like dust before the wind and that already there may have been launched on its whistling career the bullet which is to close for ever his vociferous throat However if Nozdrev resembled the headstrong desperate lieutenant whom we have just pictured as advancing upon a fortress at least the fortress itself in no way resembled the impregnable stronghold which I have described As a matter of fact the fortress became seized with a panic which drove its spirit into its boots First of all the chair with which Chichikov the fortress in question sought to defend himself was wrested from his grasp by the serfs and then blinking and neither alive nor dead he turned to parry the Circassian pipe stem of his host In fact God only knows what would have happened had not the fates been pleased by a miracle to deliver Chichikov s elegant back and shoulders from the onslaught Suddenly and as unexpectedly as though the sound had come from the clouds there made itself heard the tinkling notes of a collar bell and then the rumble of wheels approaching the entrance steps and lastly the snorting and hard breathing of a team of horses as a vehicle came to a standstill Involuntarily all present glanced through the window and saw a man clad in a semi military greatcoat leap from a buggy After making an inquiry or two in the hall he entered the dining room just at the juncture when Chichikov almost swooning with terror had found himself placed in about as awkward a situation as could well befall a mortal man Kindly tell me which of you is Monsieur Nozdrev said the unknown with a glance of perplexity both at the person named who was still standing with pipe shank upraised and at Chichikov who was just beginning to recover from his unpleasant predicament Kindly tell ME whom I have the honour of addressing retorted Nozdrev as he approached the official I am the Superintendent of Rural Police And what do you want I have come to fulfil a commission imposed upon me That is to say I have come to place you under arrest until your case shall have been decided Rubbish What case pray The case in which you involved yourself when in a drunken condition and through the instrumentality of a walking stick you offered grave offence to the person of Landowner Maksimov You lie To your face I tell you that never in my life have I set eyes upon Landowner Maksimov Good sir allow me to represent to you that I am a Government officer Speeches like that you may address to your servants but not to me At this point Chichikov without waiting for Nozdrev s reply seized his cap slipped behind the Superintendent s back rushed out on to the verandah sprang into his britchka and ordered Selifan to drive like the wind CHAPTER V Certainly Chichikov was a thorough coward for although the britchka pursued its headlong course until Nozdrev s establishment had disappeared behind hillocks and hedgerows our hero continued to glance nervously behind him as though every moment expecting to see a stern chase begin His breath came with difficulty and when he tried his heart with his hands he could feel it fluttering like a quail caught in a net What a sweat the fellow has thrown me into he thought to himself while many a dire and forceful aspiration passed through his mind Indeed the expressions to which he gave vent were most inelegant in their nature But what was to be done next He was a Russian and thoroughly aroused The affair had been no joke But for the Superintendent he reflected I might never again have looked upon God s daylight I might have vanished like a bubble on a pool and left neither trace nor posterity nor property nor an honourable name for my future offspring to inherit it seemed that our hero was particularly anxious with regard to his possible issue What a scurvy barin mused Selifan as he drove along Never have I seen such a barin I should like to spit in his face Tis better to allow a man nothing to eat than to refuse to feed a horse properly A horse needs his oats they are his proper fare Even if you make a man procure a meal at his own expense don t deny a horse his oats for he ought always to have them An equally poor opinion of Nozdrev seemed to be cherished also by the steeds for not only were the bay and the Assessor clearly out of spirits but even the skewbald was wearing a dejected air True at home the skewbald got none but the poorer sorts of oats to eat and Selifan never filled his trough without having first called him a villain but at least they WERE oats and not hay they were stuff which could be chewed with a certain amount of relish Also there was the fact that at intervals he could intrude his long nose into his companions troughs especially when Selifan happened to be absent from the stable and ascertain what THEIR provender was like But at Nozdrev s there had been nothing but hay That was not right All three horses felt greatly discontented But presently the malcontents had their reflections cut short in a very rude and unexpected manner That is to say they were brought back to practicalities by coming into violent collision with a six horsed vehicle while upon their heads descended both a babel of cries from the ladies inside and a storm of curses and abuse from the coachman Ah you damned fool he vociferated I shouted to you loud enough Draw out you old raven and keep to the right Are you drunk Selifan himself felt conscious that he had been careless but since a Russian does not care to admit a fault in the presence of strangers he retorted with dignity Why have you run into US Did you leave your eyes behind you at the last tavern that you stopped at With that he started to back the britchka in the hope that it might get clear of the other s harness but this would not do for the pair were too hopelessly intertwined Meanwhile the skewbald snuffed curiously at his new acquaintances as they stood planted on either side of him while the ladies in the vehicle regarded the scene with an expression of terror One of them was an old woman and the other a damsel of about sixteen A mass of golden hair fell daintily from a small head and the oval of her comely face was as shapely as an egg and white with the transparent whiteness seen when the hands of a housewife hold a new laid egg to the light to let the sun s rays filter through its shell The same tint marked the maiden s ears where they glowed in the sunshine and in short what with the tears in her wide open arresting eyes she presented so attractive a picture that our hero bestowed upon it more than a passing glance before he turned his attention to the hubbub which was being raised among the horses and the coachmen Back out you rook of Nizhni Novgorod the strangers coachman shouted Selifan tightened his reins and the other driver did the same The horses stepped back a little and then came together again this time getting a leg or two over the traces In fact so pleased did the skewbald seem with his new friends that he refused to stir from the melee into which an unforeseen chance had plunged him Laying his muzzle lovingly upon the neck of one of his recently acquired acquaintances he seemed to be whispering something in that acquaintance s ear and whispering pretty nonsense too to judge from the way in which that confidant kept shaking his ears At length peasants from a village which happened to be near the scene of the accident tackled the mess and since a spectacle of that kind is to the Russian muzhik what a newspaper or a club meeting is to the German the vehicles soon became the centre of a crowd and the village denuded even of its old women and children The traces were disentangled and a few slaps on the nose forced the skewbald to draw back a little after which the teams were straightened out and separated Nevertheless either sheer obstinacy or vexation at being parted from their new friends caused the strange team absolutely to refuse to move a leg Their driver laid the whip about them but still they stood as though rooted to the spot At length the participatory efforts of the peasants rose to an unprecedented degree of enthusiasm and they shouted in an intermittent chorus the advice Do you Andrusha take the head of the trace horse on the right while Uncle Mitai mounts the shaft horse Get up Uncle Mitai Upon that the lean long and red bearded Uncle Mitai mounted the shaft horse in which position he looked like a village steeple or the winder which is used to raise water from wells The coachman whipped up his steeds afresh but nothing came of it and Uncle Mitai had proved useless Hold on hold on shouted the peasants again Do you Uncle Mitai mount the trace horse while Uncle Minai mounts the shaft horse Whereupon Uncle Minai a peasant with a pair of broad shoulders a beard as black as charcoal and a belly like the huge samovar in which sbiten is brewed for all attending a local market hastened to seat himself upon the shaft horse which almost sank to the ground beneath his weight NOW they will go all right the muzhiks exclaimed Lay it on hot lay it on hot Give that sorrel horse the whip and make him squirm like a koramora twenty two Nevertheless the affair in no way progressed wherefore seeing that flogging was of no use Uncles Mitai and Minai BOTH mounted the sorrel while Andrusha seated himself upon the trace horse Then the coachman himself lost patience and sent the two Uncles about their business and not before it was time seeing that the horses were steaming in a way that made it clear that unless they were first winded they would never reach the next posthouse So they were given a moment s rest That done they moved off of their own accord Throughout Chichikov had been gazing at the young unknown with great attention and had even made one or two attempts to enter into conversation with her but without success Indeed when the ladies departed it was as in a dream that he saw the girl s comely presence the delicate features of her face and the slender outline of her form vanish from his sight it was as in a dream that once more he saw only the road the britchka the three horses Selifan and the bare empty fields Everywhere in life yes even in the plainest the dingiest ranks of society as much as in those which are uniformly bright and presentable a man may happen upon some phenomenon which is so entirely different from those which have hitherto fallen to his lot Everywhere through the web of sorrow of which our lives are woven there may suddenly break a clear radiant thread of joy even as suddenly along the street of some poor poverty stricken village which ordinarily sees nought but a farm waggon there may came bowling a gorgeous coach with plated harness picturesque horses and a glitter of glass so that the peasants stand gaping and do not resume their caps until long after the strange equipage has become lost to sight Thus the golden haired maiden makes a sudden unexpected appearance in our story and as suddenly as unexpectedly disappears Indeed had it not been that the person concerned was Chichikov and not some youth of twenty summers a hussar or a student or in general a man standing on the threshold of life what thoughts would not have sprung to birth and stirred and spoken within him for what a length of time would he not have stood entranced as he stared into the distance and forgot alike his journey the business still to be done the possibility of incurring loss through lingering himself his vocation the world and everything else that the world contains But in the present case the hero was a man of middle age and of cautious and frigid temperament True he pondered over the incident but in more deliberate fashion than a younger man would have done That is to say his reflections were not so irresponsible and unsteady She was a comely damsel he said to himself as he opened his snuff box and took a pinch But the important point is Is she also a NICE DAMSEL One thing she has in her favour and that is that she appears only just to have left school and not to have had time to become womanly in the worser sense At present therefore she is like a child Everything in her is simple and she says just what she thinks and laughs merely when she feels inclined Such a damsel might be made into anything or she might be turned into worthless rubbish The latter I surmise for trudging after her she will have a fond mother and a bevy of aunts and so forth persons who within a year will have filled her with womanishness to the point where her own father wouldn t know her And to that there will be added pride and affectation and she will begin to observe established rules and to rack her brains as to how and how much she ought to talk and to whom and where and so forth Every moment will see her growing timorous and confused lest she be saying too much Finally she will develop into a confirmed prevaricator and end by marrying the devil knows whom Chichikov paused awhile Then he went on Yet I should like to know who she is and who her father is and whether he is a rich landowner of good standing or merely a respectable man who has acquired a fortune in the service of the Government Should he allow her on marriage a dowry of say two hundred thousand roubles she will be a very nice catch indeed She might even so to speak make a man of good breeding happy Indeed so attractively did the idea of the two hundred thousand roubles begin to dance before his imagination that he felt a twinge of self reproach because during the hubbub he had not inquired of the postillion or the coachman who the travellers might be But soon the sight of Sobakevitch s country house dissipated his thoughts and forced him to return to his stock subject of reflection Sobakevitch s country house and estate were of very fair size and on each side of the mansion were expanses of birch and pine forest in two shades of green The wooden edifice itself had dark grey walls and a red gabled roof for it was a mansion of the kind which Russia builds for her military settlers and for German colonists A noticeable circumstance was the fact that the taste of the architect had differed from that of the proprietor the former having manifestly been a pedant and desirous of symmetry and the latter having wished only for comfort Consequently he the proprietor had dispensed with all windows on one side of the mansion and had caused to be inserted in their place only a small aperture which doubtless was intended to light an otherwise dark lumber room Likewise the architect s best efforts had failed to cause the pediment to stand in the centre of the building since the proprietor had had one of its four original columns removed Evidently durability had been considered throughout for the courtyard was enclosed by a strong and very high wooden fence and both the stables the coach house and the culinary premises were partially constructed of beams warranted to last for centuries Nay even the wooden huts of the peasantry were wonderful in the solidity of their construction and not a clay wall or a carved pattern or other device was to be seen Everything fitted exactly into its right place and even the draw well of the mansion was fashioned of the oakwood usually thought suitable only for mills or ships In short wherever Chichikov s eye turned he saw nothing that was not free from shoddy make and well and skilfully arranged As he approached the entrance steps he caught sight of two faces peering from a window One of them was that of a woman in a mobcap with features as long and as narrow as a cucumber and the other that of a man with features as broad and as short as the Moldavian pumpkins known as gorlianki whereof balallaiki the species of light two stringed instrument which constitutes the pride and the joy of the gay young fellow of twenty as he sits winking and smiling at the white necked white bosomed maidens who have gathered to listen to his low pitched tinkling are fashioned This scrutiny made both faces withdrew and there came out on to the entrance steps a lacquey clad in a grey jacket and a stiff blue collar This functionary conducted Chichikov into the hall where he was met by the master of the house himself who requested his guest to enter and then led him into the inner part of the mansion A covert glance at Sobakevitch showed our hero that his host exactly resembled a moderate sized bear To complete the resemblance Sobakevitch s long frockcoat and baggy trousers were of the precise colour of a bear s hide while when shuffling across the floor he made a criss cross motion of the legs and had in addition a constant habit of treading upon his companion s toes As for his face it was of the warm ardent tint of a piatok twenty three Persons of this kind persons to whose designing nature has devoted not much thought and in the fashioning of whose frames she has used no instruments so delicate as a file or a gimlet and so forth are not uncommon Such persons she merely roughhews One cut with a hatchet and there results a nose another such cut with a hatchet and there materialises a pair of lips two thrusts with a drill and there issues a pair of eyes Lastly scorning to plane down the roughness she sends out that person into the world saying There is another live creature Sobakevitch was just such a ragged curiously put together figure though the above model would seem to have been followed more in his upper portion than in his lower One result was that he seldom turned his head to look at the person with whom he was speaking but rather directed his eyes towards say the stove corner or the doorway As host and guest crossed the dining room Chichikov directed a second glance at his companion He is a bear and nothing but a bear he thought to himself And indeed the strange comparison was inevitable Incidentally Sobakevitch s Christian name and patronymic were Michael Semenovitch Of his habit of treading upon other people s toes Chichikov had become fully aware wherefore he stepped cautiously and throughout allowed his host to take the lead As a matter of fact Sobakevitch himself seemed conscious of his failing for at intervals he would inquire I hope I have not hurt you and Chichikov with a word of thanks would reply that as yet he had sustained no injury At length they reached the drawing room where Sobakevitch pointed to an armchair and invited his guest to be seated Chichikov gazed with interest at the walls and the pictures In every such picture there were portrayed either young men or Greek generals of the type of Movrogordato clad in a red uniform and breaches Kanaris and others and all these heroes were depicted with a solidity of thigh and a wealth of moustache which made the beholder simply shudder with awe Among them there were placed also according to some unknown system and for some unknown reason firstly Bagration twenty four tall and thin and with a cluster of small flags and cannon beneath him and the whole set in the narrowest of frames and secondly the Greek heroine Bobelina whose legs looked larger than do the whole bodies of the drawing room dandies of the present day Apparently the master of the house was himself a man of health and strength and therefore liked to have his apartments adorned with none but folk of equal vigour and robustness Lastly in the window and suspected cheek by jowl with Bobelina there hung a cage whence at intervals there peered forth a white spotted blackbird Like everything else in the apartment it bore a strong resemblance to Sobakevitch When host and guest had been conversing for two minutes or so the door opened and there entered the hostess a tall lady in a cap adorned with ribands of domestic colouring and manufacture She entered deliberately and held her head as erect as a palm This is my wife Theodulia Ivanovna said Sobakevitch Chichikov approached and took her hand The fact that she raised it nearly to the level of his lips apprised him of the circumstance that it had just been rinsed in cucumber oil My dear allow me to introduce Paul Ivanovitch Chichikov added Sobakevitch He has the honour of being acquainted both with our Governor and with our Postmaster Upon this Theodulia Ivanovna requested her guest to be seated and accompanied the invitation with the kind of bow usually employed only by actresses who are playing the role of queens Next she took a seat upon the sofa drew around her her merino gown and sat thereafter without moving an eyelid or an eyebrow As for Chichikov he glanced upwards and once more caught sight of Kanaris with his fat thighs and interminable moustache and of Bobelina and the blackbird For fully five minutes all present preserved a complete silence the only sound audible being that of the blackbird s beak against the wooden floor of the cage as the creature fished for grains of corn Meanwhile Chichikov again surveyed the room and saw that everything in it was massive and clumsy in the highest degree as also that everything was curiously in keeping with the master of the house For example in one corner of the apartment there stood a hazelwood bureau with a bulging body on four grotesque legs the perfect image of a bear Also the tables and the chairs were of the same ponderous unrestful order and every single article in the room appeared to be saying either I too am a Sobakevitch or I am exactly like Sobakevitch I heard speak of you one day when I was visiting the President of the Council said Chichikov on perceiving that no one else had a mind to begin a conversation That was on Thursday last We had a very pleasant evening Yes on that occasion I was not there replied Sobakevitch What a nice man he is Who is inquired Sobakevitch gazing into the corner by the stove The President of the Local Council Did he seem so to you True he is a mason but he is also the greatest fool that the world ever saw Chichikov started a little at this mordant criticism but soon pulled himself together again and continued Of course every man has his weakness Yet the President seems to be an excellent fellow And do you think the same of the Governor Yes Why not Because there exists no greater rogue than he What The Governor a rogue ejaculated Chichikov at a loss to understand how the official in question could come to be numbered with thieves Let me say that I should never have guessed it Permit me also to remark that his conduct would hardly seem to bear out your opinion he seems so gentle a man And in proof of this Chichikov cited the purses which the Governor knitted and also expatiated on the mildness of his features He has the face of a robber said Sobakevitch Were you to give him a knife and to turn him loose on a turnpike he would cut your throat for two kopecks And the same with the Vice Governor The pair are just Gog and Magog Evidently he is not on good terms with them thought Chichikov to himself I had better pass to the Chief of Police which whom he DOES seem to be friendly Accordingly he added aloud For my own part I should give the preference to the Head of the Gendarmery What a frank outspoken nature he has And what an element of simplicity does his expression contain He is mean to the core remarked Sobakevitch coldly He will sell you and cheat you and then dine at your table Yes I know them all and every one of them is a swindler and the town a nest of rascals engaged in robbing one another Not a man of the lot is there but would sell Christ Yet stay ONE decent fellow there is the Public Prosecutor though even HE if the truth be told is little better than a pig After these eulogia Chichikov saw that it would be useless to continue running through the list of officials more especially since suddenly he had remembered that Sobakevitch was not at any time given to commending his fellow man Let us go to luncheon my dear put in Theodulia Ivanovna to her spouse Yes pray come to table said Sobakevitch to his guest whereupon they consumed the customary glass of vodka accompanied by sundry snacks of salted cucumber and other dainties with which Russians both in town and country preface a meal Then they filed into the dining room in the wake of the hostess who sailed on ahead like a goose swimming across a pond The small dining table was found to be laid for four persons the fourth place being occupied by a lady or a young girl it would have been difficult to say which exactly who might have been either a relative the housekeeper or a casual visitor Certain persons in the world exist not as personalities in themselves but as spots or specks on the personalities of others Always they are to be seen sitting in the same place and holding their heads at exactly the same angle so that one comes within an ace of mistaking them for furniture and thinks to oneself that never since the day of their birth can they have spoken a single word My dear said Sobakevitch the cabbage soup is excellent With that he finished his portion and helped himself to a generous measure of niania twenty five the dish which follows shtchi and consists of a sheep s stomach stuffed with black porridge brains and other things What niania this is he added to Chichikov Never would you get such stuff in a town where one is given the devil knows what Nevertheless the Governor keeps a fair table said Chichikov Yes but do you know what all the stuff is MADE OF retorted Sobakevitch If you DID know you would never touch it Of course I am not in a position to say how it is prepared but at least the pork cutlets and the boiled fish seemed excellent Ah it might have been thought so yet I know the way in which such things are bought in the market place They are bought by some rascal of a cook whom a Frenchman has taught how to skin a tomcat and then serve it up as hare Ugh What horrible things you say put in Madame Well my dear that is how things are done and it is no fault of mine that it is so Moreover everything that is left over everything that WE pardon me for mentioning it cast into the slop pail is used by such folk for making soup Always at table you begin talking like this objected his helpmeet And why not said Sobakevitch I tell you straight that I would not eat such nastiness even had I made it myself Sugar a frog as much as you like but never shall it pass MY lips Nor would I swallow an oyster for I know only too well what an oyster may resemble But have some mutton friend Chichikov It is shoulder of mutton and very different stuff from the mutton which they cook in noble kitchens mutton which has been kicking about the market place four days or more All that sort of cookery has been invented by French and German doctors and I should like to hang them for having done so They go and prescribe diets and a hunger cure as though what suits their flaccid German systems will agree with a Russian stomach Such devices are no good at all Sobakevitch shook his head wrathfully Fellows like those are for ever talking of civilisation As if THAT sort of thing was civilisation Phew Perhaps the speaker s concluding exclamation would have been even stronger had he not been seated at table For myself I will have none of it When I eat pork at a meal give me the WHOLE pig when mutton the WHOLE sheep when goose the WHOLE of the bird Two dishes are better than a thousand provided that one can eat of them as much as one wants And he proceeded to put precept into practice by taking half the shoulder of mutton on to his plate and then devouring it down to the last morsel of gristle and bone My word reflected Chichikov The fellow has a pretty good holding capacity None of it for me repeated Sobakevitch as he wiped his hands on his napkin I don t intend to be like a fellow named Plushkin who owns eight hundred souls yet dines worse than does my shepherd Who is Plushkin asked Chichikov A miser replied Sobakevitch Such a miser as never you could imagine Even convicts in prison live better than he does And he starves his servants as well Really ejaculated Chichikov greatly interested Should you then say that he has lost many peasants by death Certainly They keep dying like flies Then how far from here does he reside About five versts Only five versts exclaimed Chichikov feeling his heart beating joyously Ought one when leaving your gates to turn to the right or to the left I should be sorry to tell you the way to the house of such a cur said Sobakevitch A man had far better go to hell than to Plushkin s Quite so responded Chichikov My only reason for asking you is that it interests me to become acquainted with any and every sort of locality To the shoulder of mutton there succeeded in turn cutlets each one larger than a plate a turkey of about the size of a calf eggs rice pastry and every conceivable thing which could possibly be put into a stomach There the meal ended When he rose from table Chichikov felt as though a pood s weight were inside him In the drawing room the company found dessert awaiting them in the shape of pears plums and apples but since neither host nor guest could tackle these particular dainties the hostess removed them to another room Taking advantage of her absence Chichikov turned to Sobakevitch who prone in an armchair seemed after his ponderous meal to be capable of doing little beyond belching and grunting each such grunt or belch necessitating a subsequent signing of the cross over the mouth and intimated to him a desire to have a little private conversation concerning a certain matter At this moment the hostess returned Here is more dessert she said Pray have a few radishes stewed in honey Later later replied Sobakevitch Do you go to your room and Paul Ivanovitch and I will take off our coats and have a nap Upon this the good lady expressed her readiness to send for feather beds and cushions but her husband expressed a preference for slumbering in an armchair and she therefore departed When she had gone Sobakevitch inclined his head in an attitude of willingness to listen to Chichikov s business Our hero began in a sort of detached manner touching lightly upon the subject of the Russian Empire and expatiating upon the immensity of the same and saying that even the Empire of Ancient Rome had been of considerably smaller dimensions Meanwhile Sobakevitch sat with his head drooping From that Chichikov went on to remark that according to the statutes of the said Russian Empire which yielded to none in glory so much so that foreigners marvelled at it peasants on the census lists who had ended their earthly careers were nevertheless on the rendering of new lists returned equally with the living to the end that the courts might be relieved of a multitude of trifling useless emendations which might complicate the already sufficiently complex mechanism of the State Nevertheless said Chichikov the general equity of this measure did not obviate a certain amount of annoyance to landowners since it forced them to pay upon a non living article the tax due upon a living Hence our hero concluded he Chichikov was prepared owing to the personal respect which he felt for Sobakevitch to relieve him in part of the irksome obligation referred to in passing it may be said that Chichikov referred to his principal point only guardedly for he called the souls which he was seeking not dead but non existent Meanwhile Sobakevitch listened with bent head though something like a trace of expression dawned in his face as he did so Ordinarily his body lacked a soul or if he did posses a soul he seemed to keep it elsewhere than where it ought to have been so that buried beneath mountains as it were or enclosed within a massive shell its movements produced no sort of agitation on the surface Well said Chichikov though not without a certain tremor of diffidence as to the possible response You are after dead souls were Sobakevitch s perfectly simple words He spoke without the least surprise in his tone and much as though the conversation had been turning on grain Yes replied Chichikov and then as before softened down the expression dead souls They are to be found said Sobakevitch Why should they not be Then of course you will be glad to get rid of any that you may chance to have Yes I shall have no objection to SELLING them At this point the speaker raised his head a little for it had struck him that surely the would be buyer must have some advantage in view The devil thought Chichikov to himself Here is he selling the goods before I have even had time to utter a word And what about the price he added aloud Of course the articles are not of a kind very easy to appraise I should be sorry to ask too much said Sobakevitch How would a hundred roubles per head suit you What a hundred roubles per head Chichikov stared open mouthed at his host doubting whether he had heard aright or whether his host s slow moving tongue might not have inadvertently substituted one word for another Yes Is that too much for you said Sobakevitch Then he added What is your own price My own price I think that we cannot properly have understood one another that you must have forgotten of what the goods consist With my hand on my heart do I submit that eight grivni per soul would be a handsome a VERY handsome offer What Eight grivni In my opinion a higher offer would be impossible But I am not a seller of boots No yet you for your part will agree that these souls are not live human beings I suppose you hope to find fools ready to sell you souls on the census list for a couple of groats apiece Pardon me but why do you use the term on the census list The souls themselves have long since passed away and have left behind them only their names Not to trouble you with any further discussion of the subject I can offer you a rouble and a half per head but no more You should be ashamed even to mention such a sum Since you deal in articles of this kind quote me a genuine price I cannot Michael Semenovitch Believe me I cannot What a man cannot do that he cannot do The speaker ended by advancing another half rouble per head But why hang back with your money said Sobakevitch Of a truth I am not asking much of you Any other rascal than myself would have cheated you by selling you old rubbish instead of good genuine souls whereas I should be ready to give you of my best even were you buying only nut kernels For instance look at wheelwright Michiev Never was there such a one to build spring carts And his handiwork was not like your Moscow handiwork good only for an hour No he did it all himself even down to the varnishing Chichikov opened his mouth to remark that nevertheless the said Michiev had long since departed this world but Sobakevitch s eloquence had got too thoroughly into its stride to admit of any interruption And look too at Probka Stepan the carpenter his host went on I will wager my head that nowhere else would you find such a workman What a strong fellow he was He had served in the Guards and the Lord only knows what they had given for him seeing that he was over three arshins in height Again Chichikov tried to remark that Probka was dead but Sobakevitch s tongue was borne on the torrent of its own verbiage and the only thing to be done was to listen And Milushkin the bricklayer He could build a stove in any house you liked And Maksim Teliatnikov the bootmaker Anything that he drove his awl into became a pair of boots and boots for which you would be thankful although he WAS a bit foul of the mouth And Eremi Sorokoplechin too He was the best of the lot and used to work at his trade in Moscow where he paid a tax of five hundred roubles Well THERE S an assortment of serfs for you a very different assortment from what Plushkin would sell you But permit me at length put in Chichikov astounded at this flood of eloquence to which there appeared to be no end Permit me I say to inquire why you enumerate the talents of the deceased seeing that they are all of them dead and that therefore there can be no sense in doing so A dead body is only good to prop a fence with says the proverb Of course they are dead replied Sobakevitch but rather as though the idea had only just occurred to him and was giving him food for thought But tell me now what is the use of listing them as still alive And what is the use of them themselves They are flies not human beings Well said Chichikov they exist though only in idea But no NOT only in idea I tell you that nowhere else would you find such a fellow for working heavy tools as was Michiev He had the strength of a horse in his shoulders And with the words Sobakevitch turned as though for corroboration to the portrait of Bagration as is frequently done by one of the parties in a dispute when he purports to appeal to an extraneous individual who is not only unknown to him but wholly unconnected with the subject in hand with the result that the individual is left in doubt whether to make a reply or whether to betake himself elsewhere Nevertheless I CANNOT give you more than two roubles per head said Chichikov Well as I don t want you to swear that I have asked too much of you and won t meet you halfway suppose for friendship s sake that you pay me seventy five roubles in assignats Good heavens thought Chichikov to himself Does the man take me for a fool Then he added aloud The situation seems to me a strange one for it is as though we were performing a stage comedy No other explanation would meet the case Yet you appear to be a man of sense and possessed of some education The matter is a very simple one The question is what is a dead soul worth and is it of any use to any one It is of use to YOU or you would not be buying such articles Chichikov bit his lip and stood at a loss for a retort He tried to saying something about family and domestic circumstances but Sobakevitch cut him short with I don t want to know your private affairs for I never poke my nose into such things You need the souls and I am ready to sell them Should you not buy them I think you will repent it Two roubles is my price repeated Chichikov Come come As you have named that sum I can understand your not liking to go back upon it but quote me a bona fide figure The devil fly away with him mused Chichikov However I will add another half rouble And he did so Indeed said Sobakevitch Well my last word upon it is fifty roubles in assignats That will mean a sheer loss to me for nowhere else in the world could you buy better souls than mine The old skinflint muttered Chichikov Then he added aloud with irritation in his tone See here This is a serious matter Any one but you would be thankful to get rid of the souls Only a fool would stick to them and continue to pay the tax Yes but remember and I say it wholly in a friendly way that transactions of this kind are not generally allowed and that any one would say that a man who engages in them must have some rather doubtful advantage in view Have it your own away said Chichikov with assumed indifference As a matter of fact I am not purchasing for profit as you suppose but to humour a certain whim of mine Two and a half roubles is the most that I can offer Bless your heart retorted the host At least give me thirty roubles in assignats and take the lot No for I see that you are unwilling to sell I must say good day to you Hold on hold on exclaimed Sobakevitch retaining his guest s hand and at the same moment treading heavily upon his toes so heavily indeed that Chichikov gasped and danced with the pain I BEG your pardon said Sobakevitch hastily Evidently I have hurt you Pray sit down again No retorted Chichikov I am merely wasting my time and must be off Oh sit down just for a moment I have something more agreeable to say And drawing closer to his guest Sobakevitch whispered in his ear as though communicating to him a secret How about twenty five roubles No no no exclaimed Chichikov I won t give you even a QUARTER of that I won t advance another kopeck For a while Sobakevitch remained silent and Chichikov did the same This lasted for a couple of minutes and meanwhile the aquiline nosed Bagration gazed from the wall as though much interested in the bargaining What is your outside price at length said Sobakevitch Two and a half roubles Then you seem to rate a human soul at about the same value as a boiled turnip At least give me THREE roubles No I cannot Pardon me but you are an impossible man to deal with However even though it will mean a dead loss to me and you have not shown a very nice spirit about it I cannot well refuse to please a friend I suppose a purchase deed had better be made out in order to have everything in order Of course Then for that purpose let us repair to the town The affair ended in their deciding to do this on the morrow and to arrange for the signing of a deed of purchase Next Chichikov requested a list of the peasants to which Sobakevitch readily agreed Indeed he went to his writing desk then and there and started to indite a list which gave not only the peasants names but also their late qualifications Meanwhile Chichikov having nothing else to do stood looking at the spacious form of his host and as he gazed at his back as broad as that of a cart horse and at the legs as massive as the iron standards which adorn a street he could not help inwardly ejaculating Truly God has endowed you with much Though not adjusted with nicety at least you are strongly built I wonder whether you were born a bear or whether you have come to it through your rustic life with its tilling of crops and its trading with peasants Yet no I believe that even if you had received a fashionable education and had mixed with society and had lived in saint Petersburg you would still have been just the kulak twenty six that you are The only difference is that circumstances as they stand permit of your polishing off a stuffed shoulder of mutton at a meal whereas in saint Petersburg you would have been unable to do so Also as circumstances stand you have under you a number of peasants whom you treat well for the reason that they are your property whereas otherwise you would have had under you tchinovniks twenty seven whom you would have bullied because they were NOT your property Also you would have robbed the Treasury since a kulak always remains a money grubber The list is ready said Sobakevitch turning round Indeed Then please let me look at it Chichikov ran his eye over the document and could not but marvel at its neatness and accuracy Not only were there set forth in it the trade the age and the pedigree of every serf but on the margin of the sheet were jotted remarks concerning each serf s conduct and sobriety Truly it was a pleasure to look at it And do you mind handing me the earnest money said Sobakevitch Yes I do Why need that be done You can receive the money in a lump sum as soon as we visit the town But it is always the custom you know asserted Sobakevitch Then I cannot follow it for I have no money with me However here are ten roubles Ten roubles indeed You might as well hand me fifty while you are about it Once more Chichikov started to deny that he had any money upon him but Sobakevitch insisted so strongly that this was not so that at length the guest pulled out another fifteen roubles and added them to the ten already produced Kindly give me a receipt for the money he added A receipt Why should I give you a receipt Because it is better to do so in order to guard against mistakes Very well but first hand me over the money The money I have it here Do you write out the receipt and then the money shall be yours Pardon me but how am I to write out the receipt before I have seen the cash Chichikov placed the notes in Sobakevitch s hand whereupon the host moved nearer to the table and added to the list of serfs a note that he had received for the peasants therewith sold the sum of twenty five roubles as earnest money This done he counted the notes once more This is a very OLD note he remarked holding one up to the light Also it is a trifle torn However in a friendly transaction one must not be too particular What a kulak thought Chichikov to himself And what a brute beast Then you do not want any WOMEN souls queried Sobakevitch I thank you no I could let you have some cheap say as between friends at a rouble a head No I should have no use for them Then that being so there is no more to be said There is no accounting for tastes One man loves the priest and another the priest s wife says the proverb Chichikov rose to take his leave Once more I would request of you he said that the bargain be left as it is Of course of course What is done between friends holds good because of their mutual friendship Good bye and thank you for your visit In advance I would beg that whenever you should have an hour or two to spare you will come and lunch with us again Perhaps we might be able to do one another further service Not if I know it reflected Chichikov as he mounted his britchka Not I seeing that I have had two and a half roubles per soul squeezed out of me by a brute of a kulak Altogether he felt dissatisfied with Sobakevitch s behaviour In spite of the man being a friend of the Governor and the Chief of Police he had acted like an outsider in taking money for what was worthless rubbish As the britchka left the courtyard Chichikov glanced back and saw Sobakevitch still standing on the verandah apparently for the purpose of watching to see which way the guest s carriage would turn The old villain to be still standing there muttered Chichikov through his teeth after which he ordered Selifan to proceed so that the vehicle s progress should be invisible from the mansion the truth being that he had a mind next to visit Plushkin whose serfs to quote Sobakevitch had a habit of dying like flies but not to let his late host learn of his intention Accordingly on reaching the further end of the village he hailed the first peasant whom he saw a man who was in the act of hoisting a ponderous beam on to his shoulder before setting off with it ant like to his hut Hi shouted Chichikov How can I reach landowner Plushkin s place without first going past the mansion here The peasant seemed nonplussed by the question Don t you know queried Chichikov No barin replied the peasant What You don t know skinflint Plushkin who feeds his people so badly Of course I do exclaimed the fellow and added thereto an uncomplimentary expression of a species not ordinarily employed in polite society We may guess that it was a pretty apt expression since long after the man had become lost to view Chichikov was still laughing in his britchka And indeed the language of the Russian populace is always forcible in its phraseology CHAPTER VI Chichikov s amusement at the peasant s outburst prevented him from noticing that he had reached the centre of a large and populous village 
4225-144132-0000	train-other-500	but presently a violent jolt aroused him to the fact that he was driving over wooden pavements of a kind compared with which the cobblestones of the town had been as nothing Like the keys of a piano the planks kept rising and falling
4225-144132-0001	train-other-500	and unguarded passage over them entailed either a bump on the back of the neck or a bruise on the forehead or a bite on the tip of one s tongue At the same time Chichikov noticed a look of decay about the buildings of the village The beams of the huts had grown dark with age
4225-144132-0002	train-other-500	many of their roofs were riddled with holes others had but a tile of the roof remaining and yet others were reduced to the rib like framework of the same It would seem as though the inhabitants themselves had removed the laths and traverses on the very natural plea
4225-144132-0003	train-other-500	that the huts were no protection against the rain and therefore since the latter entered in bucketfuls
none	none	 there was no particular object to be gained by sitting in such huts 
4225-144132-0004	train-other-500	when all the time there was the tavern and the highroad and other places to resort to Suddenly a woman appeared from an outbuilding apparently the housekeeper of the mansion but so roughly and dirtily dressed as almost to seem indistinguishable from a man
4225-144132-0005	train-other-500	Chichikov inquired for the master of the place
none	none	 He is not at home 
4225-144132-0006	train-other-500	she replied almost before her interlocutor had had time to finish Then she added
none	none	 What do you want with him I have some business to do 
4225-144132-0007	train-other-500	said Chichikov Then pray walk into the house the woman advised Then she turned upon him a back that was smeared with flour and had a long slit in the lower portion of its covering
none	none	 Entering a large dark hall which reeked like a tomb 
4225-144132-0008	train-other-500	he passed into an equally dark parlour that was lighted only by such rays as contrived to filter through a crack under the door When Chichikov opened the door in question the spectacle of the untidiness within struck him almost with amazement
4225-144132-0009	train-other-500	It would seem that the floor was never washed and that the room was used as a receptacle for every conceivable kind of furniture On a table stood a ragged chair with beside it a clock minus a pendulum and covered all over with cobwebs
4225-144132-0010	train-other-500	Against a wall leant a cupboard full of old silver glassware and china On a writing table inlaid with mother of pearl which in places had broken away and left behind it a number of yellow grooves stuffed with putty
4225-144132-0011	train-other-500	lay a pile of finely written manuscript an overturned marble press turning green an ancient book in a leather cover with red edges a lemon dried and shrunken to the dimensions of a hazelnut the broken arm of a chair
4225-144132-0012	train-other-500	a tumbler containing the dregs of some liquid and three flies the whole covered over with a sheet of notepaper a pile of rags
none	none	 two ink encrusted pens 
4225-144132-0013	train-other-500	and a yellow toothpick with which the master of the house had picked his teeth apparently at least before the coming of the French to Moscow As for the walls they were hung with a medley of pictures
4225-144132-0014	train-other-500	Among the latter was a long engraving of a battle scene wherein soldiers in three cornered hats were brandishing huge drums and slender lances It lacked a glass and was set in a frame ornamented with bronze fretwork and bronze corner rings
none	none	 Beside it hung a huge grimy oil painting 
4225-144132-0015	train-other-500	representative of some flowers and fruit half a water melon a boar s head and the pendent form of a dead wild duck Attached to the ceiling there was a chandelier in a holland covering
none	none	 the covering so dusty as closely to resemble a huge cocoon 
4225-144132-0016	train-other-500	enclosing a caterpillar Lastly in one corner of the room lay a pile of articles which had evidently been adjudged unworthy of a place on the table Yet what the pile consisted of it would have been difficult to say
4225-144132-0017	train-other-500	seeing that the dust on the same was so thick that any hand which touched it would have at once resembled a glove Prominently protruding from the pile was the shaft of a wooden spade and the antiquated sole of a shoe Never would one have supposed that a living creature had tenanted the room
none	none	 were it not that the presence of such a creature 
4225-144132-0018	train-other-500	was betrayed by the spectacle of an old nightcap resting on the table Whilst Chichikov was gazing at this extraordinary mess a side door opened and there entered the housekeeper who had met him near the outbuildings
4225-144132-0019	train-other-500	But now Chichikov perceived this person to be a man rather than a woman since a female housekeeper would have had no beard to shave whereas the chin of the newcomer with the lower portion of his cheeks strongly resembled the curry comb which is used for grooming horses
4225-144132-0020	train-other-500	Chichikov assumed a questioning air and waited to hear what the housekeeper might have to say The housekeeper did the same At length surprised at the misunderstanding Chichikov decided to ask the first question Is the master at home
4225-144132-0021	train-other-500	he inquired Yes replied the person addressed Then were is he
none	none	 continued Chichikov Are you blind my good sir 
4225-144132-0022	train-other-500	retorted the other I am the master
none	none	 Involuntarily our hero started and stared 
4225-144132-0023	train-other-500	During his travels it had befallen him to meet various types of men some of them it may be types which you and I have never encountered but even to Chichikov this particular species was new In the old man s face there was nothing very special
4225-144132-0024	train-other-500	it was much like the wizened face of many another dotard save that the chin was so greatly projected that whenever he spoke he was forced to wipe it with a handkerchief to avoid dribbling and that his small eyes were not yet grown dull
4225-144132-0025	train-other-500	but twinkled under their overhanging brows like the eyes of mice when with attentive ears and sensitive whiskers they snuff the air and peer forth from their holes to see whether a cat or a boy may not be in the vicinity
4225-144132-0026	train-other-500	No the most noticeable feature about the man was his clothes In no way could it have been guessed of what his coat was made for both its sleeves and its skirts were so ragged and filthy
none	none	 as to defy description 
4225-144132-0027	train-other-500	while instead of two posterior tails there dangled four of those appendages with projecting from them a torn newspaper Also around his neck there was wrapped something which might have been a stocking a garter or a stomacher
4225-144132-0028	train-other-500	but was certainly not a tie In short had Chichikov chanced to encounter him at a church door he would have bestowed upon him a copper or two for to do our hero justice he had a sympathetic heart
none	none	 and never refrained from presenting a beggar with alms 
4225-144132-0029	train-other-500	but in the present case there was standing before him not a mendicant but a landowner and a landowner possessed of fully a thousand serfs the superior of all his neighbours in wealth of flour and grain
4225-144132-0030	train-other-500	and the owner of storehouses and so forth that were crammed with homespun cloth and linen tanned and undressed sheepskins dried fish and every conceivable species of produce Nevertheless such a phenomenon is rare in Russia
4225-144132-0031	train-other-500	where the tendency is rather to prodigality than to parsimony For several minutes Plushkin stood mute
none	none	 while Chichikov remained so dazed with the appearance of the host 
4225-144132-0032	train-other-500	and everything else in the room that he too could not begin a conversation but stood wondering how best to find words in which to explain the object of his visit For a while he thought of expressing himself to the effect that
4225-144132-0033	train-other-500	having heard so much of his host s benevolence and other rare qualities of spirit he had considered it his duty to come and pay a tribute of respect but presently even HE came to the conclusion that this would be overdoing the thing
4225-144132-0034	train-other-500	and after another glance round the room decided that the phrase benevolence and other rare qualities of spirit
none	none	 might to advantage give place to economy and genius for method 
4225-144132-0035	train-other-500	Accordingly the speech mentally composed he said aloud that having heard of Plushkin s talents for thrifty and systematic management he had considered himself bound to make the acquaintance of his host and to present him with his personal compliments
4225-144132-0036	train-other-500	I need hardly say that Chichikov could easily have alleged a better reason
none	none	 had any better one happened at the moment to have come into his head 
4225-144132-0037	train-other-500	With toothless gums Plushkin murmured something in reply but nothing is known as to its precise terms beyond that it included a statement that the devil was at liberty to fly away with Chichikov s sentiments
4225-144132-0038	train-other-500	However the laws of Russian hospitality do not permit even of a miser infringing their rules wherefore Plushkin added to the foregoing
none	none	 a more civil invitation to be seated It is long since I last received a visitor 
4225-144132-0039	train-other-500	he went on Also I feel bound to say that I can see little good in their coming Once introduce the abominable custom of folk paying calls and forthwith there will ensue such ruin to the management of estates
4225-144132-0040	train-other-500	that landowners will be forced to feed their horses on hay Not for a long long time have I eaten a meal away from home although my own kitchen is a poor one and has its chimney in such a state that were it to become overheated it would instantly catch fire
4225-144132-0041	train-other-500	What a brute thought Chichikov I am lucky to have got through so much pastry and stuffed shoulder of mutton at Sobakevitch s Also went on Plushkin I am ashamed to say that hardly a wisp of fodder does the place contain
4225-144132-0042	train-other-500	But how can I get fodder My lands are small
none	none	 and the peasantry lazy fellows who hate work and think of nothing but the tavern 
4225-144132-0043	train-other-500	In the end therefore I shall be forced to go and spend my old age in roaming about the world
none	none	 But I have been told that you possess over a thousand serfs 
4225-144132-0044	train-other-500	said Chichikov Who told you that No matter who it was you would have been justified in giving him the lie He must have been a jester who wanted to make a fool of you A thousand souls indeed Why just reckon the taxes on them
none	none	 and see what there would be left For these three years that accursed fever has been killing off my serfs wholesale 
4225-144132-0045	train-other-500	Wholesale you say echoed Chichikov greatly interested Yes wholesale replied the old man Then might I ask you the exact number
none	none	 Fully eighty Surely not But it is so Then might I also ask whether it is from the date of the last census revision that you are reckoning these souls 
4225-144132-0046	train-other-500	Yes damn it And since that date I have been bled for taxes upon a hundred and twenty souls in all
none	none	 Indeed 
4225-144132-0047	train-other-500	Upon a hundred and twenty souls in all And Chichikov s surprise and elation were such that this said he remained sitting open mouthed Yes good sir replied Plushkin I am too old to tell you lies
none	none	 for I have passed my seventieth year 
4225-144132-0048	train-other-500	Somehow he seemed to have taken offence at Chichikov s almost joyous exclamation wherefore the guest hastened to heave a profound sigh and to observe that he sympathised to the full with his host s misfortunes
4225-144132-0049	train-other-500	But sympathy does not put anything into one s pocket retorted Plushkin For instance I have a kinsman who is constantly plaguing me He is a captain in the army damn him
none	none	 and all day he does nothing but call me dear uncle and kiss my hand and express sympathy until I am forced to stop my ears You see he has squandered all his money upon his brother officers as well as made a fool of himself with an actress so now he spends his time 
4225-144132-0050	train-other-500	in telling me that he has a sympathetic heart Chichikov hastened to explain that HIS sympathy had nothing in common with the captain s since he dealt not in empty words alone but in actual deeds
none	none	 in proof of which he was ready then and there 
4225-144132-0051	train-other-500	for the purpose of cutting the matter short and of dispensing with circumlocution to transfer to himself the obligation of paying the taxes
none	none	 due upon such serfs as Plushkin s as had in the unfortunate manner 
4225-144132-0052	train-other-500	just described departed this world The proposal seemed to astonish Plushkin for he sat staring open eyed At length he inquired My dear sir have you seen military service No
4225-144132-0053	train-other-500	replied the other warily but I have been a member of the CIVIL Service Oh Of the CIVIL Service And Plushkin sat moving his lips as though he were chewing something
none	none	 Well what of your proposal he added presently 
4225-144132-0054	train-other-500	Are you prepared to lose by it Yes certainly if thereby I can please you My dear sir My good benefactor In his delight Plushkin lost sight of the fact that his nose was caked with snuff of the consistency of thick coffee
4225-144132-0055	train-other-500	and that his coat had parted in front and was disclosing some very unseemly underclothing What comfort you have brought to an old man Yes as God is my witness For the moment he could say no more
none	none	 Yet barely a minute had elapsed before this 
4225-144132-0056	train-other-500	instantaneously aroused emotion had as instantaneously disappeared from his wooden features Once more they assumed a careworn expression and he even wiped his face with his handkerchief then rolled it into a ball
4225-144132-0057	train-other-500	and rubbed it to and fro against his upper lip
none	none	 If it will not annoy you again to state the proposal he went on what you undertake to do 
4225-144132-0058	train-other-500	is to pay the annual tax upon these souls and to remit the money either to me or to the Treasury Yes that is how it shall be done We will draw up a deed of purchase as though the souls were still alive and you had sold them to myself
4225-144132-0059	train-other-500	Quite so a deed of purchase echoed Plushkin once more relapsing into thought and the chewing motion of the lips
none	none	 But a deed of such a kind will entail certain expenses 
4225-144132-0060	train-other-500	and lawyers are so devoid of conscience In fact so extortionate is their avarice that they will charge one half a rouble and then a sack of flour and then a whole waggon load of meal I wonder that no one has yet called attention to the system
4225-144132-0061	train-other-500	Upon that Chichikov intimated that out of respect for his host he himself would bear the cost of the transfer of souls This led Plushkin to conclude that his guest must be the kind of unconscionable fool
none	none	 who while pretending to have been a member of the Civil Service 
4225-144132-0062	train-other-500	has in reality served in the army and run after actresses wherefore the old man no longer disguised his delight but called down blessings alike upon Chichikov s head and upon those of his children
4225-144132-0063	train-other-500	he had never even inquired whether Chichikov possessed a family Next he shuffled to the window and tapping one of its panes shouted the name of
none	none	 Proshka Immediately some one ran quickly into the hall 
4225-144132-0064	train-other-500	and after much stamping of feet burst into the room This was Proshka a thirteen year old youngster who was shod with boots of such dimensions as almost to engulf his legs as he walked The reason why he had entered thus shod
4225-144132-0065	train-other-500	was that Plushkin only kept one pair of boots for the whole of his domestic staff This universal pair was stationed in the hall of the mansion so that any servant who was summoned to the house
none	none	 might don the said boots after wading barefooted through the mud of the courtyard 
4225-144132-0066	train-other-500	and enter the parlour dry shod subsequently leaving the boots where he had found them and departing in his former barefooted condition Indeed had any one on a slushy winter s morning glanced from a window into the said courtyard
none	none	 he would have seen Plushkin s servitors performing saltatory feats worthy of the most vigorous of stage dancers Look at that boy s face said Plushkin to Chichikov as he pointed to Proshka It is stupid enough yet lay anything aside and in a trice he will have stolen it Well my lad what do you want He paused a moment or two but Proshka made no reply Come come went on the old man Set out the samovar and then give Mavra the key of the store room 
4225-144132-0067	train-other-500	here it is and tell her to get out some loaf sugar for tea
none	none	 Here Wait another moment fool Is the devil in your legs that they itch so to be off 
4225-144132-0068	train-other-500	Listen to what more I have to tell you Tell Mavra that the sugar on the outside of the loaf has gone bad so that she must scrape it off with a knife and NOT throw away the scrapings but give them to the poultry Also
none	none	 see that you yourself don t go into the storeroom 
4225-144132-0069	train-other-500	or I will give you a birching that you won t care for Your appetite is good enough already but a better one won t hurt you Don t even TRY to go into the storeroom for I shall be watching you from this window You see the old man added to Chichikov
4225-144132-0070	train-other-500	one can never trust these fellows Presently when Proshka and the boots had departed he fell to gazing at his guest with an equally distrustful air since certain features in Chichikov s benevolence now struck him
4225-144132-0071	train-other-500	as a little open to question and he had begin to think to himself After all the devil only knows who he is whether a braggart like most of these spendthrifts or a fellow who is lying merely in order to get some tea out of me
4225-144132-0072	train-other-500	Finally his circumspection combined with a desire to test his guest
none	none	 led him to remark that it might be well to complete the transaction IMMEDIATELY since he had not overmuch confidence in humanity 
4225-144132-0073	train-other-500	seeing that a man might be alive to day and dead to morrow To this Chichikov assented readily enough merely adding that he should like first of all to be furnished with a list of the dead souls
none	none	 This reassured Plushkin as to his guest s intention of doing business 
4225-144132-0074	train-other-500	so he got out his keys approached a cupboard and having pulled back the door rummaged among the cups and glasses with which it was filled At length he said
none	none	 I cannot find it now 
4225-144132-0075	train-other-500	but I used to possess a splendid bottle of liquor Probably the servants have drunk it all for they are such thieves
none	none	 Oh no perhaps this is it Looking up Chichikov saw that Plushkin had extracted a decanter coated with dust My late wife made the stuff went on the old man but that rascal of a housekeeper 
4225-144132-0076	train-other-500	went and threw away a lot of it and never even replaced the stopper Consequently bugs and other nasty creatures got into the decanter but I cleaned it out and now beg to offer you a glassful
4225-144132-0077	train-other-500	The idea of a drink from such a receptacle was too much for Chichikov so he excused himself
none	none	 on the ground that he had just had luncheon You have just had luncheon re echoed Plushkin Now THAT shows how invariably one can tell 
4225-144132-0078	train-other-500	a man of good society wheresoever one may be A man of that kind never eats anything
none	none	 he always says that he has had enough Very different that from the ways of a rogue 
4225-144132-0079	train-other-500	whom one can never satisfy however much one may give him For instance that captain of mine is constantly begging me to let him have a meal though he is about as much my nephew
none	none	 as I am his grandfather 
4225-144132-0080	train-other-500	As it happens there is never a bite of anything in the house so he has to go away empty But about the list of those good for nothing souls I happen to possess such a list
none	none	 since I have drawn one up in readiness for the next revision 
4225-144132-0081	train-other-500	With that Plushkin donned his spectacles and once more started to rummage in the cupboard and to smother his guest with dust as he untied successive packages of papers so much so that his victim burst out sneezing
4225-144132-0082	train-other-500	Finally he extracted a much scribbled document in which the names of the deceased peasants lay as close packed as a cloud of midges
none	none	 for there were a hundred and twenty of them in all 
4225-144132-0083	train-other-500	Chichikov grinned with joy at the sight of the multitude Stuffing the list into his pocket he remarked that to complete the transaction
none	none	 it would be necessary to return to the town To the town 
4225-144132-0084	train-other-500	repeated Plushkin But why Moreover
none	none	 how could I leave the house 
4225-144132-0085	train-other-500	seeing that every one of my servants is either a thief or a rogue Day by day they pilfer things until soon I shall have not a single coat to hang on my back Then you possess acquaintances in the town
none	none	 Acquaintances No Every acquaintance whom I 
4225-144132-0086	train-other-500	ever possessed has either left me or is dead But stop a moment
none	none	 I DO know the President of the Council 
4225-144132-0087	train-other-500	Even in my old age he has once or twice come to visit me for he and I used to be schoolfellows and to go climbing walls together Yes him I do know Shall I write him a letter By all means
4225-144132-0088	train-other-500	Yes him I know well for we were friends together at school Over Plushkin s wooden features there had gleamed a ray of warmth a ray which expressed if not feeling
4225-144132-0089	train-other-500	at all events feeling s pale reflection Just such a phenomenon may be witnessed when for a brief moment a drowning man makes a last re appearance on the surface of a river and there rises from the crowd lining
none	none	 the banks a cry of hope that even yet the exhausted hands 
4225-144132-0090	train-other-500	may clutch the rope which has been thrown him may clutch it before the surface of the unstable element shall have resumed for ever its calm dread vacuity But the hope is short lived and the hands disappear
4225-144132-0091	train-other-500	Even so did Plushkin s face after its momentary manifestation of feeling become meaner and more insensible than ever
none	none	 There used to be a sheet of clean writing paper 
4225-144132-0092	train-other-500	lying on the table he went on But where it is now I cannot think That comes of my servants being such rascals
none	none	 Whit that he fell to looking also under the table 
4225-144132-0093	train-other-500	as well as to hurrying about with cries of
none	none	 Mavra Mavra At length the call was answered by a woman with a plateful of the sugar of which mention has been made 
4225-144132-0094	train-other-500	whereupon there ensued the following conversation
none	none	 What have you done with my piece of writing paper you pilferer 
4225-144132-0095	train-other-500	I swear that I have seen no paper except the bit with which you covered the glass
none	none	 Your very face tells me that you have made off with it 
4225-144132-0096	train-other-500	Why should I make off with it Twould be of no use to me for I can neither read nor write You lie You have taken it away for the sexton to scribble upon
none	none	 Well if the sexton wanted paper he could get some for himself Neither he nor I have set eyes upon your piece Ah Wait a bit for on the Judgment Day you will be roasted by devils on iron spits Just see if you are not But why should I be roasted when I have never even TOUCHED the paper 
4225-144132-0097	train-other-500	You might accuse me of any other fault than theft
none	none	 Nay devils shall roast you sure enough They will say to you 
4225-144132-0098	train-other-500	Bad woman we are doing this because you robbed your master and then stoke up the fire still hotter Nevertheless I shall continue to say You are roasting me for nothing
none	none	 for I never stole anything at all Why THERE it is lying on the table 
4225-144132-0099	train-other-500	You have been accusing me for no reason whatever
none	none	 And sure enough the sheet of paper was lying before 
4225-144132-0100	train-other-500	Plushkin s very eyes For a moment or two he chewed silently
none	none	 Then he went on 
4225-144132-0101	train-other-500	Well and what are you making such a noise about
none	none	 If one says a single word to you 
4225-144132-0102	train-other-500	you answer back with ten Go and fetch me a candle to seal a letter with And mind you bring a TALLOW candle for it will not cost so much as the other sort And bring me a match too Mavra departed and Plushkin seating himself
4225-144132-0103	train-other-500	and taking up a pen sat turning the sheet of paper over and over as though in doubt whether to tear from it yet another morsel At length he came to the conclusion that it was impossible to do so and therefore dipping the pen
4225-144132-0104	train-other-500	into the mixture of mouldy fluid and dead flies which the ink bottle contained
none	none	 started to indite the letter in characters as bold as the notes of a music score 
4225-144132-0105	train-other-500	while momentarily checking the speed of his hand lest it should meander too much over the paper and crawling from line to line as though he regretted that there was so little vacant space left on the sheet
none	none	 And do you happen to know any one to whom a few runaway serfs would be of use 
4225-144132-0106	train-other-500	he asked as subsequently he folded the letter What You have some runaways as well exclaimed Chichikov again greatly interested Certainly I have My son in law has laid the necessary information against them
4225-144132-0107	train-other-500	but says that their tracks have grown cold However he is only a military man
none	none	 that is to say good at clinking a pair of spurs 
4225-144132-0108	train-other-500	but of no use for laying a plea before a court
none	none	 And how many runaways have you 
4225-144132-0109	train-other-500	About seventy Surely not Alas yes Never does a year pass without a certain number of them making off Yet so gluttonous and idle are my serfs that they are simply bursting with food
4225-144132-0110	train-other-500	whereas I scarcely get enough to eat I will take any price for them that you may care to offer Tell your friends about it and should they find
none	none	 even a score of the runaways it will repay them handsomely 
4225-144132-0111	train-other-500	seeing that a living serf on the census list
none	none	 is 
4225-144132-0112	train-other-500	at present worth five hundred roubles
none	none	 Perhaps so but I am not going to let any one but myself have a finger in this 
4225-144132-0113	train-other-500	thought Chichikov to himself after which he explained to Plushkin that a friend of the kind mentioned would be impossible to discover since the legal expenses of the enterprise would lead to the said friend having to cut the very tail from his coat before he would
4225-144132-0114	train-other-500	get clear of the lawyers Nevertheless added Chichikov seeing that you are so hard pressed for money
none	none	 and that I am so interested in the matter 
4225-144132-0115	train-other-500	I feel moved to advance you well to advance you such a trifle as would scarcely be worth mentioning But how much is it asked Plushkin eagerly and with his hands trembling like quicksilver Twenty five kopecks per soul
4225-144132-0116	train-other-500	What In ready money Yes in money down Nevertheless consider my poverty dear friend and make it FORTY kopecks per soul Venerable sir would that I could pay you not merely forty kopecks
4225-144132-0117	train-other-500	but five hundred roubles I should be only too delighted if that were possible since I perceive that you
none	none	 an aged and respected gentleman 
4225-144132-0118	train-other-500	are suffering for your own goodness of heart By God that is true that is true Plushkin hung his head and wagged it feebly from side to side Yes
4225-144132-0119	train-other-500	all that I have done I have done purely out of kindness See how instantaneously I have divined your nature By now it will have become clear to you why it is impossible for me to pay you five hundred roubles per runaway soul for by now
none	none	 you will have gathered 
4225-144132-0120	train-other-500	the fact that I am not sufficiently rich
none	none	 Nevertheless I am ready to add another five 
4225-144132-0121	train-other-500	kopecks and so to make it that each runaway serf shall cost me in all thirty kopecks
none	none	 As you please dear sir Yet stretch another point 
4225-144132-0122	train-other-500	and throw in another two kopecks Pardon me but I cannot
none	none	 How many runaway serfs did you say that you possess Seventy No seventy eight 
4225-144132-0123	train-other-500	Seventy eight souls at thirty kopecks each will amount to to only for a moment did our hero halt
none	none	 since he was strong in his arithmetic 
4225-144132-0124	train-other-500	will amount to twenty four roubles ninety six kopecks
none	none	 twenty eight With that he requested Plushkin to make out the receipt 
4225-144132-0125	train-other-500	and then handed him the money Plushkin took it in both hands bore it to a bureau with as much caution as
none	none	 though he were carrying a liquid which might at any moment splash him in the face 
4225-144132-0126	train-other-500	and arrived at the bureau and glancing round once more carefully packed the cash in one of his money bags where doubtless
none	none	 it was destined to lie buried until to the intense joy of his daughters and his son in law and perhaps of the captain who claimed kinship with him he should himself receive burial at the hands of Fathers Carp and Polycarp the two priests attached to his village 
4225-144132-0127	train-other-500	Lastly the money concealed
none	none	 Plushkin re seated himself in the armchair 
4225-144132-0128	train-other-500	and seemed at a loss for further material for conversation Are you thinking of starting at length he inquired on seeing Chichikov making a trifling movement though the movement was only to extract from his pocket a handkerchief
4225-144132-0129	train-other-500	Nevertheless the question reminded Chichikov that there was no further excuse for lingering Yes I must be going he said as he took his hat Then what about the tea Thank you I will have some on my next visit What
4225-144132-0130	train-other-500	Even though I have just ordered the samovar to be got ready Well well I myself do not greatly care for tea for I think it an expensive beverage Moreover the price of sugar has risen terribly
none	none	 Proshka he 
4225-144132-0131	train-other-500	then shouted The samovar will not be needed Return the sugar to Mavra and tell her to put it back again But no Bring the sugar here and I will put it back Good bye dear sir finally he added to Chichikov
4225-144132-0132	train-other-500	May the Lord bless you Hand that letter to the President of the Council and let him read it Yes he is an old friend of mine We knew one another as schoolfellows With that this strange phenomenon
4225-144132-0133	train-other-500	this withered old man escorted his guest to the gates of the courtyard and after the guest had departed ordered the gates to be closed made the round of the outbuildings for the purpose of ascertaining whether the numerous watchmen were at their posts
4225-144132-0134	train-other-500	peered into the kitchen where under the pretence of seeing whether his servants were being properly fed he made a light meal of cabbage soup and gruel
none	none	 rated the said servants soundly for their thievishness and general bad behaviour 
4225-144132-0135	train-other-500	and then returned to his room Meditating in solitude he fell to thinking how best he could contrive to recompense his guest for the latter s measureless benevolence I will present him he thought to himself with a watch It is a good silver article
4225-144132-0136	train-other-500	not one of those cheap metal affairs and though it has suffered some damage he can easily get that put right A young man always needs to give a watch to his betrothed No he added after further thought
4225-144132-0137	train-other-500	I will leave him the watch in my will as a keepsake Meanwhile our hero was bowling along in high spirit Such an unexpected acquisition both of dead souls and of runaway serfs had come as a windfall
4225-144132-0138	train-other-500	Even before reaching Plushkin s village he had had a presentiment that he would do successful business there but not business of such pre eminent profitableness as had actually resulted As he proceeded he whistled hummed with
4225-144132-0139	train-other-500	hand placed trumpetwise to his mouth and ended by bursting into a burst of melody so striking that Selifan after listening for a while nodded his head and exclaimed
none	none	 My word but the master CAN sing 
4225-144132-0140	train-other-500	By the time they reached the town darkness had fallen and changed the character of the scene The britchka bounded over the cobblestones
none	none	 and at length turned into the hostelry s courtyard 
4225-144132-0141	train-other-500	where the travellers were met by Petrushka With one hand holding back the tails of his coat which he never liked to see fly apart
none	none	 the valet assisted his master to alight 
4225-144132-0142	train-other-500	The waiter ran out with candle in hand and napkin on shoulder Whether or not Petrushka was glad to see the barin return it is impossible to say but at all events he exchanged a wink with Selifan
none	none	 and his ordinarily morose exterior 
4225-144132-0143	train-other-500	seemed momentarily to brighten Then you have been travelling far sir said the waiter as he lit the way upstarts Yes said Chichikov What has happened here in the meanwhile Nothing sir
4225-144132-0144	train-other-500	replied the waiter bowing except that last night there arrived a military lieutenant He has got room number sixteen
none	none	 A lieutenant Yes He came from Riazan 
4225-144132-0145	train-other-500	driving three grey horses On entering his room Chichikov clapped his hand to his nose
none	none	 and asked his valet why he had never 
4225-144132-0146	train-other-500	had the windows opened But I did have them opened replied Petrushka Nevertheless this was a lie as Chichikov well knew though he was too tired to contest the point After ordering and consuming a light supper of sucking pig
none	none	 he undressed plunged beneath the bedclothes and sank into the profound slumber which comes only to such fortunate folk as are troubled neither with mosquitoes nor fleas nor excessive activity of brain CHAPTER VII When Chichikov awoke he stretched himself and realised that he had slept well For a moment or two he lay on his back and then suddenly clapped his hands at the recollection that he was now owner of nearly four hundred souls At once he leapt out of bed without so much as glancing at his face in the mirror though as a rule he had much solicitude for his features and especially for his chin of which he would make the most when in company with friends and more particularly should any one happen to enter while he was engaged in the process of shaving Look how round my chin is was his usual formula On the present occasion however he looked neither at chin nor at any other feature but at once donned his flower embroidered slippers of morroco leather the kind of slippers in which thanks to the Russian love for a dressing gowned existence the town of Torzhok does such a huge trade and clad only in a meagre shirt so far forgot his elderliness and dignity as to cut a couple of capers after the fashion of a Scottish highlander alighting neatly each time on the flat of his heels Only when he had done that did he proceed to business Planting himself before his dispatch box he rubbed his hands with a satisfaction worthy of an incorruptible rural magistrate when adjourning for luncheon after which he extracted from the receptacle a bundle of papers These he had decided not to deposit with a lawyer for the reason that he would hasten matters as well as save expense by himself framing and fair copying the necessary deeds of indenture and since he was thoroughly acquainted with the necessary terminology he proceeded to inscribe in large characters the date and then in smaller ones his name and rank By two o clock the whole was finished and as he looked at the sheets of names representing bygone peasants who had ploughed worked at handicrafts cheated their masters fetched carried and got drunk though SOME of them may have behaved well there came over him a strange unaccountable sensation To his eye each list of names seemed to possess a character of its own and even individual peasants therein seemed to have taken on certain qualities peculiar to themselves For instance to the majority of Madame Korobotchka s serfs there were appended nicknames and other additions Plushkin s list was distinguished by a conciseness of exposition which had led to certain of the items being represented merely by Christian name patronymic and a couple of dots and Sobakevitch s list was remarkable for its amplitude and circumstantiality in that not a single peasant had such of his peculiar characteristics omitted as that the deceased had been excellent at joinery or sober and ready to pay attention to his work Also in Sobakevitch s list there was recorded who had been the father and the mother of each of the deceased and how those parents had behaved themselves Only against the name of a certain Thedotov was there inscribed Father unknown Mother the maidservant Kapitolina Morals and Honesty good These details communicated to the document a certain air of freshness they seemed to connote that the peasants in question had lived but yesterday As Chichikov scanned the list he felt softened in spirit and said with a sigh My friends what a concourse of you is here How did you all pass your lives my brethren And how did you all come to depart hence As he spoke his eyes halted at one name in particular that of the same Peter Saveliev Neuvazhai Korito who had once been the property of the window Korobotchka Once more he could not help exclaiming What a series of titles They occupy a whole line Peter Saveliev I wonder whether you were an artisan or a plain muzhik Also I wonder how you came to meet your end whether in a tavern or whether through going to sleep in the middle of the road and being run over by a train of waggons Again I see the name Probka Stepan carpenter very sober That must be the hero of whom the Guards would have been so glad to get hold How well I can imagine him tramping the country with an axe in his belt and his boots on his shoulder and living on a few groats worth of bread and dried fish per day and taking home a couple of half rouble pieces in his purse and sewing the notes into his breeches or stuffing them into his boots In what manner came you by your end Probka Stepan Did you for good wages mount a scaffold around the cupola of the village church and climbing thence to the cross above miss your footing on a beam and fall headlong with none at hand but Uncle Michai the good uncle who scratching the back of his neck and muttering Ah Vania for once you have been too clever straightway lashed himself to a rope and took your place Maksim Teliatnikov shoemaker A shoemaker indeed As drunk as a shoemaker says the proverb I know what you were like my friend If you wish I will tell you your whole history You were apprenticed to a German who fed you and your fellows at a common table thrashed you with a strap kept you indoors whenever you had made a mistake and spoke of you in uncomplimentary terms to his wife and friends At length when your apprenticeship was over you said to yourself I am going to set up on my own account and not just to scrape together a kopeck here and a kopeck there as the Germans do but to grow rich quick Hence you took a shop at a high rent bespoke a few orders and set to work to buy up some rotten leather out of which you could make on each pair of boots a double profit But those boots split within a fortnight and brought down upon your head dire showers of maledictions with the result that gradually your shop grew empty of customers and you fell to roaming the streets and exclaiming The world is a very poor place indeed A Russian cannot make a living for German competition Well well Elizabeta Vorobei But that is a WOMAN S name How comes SHE to be on the list That villain Sobakevitch must have sneaked her in without my knowing it Grigori Goiezhai ne Doiedesh he went on What sort of a man were YOU I wonder Were you a carrier who having set up a team of three horses and a tilt waggon left your home your native hovel for ever and departed to cart merchandise to market Was it on the highway that you surrendered your soul to God or did your friends first marry you to some fat red faced soldier s daughter after which your harness and team of rough but sturdy horses caught a highwayman s fancy and you lying on your pallet thought things over until willy nilly you felt that you must get up and make for the tavern thereafter blundering into an icehole Ah our peasant of Russia Never do you welcome death when it comes And you my friends continued Chichikov turning to the sheet whereon were inscribed the names of Plushkin s absconded serfs Although you are still alive what is the good of you You are practically dead Whither I wonder have your fugitive feet carried you Did you fare hardly at Plushkin s or was it that your natural inclinations led you to prefer roaming the wilds and plundering travellers Are you by this time in gaol or have you taken service with other masters for the tillage of their lands Eremei Kariakin Nikita Volokita and Anton Volokita son of the foregoing To judge from your surnames you would seem to have been born gadabouts twenty nine Popov household serf Probably you are an educated man good Popov and go in for polite thieving as distinguished from the more vulgar cut throat sort In my mind s eye I seem to see a Captain of Rural Police challenging you for being without a passport whereupon you stake your all upon a single throw To whom do you belong asks the Captain probably adding to his question a forcible expletive To such and such a landowner stoutly you reply And what are you doing here continues the Captain I have just received permission to go and earn my obrok is your fluent explanation Then where is your passport At Miestchanin thirty Pimenov s Pimenov s Then are you Pimenov himself Yes I am Pimenov himself He has given you his passport No he has not given me his passport Come come shouts the Captain with another forcible expletive You are lying No I am not is your dogged reply It is only that last night I could not return him his passport because I came home late so I handed it to Antip Prochorov the bell ringer for him to take care of Bell ringer indeed Then HE gave you a passport No I did not receive a passport from him either What and here the Captain shouts another expletive How dare you keep on lying Where is YOUR OWN passport I had one all right you reply cunningly but must have dropped it somewhere on the road as I came along And what about that soldier s coat asks the Captain with an impolite addition Whence did you get it And what of the priest s cashbox and copper money About them I know nothing you reply doggedly Never at any time have I committed a theft Then how is it that the coat was found at your place I do not know Probably some one else put it there You rascal you rascal shouts the Captain shaking his head and closing in upon you Put the leg irons upon him and off with him to prison With pleasure you reply as taking a snuff box from your pocket you offer a pinch to each of the two gendarmes who are manacling you while also inquiring how long they have been discharged from the army and in what wars they may have served And in prison you remain until your case comes on when the justice orders you to be removed from Tsarev Kokshaika to such and such another prison and a second justice orders you to be transferred thence to Vesiegonsk or somewhere else and you go flitting from gaol to gaol and saying each time as you eye your new habitation The last place was a good deal cleaner than this one is and one could play babki thirty one there and stretch one s legs and see a little society Abakum Thirov Chichikov went on after a pause What of YOU brother Where and in what capacity are YOU disporting yourself Have you gone to the Volga country and become bitten with the life of freedom and joined the fishermen of the river Here breaking off Chichikov relapsed into silent meditation Of what was he thinking as he sat there Was he thinking of the fortunes of Abakum Thirov or was he meditating as meditates every Russian when his thoughts once turn to the joys of an emancipated existence Ah well he sighed looking at his watch It has now gone twelve o clock Why have I so forgotten myself There is still much to be done yet I go shutting myself up and letting my thoughts wander What a fool I am So saying he exchanged his Scottish costume of a shirt and nothing else for attire of a more European nature after which he pulled tight the waistcoat over his ample stomach sprinkled himself with eau de Cologne tucked his papers under his arm took his fur cap and set out for the municipal offices for the purpose of completing the transfer of souls The fact that he hurried along was not due to a fear of being late seeing that the President of the Local Council was an intimate acquaintance of his as well as a functionary who could shorten or prolong an interview at will even as Homer s Zeus was able to shorten or to prolong a night or a day whenever it became necessary to put an end to the fighting of his favourite heroes or to enable them to join battle but rather to a feeling that he would like to have the affair concluded as quickly as possible seeing that throughout it had been an anxious and difficult business Also he could not get rid of the idea that his souls were unsubstantial things and that therefore under the circumstances his shoulders had better be relieved of their load with the least possible delay Pulling on his cinnamon coloured bear lined overcoat as he went he had just stepped thoughtfully into the street when he collided with a gentleman dressed in a similar coat and an ear lappeted fur cap Upon that the gentleman uttered an exclamation Behold it was Manilov At once the friends became folded in a strenuous embrace and remained so locked for fully five minutes Indeed the kisses exchanged were so vigorous that both suffered from toothache for the greater portion of the day Also Manilov s delight was such that only his nose and lips remained visible the eyes completely disappeared Afterwards he spent about a quarter of an hour in holding Chichikov s hand and chafing it vigorously Lastly he in the most pleasant and exquisite terms possible intimated to his friend that he had just been on his way to embrace Paul Ivanovitch and upon this followed a compliment of the kind which would more fittingly have been addressed to a lady who was being asked to accord a partner the favour of a dance Chichikov had opened his mouth to reply though even HE felt at a loss how to acknowledge what had just been said when Manilov cut him short by producing from under his coat a roll of paper tied with red riband What have you there asked Chichikov The list of my souls Ah And as Chichikov unrolled the document and ran his eye over it he could not but marvel at the elegant neatness with which it had been inscribed It is a beautiful piece of writing he said In fact there will be no need to make a copy of it Also it has a border around its edge Who worked that exquisite border Do not ask me said Manilov Did YOU do it No my wife Dear dear Chichikov cried To think that I should have put her to so much trouble NOTHING could be too much trouble where Paul Ivanovitch is concerned Chichikov bowed his acknowledgements Next on learning that he was on his way to the municipal offices for the purpose of completing the transfer Manilov expressed his readiness to accompany him wherefore the pair linked arm in arm and proceeded together Whenever they encountered a slight rise in the ground even the smallest unevenness or difference of level Manilov supported Chichikov with such energy as almost to lift him off his feet while accompanying the service with a smiling implication that not if HE could help it should Paul Ivanovitch slip or fall Nevertheless this conduct appeared to embarrass Chichikov either because he could not find any fitting words of gratitude or because he considered the proceeding tiresome and it was with a sense of relief that he debouched upon the square where the municipal offices a large three storied building of a chalky whiteness which probably symbolised the purity of the souls engaged within were situated No other building in the square could vie with them in size seeing that the remaining edifices consisted only of a sentry box a shelter for two or three cabmen and a long hoarding the latter adorned with the usual bills posters and scrawls in chalk and charcoal At intervals from the windows of the second and third stories of the municipal offices the incorruptible heads of certain of the attendant priests of Themis would peer quickly forth and as quickly disappear again probably for the reason that a superior official had just entered the room Meanwhile the two friends ascended the staircase nay almost flew up it since longing to get rid of Manilov s ever supporting arm Chichikov hastened his steps and Manilov kept darting forward to anticipate any possible failure on the part of his companion s legs Consequently the pair were breathless when they reached the first corridor In passing it may be remarked that neither corridors nor rooms evinced any of that cleanliness and purity which marked the exterior of the building for such attributes were not troubled about within and anything that was dirty remained so and donned no meritricious purely external disguise It was as though Themis received her visitors in neglige and a dressing gown The author would also give a description of the various offices through which our hero passed were it not that he the author stands in awe of such legal haunts Approaching the first desk which he happened to encounter Chichikov inquired of the two young officials who were seated at it whether they would kindly tell him where business relating to serf indenture was transacted Of what nature precisely IS your business countered one of the youthful officials as he turned himself round I desire to make an application In connection with a purchase Yes But as I say I should like first to know where I can find the desk devoted to such business Is it here or elsewhere You must state what it is you have bought and for how much THEN we shall be happy to give you the information Chichikov perceived that the officials motive was merely one of curiosity as often happens when young tchinovniks desire to cut a more important and imposing figure than is rightfully theirs Look here young sirs he said I know for a fact that all serf business no matter to what value is transacted at one desk alone Consequently I again request you to direct me to that desk Of course if you do not know your business I can easily ask some one else To this the tchinovniks made no reply beyond pointing towards a corner of the room where an elderly man appeared to be engaged in sorting some papers Accordingly Chichikov and Manilov threaded their way in his direction through the desks whereupon the elderly man became violently busy Would you mind telling me said Chichikov bowing whether this is the desk for serf affairs The elderly man raised his eyes and said stiffly This is NOT the desk for serf affairs Where is it then In the Serf Department And where might the Serf Department be In charge of Ivan Antonovitch And where is Ivan Antonovitch The elderly man pointed to another corner of the room whither Chichikov and Manilov next directed their steps As they advanced Ivan Antonovitch cast an eye backwards and viewed them askance Then with renewed ardour he resumed his work of writing Would you mind telling me said Chichikov bowing whether this is the desk for serf affairs It appeared as though Ivan Antonovitch had not heard so completely did he bury himself in his papers and return no reply Instantly it became plain that HE at least was of an age of discretion and not one of your jejune chatterboxes and harum scarums for although his hair was still thick and black he had long ago passed his fortieth year His whole face tended towards the nose it was what in common parlance is known as a pitcher mug Would you mind telling me repeated Chichikov whether this is the desk for serf affairs It is that said Ivan Antonovitch again lowering his jug shaped jowl and resuming his writing Then I should like to transact the following business From various landowners in this canton I have purchased a number of peasants for transfer Here is the purchase list and it needs but to be registered Have you also the vendors here Some of them and from the rest I have obtained powers of attorney And have you your statement of application Yes I desire indeed it is necessary for me so to do to hasten matters a little Could the affair therefore be carried through to day To day Oh dear no said Ivan Antonovitch Before that can be done you must furnish me with further proofs that no impediments exist Then to expedite matters let me say that Ivan Grigorievitch the President of the Council is a very intimate friend of mine Possibly said Ivan Antonovitch without enthusiasm But Ivan Grigorievitch alone will not do it is customary to have others as well Yes but the absence of others will not altogether invalidate the transaction I too have been in the service and know how things can be done You had better go and see Ivan Grigorievitch said Ivan Antonovitch more mildly Should he give you an order addressed to whom it may concern we shall soon be able to settle the matter Upon that Chichikov pulled from his pocket a paper and laid it before Ivan Antonovitch At once the latter covered it with a book Chichikov again attempted to show it to him but with a movement of his head Ivan Antonovitch signified that that was unnecessary A clerk he added will now conduct you to Ivan Grigorievitch s room Upon that one of the toilers in the service of Themis a zealot who had offered her such heartfelt sacrifice that his coat had burst at the elbows and lacked a lining escorted our friends even as Virgil had once escorted Dante to the apartment of the Presence In this sanctum were some massive armchairs a table laden with two or three fat books and a large looking glass Lastly in apparently sunlike isolation there was seated at the table the President On arriving at the door of the apartment our modern Virgil seemed to have become so overwhelmed with awe that without daring even to intrude a foot he turned back and in so doing once more exhibited a back as shiny as a mat and having adhering to it in one spot a chicken s feather As soon as the two friends had entered the hall of the Presence they perceived that the President was NOT alone but on the contrary had seated by his side Sobakevitch whose form had hitherto been concealed by the intervening mirror The newcomers entry evoked sundry exclamations and the pushing back of a pair of Government chairs as the voluminous sleeved Sobakevitch rose into view from behind the looking glass Chichikov the President received with an embrace and for a while the hall of the Presence resounded with osculatory salutations as mutually the pair inquired after one another s health It seemed that both had lately had a touch of that pain under the waistband which comes of a sedentary life Also it seemed that the President had just been conversing with Sobakevitch on the subject of sales of souls since he now proceeded to congratulate Chichikov on the same a proceeding which rather embarrassed our hero seeing that Manilov and Sobakevitch two of the vendors and persons with whom he had bargained in the strictest privacy were now confronting one another direct However Chichikov duly thanked the President and then turning to Sobakevitch inquired after HIS health Thank God I have nothing to complain of replied Sobakevitch which was true enough seeing that a piece of iron would have caught cold and taken to sneezing sooner than would that uncouthly fashioned landowner Ah yes you have always had good health have you not put in the President Your late father was equally strong Yes he even went out bear hunting alone replied Sobakevitch I should think that you too could worst a bear if you were to try a tussle with him rejoined the President Oh no said Sobakevitch My father was a stronger man than I am Then with a sigh the speaker added But nowadays there are no such men as he What is even a life like mine worth Then you do not have a comfortable time of it exclaimed the President No far from it rejoined Sobakevitch shaking his head Judge for yourself Ivan Grigorievitch I am fifty years old yet never in my life had been ill except for an occasional carbuncle or boil That is not a good sign Sooner or later I shall have to pay for it And he relapsed into melancholy Just listen to the fellow was Chichikov s and the President s joint inward comment What on earth has HE to complain of I have a letter for you Ivan Grigorievitch went on Chichikov aloud as he produced from his pocket Plushkin s epistle From whom inquired the President Having broken the seal he exclaimed Why it is from Plushkin To think that HE is still alive What a strange world it is He used to be such a nice fellow and now And now he is a cur concluded Sobakevitch as well as a miser who starves his serfs to death Allow me a moment said the President Then he read the letter through When he had finished he added Yes I am quite ready to act as Plushkin s attorney When do you wish the purchase deeds to be registered Monsieur Chichikov now or later Now if you please replied Chichikov Indeed I beg that if possible the affair may be concluded to day since to morrow I wish to leave the town I have brought with me both the forms of indenture and my statement of application Very well Nevertheless we cannot let you depart so soon The indentures shall be completed to day but you must continue your sojourn in our midst I will issue the necessary orders at once So saying he opened the door into the general office where the clerks looked like a swarm of bees around a honeycomb if I may liken affairs of Government to such an article Is Ivan Antonovitch here asked the President Yes replied a voice from within Then send him here Upon that the pitcher faced Ivan Antonovitch made his appearance in the doorway and bowed Take these indentures Ivan Antonovitch said the President and see that they But first I would ask you to remember put in Sobakevitch that witnesses ought to be in attendance not less than two on behalf of either party Let us therefore send for the Public Prosecutor who has little to do and has even that little done for him by his chief clerk Zolotucha The Inspector of the Medical Department is also a man of leisure and likely to be at home if he has not gone out to a card party Others also there are all men who cumber the ground for nothing Quite so quite so agreed the President and at once dispatched a clerk to fetch the persons named Also requested Chichikov I should be glad if you would send for the accredited representative of a certain lady landowner with whom I have done business He is the son of a Father Cyril and a clerk in your offices Certainly we shall call him here replied the President Everything shall be done to meet your convenience and I forbid you to present any of our officials with a gratuity That is a special request on my part No friend of mine ever pays a copper With that he gave Ivan Antonovitch the necessary instructions and though they scarcely seemed to meet with that functionary s approval upon the President the purchase deeds had evidently produced an excellent impression more especially since the moment when he had perceived the sum total to amount to nearly a hundred thousand roubles For a moment or two he gazed into Chichikov s eyes with an expression of profound satisfaction Then he said Well done Paul Ivanovitch You have indeed made a nice haul That is so replied Chichikov Excellent business Yes excellent business I too conceive that I could not well have done better The truth is that never until a man has driven home the piles of his life s structure upon a lasting bottom instead of upon the wayward chimeras of youth will his aims in life assume a definite end And that said Chichikov went on to deliver himself of a very telling indictment of Liberalism and our modern young men Yet in his words there seemed to lurk a certain lack of conviction Somehow he seemed secretly to be saying to himself My good sir you are talking the most absolute rubbish and nothing but rubbish Nor did he even throw a glance at Sobakevitch and Manilov It was as though he were uncertain what he might not encounter in their expression Yet he need not have been afraid Never once did Sobakevitch s face move a muscle and as for Manilov he was too much under the spell of Chichikov s eloquence to do aught beyond nod his approval at intervals and strike the kind of attitude which is assumed by lovers of music when a lady singer has in rivalry of an accompanying violin produced a note whereof the shrillness would exceed even the capacity of a bird s throstle But why not tell Ivan Grigorievitch precisely what you have bought inquired Sobakevitch of Chichikov And why Ivan Grigorievitch do YOU not ask Monsieur Chichikov precisely what his purchases have consisted of What a splendid lot of serfs to be sure I myself have sold him my wheelwright Michiev What You have sold him Michiev exclaimed the President I know the man well He is a splendid craftsman and on one occasion made me a drozhki thirty two Only only well lately didn t you tell me that he is dead That Michiev is dead re echoed Sobakevitch coming perilously near to laughing Oh dear no That was his brother Michiev himself is very much alive and in even better health than he used to be Any day he could knock you up a britchka such as you could not procure even in Moscow However he is now bound to work for only one master Indeed a splendid craftsman repeated the President My only wonder is that you can have brought yourself to part with him Then think you that Michiev is the ONLY serf with whom I have parted Nay for I have parted also with Probka Stepan my carpenter with Milushkin my bricklayer and with Teliatnikov my bootmaker Yes the whole lot I have sold And to the President s inquiry why he had so acted seeing that the serfs named were all skilled workers and indispensable to a household Sobakevitch replied that a mere whim had led him to do so and thus the sale had owed its origin to a piece of folly Then he hung his head as though already repenting of his rash act and added Although a man of grey hairs I have not yet learned wisdom But inquired the President further how comes it about Paul Ivanovitch that you have purchased peasants apart from land Is it for transferment elsewhere that you need them Yes Very well then That is quite another matter To what province of the country To the province of Kherson Indeed That region contains some splendid land said the President whereupon he proceeded to expatiate on the fertility of the Kherson pastures And have you MUCH land there he continued Yes quite sufficient to accommodate the serfs whom I have purchased And is there a river on the estate or a lake Both After this reply Chichikov involuntarily threw a glance at Sobakevitch and though that landowner s face was as motionless as every other the other seemed to detect in it You liar Don t tell ME that you own both a river and a lake as well as the land which you say you do Whilst the foregoing conversation had been in progress various witnesses had been arriving on the scene They consisted of the constantly blinking Public Prosecutor the Inspector of the Medical Department and others all to quote Sobakevitch men who cumbered the ground for nothing With some of them however Chichikov was altogether unacquainted since certain substitutes and supernumeraries had to be pressed into the service from among the ranks of the subordinate staff There also arrived in answer to the summons not only the son of Father Cyril before mentioned but also Father Cyril himself Each such witness appended to his signature a full list of his dignities and qualifications one man in printed characters another in a flowing hand a third in topsy turvy characters of a kind never before seen in the Russian alphabet and so forth Meanwhile our friend Ivan Antonovitch comported himself with not a little address and after the indentures had been signed docketed and registered Chichikov found himself called upon to pay only the merest trifle in the way of Government percentage and fees for publishing the transaction in the Official Gazette The reason of this was that the President had given orders that only half the usual charges were to be exacted from the present purchaser the remaining half being somehow debited to the account of another applicant for serf registration And now said Ivan Grigorievitch when all was completed we need only to wet the bargain For that too I am ready said Chichikov Do you but name the hour If in return for your most agreeable company I were not to set a few champagne corks flying I should be indeed in default But we are not going to let you charge yourself with anything whatsoever WE must provide the champagne for you are our guest and it is for us it is our duty it is our bounden obligation to entertain you Look here gentlemen Let us adjourn to the house of the Chief of Police He is the magician who needs but to wink when passing a fishmonger s or a wine merchant s Not only shall we fare well at his place but also we shall get a game of whist To this proposal no one had any objection to offer for the mere mention of the fish shop aroused the witnesses appetite Consequently the ceremony being over there was a general reaching for hats and caps As the party were passing through the general office Ivan Antonovitch whispered in Chichikov s ear with a courteous inclination of his jug shaped physiognomy You have given a hundred thousand roubles for the serfs but have paid ME only a trifle for my trouble Yes replied Chichikov with a similar whisper but what sort of serfs do you suppose them to be They are a poor useless lot and not worth even half the purchase money This gave Ivan Antonovitch to understand that the visitor was a man of strong character a man from whom nothing more was to be expected Why have you gone and purchased souls from Plushkin whispered Sobakevitch in Chichikov s other ear Why did YOU go and add the woman Vorobei to your list retorted Chichikov Vorobei Who is Vorobei The woman Elizabet Vorobei Elizabet not Elizabeta I added no such name replied Sobakevitch and straightway joined the other guests At length the party arrived at the residence of the Chief of Police The latter proved indeed a man of spells for no sooner had he learnt what was afoot than he summoned a brisk young constable whispered in his ear adding laconically You understand do you not and brought it about that during the time that the guests were cutting for partners at whist in an adjoining room the dining table became laden with sturgeon caviare salmon herrings cheese smoked tongue fresh roe and a potted variety of the same all procured from the local fish market and reinforced with additions from the host s own kitchen The fact was that the worthy Chief of Police filled the office of a sort of father and general benefactor to the town and that he moved among the citizens as though they constituted part and parcel of his own family and watched over their shops and markets as though those establishments were merely his own private larder Indeed it would be difficult to say so thoroughly did he perform his duties in this respect whether the post most fitted him or he the post Matters were also so arranged that though his income more than doubled that of his predecessors he had never lost the affection of his fellow townsmen In particular did the tradesmen love him since he was never above standing godfather to their children or dining at their tables True he had differences of opinion with them and serious differences at that but always these were skilfully adjusted by his slapping the offended ones jovially on the shoulder drinking a glass of tea with them promising to call at their houses and play a game of chess asking after their belongings and should he learn that a child of theirs was ill prescribing the proper medicine In short he bore the reputation of being a very good fellow On perceiving the feast to be ready the host proposed that his guests should finish their whist after luncheon whereupon all proceeded to the room whence for some time past an agreeable odour had been tickling the nostrils of those present and towards the door of which Sobakevitch in particular had been glancing since the moment when he had caught sight of a huge sturgeon reposing on the sideboard After a glassful of warm olive coloured vodka apiece vodka of the tint to be seen only in the species of Siberian stone whereof seals are cut the company applied themselves to knife and fork work and in so doing evinced their several characteristics and tastes For instance Sobakevitch disdaining lesser trifles tackled the large sturgeon and during the time that his fellow guests were eating minor comestibles and drinking and talking contrived to consume more than a quarter of the whole fish so that on the host remembering the creature and with fork in hand leading the way in its direction and saying What gentlemen think you of this striking product of nature there ensued the discovery that of the said product of nature there remained little beyond the tail while Sobakevitch with an air as though at least HE had not eaten it was engaged in plunging his fork into a much more diminutive piece of fish which happened to be resting on an adjacent platter After his divorce from the sturgeon Sobakevitch ate and drank no more but sat frowning and blinking in an armchair Apparently the host was not a man who believed in sparing the wine for the toasts drunk were innumerable The first toast as the reader may guess was quaffed to the health of the new landowner of Kherson the second to the prosperity of his peasants and their safe transferment and the third to the beauty of his future wife a compliment which brought to our hero s lips a flickering smile Lastly he received from the company a pressing as well as an unanimous invitation to extend his stay in town for at least another fortnight and in the meanwhile to allow a wife to be found for him Quite so agreed the President Fight us tooth and nail though you may we intend to have you married You have happened upon us by chance and you shall have no reason to repent of it We are in earnest on this subject But why should I fight you tooth and nail said Chichikov smiling Marriage would not come amiss to me were I but provided with a betrothed Then a betrothed you shall have Why not We will do as you wish Very well assented Chichikov Bravo bravo the company shouted Long live Paul Ivanovitch Hurrah Hurrah And with that every one approached to clink glasses with him and he readily accepted the compliment and accepted it many times in succession Indeed as the hours passed on the hilarity of the company increased yet further and more than once the President a man of great urbanity when thoroughly in his cups embraced the chief guest of the day with the heartfelt words My dearest fellow My own most precious of friends Nay he even started to crack his fingers to dance around Chichikov s chair and to sing snatches of a popular song To the champagne succeeded Hungarian wine which had the effect of still further heartening and enlivening the company By this time every one had forgotten about whist and given himself up to shouting and disputing Every conceivable subject was discussed including politics and military affairs and in this connection guests voiced jejune opinions for the expression of which they would at any other time have soundly spanked their offspring Chichikov like the rest had never before felt so gay and imagining himself really and truly to be a landowner of Kherson spoke of various improvements in agriculture of the three field system of tillage thirty three and of the beatific felicity of a union between two kindred souls Also he started to recite poetry to Sobakevitch who blinked as he listened for he greatly desired to go to sleep At length the guest of the evening realised that matters had gone far enough so begged to be given a lift home and was accommodated with the Public Prosecutor s drozhki Luckily the driver of the vehicle was a practised man at his work for while driving with one hand he succeeded in leaning backwards and with the other holding Chichikov securely in his place Arrived at the inn our hero continued babbling awhile about a flaxen haired damsel with rosy lips and a dimple in her right cheek about villages of his in Kherson and about the amount of his capital Nay he even issued seignorial instructions that Selifan should go and muster the peasants about to be transferred and make a complete and detailed inventory of them For a while Selifan listened in silence then he left the room and instructed Petrushka to help the barin to undress As it happened Chichikov s boots had no sooner been removed than he managed to perform the rest of his toilet without assistance to roll on to the bed which creaked terribly as he did so and to sink into a sleep in every way worthy of a landowner of Kherson Meanwhile Petrushka had taken his master s coat and trousers of bilberry coloured check into the corridor where spreading them over a clothes horse he started to flick and to brush them and to fill the whole corridor with dust Just as he was about to replace them in his master s room he happened to glance over the railing of the gallery and saw Selifan returning from the stable Glances were exchanged and in an instant the pair had arrived at an instinctive understanding an understanding to the effect that the barin was sound asleep and that therefore one might consider one s own pleasure a little Accordingly Petrushka proceeded to restore the coat and trousers to their appointed places and then descended the stairs whereafter he and Selifan left the house together Not a word passed between them as to the object of their expedition On the contrary they talked solely of extraneous subjects Yet their walk did not take them far it took them only to the other side of the street and thence into an establishment which immediately confronted the inn Entering a mean dirty courtyard covered with glass they passed thence into a cellar where a number of customers were seated around small wooden tables What thereafter was done by Selifan and Petrushka God alone knows At all events within an hour s time they issued arm in arm and in profound silence yet remaining markedly assiduous to one another and ever ready to help one another around an awkward corner Still linked together never once releasing their mutual hold they spent the next quarter of an hour in attempting to negotiate the stairs of the inn but at length even that ascent had been mastered and they proceeded further on their way Halting before his mean little pallet Petrushka stood awhile in thought His difficulty was how best to assume a recumbent position Eventually he lay down on his face with his legs trailing over the floor after which Selifan also stretched himself upon the pallet with his head resting upon Petrushka s stomach and his mind wholly oblivious of the fact that he ought not to have been sleeping there at all but in the servant s quarters or in the stable beside his horses Scarcely a moment had passed before the pair were plunged in slumber and emitting the most raucous snores to which their master next door responded with snores of a whistling and nasal order Indeed before long every one in the inn had followed their soothing example and the hostelry lay plunged in complete restfulness Only in the window of the room of the newly arrived lieutenant from Riazan did a light remain burning Evidently he was a devotee of boots for he had purchased four pairs and was now trying on a fifth Several times he approached the bed with a view to taking off the boots and retiring to rest but each time he failed for the reason that the boots were so alluring in their make that he had no choice but to lift up first one foot and then the other for the purpose of scanning their elegant welts CHAPTER VIII It was not long before Chichikov s purchases had become the talk of the town and various were the opinions expressed as to whether or not it was expedient to procure peasants 
1987_144135_000024_000002	train-clean-360	for transferment Indeed 
none	none	such was the interest taken by certain citizens in the matter that they advised the purchaser to provide himself and his convoy with an escort in order to ensure their safe arrival at the appointed destination but though Chichikov thanked the donors of this advice for the same and declared that he should be very glad in case of need to avail himself of it he declared also that there was no real need for an escort seeing that the peasants whom he had purchased were exceptionally peace loving folk and that being themselves consenting parties to the transferment they would undoubtedly prove in every way tractable One particularly good result of this advertisement of his scheme was that he came to rank as neither more nor less than a millionaire Consequently much as the inhabitants had liked our hero in the first instance as seen in Chapter I they now liked him more than ever As a matter of fact they were citizens of an exceptionally quiet good natured easy going disposition and some of them were even well educated For instance the President of the Local Council could recite the whole of Zhukovski s LUDMILLA by heart and give such an impressive rendering of the passage The pine forest was asleep and the valley at rest as well as of the exclamation Phew that one felt as he did so that the pine forest and the valley really WERE as he described them The effect was also further heightened by the manner in which at such moments he assumed the most portentous frown For his part the Postmaster went in more for philosophy and diligently perused such works as Young s Night Thoughts and Eckharthausen s A Key to the Mysteries of Nature of which latter work he would make copious extracts though no one had the slightest notion what they referred to For the rest he was a witty florid little individual and much addicted to a practice of what he called embellishing whatsoever he had to say a feat which he performed with the aid of such by the way phrases as my dear sir my good So and So you know you understand you may imagine relatively speaking for instance and et cetera of which phrases he would add sackfuls to his speech He could also embellish his words by the simple expedient of half closing half winking one eye which trick communicated to some of his satirical utterances quite a mordant effect Nor were his colleagues a wit inferior to him in enlightenment For instance one of them made a regular practice of reading Karamzin another of conning the Moscow Gazette and a third of never looking at a book at all Likewise although they were the sort of men to whom in their more intimate movements their wives would very naturally address such nicknames as Toby Jug Marmot Fatty Pot Belly Smutty Kiki and Buzz Buzz they were men also of good heart and very ready to extend their hospitality and their friendship when once a guest had eaten of their bread and salt or spent an evening in their company Particularly therefore did Chichikov earn these good folk s approval with his taking methods and qualities so much so that the expression of that approval bid fair to make it difficult for him to quit the town seeing that wherever he went the one phrase dinned into his ears was Stay another week with us Paul Ivanovitch In short he ceased to be a free agent But incomparably more striking was the impression a matter for unbounded surprise which he produced upon the ladies Properly to explain this phenomenon I should need to say a great deal about the ladies themselves and to describe in the most vivid of colours their social intercourse and spiritual qualities Yet this would be a difficult thing for me to do since on the one hand I should be hampered by my boundless respect for the womenfolk of all Civil Service officials and on the other hand well simply by the innate arduousness of the task The ladies of N were But no I cannot do it my heart has already failed me Come come The ladies of N were distinguished for But it is of no use somehow my pen seems to refuse to move over the paper it seems to be weighted as with a plummet of lead Very well That being so I will merely say a word or two concerning the most prominent tints on the feminine palette of N merely a word or two concerning the outward appearance of its ladies and a word or two concerning their more superficial characteristics The ladies of N were pre eminently what is known as presentable Indeed in that respect they might have served as a model to the ladies of many another town That is to say in whatever pertained to tone etiquette the intricacies of decorum and strict observance of the prevailing mode they surpassed even the ladies of Moscow and saint Petersburg seeing that they dressed with taste drove about in carriages in the latest fashions and never went out without the escort of a footman in gold laced livery Again they looked upon a visiting card even upon a make shift affair consisting of an ace of diamonds or a two of clubs as a sacred thing so sacred that on one occasion two closely related ladies who had also been closely attached friends were known to fall out with one another over the mere fact of an omission to return a social call Yes in spite of the best efforts of husbands and kinsfolk to reconcile the antagonists it became clear that though all else in the world might conceivably be possible never could the hatchet be buried between ladies who had quarrelled over a neglected visit Likewise strenuous scenes used to take place over questions of precedence scenes of a kind which had the effect of inspiring husbands to great and knightly ideas on the subject of protecting the fair True never did a duel actually take place since all the husbands were officials belonging to the Civil Service but at least a given combatant would strive to heap contumely upon his rival and as we all know that is a resource which may prove even more effectual than a duel As regards morality the ladies of N were nothing if not censorious and would at once be fired with virtuous indignation when they heard of a case of vice or seduction Nay even to mere frailty they would award the lash without mercy On the other hand should any instance of what they called third personism occur among THEIR OWN circle it was always kept dark not a hint of what was going on being allowed to transpire and even the wronged husband holding himself ready should he meet with or hear of the third person to quote in a mild and rational manner the proverb Whom concerns it that a friend should consort with friend In addition I may say that like most of the female world of saint Petersburg the ladies of N were pre eminently careful and refined in their choice of words and phrases Never did a lady say I blew my nose or I perspired or I spat No it had to be I relieved my nose through the expedient of wiping it with my handkerchief and so forth Again to say This glass or this plate smells badly was forbidden No not even a hint to such an effect was to be dropped Rather the proper phrase in such a case was This glass or this plate is not behaving very well or some such formula In fact to refine the Russian tongue the more thoroughly something like half the words in it were cut out which circumstance necessitated very frequent recourse to the tongue of France since the same words if spoken in French were another matter altogether and one could use even blunter ones than the ones originally objected to So much for the ladies of N provided that one confines one s observations to the surface yet hardly need it be said that should one penetrate deeper than that a great deal more would come to light At the same time it is never a very safe proceeding to peer deeply into the hearts of ladies wherefore restricting ourselves to the foregoing superficialities let us proceed further on our way Hitherto the ladies had paid Chichikov no particular attention though giving him full credit for his gentlemanly and urbane demeanour but from the moment that there arose rumours of his being a millionaire other qualities of his began to be canvassed Nevertheless not ALL the ladies were governed by interested motives since it is due to the term millionaire rather than to the character of the person who bears it that the mere sound of the word exercises upon rascals upon decent folk and upon folk who are neither the one nor the other an undeniable influence A millionaire suffers from the disadvantage of everywhere having to behold meanness including the sort of meanness which though not actually based upon calculations of self interest yet runs after the wealthy man with smiles and doffs his hat and begs for invitations to houses where the millionaire is known to be going to dine That a similar inclination to meanness seized upon the ladies of N goes without saying with the result that many a drawing room heard it whispered that if Chichikov was not exactly a beauty at least he was sufficiently good looking to serve for a husband though he could have borne to have been a little more rotund and stout To that there would be added scornful references to lean husbands and hints that they resembled tooth brushes rather than men with many other feminine additions Also such crowds of feminine shoppers began to repair to the Bazaar as almost to constitute a crush and something like a procession of carriages ensued so long grew the rank of vehicles For their part the tradesmen had the joy of seeing highly priced dress materials which they had brought at fairs and then been unable to dispose of now suddenly become tradeable and go off with a rush For instance on one occasion a lady appeared at Mass in a bustle which filled the church to an extent which led the verger on duty to bid the commoner folk withdraw to the porch lest the lady s toilet should be soiled in the crush Even Chichikov could not help privately remarking the attention which he aroused On one occasion when he returned to the inn he found on his table a note addressed to himself Whence it had come and who had delivered it he failed to discover for the waiter declared that the person who had brought it had omitted to leave the name of the writer Beginning abruptly with the words I MUST write to you the letter went on to say that between a certain pair of souls there existed a bond of sympathy and this verity the epistle further confirmed with rows of full stops to the extent of nearly half a page 
1987_144135_000005_000010	train-clean-360	Next there followed a few reflections of a correctitude so remarkable that I have no choice but to quote them 
none	none	What I would ask is this life of ours inquired the writer Tis nought but a vale of woe And what I would ask is the world Tis nought but a mob of unthinking humanity Thereafter incidentally remarking that she had just dropped a tear to the memory of her dear mother who had departed this life twenty five years ago the presumably lady writer invited Chichikov to come forth into the wilds and to leave for ever the city where penned in noisome haunts folk could not even draw their breath 
1987_144135_000005_000015	train-clean-360	In conclusion the writer gave way to unconcealed despair and wound up with the following verses 
none	none	Two turtle doves to thee one day My dust will show congealed in death And cooing wearily they ll say In grief and loneliness she drew her closing breath 
1987_144135_000007_000000	train-clean-360	True the last line did not scan but that was a trifle since the quatrain at least conformed to the mode then prevalent 
1987_144135_000007_000001	train-clean-360	Neither signature nor date were appended to the document but only a postscript expressing a conjecture that Chichikov s own heart would tell him who the writer was and stating in addition that the said writer would be present at the Governor s ball on the following night 
none	none	This greatly interested Chichikov Indeed there was so much that was alluring and provocative of curiosity in the anonymous missive that he read it through a second time and then a third and finally said to himself I SHOULD like to know who sent it In short he took the thing seriously and spent over an hour in considering the same At length muttering a comment upon the epistle s efflorescent style he refolded the document and committed it to his dispatch box in company with a play bill and an invitation to a wedding the latter of which had for the last seven years reposed in the self same receptacle and in the self same position Shortly afterwards there arrived a card of invitation to the Governor s ball already referred to In passing it may be said that such festivities are not infrequent phenomena in county towns for the reason that where Governors exist there must take place balls if from the local gentry there is to be evoked that respectful affection which is every Governor s due Thenceforth all extraneous thoughts and considerations were laid aside in favour of preparing for the coming function Indeed this conjunction of exciting and provocative motives led to Chichikov devoting to his toilet an amount of time never witnessed since the creation of the world Merely in the contemplation of his features in the mirror as he tried to communicate to them a succession of varying expressions was an hour spent First of all he strove to make his features assume an air of dignity and importance and then an air of humble but faintly satirical respect and then an air of respect guiltless of any alloy whatsoever Next he practised performing a series of bows to his reflection accompanied with certain murmurs intended to bear a resemblance to a French phrase though Chichikov knew not a single word of the Gallic tongue Lastly came the performing of a series of what I might call agreeable surprises in the shape of twitchings of the brow and lips and certain motions of the tongue In short he did all that a man is apt to do when he is not only alone but also certain that he is handsome and that no one is regarding him through a chink Finally he tapped himself lightly on the chin and said Ah good old face In the same way when he started to dress himself for the ceremony the level of his high spirits remained unimpaired throughout the process That is to say while adjusting his braces and tying his tie he shuffled his feet in what was not exactly a dance but might be called the entr acte of a dance which performance had the not very serious result of setting a wardrobe a rattle and causing a brush to slide from the table to the floor Later his entry into the ballroom produced an extraordinary effect Every one present came forward to meet him some with cards in their hands and one man even breaking off a conversation at the most interesting point namely the point that the Inferior Land Court must be made responsible for everything Yes in spite of the responsibility of the Inferior Land Court the speaker cast all thoughts of it to the winds as he hurried to greet our hero From every side resounded acclamations of welcome and Chichikov felt himself engulfed in a sea of embraces Thus scarcely had he extricated himself from the arms of the President of the Local Council when he found himself just as firmly clasped in the arms of the Chief of Police who in turn surrendered him to the Inspector of the Medical Department who in turn handed him over to the Commissioner of Taxes who again committed him to the charge of the Town Architect Even the Governor who hitherto had been standing among his womenfolk with a box of sweets in one hand and a lap dog in the other now threw down both sweets and lap dog the lap dog giving vent to a yelp as he did so and added his greeting to those of the rest of the company Indeed not a face was there to be seen on which ecstatic delight or at all events the reflection of other people s ecstatic delight was not painted The same expression may be discerned on the faces of subordinate officials when the newly arrived Director having made his inspection the said officials are beginning to get over their first sense of awe on perceiving that he has found much to commend and that he can even go so far as to jest and utter a few words of smiling approval Thereupon every tchinovnik responds with a smile of double strength and those who it may be have not heard a single word of the Director s speech smile out of sympathy with the rest and even the gendarme who is posted at the distant door a man perhaps who has never before compassed a smile but is more accustomed to dealing out blows to the populace summons up a kind of grin even though the grin resembles the grimace of a man who is about to sneeze after inadvertently taking an over large pinch of snuff To all and sundry Chichikov responded with a bow and felt extraordinarily at his ease as he did so To right and left did he incline his head in the sidelong yet unconstrained manner that was his wont and never failed to charm the beholder As for the ladies they clustered around him in a shining bevy that was redolent of every species of perfume of roses of spring violets and of mignonette so much so that instinctively Chichikov raised his nose to snuff the air Likewise the ladies dresses displayed an endless profusion of taste and variety and though the majority of their wearers evinced a tendency to embonpoint those wearers knew how to call upon art for the concealment of the fact Confronting them Chichikov thought to himself Which of these beauties is the writer of the letter Then again he snuffed the air When the ladies had to a certain extent returned to their seats he resumed his attempts to discern from glances and expressions which of them could possibly be the unknown authoress Yet though those glances and expressions were too subtle too insufficiently open the difficulty in no way diminished his high spirits Easily and gracefully did he exchange agreeable bandinage with one lady and then approach another one with the short mincing steps usually affected by young old dandies who are fluttering around the fair As he turned not without dexterity to right and left he kept one leg slightly dragging behind the other like a short tail or comma This trick the ladies particularly admired In short they not only discovered in him a host of recommendations and attractions but also began to see in his face a sort of grand Mars like military expression a thing which as we know never fails to please the feminine eye Certain of the ladies even took to bickering over him and on perceiving that he spent most of his time standing near the door some of their number hastened to occupy chairs nearer to his post of vantage In fact when a certain dame chanced to have the good fortune to anticipate a hated rival in the race there very nearly ensued a most lamentable scene which to many of those who had been desirous of doing exactly the same thing seemed a peculiarly horrible instance of brazen faced audacity So deeply did Chichikov become plunged in conversation with his fair pursuers or rather so deeply did those fair pursuers enmesh him in the toils of small talk which they accomplished through the expedient of asking him endless subtle riddles which brought the sweat to his brow in his attempts to guess them that he forgot the claims of courtesy which required him first of all to greet his hostess In fact he remembered those claims only on hearing the Governor s wife herself addressing him She had been standing before him for several minutes and now greeted him with suave expressement and the words So HERE you are Paul Ivanovitch But what she said next I am not in a position to report for she spoke in the ultra refined tone and vein wherein ladies and gentlemen customarily express themselves in high class novels which have been written by experts more qualified than I am to describe salons and able to boast of some acquaintance with good society In effect what the Governor s wife said was that she hoped she greatly hoped that Monsieur Chichikov s heart still contained a corner even the smallest possible corner for those whom he had so cruelly forgotten Upon that Chichikov turned to her and was on the point of returning a reply at least no worse than that which would have been returned under similar circumstances by the hero of a fashionable novelette when he stopped short as though thunderstruck Before him there was standing not only Madame but also a young girl whom she was holding by the hand The golden hair the fine drawn delicate contours the face with its bewitching oval a face which might have served as a model for the countenance of the Madonna since it was of a type rarely to be met with in Russia where nearly everything from plains to human feet is rather on the gigantic scale these features I say were those of the identical maiden whom Chichikov had encountered on the road when he had been fleeing from Nozdrev s His emotion was such that he could not formulate a single intelligible syllable he could merely murmur the devil only knows what though certainly nothing of the kind which would have risen to the lips of the hero of a fashionable novel
1987_144135_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 I think that you have not met my daughter before said Madame 
1987_144135_000013_000001	train-clean-360	 She is just fresh from school 
1987_144135_000014_000000	train-clean-360	He replied that he HAD had the happiness of meeting Mademoiselle before and under rather unexpected circumstances but on his trying to say something further his tongue completely failed him 
none	none	The Governor s wife added a word or two and then carried off her daughter to speak to some of the other guests 
1987_144135_000015_000000	train-clean-360	Chichikov stood rooted to the spot like a man who after issuing into the street for a pleasant walk has suddenly come to a halt on remembering that something has been left behind him 
none	none	In a moment as he struggles to recall what that something is the mien of careless expectancy disappears from his face and he no longer sees a single person or a single object in his vicinity In the same way did Chichikov suddenly become oblivious to the scene around him Yet all the while the melodious tongues of ladies were plying him with multitudinous hints and questions hints and questions inspired with a desire to captivate Might we poor cumberers of the ground make so bold as to ask you what you are thinking of Pray tell us where lie the happy regions in which your thoughts are wandering Might we be informed of the name of her who has plunged you into this sweet abandonment of meditation such were the phrases thrown at him But to everything he turned a dead ear and the phrases in question might as well have been stones dropped into a pool Indeed his rudeness soon reached the pitch of his walking away altogether in order that he might go and reconnoitre wither the Governor s wife and daughter had retreated But the ladies were not going to let him off so easily 
1987_144135_000015_000007	train-clean-360	Every one of them had made up her mind to use upon him her every weapon and to exhibit whatsoever might chance to constitute her best point 
1987_144135_000015_000008	train-clean-360	Yet the ladies wiles proved useless for Chichikov paid not the smallest attention to them even when the dancing had begun but kept raising himself on tiptoe to peer over people s heads and ascertain in which direction the bewitching maiden with the golden hair had gone 
none	none	Also when seated he continued to peep between his neighbours backs and shoulders until at last he discovered her sitting beside her mother who was wearing a sort of Oriental turban and feather Upon that one would have thought that his purpose was to carry the position by storm for whether moved by the influence of spring or whether moved by a push from behind he pressed forward with such desperate resolution that his elbow caused the Commissioner of Taxes to stagger on his feet and would have caused him to lose his balance altogether but for the supporting row of guests in the rear Likewise the Postmaster was made to give ground whereupon he turned and eyed Chichikov with mingled astonishment and subtle irony 
1987_144135_000015_000012	train-clean-360	But Chichikov never even noticed him he saw in the distance only the golden haired beauty 
1987_144135_000015_000013	train-clean-360	At that moment she was drawing on a long glove and doubtless pining to be flying over the dancing floor where with clicking heels four couples had now begun to thread the mazes of the mazurka 
none	none	In particular was a military staff captain working body and soul and arms and legs to compass such a series of steps as were never before performed even in a dream 
1987_144135_000015_000015	train-clean-360	However Chichikov slipped past the mazurka dancers and almost treading on their heels made his way towards the spot where Madame and her daughter were seated 
1987_144135_000015_000016	train-clean-360	Yet he approached them with great diffidence and none of his late mincing and prancing 
none	none	Nay he even faltered as he walked his every movement had about it an air of awkwardness It is difficult to say whether or not the feeling which had awakened in our hero s breast was the feeling of love for it is problematical whether or not men who are neither stout nor thin are capable of any such sentiment 
1987_144135_000016_000001	train-clean-360	Nevertheless something strange something which he could not altogether explain had come upon him 
1987_144135_000016_000002	train-clean-360	It seemed as though the ball with its talk and its clatter had suddenly become a thing remote that the orchestra had withdrawn behind a hill and the scene grown misty like the carelessly painted in background of a picture 
none	none	And from that misty void there could be seen glimmering only the delicate outlines of the bewitching maiden Somehow her exquisite shape reminded him of an ivory toy in such fair white transparent relief did it stand out against the dull blur of the surrounding throng Herein we see a phenomenon not infrequently observed the phenomenon of the Chichikovs of this world becoming temporarily poets At all events for a moment or two our Chichikov felt that he was a young man again if not exactly a military officer 
1987_144135_000017_000002	train-clean-360	On perceiving an empty chair beside the mother and daughter he hastened to occupy it and though conversation at first hung fire things gradually improved and he acquired more confidence 
1987_144135_000018_000000	train-clean-360	At this point I must reluctantly deviate to say that men of weight and high office are always a trifle ponderous when conversing with ladies Young lieutenants or at all events officers not above the rank of captain are far more successful at the game 
none	none	How they contrive to be so God only knows Let them but make the most inane of remarks and at once the maiden by their side will be rocking with laughter whereas should a State Councillor enter into conversation with a damsel and remark that the Russian Empire is one of vast extent or utter a compliment which he has elaborated not without a certain measure of intelligence however strongly the said compliment may smack of a book of a surety the thing will fall flat Even a witticism from him will be laughed at far more by him himself than it will by the lady who may happen to be listening to his remarks These comments I have interposed for the purpose of explaining to the reader why as our hero conversed the maiden began to yawn Blind to this however he continued to relate to her sundry adventures which had befallen him in different parts of the world Meanwhile as need hardly be said the rest of the ladies had taken umbrage at his behaviour One of them purposely stalked past him to intimate to him the fact as well as to jostle the Governor s daughter and let the flying end of a scarf flick her face while from a lady seated behind the pair came both a whiff of violets and a very venomous and sarcastic remark Nevertheless either he did not hear the remark or he PRETENDED not to hear it 
1987_144135_000019_000005	train-clean-360	This was unwise of him since it never does to disregard ladies opinions Later but too late he was destined to learn this to his cost 
1987_144135_000020_000000	train-clean-360	In short dissatisfaction began to display itself on every feminine face 
none	none	No matter how high Chichikov might stand in society and no matter how much he might be a millionaire and include in his expression of countenance an indefinable element of grandness and martial ardour there are certain things which no lady will pardon whosoever be the person concerned We know that at Governor s balls it is customary for the onlookers to compose verses at the expense of the dancers and in this case the verses were directed to Chichikov s address Briefly the prevailing dissatisfaction grew until a tacit edict of proscription had been issued against both him and the poor young maiden But an even more unpleasant surprise was in store for our hero for whilst the young lady was still yawning as Chichikov recounted to her certain of his past adventures and also touched lightly upon the subject of Greek philosophy there appeared from an adjoining room the figure of Nozdrev Whether he had come from the buffet or whether he had issued from a little green retreat where a game more strenuous than whist had been in progress or whether he had left the latter resort unaided or whether he had been expelled therefrom is unknown but at all events when he entered the ballroom he was in an elevated condition and leading by the arm the Public Prosecutor whom he seemed to have been dragging about for a long while past seeing that the poor man was glancing from side to side as though seeking a means of putting an end to this personally conducted tour Certainly he must have found the situation almost unbearable in view of the fact that after deriving inspiration from two glasses of tea not wholly undiluted with rum Nozdrev was engaged in lying unmercifully 
1987_144135_000021_000003	train-clean-360	On sighting him in the distance Chichikov at once decided to sacrifice himself 
1987_144135_000021_000004	train-clean-360	That is to say he decided to vacate his present enviable position and make off with all possible speed since he could see that an encounter with the newcomer would do him no good 
none	none	Unfortunately at that moment the Governor buttonholed him with a request that he would come and act as arbiter between him the Governor and two ladies the subject of dispute being the question as to whether or not woman s love is lasting Simultaneously Nozdrev descried our hero and bore down upon him
1987_144135_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 Ah my fine landowner of Kherson he cried with a smile which set his fresh spring rose pink cheeks a quiver 
1987_144135_000022_000001	train-clean-360	 Have you been doing much trade in departed souls lately With that he turned to the Governor 
1987_144135_000022_000002	train-clean-360	 I suppose your Excellency knows that this man traffics in dead peasants he bawled 
none	none	Look here Chichikov I tell you in the most friendly way possible that every one here likes you yes including even the Governor Nevertheless had I my way I would hang you 
1987_144135_000022_000006	train-clean-360	Yes by God I would 
1987_144135_000023_000000	train-clean-360	Chichikov s discomfiture was complete 
none	none	And would you believe it your Excellency went on Nozdrev but this fellow actually said to me Sell me your dead souls Why I laughed till I nearly became as dead as the souls 
1987_144135_000024_000001	train-clean-360	And behold no sooner do I arrive here than I am told that he has bought three million roubles worth of peasants for transferment 
none	none	For transferment indeed 
1987_144135_000024_000003	train-clean-360	And he wanted to bargain with me for my DEAD ones 
none	none	Look here Chichikov You are a swine 
1987_144135_000024_000006	train-clean-360	Yes by God you are an utter swine 
none	none	Is not that so your Excellency Is not that so friend Prokurator thirty four But both his Excellency the Public Prosecutor and Chichikov were too taken aback to reply 
1987_144135_000025_000001	train-clean-360	The half tipsy Nozdrev without noticing them continued his harangue as before 
none	none	Ah my fine sir he cried THIS time I don t mean to let you go No not until I have learnt what all this purchasing of dead peasants means Look here 
1987_144135_000026_000003	train-clean-360	You ought to be ashamed of yourself 
none	none	Yes I say that I who am one of your best friends Here he turned to the Governor again Your Excellency he continued you would never believe what inseperables this man and I have been 
1987_144135_000026_000006	train-clean-360	Indeed if you had stood there and said to me Nozdrev tell me on your honour which of the two you love best your father or Chichikov I should have replied Chichikov by God With that he tackled our hero again Come come my friend he urged 
1987_144135_000026_000007	train-clean-360	 Let me imprint upon your cheeks a baiser or two 
none	none	You will excuse me if I kiss him will you not your Excellency 
1987_144135_000026_000009	train-clean-360	No do not resist me Chichikov but allow me to imprint at least one baiser upon your lily white cheek And in his efforts to force upon Chichikov what he termed his baisers he came near to measuring his length upon the floor 
none	none	Every one now edged away and turned a deaf ear to his further babblings but his words on the subject of the purchase of dead souls had none the less been uttered at the top of his voice and been accompanied with such uproarious laughter that the curiosity even of those who had happened to be sitting or standing in the remoter corners of the room had been aroused So strange and novel seemed the idea that the company stood with faces expressive of nothing but a dumb dull wonder Only some of the ladies as Chichikov did not fail to remark exchanged meaning ill natured winks and a series of sarcastic smiles which circumstance still further increased his confusion That Nozdrev was a notorious liar every one of course knew and that he should have given vent to an idiotic outburst of this sort had surprised no one but a dead soul well what was one to make of Nozdrev s reference to such a commodity Naturally this unseemly contretemps had greatly upset our hero for however foolish be a madman s words they may yet prove sufficient to sow doubt in the minds of saner individuals 
1987_144135_000028_000001	train-clean-360	He felt much as does a man who shod with well polished boots has just stepped into a dirty stinking puddle 
1987_144135_000028_000002	train-clean-360	He tried to put away from him the occurrence and to expand and to enjoy himself once more 
none	none	Nay he even took a hand at whist 
1987_144135_000028_000004	train-clean-360	But all was of no avail matters kept going as awry as a badly bent hoop 
none	none	Twice he blundered in his play and the President of the Council was at a loss to understand how his friend Paul Ivanovitch lately so good and so circumspect a player could perpetrate such a mauvais pas as to throw away a particular king of spades which the President has been trusting as to quote his own expression he would have trusted God At supper too matters felt uncomfortable even though the society at Chichikov s table was exceedingly agreeable and Nozdrev had been removed owing to the fact that the ladies had found his conduct too scandalous to be borne now that the delinquent had taken to seating himself on the floor and plucking at the skirts of passing lady dancers As I say therefore Chichikov found the situation not a little awkward and eventually put an end to it by leaving the supper room before the meal was over and long before the hour when usually he returned to the inn In his little room with its door of communication blocked with a wardrobe his frame of mind remained as uncomfortable as the chair in which he was seated 
1987_144135_000029_000001	train-clean-360	His heart ached with a dull unpleasant sensation with a sort of oppressive emptiness 
1987_144135_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 The devil take those who first invented balls was his reflection Who derives any real pleasure from them 
1987_144135_000030_000001	train-clean-360	In this province there exist want and scarcity everywhere yet folk go in for balls 
1987_144135_000030_000002	train-clean-360	How absurd too were those overdressed women 
1987_144135_000030_000003	train-clean-360	One of them must have had a thousand roubles on her back and all acquired at the expense of the overtaxed peasant or worse still at that of the conscience of her neighbour Yes we all know why bribes are accepted and why men become crooked in soul 
1987_144135_000030_000004	train-clean-360	It is all done to provide wives yes may the pit swallow them up with fal lals 
1987_144135_000030_000005	train-clean-360	And for what purpose 
1987_144135_000030_000006	train-clean-360	That some woman may not have to reproach her husband with the fact that say the Postmaster s wife is wearing a better dress than she is a dress which has cost a thousand roubles 
1987_144135_000030_000007	train-clean-360	 Balls and gaiety balls and gaiety is the constant cry 
1987_144135_000030_000008	train-clean-360	Yet what folly balls are 
none	none	They do not consort with the Russian spirit and genius and the devil only knows why we have them 
1987_144135_000030_000010	train-clean-360	A grown middle aged man a man dressed in black and looking as stiff as a poker suddenly takes the floor and begins shuffling his feet about while another man even though conversing with a companion on important business will the while keep capering to right and left like a billy goat 
1987_144135_000030_000011	train-clean-360	Mimicry sheer mimicry 
none	none	The fact that the Frenchman is at forty precisely what he was at fifteen leads us to imagine that we too forsooth ought to be the same 
1987_144135_000030_000013	train-clean-360	No a ball leaves one feeling that one has done a wrong thing so much so that one does not care even to think of it 
none	none	It also leaves one s head perfectly empty even as does the exertion of talking to a man of the world A man of that kind chatters away and touches lightly upon every conceivable subject and talks in smooth fluent phrases which he has culled from books without grazing their substance whereas go and have a chat with a tradesman who knows at least ONE thing thoroughly and through the medium of experience and see whether his conversation will not be worth more than the prattle of a thousand chatterboxes For what good does one get out of balls Suppose that a competent writer were to describe such a scene exactly as it stands Why even in a book it would seem senseless even as it certainly is in life 
1987_144135_000030_000019	train-clean-360	Are therefore such functions right or wrong 
none	none	One would answer that the devil alone knows and then spit and close the book 
1987_144135_000031_000000	train-clean-360	Such were the unfavourable comments which Chichikov passed upon balls in general 
1987_144135_000031_000001	train-clean-360	With it all however there went a second source of dissatisfaction 
none	none	That is to say his principal grudge was not so much against balls as against the fact that at this particular one he had been exposed he had been made to disclose the circumstance that he had been playing a strange an ambiguous part Of course when he reviewed the contretemps in the light of pure reason he could not but see that it mattered nothing and that a few rude words were of no account now that the chief point had been attained yet man is an odd creature and Chichikov actually felt pained by the could shouldering administered to him by persons for whom he had not an atom of respect and whose vanity and love of display he had only that moment been censuring 
1987_144135_000031_000004	train-clean-360	Still more on viewing the matter clearly he felt vexed to think that he himself had been so largely the cause of the catastrophe 
none	none	Yet he was not angry with HIMSELF of that you may be sure seeing that all of us have a slight weakness for sparing our own faults and always do our best to find some fellow creature upon whom to vent our displeasure whether that fellow creature be a servant a subordinate official or a wife In the same way Chichikov sought a scapegoat upon whose shoulders he could lay the blame for all that had annoyed him He found one in Nozdrev and you may be sure that the scapegoat in question received a good drubbing from every side even as an experienced captain or chief of police will give a knavish starosta or postboy a rating not only in the terms become classical but also in such terms as the said captain or chief of police may invent for himself In short Nozdrev s whole lineage was passed in review and many of its members in the ascending line fared badly in the process Meanwhile at the other end of the town there was in progress an event which was destined to augment still further the unpleasantness of our hero s position That is to say through the outlying streets and alleys of the town there was clattering a vehicle to which it would be difficult precisely to assign a name seeing that though it was of a species peculiar to itself it most nearly resembled a large rickety water melon on wheels Eventually this monstrosity drew up at the gates of a house where the archpriest of one of the churches resided and from its doors there leapt a damsel clad in a jerkin and wearing a scarf over her head For a while she thumped the gates so vigorously as to set all the dogs barking then the gates stiffly opened and admitted this unwieldy phenomenon of the road Lastly the barinia herself alighted and stood revealed as Madame Korobotchka widow of a Collegiate Secretary The reason of her sudden arrival was that she had felt so uneasy about the possible outcome of Chichikov s whim that during the three nights following his departure she had been unable to sleep a wink whereafter in spite of the fact that her horses were not shod she had set off for the town in order to learn at first hand how the dead souls were faring and whether which might God forfend she had not sold them at something like a third of their true value The consequences of her venture the reader will learn from a conversation between two ladies 
1987_144135_000033_000007	train-clean-360	We will reserve it for the ensuing chapter 
none	none	CHAPTER IX Next morning before the usual hour for paying calls there tripped from the portals of an orange coloured wooden house with an attic storey and a row of blue pillars a lady in an elegant plaid cloak With her came a footman in a many caped greatcoat and a polished top hat with a gold band Hastily but gracefully the lady ascended the steps let down from a koliaska which was standing before the entrance and as soon as she had done so the footman shut her in put up the steps again and catching hold of the strap behind the vehicle 
2792-144136-0000	train-other-500	shouted to the coachman Right away The reason of all this was that the lady was the possessor of a piece of intelligence
none	none	 that she was burning to communicate to a fellow creature 
2792-144136-0001	train-other-500	Every moment she kept looking out of the carriage window and perceiving with almost speechless vexation that as yet she was but half way on her journey
2792-144136-0002	train-other-500	The fronts of the houses appeared to her longer than usual and in particular did the front of the white stone hospital with its rows of narrow windows seem interminable
none	none	 to a degree 
2792-144136-0003	train-other-500	which at length forced her to ejaculate Oh the cursed building Positively there is no end to it Also
none	none	 she twice adjured the coachman with the words 
2792-144136-0004	train-other-500	Go quicker Andrusha You are a horribly long time over the journey this morning But at length the goal was reached and the koliaska stopped before a one storied wooden mansion dark grey in colour and
2792-144136-0005	train-other-500	having white carvings over the windows a tall wooden fence and narrow garden in front of the latter and a few meagre trees looming white with an incongruous coating of road dust In the windows of the building were also a few flower pots
2792-144136-0006	train-other-500	and a parrot that kept alternately dancing on the floor of its cage and hanging on to the ring of the same with its beak Also in the sunshine before the door two pet dogs were sleeping Here
2792-144136-0007	train-other-500	there lived the lady s bosom friend As soon as the bosom friend in question learnt of the newcomer s arrival she ran down into the hall and the two ladies kissed and embraced one another
none	none	 Then they adjourned to the drawing room How glad I am to see you said the bosom friend 
2792-144136-0008	train-other-500	When I heard some one arriving I wondered who could possibly be calling so early Parasha declared that it must be the Vice Governor s wife so as I did not want to be bored with her I gave orders that I was to be reported
2792-144136-0009	train-other-500	not at home For her part the guest would have liked to have proceeded to business by communicating her tidings but a sudden exclamation from the hostess imparted temporarily a new direction to the conversation
2792-144136-0010	train-other-500	What a pretty chintz she cried gazing at the other s gown Yes it IS pretty agreed the visitor
none	none	 On the other hand 
2792-144136-0011	train-other-500	Praskovia Thedorovna thinks that In other words the ladies proceeded to indulge in a conversation on the subject of dress and only after this had lasted for a considerable while
2792-144136-0012	train-other-500	did the visitor let fall a remark which led her entertainer to inquire And how is the universal charmer
none	none	 My God replied the other There has been SUCH a business In fact do you know why I am here at all 
2792-144136-0013	train-other-500	And the visitor s breathing became more hurried and further words seemed to be hovering between her lips like hawks preparing to stoop upon their prey Only a person of the unhumanity of a true friend would have had the heart to interrupt her
none	none	 but the hostess was just such a friend and at once interposed with 
2792-144136-0014	train-other-500	I wonder how any one can see anything in the man to praise or to admire
none	none	 For my own part I think and I would say the same thing straight to his face 
2792-144136-0015	train-other-500	that he is a perfect rascal
none	none	 Yes but do listen to what I have got to tell you 
2792-144136-0016	train-other-500	Oh I know that some people think him handsome continued the hostess unmoved
none	none	 but I say that he is nothing of the kind that in particular 
2792-144136-0017	train-other-500	his nose is perfectly odious Yes
none	none	 but let me finish what I was saying 
2792-144136-0018	train-other-500	The guest s tone was almost piteous in its appeal What is it then You cannot imagine my state of mind You see this morning I received a visit from Father Cyril s wife the Archpriest s wife you know her don t you
none	none	 Well whom do you suppose that fine gentleman visitor of ours has turned out to be The man who has built the Archpriest a poultry run 
2792-144136-0019	train-other-500	Oh dear no Had that been all
none	none	 it would have been nothing No 
2792-144136-0020	train-other-500	Listen to what Father Cyril s wife had to tell me She said that
none	none	 last night a lady landowner named Madame Korobotchka arrived at the Archpriest s house 
2792-144136-0021	train-other-500	arrived all pale and trembling and told her oh such things
none	none	 They sound like a piece out of a book That is to say at dead of night just when every one had retired to rest 
2792-144136-0022	train-other-500	there came the most dreadful knocking imaginable and some one screamed out
none	none	 Open the gates or we will break them down 
2792-144136-0023	train-other-500	Just think After this how any one can say that the man is charming I cannot imagine
none	none	 Well what of Madame Korobotchka 
2792-144136-0024	train-other-500	Is she a young woman or good looking Oh dear no Quite an old woman Splendid indeed
none	none	 So he is actually engaged to a person like that 
2792-144136-0025	train-other-500	One may heartily commend the taste of our ladies for having fallen in love with him Nevertheless it is not as you suppose Think now
none	none	 Armed with weapons from head to foot he called upon this old woman and said Sell me any souls of yours which have lately died 
2792-144136-0026	train-other-500	Of course Madame Korobotchka answered reasonably enough I cannot sell you those souls
none	none	 seeing that they have departed this world 
2792-144136-0027	train-other-500	but he replied No no They are NOT dead Tis I who tell you that
none	none	 I who ought to know the truth of the matter 
2792-144136-0028	train-other-500	I swear that they are still alive In short he made such a scene that the whole village came running to the house and children screamed and men shouted
none	none	 and no one could tell what it was all about 
2792-144136-0029	train-other-500	The affair seemed to me so horrible so utterly horrible that I trembled beyond belief
none	none	 as I listened to the story 
2792-144136-0030	train-other-500	My dearest madam said my maid Mashka pray look at yourself in the mirror and see how white you are But I have no time for that I replied as I must be off to tell my friend Anna Grigorievna
2792-144136-0031	train-other-500	the news Nor did I lose a moment in ordering the koliaska Yet when my coachman Andrusha asked me for directions
none	none	 I could not get a word out I just stood staring at him like a fool 
2792-144136-0032	train-other-500	until I thought he must think me mad
none	none	 Oh Anna Grigorievna if you but knew how upset I am What a strange affair commented the hostess What on earth can the man have meant by dead souls 
2792-144136-0033	train-other-500	I confess that the words pass my understanding Curiously enough this is the second time I have heard speak of those souls True my husband avers that Nozdrev was lying yet in his lies there seems to have been a grain of truth Well
none	none	 just think of my state when I heard all this And now apparently said Korobotchka to the Archpriest s wife 
2792-144136-0034	train-other-500	I am altogether at a loss what to do
none	none	 for throwing me fifteen roubles the man forced me to sign a worthless paper yes me an inexperienced defenceless widow who knows nothing of business 
2792-144136-0035	train-other-500	That such things should happen TRY and imagine my feelings In my opinion there is in this more than the dead souls which meet the eye I think so too agreed the other As a matter of fact her friend s remark had struck her with complete surprise
none	none	 as well as filled her with curiosity to know what the word more might possibly signify 
2792-144136-0036	train-other-500	In fact she felt driven to inquire What do YOU suppose to be hidden beneath it all No tell me
none	none	 what YOU suppose What I suppose I am at a loss to conjecture 
2792-144136-0037	train-other-500	Yes but tell me what is in your mind Upon this the visitor had to confess herself nonplussed for though capable of growing hysterical she was incapable of propounding any rational theory
2792-144136-0038	train-other-500	Consequently she felt the more that she needed tender comfort and advice
none	none	 Then THIS is what I think about the dead souls said the hostess Instantly the guest pricked up her ears 
2792-144136-0039	train-other-500	or rather they pricked themselves up and straightened herself and became somehow more modish and despite her not inconsiderable weight posed herself to look like a piece of thistledown floating on the breeze The dead souls began the hostess
2792-144136-0040	train-other-500	Are what are what inquired the guest in great excitement Are are Tell me tell me for heaven s sake
none	none	 They are an invention to conceal something else The man s real object is is 
2792-144136-0041	train-other-500	TO ABDUCT THE GOVERNOR S DAUGHTER
none	none	 So startling and unexpected was this conclusion that the guest sat reduced to a state of pale 
2792-144136-0042	train-other-500	petrified genuine amazement My God she cried
none	none	 clapping her hands 
2792-144136-0043	train-other-500	I should NEVER have guessed it Well to tell you the truth I guessed it as soon as ever you opened your mouth So much then for educating girls like the Governor s daughter at school Just see what comes of it
none	none	 Yes indeed And they tell me that she says things which I hesitate even to repeat 
2792-144136-0044	train-other-500	Truly it wrings one s heart to see to what lengths immorality has come Some of the men have quite lost their heads about her but for my part I think her not worth noticing Of course And her manners are unbearable
2792-144136-0045	train-other-500	But what puzzles me most is how a travelled man like Chichikov could come to let himself in for such an affair Surely he must have accomplices Yes and I should say that one of those accomplices is Nozdrev Surely not
2792-144136-0046	train-other-500	CERTAINLY I should say so Why I have known him even try to sell his own father At all events he staked him at cards
none	none	 Indeed You interest me 
2792-144136-0047	train-other-500	I should never had thought him capable of such things I always guessed him to be so The two ladies were still discussing the matter with acumen
none	none	 and success when there walked into the room the Public Prosecutor bushy eyebrows motionless features blinking eyes and all At once the ladies hastened to inform him of the events related adducing therewith full details both as to the purchase of dead souls and as to the scheme to abduct the Governor s daughter after which they departed in different directions for the purpose of raising the rest of the town For the execution of this undertaking not more than half an hour was required So thoroughly did they succeed in throwing dust in the public s eyes that for a while every one more especially the army of public officials was placed in the position of a schoolboy who while still asleep has had a bag of pepper thrown in his face by a party of more early rising comrades The questions now to be debated resolved themselves into two namely the question of the dead souls and the question of the Governor s daughter To this end two parties were formed the men s party and the feminine section The men s party the more absolutely senseless of the two devoted its attention to the dead souls the women s party occupied itself exclusively with the alleged abduction of the Governor s daughter And here it may be said to the ladies credit that the women s party displayed far more method and caution than did its rival faction 
2792-144136-0048	train-other-500	probably because the function in life of its members had always been that of managing and administering a household With the ladies therefore matters soon assumed vivid and definite shape they became clearly
2792-144136-0049	train-other-500	and irrefutably materialised they stood stripped of all doubt and other impedimenta Said some of the ladies in question Chichikov had long been in love with the maiden
none	none	 and the pair had kept tryst by the light of the moon while the Governor would have given his consent 
2792-144136-0050	train-other-500	seeing that Chichikov was as rich as a Jew but
none	none	 for the obstacle that Chichikov had deserted a wife already 
2792-144136-0051	train-other-500	how the worthy dames came to know that he was married remains a mystery and the said deserted wife
none	none	 pining with love for her faithless husband had sent the Governor a letter of the most touching kind so that Chichikov on perceiving that the father and mother would never give their consent 
2792-144136-0052	train-other-500	had decided to abduct the girl In other circles the matter was stated in a different way That is to say
none	none	 this section averred that Chichikov did NOT possess a wife 
2792-144136-0053	train-other-500	but that as a man of subtlety and experience he had bethought him of obtaining the daughter s hand
none	none	 through the expedient of first tackling the mother 
2792-144136-0054	train-other-500	and carrying on with her an ardent liaison and that thereafter he had made an application for the desired hand but that the mother fearing to commit a sin against religion and feeling in her heart certain gnawings of conscience
none	none	 had returned a blank refusal to Chichikov s request 
2792-144136-0055	train-other-500	whereupon Chichikov had decided to carry out the abduction alleged To the foregoing of course there became appended various additional proofs and items of evidence
2792-144136-0056	train-other-500	in proportion as the sensation spread to more remote corners of the town At length with these perfectings
none	none	 the affair reached the ears of the Governor s wife herself 
2792-144136-0057	train-other-500	Naturally as the mother of a family and as the first lady in the town
none	none	 and as a matron who had never before been suspected of things of the kind 
2792-144136-0058	train-other-500	she was highly offended when she heard the stories and very justly so
none	none	 with the result that her poor young daughter 
2792-144136-0059	train-other-500	though innocent had to endure about as unpleasant a tete a tete as ever befell a maiden of sixteen while for his part the Swiss footman received orders never at any time
none	none	 to admit Chichikov to the house 
2792-144136-0060	train-other-500	Having done their business with the Governor s wife the ladies party descended upon the male section with a view to influencing it to their own side by asserting that the dead souls
none	none	 were an invention used solely for the purpose of diverting suspicion 
2792-144136-0061	train-other-500	and successfully affecting the abduction And indeed more than one man was converted and joined the feminine camp in spite of the fact that thereby such seceders incurred strong names from their late comrades
2792-144136-0062	train-other-500	names such as old women petticoats
none	none	 and others of a nature peculiarly offensive to the male sex 
2792-144136-0063	train-other-500	Also however much they might arm themselves and take the field the men could not compass such orderliness within their ranks as could the women With the former everything was of the antiquated
2792-144136-0064	train-other-500	and rough hewn and ill fitting and unsuitable and badly adapted and inferior kind their heads were full of nothing but discord and triviality and confusion and slovenliness of thought
2792-144136-0065	train-other-500	In brief they displayed everywhere the male bent the rude
none	none	 ponderous nature which is incapable either of managing a household 
2792-144136-0066	train-other-500	or of jumping to a conclusion
none	none	 as well as remains always distrustful and lazy and full of constant doubt 
2792-144136-0067	train-other-500	and everlasting timidity For instance the men s party declared that the whole story was rubbish that the alleged abduction of the Governor s daughter
none	none	 was the work rather of a military than of a civilian culprit that the ladies were lying 
2792-144136-0068	train-other-500	when they accused Chichikov of the deed that a woman was like a money bag whatsoever you put into her she thenceforth retained that the subject which really demanded attention was the dead souls of which the devil only knew the meaning
none	none	 but in which there certainly lurked something that was contrary to good order and discipline 
2792-144136-0069	train-other-500	One reason why the men s party was so certain that the dead souls connoted something contrary to good order and discipline was that there had just been appointed
none	none	 to the province 
2792-144136-0070	train-other-500	a new Governor General an event which of course had thrown the whole army of provincial tchinovniks into a state of great excitement seeing that they knew that before long there would ensue transferments and sentences of censure
2792-144136-0071	train-other-500	as well as the series of official dinners
none	none	 with which a Governor General is accustomed to entertain his subordinates 
2792-144136-0072	train-other-500	Alas thought the army of tchinovniks it is probable that should he learn of the gross reports at present afloat in our town he will make such a fuss that we shall never hear the last of them
2792-144136-0073	train-other-500	In particular did the Director of the Medical Department turn pale at the thought that possibly the new Governor General would surmise the term dead folk to connote patients in the local hospitals who for want of proper preventative measures
none	none	 had died of sporadic fever 
2792-144136-0074	train-other-500	Indeed might it not be that Chichikov was neither more nor less than an emissary of the said Governor General sent to conduct a secret inquiry
none	none	 Accordingly he the Director of the Medical Department 
2792-144136-0075	train-other-500	communicated this last supposition to the President of the Council who though at first inclined to ejaculate Rubbish suddenly turned pale on propounding to himself the theory
none	none	 What if the souls purchased by Chichikov should REALLY be dead ones 
2792-144136-0076	train-other-500	a terrible thought considering that he the President
none	none	 had permitted their transferment to be registered 
2792-144136-0077	train-other-500	and had himself acted as Plushkin s representative What if these things should reach the Governor General s ears He mentioned the matter to one friend and another and they in their turn
none	none	 went white to the lips for panic spreads faster 
2792-144136-0078	train-other-500	and is even more destructive than the dreaded black death Also to add to the tchinovniks troubles
none	none	 it so befell that just at this juncture there came into the local Governor s hands 
2792-144136-0079	train-other-500	two documents of great importance The first of them contained advices that according to received evidence and reports there was operating in the province a forger of rouble notes who had been passing under various aliases
2792-144136-0080	train-other-500	and must therefore be sought for with the utmost diligence while the second document was a letter from the Governor of a neighbouring province with regard to a malefactor who had there evaded apprehension a letter conveying also a warning that
2792-144136-0081	train-other-500	if in the province of the town of N there should appear any suspicious individual who could produce neither references nor passports he was to be arrested forthwith These two documents left every one thunderstruck
2792-144136-0082	train-other-500	for they knocked on the head all previous conceptions and theories Not for a moment could it be supposed that the former document referred to Chichikov yet as each man pondered the position from his own point of view
none	none	 he remembered that no one REALLY knew who Chichikov was 
2792-144136-0083	train-other-500	as also that his vague references to himself had yes included statements that his career in the service
none	none	 had suffered much to the cause of Truth and that he possessed a number of enemies who were seeking his life 
2792-144136-0084	train-other-500	This gave the tchinovniks further food for thought Perhaps his life really DID stand in danger Perhaps
none	none	 he really WAS being sought for by some one Perhaps he really HAD done something of the kind above referred to 
2792-144136-0085	train-other-500	As a matter of fact who was he not that it could actually be supposed that he was a forger of notes still less a brigand seeing that his exterior was respectable in the highest degree Yet who was he
2792-144136-0086	train-other-500	At length the tchinovniks decided to make enquiries among those of whom
none	none	 he had purchased souls 
2792-144136-0087	train-other-500	in order that at least it might be learnt
none	none	 what the purchases had consisted of 
2792-144136-0088	train-other-500	and what exactly underlay them and whether in passing he had explained to any one his real intentions or revealed to any one his identity In the first instance therefore resort was had to Korobotchka
2792-144136-0089	train-other-500	Yet little was gleaned from that source merely a statement that he had bought of her some souls for fifteen roubles apiece and also a quantity of feathers while promising also to buy some other commodities in the future
2792-144136-0090	train-other-500	seeing that in particular he had entered into a contract with the Treasury for lard a fact constituting fairly presumptive proof that the man was a rogue seeing that just such another fellow
none	none	 had bought a quantity of feathers yet had cheated folk all round 
2792-144136-0091	train-other-500	and in particular had done the Archpriest out of over a hundred roubles Thus the net result of Madame s cross examination was to convince the tchinovniks that she was a garrulous silly old woman
2792-144136-0092	train-other-500	With regard to Manilov he replied that he would answer for Chichikov as he would for himself
none	none	 and that he would gladly sacrifice his property in toto if thereby he could attain even a tithe of the qualities 
2792-144136-0093	train-other-500	which Paul Ivanovitch possessed Finally he delivered on Chichikov with acutely knitted brows a eulogy couched in the most charming of terms and coupled with sundry sentiments on the subject of friendship and affection in general
2792-144136-0094	train-other-500	True these remarks sufficed to indicate the tender impulses of the speaker s heart but also they did nothing to enlighten his examiners concerning the business that was actually at hand As for Sobakevitch
2792-144136-0095	train-other-500	that landowner replied that he considered Chichikov an excellent fellow as well as that the souls whom he had sold to his visitor had been in the truest sense of the word alive but that he could not answer for anything
2792-144136-0096	train-other-500	which might occur in the future seeing that any difficulties which might arise in the course of the actual transferment of souls would not be HIS fault in view of the fact that God was lord of all and that fevers and other mortal complaints
none	none	 were so numerous in the world 
2792-144136-0097	train-other-500	and that instances of whole villages perishing through the same could be found on record Finally our friends the tchinovniks found themselves compelled to resort to an expedient which
2792-144136-0098	train-other-500	though not particularly savoury is not infrequently employed namely the expedient of getting lacqueys quietly to approach the servants of the person concerning whom information is desired
2792-144136-0099	train-other-500	and to ascertain from them the servants certain details with regard to their master s life and antecedents Yet even from this source
none	none	 very little was obtained since Petrushka 
2792-144136-0100	train-other-500	provided his interrogators merely with a taste of the smell of his living room and Selifan confined his replies
none	none	 to a statement that the barin had been in the employment of the State 
2792-144136-0101	train-other-500	and also had served in the Customs In short the sum total of the results gathered by the tchinovniks was that they still stood in ignorance of Chichikov s identity but that he MUST be some one wherefore
2792-144136-0102	train-other-500	it was decided to hold a final debate on the subject on what ought to be done and who Chichikov could possibly be
none	none	 and whether or not he was a man who ought to be apprehended and detained as not respectable or whether he was a man who might himself be able to apprehend and detain THEM as persons lacking in respectability The debate in question it was proposed should be held at the residence of the Chief of Police who is known to our readers as the father and the general benefactor of the town CHAPTER X 
3109-144137-0000	train-other-500	On assembling at the residence indicated the tchinovniks had occasion to remark that owing to all these cares and excitements every one of their number had grown thinner Yes the appointment of a new Governor General coupled with the rumours described
3109-144137-0001	train-other-500	and the reception of the two serious documents above mentioned had left manifest traces upon the features of every one present More than one frockcoat had come to look too large for its wearer and more than one frame had fallen away
none	none	 including the frames of the President of the Council 
3109-144137-0002	train-other-500	the Director of the Medical Department and the Public Prosecutor Even a certain Semen Ivanovitch who for some reason or another was never alluded to by his family name but who wore on his index finger a ring with which he was accustomed to dazzle his lady friends
3109-144137-0003	train-other-500	had diminished in bulk Yet as always happens at such junctures there were also present a score of brazen individuals who had succeeded in NOT losing their presence of mind even though they constituted a mere sprinkling Of them
3109-144137-0004	train-other-500	the Postmaster formed one since he was a man of equable temperament who could always say WE know you Governor Generals We have seen three or four of you come and go whereas WE have been sitting on the same stools these thirty years Nevertheless
3109-144137-0005	train-other-500	a prominent feature of the gathering was the total absence of what is vulgarly known as common sense In general we Russians do not make a good show at representative assemblies for the reason that unless there be in authority a leading spirit to control the rest
3109-144137-0006	train-other-500	the affair always develops into confusion Why this should be so one could hardly say but at all events a success is scored only by such gatherings as have for their object dining and festivity to wit
3109-144137-0007	train-other-500	gatherings at clubs or in German run restaurants However on the present occasion the meeting was NOT one of this kind it was a meeting convoked of necessity and likely in view of the threatened calamity to affect every tchinovnik in the place
3109-144137-0008	train-other-500	Also in addition to the great divergency of views expressed thereat there was visible in all the speakers an invincible tendency to indecision which led them at one moment to make assertions
none	none	 and at the next to contradict the same 
3109-144137-0009	train-other-500	But on at least one point all seemed to agree namely that Chichikov s appearance and conversation were too respectable for him to be a forger or a disguised brigand That is to say all SEEMED to agree on the point
3109-144137-0010	train-other-500	until a sudden shout arose from the direction of the Postmaster who for some time past had been sitting plunged in thought I can tell you he cried who Chichikov is Who then replied the crowd in great excitement
3109-144137-0011	train-other-500	He is none other than Captain Kopeikin And who may Captain Kopeikin be Taking a pinch of snuff
3109-144137-0012	train-other-500	which he did with the lid of his snuff box half open lest some extraneous person should contrive to insert a not over clean finger into the stuff the Postmaster related the following story
none	none	 thirty five After fighting in the campaign of eighteen twelve 
3109-144137-0013	train-other-500	there was sent home wounded a certain Captain Kopeikin a headstrong lively blade who whether on duty or under arrest made things lively for everybody Now
none	none	 since at Krasni or at Leipzig it matters not which he had lost an arm and a leg and in those days no provision was made for wounded soldiers and he could not work with his left arm alone 
3109-144137-0014	train-other-500	he set out to see his father Unfortunately his father could only just support himself and was forced to tell his son so
none	none	 wherefore the Captain decided to go and apply for help in saint Petersburg seeing that he had risked his life for his country 
3109-144137-0015	train-other-500	and had lost much blood in its service
none	none	 You can imagine him arriving in the capital 
3109-144137-0016	train-other-500	on a baggage waggon in the capital which is like no other city in the world Before him there lay spread out the whole field of life like a sort of Arabian Nights a picture made up of the Nevski Prospect Gorokhovaia Street
3109-144137-0017	train-other-500	countless tapering spires and a number of bridges apparently supported on nothing in fact a regular second Nineveh Well he made shift to hire a lodging but found everything so wonderfully furnished with blinds and Persian carpets and so forth
none	none	 that he saw it would mean throwing away a lot of money 
3109-144137-0018	train-other-500	True as one walks the streets of saint Petersburg one seems to smell money by the thousand roubles but our friend Kopeikin s bank was limited to a few score coppers and a little silver not enough to buy a village with At length
3109-144137-0019	train-other-500	at the price of a rouble a day he obtained a lodging in the sort of tavern where the daily ration is a bowl of cabbage soup and a crust of bread and as he felt that he could not manage to live very long on fare of that kind he asked folk what he had better do
3109-144137-0020	train-other-500	What you had better do they said Well the Government is not here it is in Paris and the troops have not yet returned from the war but there is a TEMPORARY Commission sitting and you had better go and see what IT can do for you All right he said
none	none	 I will go and tell the Commission that I have shed my blood and sacrificed my life for my country 
3109-144137-0021	train-other-500	And he got up early one morning and shaved himself with his left hand
none	none	 since the expense of a barber was not worth while 
3109-144137-0022	train-other-500	and set out wooden leg and all to see the President of the Commission But first he asked where the President lived and was told that his house was in Naberezhnaia Street And you may be sure that it was no peasant s hut
none	none	 with its glazed windows and great mirrors and statues and lacqueys and brass door handles Rather it was the sort of place which you would enter only after you had bought a cheap cake of soap and indulged in a two hours wash Also at the entrance there was posted a grand Swiss footman with a baton and an embroidered collar 
3109-144137-0023	train-other-500	a fellow looking like a fat over fed pug dog However friend Kopeikin managed to get himself and his wooden leg into the reception room and there squeezed himself away into a corner for fear lest he should knock down the gilded china with his elbow
3109-144137-0024	train-other-500	And he stood waiting in great satisfaction at having arrived before the President had so much as left his bed and been served with his silver wash basin Nevertheless it was only when Kopeikin had been waiting four hours that a breakfast waiter entered to say
3109-144137-0025	train-other-500	The President will soon be here
none	none	 By now the room was as full of people as a plate is of beans and when the President left the breakfast room 
3109-144137-0026	train-other-500	he brought with him oh such dignity and refinement and such an air of the metropolis
none	none	 First he walked up to one person 
3109-144137-0027	train-other-500	and then up to another saying What do YOU want And what do YOU want What can I do for YOU What is YOUR business And at length he stopped before Kopeikin and Kopeikin said to him
3109-144137-0028	train-other-500	I have shed my blood and lost both an arm and a leg for my country and am unable to work Might I therefore dare to ask you for a little help
none	none	 if the regulations should permit of it 
3109-144137-0029	train-other-500	or for a gratuity or for a pension or something of the kind Then the President looked at him
none	none	 and saw that one of his legs was indeed a wooden one and that an empty right sleeve was pinned to his uniform 
3109-144137-0030	train-other-500	Very well he said Come to me again in a few days time Upon this friend Kopeikin felt delighted NOW I have done my job he thought to himself and you may imagine how gaily he trotted along the pavement
3109-144137-0031	train-other-500	and how he dropped into a tavern for a glass of vodka and how he ordered a cutlet and some caper sauce and some other things for luncheon and how he called for a bottle of wine and how he went to the theatre in the evening In short he did himself thoroughly well
3109-144137-0032	train-other-500	Next he saw in the street a young English lady as graceful as a swan and set off after her on his wooden leg
none	none	 But no he thought to himself 
3109-144137-0033	train-other-500	To the devil with that sort of thing just now I will wait until I have drawn my pension
none	none	 For the present I have spent enough And I may tell you that by now he had got through fully half his money Two or three days later he went to see the President of the Commission again 
3109-144137-0034	train-other-500	I should be glad to know he said whether by now you can do anything for me in return for my having shed my blood and suffered sickness and wounds on military service First of all said the President
3109-144137-0035	train-other-500	I must tell you that nothing can be decided in your case without the authority of the Supreme Government
none	none	 Without that sanction we cannot move in the matter 
3109-144137-0036	train-other-500	Surely you see how things stand until the army shall have returned from the war All that I can advise you to do is wait for the Minister to return
none	none	 and in the meanwhile to have patience Rest assured that then you will not be overlooked 
3109-144137-0037	train-other-500	And if for the moment you have nothing to live upon this is the best that I can do for you
none	none	 With that he handed Kopeikin a trifle until his case should have been decided 
3109-144137-0038	train-other-500	However that was not what Kopeikin wanted
none	none	 He had supposed that he would be given a gratuity of a thousand roubles straight away 
3109-144137-0039	train-other-500	whereas instead of Drink and be merry it was Wait for the time is not yet Thus though his head had been full of soup plates and cutlets and English girls he now descended the steps with his ears and his tail down
none	none	 looking in fact like a poodle over which the cook has poured a bucketful of water 
3109-144137-0040	train-other-500	You see saint Petersburg life had changed him not a little since first he had got a taste of it and now that the devil only knew how he was going to live
none	none	 it came all the harder to him that he should have no more sweets to look forward to 
3109-144137-0041	train-other-500	Remember that a man in the prime of years has an appetite like a wolf and as he passed a restaurant he could see a round faced holland shirted snow white aproned fellow of a French chef
none	none	 preparing a dish delicious enough to make it turn to and eat itself while again as he passed a fruit shop he could see delicacies looking out of a window for fools to come and buy them 
3109-144137-0042	train-other-500	at a hundred roubles apiece Imagine therefore his position
none	none	 On the one hand so to speak were salmon and water melons while on the other hand was the bitter fare which passed at a tavern for luncheon 
3109-144137-0043	train-other-500	Well he thought to himself let them do what they like with me at the Commission but I intend to go and raise the whole place and to tell every blessed functionary there that I have a mind to do as I choose
3109-144137-0044	train-other-500	And in truth this bold impertinence of a man did have the hardihood to return to the Commission What do you want said the President
none	none	 Why are you here for the third time 
3109-144137-0045	train-other-500	You have had your orders given you I daresay I have he retorted but I am not going to be put off with THEM I want some cutlets to eat and a bottle of French wine and a chance to go and amuse myself at the theatre
3109-144137-0046	train-other-500	Pardon me said the President What you really need if I may venture to mention it is a little patience You have been given something for food until the Military Committee shall have met and then doubtless you will receive your proper reward
none	none	 seeing that it would not be seemly that a man who has served his country should be left destitute On the other hand if in the meanwhile you desire to indulge in cutlets and theatre going 
3109-144137-0047	train-other-500	please understand that we cannot help you but you must make your own resources and try as best you can to help yourself You can imagine that this went in at one of Kopeikin s ears and out at the other that it was like shooting peas at a stone wall
3109-144137-0048	train-other-500	Accordingly he raised a turmoil which sent the staff flying One by one he gave the mob of secretaries and clerks a real good hammering You and you and you he said do not even know your duties You are law breakers Yes he trod every man of them under foot
none	none	 At length the General himself arrived from another office and sounded the alarm What was to be done with a fellow like Kopeikin The President saw that strong measures were imperative 
3109-144137-0049	train-other-500	Very well he said Since you decline to rest satisfied with what has been given you and quietly to await the decision of your case in saint Petersburg I must find you a lodging Here constable
none	none	 remove the man to gaol Then a constable who had been called to the door a constable three ells in height 
3109-144137-0050	train-other-500	and armed with a carbine a man well fitted to guard a bank placed our friend in a police waggon Well reflected Kopeikin at least I shan t have to pay my fare for THIS ride That s one comfort
3109-144137-0051	train-other-500	Again after he had ridden a little way he said to himself they told me at the Commission to go and make my own means of enjoying myself Very good I ll do so However what became of Kopeikin and whither he went is known to no one
none	none	 He sank to use the poet s expression into the waters of Lethe and his doings now lie buried in oblivion 
3109-144137-0052	train-other-500	But allow me gentlemen to piece together the further threads of the story
none	none	 Not two months later there appeared in the forests of Riazan a band of robbers 
3109-144137-0053	train-other-500	and of that band the chieftain was none other than Allow me put in the Head of the Police Department You have said that Kopeikin had lost an arm and a leg whereas Chichikov
none	none	 To say anything more was unnecessary The Postmaster clapped his hand to his forehead and publicly called himself a fool 
3109-144137-0054	train-other-500	though later he tried to excuse his mistake by saying that in England the science of mechanics had reached such a pitch
none	none	 that wooden legs were manufactured which would enable the wearer on touching a spring to vanish instantaneously from sight 
3109-144137-0055	train-other-500	Various other theories were then propounded among them a theory that Chichikov was Napoleon escaped from saint Helena and travelling about the world in disguise And if it should be supposed that no such notion could possibly have been broached let the reader
3109-144137-0056	train-other-500	remember that these events took place not many years after the French had been driven out of Russia
none	none	 and that various prophets had since declared that Napoleon was Antichrist and would one day escape from his island prison to exercise universal sway on earth Nay some good folk had even declared the letters of Napoleon s name to constitute the Apocalyptic cipher As a last resort the tchinovniks decided to question Nozdrev 
3109-144137-0057	train-other-500	since not only had the latter been the first to mention the dead souls
none	none	 but also he was supposed to stand on terms of intimacy with Chichikov 
3109-144137-0058	train-other-500	Accordingly the Chief of Police dispatched a note by the hand of a commissionaire
none	none	 At the time Nozdrev was engaged on some very important business so much so that he had not left his room for four days and was receiving his meals through the window 
3109-144137-0059	train-other-500	and no visitors at all The business referred to consisted of the marking of several dozen selected cards in such a way as to permit of his relying upon them as upon his bosom friend Naturally he did not like having his retirement invaded
3109-144137-0060	train-other-500	and at first consigned the commissionaire to the devil but as soon as he learnt from the note that since a novice at cards was to be the guest of the Chief of Police that evening a call at the latter s house might prove not wholly unprofitable he relented
3109-144137-0061	train-other-500	unlocked the door of his room threw on the first garments that came to hand and set forth To every question put to him by the tchinovniks he answered firmly and with assurance Chichikov he averred had indeed purchased dead souls
3109-144137-0062	train-other-500	and to the tune of several thousand roubles In fact he Nozdrev had himself sold him some
none	none	 and still saw no reason why he should not have done so 
3109-144137-0063	train-other-500	Next to the question of whether or not he considered Chichikov to be a spy he replied in the affirmative and added that as long ago as his and Chichikov s joint schooldays the said Chichikov had been known as The Informer
3109-144137-0064	train-other-500	and repeatedly been thrashed by his companions on that account Again to the question of whether or not Chichikov was a forger of currency notes the deponent as before responded in the affirmative
none	none	 and appended thereto an anecdote illustrative of Chichikov s extraordinary dexterity of hand namely an anecdote to that effect that once upon a time 
3109-144137-0065	train-other-500	on learning that two million roubles worth of counterfeit notes were lying in Chichikov s house the authorities had placed seals upon the building and had surrounded it on every side with an armed guard whereupon Chichikov had during the night changed each of these seals for a new one
3109-144137-0066	train-other-500	and also so arranged matters that when the house was searched the forged notes were found to be genuine ones Again to the question of whether or not Chichikov had schemed to abduct the Governor s daughter
3109-144137-0067	train-other-500	and also whether it was true that he Nozdrev had undertaken to aid and abet him in the act
none	none	 the witness replied that had he not undertaken to do so 
3109-144137-0068	train-other-500	the affair would never have come off At this point the witness pulled himself up on realising that he had told a lie which might get him into trouble but his tongue was not to be denied the details trembling on its tip were too alluring
3109-144137-0069	train-other-500	and he even went on to cite the name of the village church where the pair had arranged to be married
none	none	 that of the priest who had performed the ceremony 
3109-144137-0070	train-other-500	the amount of the fees paid for the same seventy five roubles
none	none	 and statements one that the priest had refused to solemnise the wedding until Chichikov had frightened him by threatening to expose the fact that he the priest had married Mikhail 
3109-144137-0071	train-other-500	a local corn dealer to his paramour and two that Chichikov had ordered both a koliaska for the couple s conveyance and relays of horses from the post houses on the road
3109-144137-0072	train-other-500	Nay the narrative as detailed by Nozdrev even reached the point of his mentioning certain of the postillions by name Next the tchinovniks sounded him on the question of Chichikov s possible identity with Napoleon but before long they had reason to regret the step
none	none	 for Nozdrev responded with a rambling rigmarole such as bore no resemblance to anything possibly conceivable 
3109-144137-0073	train-other-500	Finally the majority of the audience left the room and only the Chief of Police remained to listen in the hope of gathering something more but at last even he found himself forced to disclaim the speaker with a gesture which said
3109-144137-0074	train-other-500	The devil only knows what the fellow is talking about and so voiced the general opinion that it was no use trying to gather figs of thistles Meanwhile
3109-144137-0075	train-other-500	Chichikov knew nothing of these events for having contracted a slight chill coupled with a sore throat he had decided to keep his room for three days during which time he gargled his throat with milk and fig juice consumed the fruit from which the juice had been extracted
none	none	 and wore around his neck a poultice of camomile and camphor 
3109-144137-0076	train-other-500	Also to while away the hours he made new and more detailed lists of the souls which he had bought
none	none	 perused a work by the Duchesse de la Valliere thirty six rummaged in his portmanteau 
3109-144137-0077	train-other-500	looked through various articles and papers which he discovered in his dispatch box and found every one of these occupations tedious Nor could he understand why none of his official friends had come to see him and inquire after his health
3109-144137-0078	train-other-500	seeing that not long since there had been standing in front of the inn the drozhkis
none	none	 both of the Postmaster the Public Prosecutor and the President of the Council 
3109-144137-0079	train-other-500	He wondered and wondered and then with a shrug of his shoulders fell to pacing the room At length he felt better and his spirits rose at the prospect of once more going out into the fresh air
3109-144137-0080	train-other-500	wherefore having shaved a plentiful growth of hair from his face he dressed with such alacrity as almost to cause a split in his trousers sprinkled himself with eau de Cologne
none	none	 and wrapping himself in warm clothes and turning up the collar of his coat sallied forth into the street His first destination was intended to be the Governor s mansion 
3109-144137-0081	train-other-500	and as he walked along certain thoughts concerning the Governor s daughter would keep whirling through his head so that almost he forgot where he was and took to smiling and cracking jokes to himself
none	none	 Arrived at the Governor s entrance 
3109-144137-0082	train-other-500	he was about to divest himself of his scarf when a Swiss footman greeted him with the words
none	none	 I am forbidden to admit you What he exclaimed You do not know me Look at me again and see if you do not recognise me Of course I recognise you the footman replied 
3109-144137-0083	train-other-500	I have seen you before but have been ordered to admit any one else rather than Monsieur Chichikov Indeed And why so Those are my orders and they must be obeyed said the footman confronting Chichikov
3109-144137-0084	train-other-500	with none of that politeness with which on former occasions he had hastened to divest our hero of his wrappings
none	none	 Evidently he was of opinion that since the gentry declined to receive the visitor the latter must certainly be a rogue 
3109-144137-0085	train-other-500	I cannot understand it said Chichikov to himself
none	none	 Then he departed and made his way to the house of the President of the Council 
3109-144137-0086	train-other-500	But so put about was that official by Chichikov s entry that he could not utter two consecutive words he could only murmur some rubbish which left both his visitor and himself out of countenance
none	none	 Chichikov wondered as he left the house what the President s muttered words could have meant 
3109-144137-0087	train-other-500	but failed to make head or tail of them Next he visited in turn the Chief of Police the Vice Governor the Postmaster and others
3109-144137-0088	train-other-500	but in each case he either failed to be accorded admittance or was received so strangely and with such a measure of constraint and conversational awkwardness and absence of mind and embarrassment that he began to fear for the sanity of his hosts
3109-144137-0089	train-other-500	Again and again did he strive to divine the cause but could not do so so he went wandering aimlessly about the town without succeeding in making up his mind whether he or the officials had gone crazy
3109-144137-0090	train-other-500	At length in a state bordering upon bewilderment he returned to the inn to the establishment whence that every afternoon he had set forth in such exuberance of spirits Feeling the need of something to do he ordered tea
3109-144137-0091	train-other-500	and still marvelling at the strangeness of his position was about to pour out the beverage when the door opened and Nozdrev made his appearance What says the proverb he began To see a friend seven versts is not too long a round to make
none	none	 I happened to be passing the house saw a light in your window and thought to myself 
3109-144137-0092	train-other-500	Now suppose I were to run up and pay him a visit It is unlikely that he will be asleep Ah ha I see tea on your table Good Then I will drink a cup with you for I had wretched stuff for dinner and it is beginning to lie heavy on my stomach Also
3109-144137-0093	train-other-500	tell your man to fill me a pipe Where is your own pipe I never smoke rejoined Chichikov drily Rubbish As if I did not know what a chimney pot you are What is your man s name Hi Vakhramei Come here
3109-144137-0094	train-other-500	Petrushka is his name not Vakhramei Indeed But you USED to have a man called Vakhramei didn t you
none	none	 No never Oh well Then it must be Derebin s man I am thinking of 
3109-144137-0095	train-other-500	What a lucky fellow that Derebin is An aunt of his has gone and quarrelled with her son for marrying a serf woman and has left all her property to HIM to Derebin Would that I had an aunt of that kind to provide against future contingencies
3109-144137-0096	train-other-500	But why have you been hiding yourself away I suppose the reason has been that you go in for abstruse subjects and are fond of reading why Nozdrev should have drawn these conclusions no one could possibly have said
none	none	 least of all Chichikov himself 
3109-144137-0097	train-other-500	By the way I can tell you of something that would have found you scope for your satirical vein the conclusion as to Chichikov s satirical vein was as before altogether unwarranted on Nozdrev s part
none	none	 That is to say you would have seen merchant Likhachev 
3109-144137-0098	train-other-500	losing a pile of money at play My word you would have laughed A fellow with me named Perependev said Would that Chichikov had been here It would have been the very thing for him
none	none	 As a matter of fact never since the day of his birth had Nozdrev met any one of the name of Perependev 
3109-144137-0099	train-other-500	However my friend you must admit that you treated me rather badly the day that we played that game of chess but as I won the game I bear you no malice A propos I am just from the President s and ought to tell you that the feeling against you in the town is very strong
3109-144137-0100	train-other-500	for every one believes you to be a forger of currency notes
none	none	 I myself was sent for and questioned about you but I stuck up for you through thick and thin and told the tchinovniks that I had been at school with you and had known your father In fact I gave the fellows a knock or two for themselves You say that I am believed to be a forger said Chichikov starting from his seat 
3109-144137-0101	train-other-500	Yes said Nozdrev Why have you gone and frightened everybody as you have done
none	none	 Some of our folk are almost out of their minds about it and declare you to be either a brigand 
3109-144137-0102	train-other-500	in disguise or a spy Yesterday the Public Prosecutor even died of it and is to be buried to morrow this was true in so far as that on the previous day the official in question had had a fatal stroke probably induced by the excitement of the public meeting
3109-144137-0103	train-other-500	Of course I don t suppose you to be anything of the kind but you see these fellows are in a blue funk about the new Governor General for they think he will make trouble for them over your affair A propos he is believed to be a man who puts on airs and turns up his nose at everything
3109-144137-0104	train-other-500	and if so he will get on badly with the dvoriane seeing that fellows of that sort need to be humoured a bit Yes my word Should the new Governor General shut himself up in his study and give no balls there will be the very devil to pay
none	none	 By the way Chichikov that is a risky scheme of yours 
3109-144137-0105	train-other-500	What scheme to you mean Chichikov asked uneasily Why that scheme of carrying off the Governor s daughter However to tell the truth I was expecting something of the kind No sooner did I see you and her together at the ball than I said to myself Ah ha
3109-144137-0106	train-other-500	Chichikov is not here for nothing For my own part I think you have made a poor choice for I can see nothing in her at all On the other hand the niece of a friend of mine named Bikusov she IS a girl and no mistake
3109-144137-0107	train-other-500	A regular what you might call miracle in muslin
none	none	 What on earth are you talking about asked Chichikov with his eyes distended HOW could I carry off the Governor s daughter What on earth do you mean Come come What a secretive fellow you are My only object in having come to see you is to lend you a helping hand in the matter Look here 
3109-144137-0108	train-other-500	On condition that you will lend me three thousand roubles I will stand you the cost of the wedding the koliaska and the relays of horses I must have the money even if I die for it Throughout Nozdrev s maunderings
3109-144137-0109	train-other-500	Chichikov had been rubbing his eyes to ascertain whether or not he was dreaming What with the charge of being a forger the accusation of having schemed an abduction the death of the Public Prosecutor whatever might have been its cause
3109-144137-0110	train-other-500	and the advent of a new Governor General he felt utterly dismayed Things having come to their present pass he reflected I had better not linger here I had better be off at once Getting rid of Nozdrev as soon as he could
none	none	 he sent for Selifan and ordered him to be up at daybreak in order to clean the britchka 
3109-144137-0111	train-other-500	and to have everything ready for a start at six o clock Yet though Selifan replied Very well Paul Ivanovitch he hesitated awhile by the door Next Chichikov bid Petrushka get out the dusty portmanteau from under the bed
3109-144137-0112	train-other-500	and then set to work to cram into it pell mell socks shirts collars both clean and dirty boot trees a calendar and a variety of other articles Everything went into the receptacle just as it came to hand
3109-144137-0113	train-other-500	since his one object was to obviate any possible delay in the morning s departure Meanwhile the reluctant Selifan slowly very slowly left the room as slowly descended the staircase on each separate step of which he left a muddy foot print
3109-144137-0114	train-other-500	and finally halted to scratch his head What that scratching may have meant no one could say for with the Russian populace such a scratching may mean
none	none	 any one of a hundred things CHAPTER XI Nevertheless events did not turn out as Chichikov had intended they should In the first place he overslept himself That was check number one In the second place on his rising and inquiring whether the britchka had been harnessed and everything got ready he was informed that neither of those two things had been done That was check number two Beside himself with rage he prepared to give Selifan the wigging of his life and meanwhile waited impatiently to hear what the delinquent had got to say in his defence It goes without saying that when Selifan made his appearance in the doorway he had only the usual excuses to offer the sort of excuses usually offered by servants when a hasty departure has become imperatively necessary Paul Ivanovitch he said the horses require shoeing Blockhead exclaimed Chichikov Why did you not tell me of that before you damned fool Was there not time enough for them to be shod Yes I suppose there was agreed Selifan Also one of the wheels is in want of a new tyre for the roads are so rough that the old tyre is worn through Also the body of the britchka is so rickety that probably it will not last more than a couple of stages Rascal shouted Chichikov clenching his fists and approaching Selifan in such a manner that fearing to receive a blow the man backed and dodged aside Do you mean to ruin me and to break all our bones on the road you cursed idiot For these three weeks past you have been doing nothing at all yet now at the last moment you come here stammering and playing the fool Do you think I keep you just to eat and to drive yourself about You must have known of this before Did you or did you not know it Answer me at once Yes I did know it replied Selifan hanging his head Then why didn t you tell me about it Selifan had no reply immediately ready so continued to hang his head while quietly saying to himself See how well I have managed things I knew what was the matter yet I did not say And now continued Chichikov go you at once and fetch a blacksmith Tell him that everything must be put right within two hours at the most Do you hear If that should not be done I I I will give you the best flogging that ever you had in your life Truly Chichikov was almost beside himself with fury Turning towards the door as though for the purpose of going and carrying out his orders Selifan halted and added That skewbald barin you might think it well to sell him seeing that he is nothing but a rascal A horse like that is more of a hindrance than a help What Do you expect me to go NOW to the market place and sell him Well Paul Ivanovitch he is good for nothing but show since by nature he is a most cunning beast Never in my life have I seen such a horse Fool Whenever I may wish to sell him I SHALL sell him Meanwhile don t you trouble your head about what doesn t concern you but go and fetch a blacksmith and see that everything is put right within two hours Otherwise I will take the very hair off your head and beat you till you haven t a face left Be off Hurry Selifan departed and Chichikov his ill humour vented threw down upon the floor the poignard which he always took with him as a means of instilling respect into whomsoever it might concern and spent the next quarter of an hour in disputing with a couple of blacksmiths men who as usual were rascals of the type which on perceiving that something is wanted in a hurry at once multiplies its terms for providing the same Indeed for all Chichikov s storming and raging as he dubbed the fellows robbers and extortioners and thieves he could make no impression upon the pair since true to their character they declined to abate their prices and even when they had begun their work spent upon it not two hours but five and a half Meanwhile he had the satisfaction of experiencing that delightful time with which all travellers are familiar namely the time during which one sits in a room where except for a litter of string waste paper and so forth everything else has been packed But to all things there comes an end and there arrived also the long awaited moment when the britchka had received the luggage the faulty wheel had been fitted with a new tyre the horses had been re shod and the predatory blacksmiths had departed with their gains Thank God thought Chichikov as the britchka rolled out of the gates of the inn and the vehicle began to jolt over the cobblestones Yet a feeling which he could not altogether have defined filled his breast as he gazed upon the houses and the streets and the garden walls which he might never see again Presently on turning a corner the britchka was brought to a halt through the fact that along the street there was filing a seemingly endless funeral procession Leaning forward in his britchka Chichikov asked Petrushka whose obsequies the procession represented and was told that they represented those of the Public Prosecutor Disagreeably shocked our hero hastened to raise the hood of the vehicle to draw the curtains across the windows and to lean back into a corner While the britchka remained thus halted Selifan and Petrushka their caps doffed sat watching the progress of the cortege after they had received strict instructions not to greet any fellow servant whom they might recognise Behind the hearse walked the whole body of tchinovniks bare headed and though for a moment or two Chichikov feared that some of their number might discern him in his britchka he need not have disturbed himself since their attention was otherwise engaged In fact they were not even exchanging the small talk customary among members of such processions but thinking exclusively of their own affairs of the advent of the new Governor General and of the probable manner in which he would take up the reins of administration Next came a number of carriages from the windows of which peered the ladies in mourning toilets Yet the movements of their hands and lips made it evident that they were indulging in animated conversation probably about the Governor General the balls which he might be expected to give and their own eternal fripperies and gewgaws Lastly came a few empty drozhkis As soon as the latter had passed our hero was able to continue on his way Throwing back the hood of the britchka he said to himself Ah good friend you have lived your life and now it is over In the newspapers they will say of you that you died regretted not only by your subordinates but also by humanity at large as well as that a respected citizen a kind father and a husband beyond reproach you went to your grave amid the tears of your widow and orphans Yet should those journals be put to it to name any particular circumstance which justified this eulogy of you they would be forced to fall back upon the fact that you grew a pair of exceptionally thick eyebrows With that Chichikov bid Selifan quicken his pace and concluded After all it is as well that I encountered the procession for they say that to meet a funeral is lucky Presently the britchka turned into some less frequented streets lines of wooden fencing of the kind which mark the outskirts of a town began to file by the cobblestones came to an end the macadam of the highroad succeeded to them and once more there began on either side of the turnpike a procession of verst stones road menders and grey villages inns with samovars and peasant women and landlords who came running out of yards with seivefuls of oats pedestrians in worn shoes which it might be had covered eight hundred versts little towns bright with booths for the sale of flour in barrels boots small loaves and other trifles heaps of slag much repaired bridges expanses of field to right and to left stout landowners a mounted soldier bearing a green iron clamped box inscribed The th Battery of Artillery long strips of freshly tilled earth which gleamed green yellow and black on the face of the countryside With it mingled long drawn singing glimpses of elm tops amid mist the far off notes of bells endless clouds of rocks and the illimitable line of the horizon Ah Russia Russia from my beautiful home in a strange land I can still see you In you everything is poor and disordered and unhomely in you the eye is neither cheered nor dismayed by temerities of nature which a yet more temerarious art has conquered in you one beholds no cities with lofty many windowed mansions lofty as crags no picturesque trees no ivy clad ruins no waterfalls with their everlasting spray and roar no beetling precipices which confuse the brain with their stony immensity no vistas of vines and ivy and millions of wild roses and ageless lines of blue hills which look almost unreal against the clear silvery background of the sky In you everything is flat and open your towns project like points or signals from smooth levels of plain and nothing whatsoever enchants or deludes the eye Yet what secret what invincible force draws me to you Why does there ceaselessly echo and re echo in my ears the sad song which hovers throughout the length and the breadth of your borders What is the burden of that song Why does it wail and sob and catch at my heart What say the notes which thus painfully caress and embrace my soul and flit uttering their lamentations around me What is it you seek of me O Russia What is the hidden bond which subsists between us Why do you regard me as you do Why does everything within you turn upon me eyes full of yearning Even at this moment as I stand dumbly fixedly perplexedly contemplating your vastness a menacing cloud charged with gathering rain seems to overshadow my head What is it that your boundless expanses presage Do they not presage that one day there will arise in you ideas as boundless as yourself Do they not presage that one day you too will know no limits Do they not presage that one day when again you shall have room for their exploits there will spring to life the heroes of old How the power of your immensity enfolds me and reverberates through all my being with a wild strange spell and flashes in my eyes with an almost supernatural radiance Yes a strange brilliant unearthly vista indeed do you disclose O Russia country of mine Stop stop you fool shouted Chichikov to Selifan and even as he spoke a troika bound on Government business came chattering by and disappeared in a cloud of dust To Chichikov s curses at Selifan for not having drawn out of the way with more alacrity a rural constable with moustaches of the length of an arshin added his quota What a curious and attractive yet also what an unreal fascination the term highway connotes And how interesting for its own sake is a highway Should the day be a fine one though chilly in mellowing autumn press closer your travelling cloak and draw down your cap over your ears and snuggle cosily comfortably into a corner of the britchka before a last shiver shall course through your limbs and the ensuing warmth shall put to flight the autumnal cold and damp As the horses gallop on their way how delightfully will drowsiness come stealing upon you and make your eyelids droop For a while through your somnolence you will continue to hear the hard breathing of the team and the rumbling of the wheels but at length sinking back into your corner you will relapse into the stage of snoring And when you awake behold you will find that five stages have slipped away and that the moon is shining and that you have reached a strange town of churches and old wooden cupolas and blackened spires and white half timbered houses And as the moonlight glints hither and thither almost you will believe that the walls and the streets and the pavements of the place are spread with sheets sheets shot with coal black shadows which make the wooden roofs look all the brighter under the slanting beams of the pale luminary Nowhere is a soul to be seen for every one is plunged in slumber Yet no In a solitary window a light is flickering where some good burgher is mending his boots or a baker drawing a batch of dough O night and powers of heaven how perfect is the blackness of your infinite vault how lofty how remote its inaccessible depths where it lies spread in an intangible yet audible silence Freshly does the lulling breath of night blow in your face until once more you relapse into snoring oblivion and your poor neighbour turns angrily in his corner as he begins to be conscious of your weight Then again you awake but this time to find yourself confronted with only fields and steppes Everywhere in the ascendant is the desolation of space But suddenly the ciphers on a verst stone leap to the eye Morning is rising and on the chill gradually paling line of the horizon you can see gleaming a faint gold streak The wind freshens and grows keener and you snuggle closer in your cloak yet how glorious is that freshness and how marvellous the sleep in which once again you become enfolded A jolt and for the last time you return to consciousness By now the sun is high in the heavens and you hear a voice cry gently gently as a farm waggon issues from a by road Below enclosed within an ample dike stretches a sheet of water which glistens like copper in the sunlight Beyond on the side of a slope lie some scattered peasants huts a manor house and flanking the latter a village church with its cross flashing like a star There also comes wafted to your ear the sound of peasants laughter while in your inner man you are becoming conscious of an appetite which is not to be withstood Oh long drawn highway how excellent you are How often have I in weariness and despondency set forth upon your length and found in you salvation and rest How often as I followed your leading have I been visited with wonderful thoughts and poetic dreams and curious wild impressions At this moment our friend Chichikov also was experiencing visions of a not wholly prosaic nature Let us peep into his soul and share them At first he remained unconscious of anything whatsoever for he was too much engaged in making sure that he was really clear of the town but as soon as he saw that it had completely disappeared with its mills and factories and other urban appurtenances and that even the steeples of the white stone churches had sunk below the horizon he turned his attention to the road and the town of N vanished from his thoughts as completely as though he had not seen it since childhood Again in its turn the road ceased to interest him and he began to close his eyes and to loll his head against the cushions Of this let the author take advantage in order to speak at length concerning his hero since hitherto he the author has been prevented from so doing by Nozdrev and balls and ladies and local intrigues by those thousand trifles which seem trifles only when they are introduced into a book but which in life figure as affairs of importance Let us lay them aside and betake ourselves to business Whether the character whom I have selected for my hero has pleased my readers is of course exceedingly doubtful At all events the ladies will have failed to approve him for the fair sex demands in a hero perfection and should there be the least mental or physical stain on him well woe betide Yes no matter how profoundly the author may probe that hero s soul no matter how clearly he may portray his figure as in a mirror he will be given no credit for the achievement Indeed Chichikov s very stoutness and plenitude of years may have militated against him for never is a hero pardoned for the former and the majority of ladies will in such case turn away and mutter to themselves Phew What a beast Yes the author is well aware of this Yet though he could not to save his life take a person of virtue for his principal character it may be that this story contains themes never before selected and that in it there projects the whole boundless wealth of Russian psychology that it portrays as well as Chichikov the peasant who is gifted with the virtues which God has sent him and the marvellous maiden of Russia who has not her like in all the world for her beautiful feminine spirituality the roots of which lie buried in noble aspirations and boundless self denial In fact compared with these types the virtuous of other races seem lifeless as does an inanimate volume when compared with the living word Yes each time that there arises in Russia a movement of thought it becomes clear that the movement sinks deep into the Slavonic nature where it would but have skimmed the surface of other nations But why am I talking like this Whither am I tending It is indeed shameful that an author who long ago reached man s estate and was brought up to a course of severe introspection and sober solitary self enlightenment should give way to such jejune wandering from the point To everything its proper time and place and turn As I was saying it does not lie in me to take a virtuous character for my hero and I will tell you why It is because it is high time that a rest were given to the poor but virtuous individual it is because the phrase a man of worth has grown into a by word it is because the man of worth has become converted into a horse and there is not a writer but rides him and flogs him in and out of season it is because the man of worth has been starved until he has not a shred of his virtue left and all that remains of his body is but the ribs and the hide it is because the man of worth is for ever being smuggled upon the scene it is because the man of worth has at length forfeited every one s respect For these reasons do I reaffirm that it is high time to yoke a rascal to the shafts Let us yoke that rascal Our hero s beginnings were both modest and obscure True his parents were dvoriane but he in no way resembled them At all events a short squab female relative who was present at his birth exclaimed as she lifted up the baby He is altogether different from what I had expected him to be He ought to have taken after his maternal grandmother whereas he has been born as the proverb has it like not father nor mother but like a chance passer by Thus from the first life regarded the little Chichikov with sour distaste and as through a dim frost encrusted window A tiny room with diminutive casements which were never opened summer or winter an invalid father in a dressing gown lined with lambskin and with an ailing foot swathed in bandages a man who was continually drawing deep breaths and walking up and down the room and spitting into a sandbox a period of perpetually sitting on a bench with pen in hand and ink on lips and fingers a period of being eternally confronted with the copy book maxim Never tell a lie but obey your superiors and cherish virtue in your heart an everlasting scraping and shuffling of slippers up and down the room a period of continually hearing a well known strident voice exclaim So you have been playing the fool again at times when the child weary of the mortal monotony of his task had added a superfluous embellishment to his copy a period of experiencing the ever familiar but ever unpleasant sensation which ensued upon those words as the boy s ear was painfully twisted between two long fingers bent backwards at the tips such is the miserable picture of that youth of which in later life Chichikov preserved but the faintest of memories But in this world everything is liable to swift and sudden change and one day in early spring when the rivers had melted the father set forth with his little son in a teliezshka thirty seven drawn by a sorrel steed of the kind known to horsy folk as a soroka and having as coachman the diminutive hunchback who father of the only serf family belonging to the elder Chichikov served as general factotum in the Chichikov establishment For a day and a half the soroka conveyed them on their way during which time they spent the night at a roadside inn crossed a river dined off cold pie and roast mutton and eventually arrived at the county town To the lad the streets presented a spectacle of unwonted brilliancy and he gaped with amazement Turning into a side alley wherein the mire necessitated both the most strenuous exertions on the soroka s part and the most vigorous castigation on the part of the driver and the barin the conveyance eventually reached the gates of a courtyard which combined with a small fruit garden containing various bushes a couple of apple trees in blossom and a mean dirty little shed constituted the premises attached to an antiquated looking villa Here there lived a relative of the Chichikovs a wizened old lady who went to market in person and dried her stockings at the samovar On seeing the boy she patted his cheek and expressed satisfaction at his physique whereupon the fact became disclosed that here he was to abide for a while for the purpose of attending a local school After a night s rest his father prepared to betake himself homeward again but no tears marked the parting between him and his son he merely gave the lad a copper or two and a far more important thing the following injunctions See here my boy Do your lessons well do not idle or play the fool and above all things see that you please your teachers So long as you observe these rules you will make progress and surpass your fellows even if God shall have denied you brains and you should fail in your studies Also do not consort overmuch with your comrades for they will do you no good but should you do so then make friends with the richer of them since one day they may be useful to you Also never entertain or treat any one but see that every one entertains and treats YOU Lastly and above all else keep and save your every kopeck To save money is the most important thing in life Always a friend or a comrade may fail you and be the first to desert you in a time of adversity but never will a KOPECK fail you whatever may be your plight Nothing in the world cannot be done cannot be attained with the aid of money These injunctions given the father embraced his son and set forth on his return and though the son never again beheld his parent the latter s words and precepts sank deep into the little Chichikov s soul The next day young Pavlushka made his first attendance at school But no special aptitude in any branch of learning did he display Rather his distinguishing characteristics were diligence and neatness On the other hand he developed great intelligence as regards the PRACTICAL aspect of life In a trice he divined and comprehended how things ought to be worked and from that time forth bore himself towards his school fellows in such a way that though they frequently gave him presents he not only never returned the compliment but even on occasions pocketed the gifts for the mere purpose of selling them again Also boy though he was he acquired the art of self denial Of the trifle which his father had given him on parting he spent not a kopeck but the same year actually added to his little store by fashioning a bullfinch of wax painting it and selling the same at a handsome profit Next as time went on he engaged in other speculations in particular in the scheme of buying up eatables taking his seat in class beside boys who had plenty of pocket money and as soon as such opulent individuals showed signs of failing attention and therefore of growing appetite tendering them from beneath the desk a roll of pudding or a piece of gingerbread and charging according to degree of appetite and size of portion He also spent a couple of months in training a mouse which he kept confined in a little wooden cage in his bedroom At length when the training had reached the point that at the several words of command the mouse would stand upon its hind legs lie down and get up again he sold the creature for a respectable sum Thus in time his gains attained the amount of five roubles whereupon he made himself a purse and then started to fill a second receptacle of the kind Still more studied was his attitude towards the authorities No one could sit more quietly in his place on the bench than he In the same connection it may be remarked that his teacher was a man who above all things loved peace and good behaviour and simply could not abide clever witty boys since he suspected them of laughing at him Consequently any lad who had once attracted the master s attention with a manifestation of intelligence needed but to shuffle in his place or unintentionally to twitch an eyebrow for the said master at once to burst into a rage to turn the supposed offender out of the room and to visit him with unmerciful punishment Ah my fine fellow he would say I LL cure you of your impudence and want of respect I know you through and through far better than you know yourself and will take good care that you have to go down upon your knees and curb your appetite Whereupon the wretched lad would for no cause of which he was aware be forced to wear out his breeches on the floor and go hungry for days Talents and gifts the schoolmaster would declare are so much rubbish I respect only good behaviour and shall award full marks to those who conduct themselves properly even if they fail to learn a single letter of their alphabet whereas to those in whom I may perceive a tendency to jocularity I shall award nothing even though they should outdo Solon himself For the same reason he had no great love of the author Krylov in that the latter says in one of his Fables In my opinion the more one sings the better one works and often the pedagogue would relate how in a former school of his the silence had been such that a fly could be heard buzzing on the wing and for the space of a whole year not a single pupil sneezed or coughed in class and so complete was the absence of all sound that no one could have told that there was a soul in the place Of this mentor young Chichikov speedily appraised the mentality wherefore he fashioned his behaviour to correspond with it Not an eyelid not an eyebrow would he stir during school hours howsoever many pinches he might receive from behind and only when the bell rang would he run to anticipate his fellows in handing the master the three cornered cap which that dignitary customarily sported and then to be the first to leave the class room and contrive to meet the master not less than two or three times as the latter walked homeward in order that on each occasion he might doff his cap And the scheme proved entirely successful Throughout the period of his attendance at school he was held in high favour and on leaving the establishment received full marks for every subject as well as a diploma and a book inscribed in gilt letters For Exemplary Diligence and the Perfection of Good Conduct By this time he had grown into a fairly good looking youth of the age when the chin first calls for a razor and at about the same period his father died leaving behind him as his estate four waistcoats completely worn out two ancient frockcoats and a small sum of money Apparently he had been skilled only in RECOMMENDING the saving of kopecks not in ACTUALLY PRACTISING the art Upon that Chichikov sold the old house and its little parcel of land for a thousand roubles and removed with his one serf and the serf s family to the capital where he set about organising a new establishment and entering the Civil Service Simultaneously with his doing so his old schoolmaster lost through stupidity or otherwise the establishment over which he had hitherto presided and in which he had set so much store by silence and good behaviour Grief drove him to drink and when nothing was left even for that purpose he retired ill helpless and starving into a broken down cheerless hovel But certain of his former pupils the same clever witty lads whom he had once been wont to accuse of impertinence and evil conduct generally heard of his pitiable plight and collected for him what money they could even to the point of selling their own necessaries Only Chichikov when appealed to pleaded inability and compromised with a contribution of a single piatak thirty eight which his old schoolfellows straightway returned him full in the face and accompanied with a shout of Oh you skinflint As for the poor schoolmaster when he heard what his former pupils had done he buried his face in his hands and the tears gushed from his failing eyes as from those of a helpless infant God has brought you but to weep over my death bed he murmured feebly and added with a profound sigh on hearing of Chichikov s conduct Ah Pavlushka how a human being may become changed Once you were a good lad and gave me no trouble but now you are become proud indeed Yet let it not be inferred from this that our hero s character had grown so blase and hard or his conscience so blunted as to preclude his experiencing a particle of sympathy or compassion As a matter of fact he was capable both of the one and the other and would have been glad to assist his old teacher had no great sum been required or had he not been called upon to touch the fund which he had decided should remain intact In other words the father s injunction Guard and save every kopeck had become a hard and fast rule of the son s Yet the youth had no particular attachment to money for money s sake he was not possessed with the true instinct for hoarding and niggardliness Rather before his eyes there floated ever a vision of life and its amenities and advantages a vision of carriages and an elegantly furnished house and recherche dinners and it was in the hope that some day he might attain these things that he saved every kopeck and meanwhile stinted both himself and others Whenever a rich man passed him by in a splendid drozhki drawn by swift and handsomely caparisoned horses he would halt as though deep in thought and say to himself like a man awakening from a long sleep That gentleman must have been a financier he has so little hair on his brow In short everything connected with wealth and plenty produced upon him an ineffaceable impression Even when he left school he took no holiday so strong in him was the desire to get to work and enter the Civil Service Yet for all the encomiums contained in his diploma he had much ado to procure a nomination to a Government Department and only after a long time was a minor post found for him at a salary of thirty or fourty roubles a year Nevertheless wretched though this appointment was he determined by strict attention to business to overcome all obstacles and to win success And indeed the self denial the patience and the economy which he displayed were remarkable From early morn until late at night he would with indefatigable zeal of body and mind remain immersed in his sordid task of copying official documents never going home snatching what sleep he could on tables in the building and dining with the watchman on duty Yet all the while he contrived to remain clean and neat to preserve a cheerful expression of countenance and even to cultivate a certain elegance of movement In passing it may be remarked that his fellow tchinovniks were a peculiarly plain unsightly lot some of them having faces like badly baked bread swollen cheeks receding chins and cracked and blistered upper lips Indeed not a man of them was handsome Also their tone of voice always contained a note of sullenness as though they had a mind to knock some one on the head and by their frequent sacrifices to Bacchus they showed that even yet there remains in the Slavonic nature a certain element of paganism Nay the Director s room itself they would invade while still licking their lips and since their breath was not over aromatic the atmosphere of the room grew not over pleasant Naturally among such an official staff a man like Chichikov could not fail to attract attention and remark since in everything in cheerfulness of demeanour in suavity of voice and in complete neglect of the use of strong potions he was the absolute antithesis of his companions Yet his path was not an easy one to tread for over him he had the misfortune to have placed in authority a Chief Clerk who was a graven image of elderly insensibility and inertia Always the same always unapproachable this functionary could never in his life have smiled or asked civilly after an acquaintance s health Nor had any one ever seen him a whit different in the street or at his own home from what he was in the office or showing the least interest in anything whatever or getting drunk and relapsing into jollity in his cups or indulging in that species of wild gaiety which when intoxicated even a burglar affects No not a particle of this was there in him Nor for that matter was there in him a particle of anything at all whether good or bad which complete negativeness of character produced rather a strange effect In the same way his wizened marble like features reminded one of nothing in particular so primly proportioned were they Only the numerous pockmarks and dimples with which they were pitted placed him among the number of those over whose faces to quote the popular saying The Devil has walked by night to grind peas In short it would seem that no human agency could have approached such a man and gained his goodwill Yet Chichikov made the effort As a first step he took to consulting the other s convenience in all manner of insignificant trifles to cleaning his pens carefully and when they had been prepared exactly to the Chief Clerk s liking laying them ready at his elbow to dusting and sweeping from his table all superfluous sand and tobacco ash to procuring a new mat for his inkstand to looking for his hat the meanest looking hat that ever the world beheld and having it ready for him at the exact moment when business came to an end to brushing his back if it happened to become smeared with whitewash from a wall Yet all this passed as unnoticed as though it had never been done Finally Chichikov sniffed into his superior s family and domestic life and learnt that he possessed a grown up daughter on whose face also there had taken place a nocturnal diabolical grinding of peas HERE was a quarter whence a fresh attack might be delivered After ascertaining what church the daughter attended on Sundays our hero took to contriving to meet her in a neat suit and a well starched dickey and soon the scheme began to work The surly Chief Clerk wavered for a while then ended by inviting Chichikov to tea Nor could any man in the office have told you how it came about that before long Chichikov had removed to the Chief Clerk s house and become a person necessary indeed indispensable to the household seeing that he bought the flour and the sugar treated the daughter as his betrothed called the Chief Clerk Papenka and occasionally kissed Papenka s hand In fact every one at the office supposed that at the end of February i e before the beginning of Lent there would take place a wedding Nay the surly father even began to agitate with the authorities on Chichikov s behalf and so enabled our hero on a vacancy occurring to attain the stool of a Chief Clerk Apparently this marked the consummation of Chichikov s relations with his host for he hastened stealthily to pack his trunk and the next day figured in a fresh lodging Also he ceased to call the Chief Clerk Papenka or to kiss his hand and the matter of the wedding came to as abrupt a termination as though it had never been mooted Yet also he never failed to press his late host s hand whenever he met him and to invite him to tea while on the other hand for all his immobility and dry indifference the Chief Clerk never failed to shake his head with a muttered Ah my fine fellow you have grown too proud you have grown too proud The foregoing constituted the most difficult step that our hero had to negotiate Thereafter things came with greater ease and swifter success Everywhere he attracted notice for he developed within himself everything necessary for this world namely charm of manner and bearing and great diligence in business matters Armed with these resources he next obtained promotion to what is known as a fat post and used it to the best advantage and even though at that period strict inquiry had begun to be made into the whole subject of bribes such inquiry failed to alarm him nay he actually turned it to account and thereby manifested the Russian resourcefulness which never fails to attain its zenith where extortion is concerned His method of working was the following As soon as a petitioner or a suitor put his hand into his pocket to extract thence the necessary letters of recommendation for signature Chichikov would smilingly exclaim as he detained his interlocutor s hand No no Surely you do not think that I But no no It is our duty it is our obligation and we do not require rewards for doing our work properly So far as YOUR matter is concerned you may rest easy Everything shall be carried through to morrow But may I have your address There is no need to trouble yourself seeing that the documents can easily be brought to you at your residence Upon which the delighted suitor would return home in raptures thinking Here at long last is the sort of man so badly needed A man of that kind is a jewel beyond price Yet for a day for two days nay even for three the suitor would wait in vain so far as any messengers with documents were concerned Then he would repair to the office to find that his business had not so much as been entered upon Lastly he would confront the jewel beyond price Oh pardon me pardon me Chichikov would exclaim in the politest of tones as he seized and grasped the visitor s hands The truth is that we have SUCH a quantity of business on hand But the matter shall be put through to morrow and in the meanwhile I am most sorry about it And with this would go the most fascinating of gestures Yet neither on the morrow nor on the day following nor on the third would documents arrive at the suitor s abode Upon that he would take thought as to whether something more ought not to have been done and sure enough on his making inquiry he would be informed that something will have to be given to the copyists Well there can be no harm in that he would reply As a matter of fact I have ready a tchetvertak thirty nine or two Oh no no the answer would come Not a tchetvertak per copyist but a rouble is the fee What A rouble per copyist Certainly What is there to grumble at in that Of the money the copyists will receive a tchetvertak apiece and the rest will go to the Government Upon that the disillusioned suitor would fly out upon the new order of things brought about by the inquiry into illicit fees and curse both the tchinovniks and their uppish insolent behaviour Once upon a time would the suitor lament one DID know what to do Once one had tipped the Director a bank note one s affair was so to speak in the hat But now one has to pay a rouble per copyist after waiting a week because otherwise it was impossible to guess how the wind might set The devil fly away with all disinterested and trustworthy tchinovniks And certainly the aggrieved suitor had reason to grumble seeing that now that bribe takers had ceased to exist and Directors had uniformly become men of honour and integrity secretaries and clerks ought not with impunity to have continued their thievish ways In time there opened out to Chichikov a still wider field for a Commission was appointed to supervise the erection of a Government building and on his being nominated to that body he proved himself one of its most active members The Commission got to work without delay but for a space of six years had some trouble with the building in question Either the climate hindered operations or the materials used were of the kind which prevents official edifices from ever rising higher than the basement But meanwhile OTHER quarters of the town saw arise for each member of the Commission a handsome house of the NON official style of architecture Clearly the foundation afforded by the soil of those parts was better than that where the Government building was still engaged in hanging fire Likewise the members of the Commission began to look exceedingly prosperous and to blossom out into family life and for the first time in his existence even Chichikov also departed from the iron laws of his self imposed restraint and inexorable self denial and so far mitigated his heretofore asceticism as to show himself a man not averse to those amenities which during his youth he had been capable of renouncing That is to say certain superfluities began to make their appearance in his establishment He engaged a good cook took to wearing linen shirts bought for himself cloth of a pattern worn by no one else in the province figured in checks shot with the brightest of reds and browns fitted himself out with two splendid horses which he drove with a single pair of reins added to a ring attachment for the trace horse developed a habit of washing with a sponge dipped in eau de Cologne and invested in soaps of the most expensive quality in order to communicate to his skin a more elegant polish But suddenly there appeared upon the scene a new Director a military man and a martinet as regarded his hostility to bribe takers and anything which might be called irregular On the very day after his arrival he struck fear into every breast by calling for accounts discovering hosts of deficits and missing sums and directing his attention to the aforesaid fine houses of civilian architecture Upon that there ensued a complete reshuffling Tchinovniks were retired wholesale and the houses were sequestrated to the Government or else converted into various pious institutions and schools for soldiers children Thus the whole fabric and especially Chichikov came crashing to the ground Particularly did our hero s agreeable face displease the new Director Why that was so it is impossible to say but frequently in cases of the kind no reason exists However the Director conceived a mortal dislike to him and also extended that enmity to the whole of Chichikov s colleagues But inasmuch as the said Director was a military man he was not fully acquainted with the myriad subtleties of the civilian mind wherefore it was not long before by dint of maintaining a discreet exterior added to a faculty for humouring all and sundry a fresh gang of tchinovniks succeeded in restoring him to mildness and the General found himself in the hands of greater thieves than before but thieves whom he did not even suspect seeing that he believed himself to have selected men fit and proper and even ventured to boast of possessing a keen eye for talent In a trice the tchinovniks concerned appraised his spirit and character with the result that the entire sphere over which he ruled became an agency for the detection of irregularities Everywhere and in every case were those irregularities pursued as a fisherman pursues a fat sturgeon with a gaff and to such an extent did the sport prove successful that almost in no time each participator in the hunt was seen to be in possession of several thousand roubles of capital Upon that a large number of the former band of tchinovniks also became converted to paths of rectitude and were allowed to re enter the Service but not by hook or by crook could Chichikov worm his way back even though incited thereto by sundry items of paper currency the General s first secretary and principal bear leader did all he could on our hero s behalf It seemed that the General was the kind of man who though easily led by the nose provided it was done without his knowledge no sooner got an idea into his head than it stuck there like a nail and could not possibly be extracted and all that the wily secretary succeeded in procuring was the tearing up of a certain dirty fragment of paper even that being effected only by an appeal to the General s compassion on the score of the unhappy fate which otherwise would befall Chichikov s wife and children who luckily had no existence in fact Well said Chichikov to himself I have done my best and now everything has failed Lamenting my misfortune won t help me but only action And with that he decided to begin his career anew and once more to arm himself with the weapons of patience and self denial The better to effect this he had of course to remove to another town Yet somehow for a while things miscarried More than once he found himself forced to exchange one post for another and at the briefest of notice and all of them were posts of the meanest the most wretched order Yet being a man of the utmost nicety of feeling the fact that he found himself rubbing shoulders with anything but nice companions did not prevent him from preserving intact his innate love of what was decent and seemly or from cherishing the instinct which led him to hanker after office fittings of lacquered wood with neatness and orderliness everywhere Nor did he at any time permit a foul word to creep into his speech and would feel hurt even if in the speech of others there occurred a scornful reference to anything which pertained to rank and dignity Also the reader will be pleased to know that our hero changed his linen every other day and in summer when the weather was very hot EVERY day seeing that the very faintest suspicion of an unpleasant odour offended his fastidiousness For the same reason it was his custom before being valeted by Petrushka always to plug his nostrils with a couple of cloves In short there were many occasions when his nerves suffered rackings as cruel as a young girl s and so helped to increase his disgust at having once more to associate with men who set no store by the decencies of life Yet though he braced himself to the task this period of adversity told upon his health and he even grew a trifle shabby More than once on happening to catch sight of himself in the mirror he could not forbear exclaiming Holy Mother of God but what a nasty looking brute I have become and for a long while afterwards could not with anything like sang froid contemplate his reflection Yet throughout he bore up stoutly and patiently and ended by being transferred to the Customs Department It may be said that the department had long constituted the secret goal of his ambition for he had noted the foreign elegancies with which its officials always contrived to provide themselves and had also observed that invariably they were able to send presents of china and cambric to their sisters and aunts well to their lady friends generally Yes more than once he had said to himself with a sigh THAT is the department to which I ought to belong for given a town near the frontier and a sensible set of colleagues I might be able to fit myself out with excellent linen shirts Also it may be said that most frequently of all had his thoughts turned towards a certain quality of French soap which imparted a peculiar whiteness to the skin and a peerless freshness to the cheeks Its name is known to God alone but at least it was to be procured only in the immediate neighbourhood of the frontier So as I say Chichikov had long felt a leaning towards the Customs but for a time had been restrained from applying for the same by the various current advantages of the Building Commission since rightly he had adjudged the latter to constitute a bird in the hand and the former to constitute only a bird in the bush But now he decided that come what might into the Customs he must make his way And that way he made and then applied himself to his new duties with a zeal born of the fact that he realised that fortune had specially marked him out for a Customs officer Indeed such activity perspicuity and ubiquity as his had never been seen or thought of Within four weeks at the most he had so thoroughly got his hand in that he was conversant with Customs procedure in every detail Not only could he weigh and measure but also he could divine from an invoice how many arshins of cloth or other material a given piece contained and then taking a roll of the latter in his hand could specify at once the number of pounds at which it would tip the scale As for searchings well even his colleagues had to admit that he possessed the nose of a veritable bloodhound and that it was impossible not to marvel at the patience wherewith he would try every button of the suspected person yet preserve throughout a deadly politeness and an icy sang froid which surpass belief And while the searched were raging and foaming at the mouth and feeling that they would give worlds to alter his smiling exterior with a good resounding slap he would move not a muscle of his face nor abate by a jot the urbanity of his demeanour as he murmured Do you mind so far incommoding yourself as to stand up or Pray step into the next room madam where the wife of one of our staff will attend you or Pray allow me to slip this penknife of mine into the lining of your coat after which he would extract thence shawls and towels with as much nonchalance as he would have done from his own travelling trunk Even his superiors acknowledged him to be a devil at the job rather than a human being so perfect was his instinct for looking into cart wheels carriage poles horses ears and places whither an author ought not to penetrate even in thought places whither only a Customs official is permitted to go The result was that the wretched traveller who had just crossed the frontier would within a few minutes become wholly at sea and wiping away the perspiration and breaking out into body flushes would be reduced to crossing himself and muttering Well well well In fact such a traveller would feel in the position of a schoolboy who having been summoned to the presence of the headmaster for the ostensible purpose of being give an order has found that he receives instead a sound flogging In short for some time Chichikov made it impossible for smugglers to earn a living In particular he reduced Polish Jewry almost to despair so invincible so almost unnatural was the rectitude the incorruptibility which led him to refrain from converting himself into a small capitalist with the aid of confiscated goods and articles which to save excessive clerical labour had failed to be handed over to the Government Also without saying it goes that such phenomenally zealous and disinterested service attracted general astonishment and eventually the notice of the authorities whereupon he received promotion and followed that up by mooting a scheme for the infallible detection of contrabandists provided that he could be furnished with the necessary authority for carrying out the same At once such authority was accorded him as also unlimited power to conduct every species of search and investigation And that was all he wanted It happened that previously there had been formed a well found association for smuggling on regular carefully prepared lines and that this daring scheme seemed to promise profit to the extent of some millions of money yet though he had long had knowledge of it Chichikov had said to the association s emissaries when sent to buy him over The time is not yet But now that he had got all the reins into his hands he sent word of the fact to the gang and with it the remark The time is NOW Nor was he wrong in his calculations for within the space of a year he had acquired what he could not have made during twenty years of non fraudulent service With similar sagacity he had during his early days in the department declined altogether to enter into relations with the association for the reason that he had then been a mere cipher and would have come in for nothing large in the way of takings but now well now it was another matter altogether and he could dictate what terms he liked Moreover that the affair might progress the more smoothly he suborned a fellow tchinovnik of the type which in spite of grey hairs stands powerless against temptation and the contract concluded the association duly proceeded to business Certainly business began brilliantly But probably most of my readers are familiar with the oft repeated story of the passage of Spanish sheep across the frontier in double fleeces which carried between their outer layers and their inner enough lace of Brabant to sell to the tune of millions of roubles wherefore I will not recount the story again beyond saying that those journeys took place just when Chichikov had become head of the Customs and that had he not a hand in the enterprise not all the Jews in the world could have brought it to success By the time that three or four of these ovine invasions had taken place Chichikov and his accomplice had come to be the possessors of four hundred thousand roubles apiece while some even aver that the former s gains totalled half a million owing to the greater industry which he had displayed in the matter Nor can any one but God say to what a figure the fortunes of the pair might not eventually have attained had not an awkward contretemps cut right across their arrangements That is to say for some reason or another the devil so far deprived these tchinovnik conspirators of sense as to make them come to words with one another and then to engage in a quarrel Beginning with a heated argument this quarrel reached the point of Chichikov who was possibly a trifle tipsy calling his colleague a priest s son and though that description of the person so addressed was perfectly accurate he chose to take offence and to answer Chichikov with the words loudly and incisively uttered It is YOU who have a priest for your father and to add to that the more to incense his companion Yes mark you THAT is how it is Yet though he had thus turned the tables upon Chichikov with a tu quoque and then capped that exploit with the words last quoted the offended tchinovnik could not remain satisfied but went on to send in an anonymous document to the authorities On the other hand some aver that it was over a woman that the pair fell out over a woman who to quote the phrase then current among the staff of the Customs Department was as fresh and as strong as the pulp of a turnip and that night birds were hired to assault our hero in a dark alley and that the scheme miscarried and that in any case both Chichikov and his friend had been deceived seeing that the person to whom the lady had really accorded her favours was a certain staff captain named Shamsharev However only God knows the truth of the matter Let the inquisitive reader ferret it out for himself The fact remains that a complete exposure of the dealings with the contrabandists followed and that the two tchinovniks were put to the question deprived of their property and made to formulate in writing all that they had done Against this thunderbolt of fortune the State Councillor could make no headway and in some retired spot or another sank into oblivion but Chichikov put a brave face upon the matter for in spite of the authorities best efforts to smell out his gains he had contrived to conceal a portion of them and also resorted to every subtle trick of intellect which could possibly be employed by an experienced man of the world who has a wide knowledge of his fellows Nothing which could be effected by pleasantness of demeanour by moving oratory by clouds of flattery and by the occasional insertion of a coin into a palm did he leave undone with the result that he was retired with less ignominy than was his companion and escaped actual trial on a criminal charge Yet he issued stripped of all his capital stripped of his imported effects stripped of everything That is to say all that remained to him consisted of ten thousand roubles which he had stored against a rainy day two dozen linen shirts a small britchka of the type used by bachelors and two serving men named Selifan and Petrushka Yes and an impulse of kindness moved the tchinovniks of the Customs also to set aside for him a few cakes of the soap which he had found so excellent for the freshness of the cheeks Thus once more our hero found himself stranded And what an accumulation of misfortunes had descended upon his head though true he termed them suffering in the Service in the cause of Truth Certainly one would have thought that after these buffetings and trials and changes of fortune after this taste of the sorrows of life he and his precious ten thousand roubles would have withdrawn to some peaceful corner in a provincial town where clad in a stuff dressing gown he could have sat and listened to the peasants quarrelling on festival days or for the sake of a breath of fresh air have gone in person to the poulterer s to finger chickens for soup and so have spent a quiet but not wholly useless existence but nothing of the kind took place and therein we must do justice to the strength of his character In other words although he had undergone what to the majority of men would have meant ruin and discouragement and a shattering of ideals he still preserved his energy True downcast and angry and full of resentment against the world in general he felt furious with the injustice of fate and dissatisfied with the dealings of men yet he could not forbear courting additional experiences In short the patience which he displayed was such as to make the wooden persistency of the German a persistency merely due to the slow lethargic circulation of the Teuton s blood seem nothing at all seeing that by nature Chichikov s blood flowed strongly and that he had to employ much force of will to curb within himself those elements which longed to burst forth and revel in freedom He thought things over and as he did so a certain spice of reason appeared in his reflections How have I come to be what I am he said to himself Why has misfortune overtaken me in this way Never have I wronged a poor person or robbed a widow or turned any one out of doors I have always been careful only to take advantage of those who possess more than their share Moreover I have never gleaned anywhere but where every one else was gleaning and had I not done so others would have gleaned in my place Why then should those others be prospering and I be sunk as low as a worm What am I What am I good for How can I in future hope to look any honest father of a family in the face How shall I escape being tortured with the thought that I am cumbering the ground What in the years to come will my children say save that our father was a brute for he left us nothing to live upon Here I may remark that we have seen how much thought Chichikov devoted to his future descendants Indeed had not there been constantly recurring to his mind the insistent question What will my children say he might not have plunged into the affair so deeply Nevertheless like a wary cat which glances hither and thither to see whether its mistress be not coming before it can make off with whatsoever first falls to its paw butter fat lard a duck or anything else so our future founder of a family continued though weeping and bewailing his lot to let not a single detail escape his eye That is to say he retained his wits ever in a state of activity and kept his brain constantly working All that he required was a plan Once more he pulled himself together once more he embarked upon a life of toil once more he stinted himself in everything once more he left clean and decent surroundings for a dirty mean existence In other words until something better should turn up he embraced the calling of an ordinary attorney a calling which not then possessed of a civic status was jostled on very side enjoyed little respect at the hands of the minor legal fry or indeed at its own and perforce met with universal slights and rudeness But sheer necessity compelled Chichikov to face these things Among commissions entrusted to him was that of placing in the hands of the Public Trustee several hundred peasants who belonged to a ruined estate The estate had reached its parlous condition through cattle disease through rascally bailiffs through failures of the harvest through such epidemic diseases that had killed off the best workmen and last but not least through the senseless conduct of the owner himself who had furnished a house in Moscow in the latest style and then squandered his every kopeck so that nothing was left for his further maintenance and it became necessary to mortgage the remains including the peasants of the estate In those days mortgage to the Treasury was an innovation looked upon with reserve and as attorney in the matter Chichikov had first of all to entertain every official concerned we know that unless that be previously done unless a whole bottle of madeira first be emptied down each clerical throat not the smallest legal affair can be carried through and to explain for the barring of future attachments that half of the peasants were dead And are they entered on the revision lists asked the secretary Yes replied Chichikov Then what are you boggling at continued the Secretary Should one soul die another will be born and in time grow up to take the first one s place Upon that there dawned on our hero one of the most inspired ideas which ever entered the human brain What a simpleton I am he thought to himself Here am I looking about for my mittens when all the time I have got them tucked into my belt Why were I myself to buy up a few souls which are dead to buy them before a new revision list shall have been made the Council of Public Trust might pay me two hundred roubles apiece for them and I might find myself with say a capital of two hundred thousand roubles The present moment is particularly propitious since in various parts of the country there has been an epidemic and glory be to God a large number of souls have died of it Nowadays landowners have taken to card playing and junketting and wasting their money or to joining the Civil Service in saint Petersburg consequently their estates are going to rack and ruin and being managed in any sort of fashion and succeeding in paying their dues with greater difficulty each year That being so not a man of the lot but would gladly surrender to me his dead souls rather than continue paying the poll tax and in this fashion I might make well not a few kopecks Of course there are difficulties and to avoid creating a scandal I should need to employ plenty of finesse but man was given his brain to USE not to neglect One good point about the scheme is that it will seem so improbable that in case of an accident no one in the world will believe in it True it is illegal to buy or mortgage peasants without land but I can easily pretend to be buying them only for transferment elsewhere Land is to be acquired in the provinces of Taurida and Kherson almost for nothing provided that one undertakes subsequently to colonise it so to Kherson I will transfer them and long may they live there And the removal of my dead souls shall be carried out in the strictest legal form and if the authorities should want confirmation by testimony I shall produce a letter signed by my own superintendent of the Khersonian rural police that is to say by myself Lastly the supposed village in Kherson shall be called Chichikovoe better still Pavlovskoe according to my Christian name In this fashion there germinated in our hero s brain that strange scheme for which the reader may or may not be grateful but for which the author certainly is so seeing that had it never occurred to Chichikov this story would never have seen the light After crossing himself according to the Russian custom Chichikov set about carrying out his enterprise On pretence of selecting a place wherein to settle he started forth to inspect various corners of the Russian Empire but more especially those which had suffered from such unfortunate accidents as failures of the harvest a high rate of mortality or whatsoever else might enable him to purchase souls at the lowest possible rate But he did not tackle his landowners haphazard he rather selected such of them as seemed more particularly suited to his taste or with whom he might with the least possible trouble conclude identical agreements though in the first instance he always tried by getting on terms of acquaintanceship better still of friendship with them to acquire the souls for nothing and so to avoid purchase at all In passing my readers must not blame me if the characters whom they have encountered in these pages have not been altogether to their liking The fault is Chichikov s rather than mine for he is the master and where he leads we must follow Also should my readers gird at me for a certain dimness and want of clarity in my principal characters and actors that will be tantamount to saying that never do the broad tendency and the general scope of a work become immediately apparent Similarly does the entry to every town the entry even to the Capital itself convey to the traveller such an impression of vagueness that at first everything looks grey and monotonous and the lines of smoky factories and workshops seem never to be coming to an end but in time there will begin also to stand out the outlines of six storied mansions and of shops and balconies and wide perspectives of streets and a medley of steeples columns statues and turrets the whole framed in rattle and roar and the infinite wonders which the hand and the brain of men have conceived Of the manner in which Chichikov s first purchases were made the reader is aware Subsequently he will see also how the affair progressed and with what success or failure our hero met and how Chichikov was called upon to decide and to overcome even more difficult problems than the foregoing and by what colossal forces the levers of his far flung tale are moved and how eventually the horizon will become extended until everything assumes a grandiose and a lyrical tendency Yes many a verst of road remains to be travelled by a party made up of an elderly gentleman a britchka of the kind affected by bachelors a valet named Petrushka a coachman named Selifan and three horses which from the Assessor to the skewbald are known to us individually by name Again although I have given a full description of our hero s exterior such as it is I may yet be asked for an inclusive definition also of his moral personality That he is no hero compounded of virtues and perfections must be already clear Then WHAT is he A villain Why should we call him a villain Why should we be so hard upon a fellow man In these days our villains have ceased to exist Rather it would be fairer to call him an ACQUIRER The love of acquisition the love of gain is a fault common to many and gives rise to many and many a transaction of the kind generally known as not strictly honourable True such a character contains an element of ugliness and the same reader who on his journey through life would sit at the board of a character of this kind and spend a most agreeable time with him would be the first to look at him askance if he should appear in the guise of the hero of a novel or a play But wise is the reader who on meeting such a character scans him carefully and instead of shrinking from him with distaste probes him to the springs of his being The human personality contains nothing which may not in the twinkling of an eye become altogether changed nothing in which before you can look round there may not spring to birth some cankerous worm which is destined to suck thence the essential juice Yes it is a common thing to see not only an overmastering passion but also a passion of the most petty order arise in a man who was born to better things and lead him both to forget his greatest and most sacred obligations and to see only in the veriest trifles the Great and the Holy For human passions are as numberless as is the sand of the seashore and go on to become his most insistent of masters Happy therefore the man who may choose from among the gamut of human passions one which is noble Hour by hour will that instinct grow and multiply in its measureless beneficence hour by hour will it sink deeper and deeper into the infinite paradise of his soul But there are passions of which a man cannot rid himself seeing that they are born with him at his birth and he has no power to abjure them Higher powers govern those passions and in them is something which will call to him and refuse to be silenced to the end of his life Yes whether in a guise of darkness or whether in a guise which will become converted into a light to lighten the world they will and must attain their consummation on life s field and in either case they have been evoked for man s good In the same way may the passion which drew our Chichikov onwards have been one that was independent of himself in the same way may there have lurked even in his cold essence something which will one day cause men to humble themselves in the dust before the infinite wisdom of God Yet that folk should be dissatisfied with my hero matters nothing What matters is the fact that under different circumstances their approval could have been taken as a foregone conclusion That is to say had not the author pried over deeply into Chichikov s soul nor stirred up in its depths what shunned and lay hidden from the light nor disclosed those of his hero s thoughts which that hero would have not have disclosed even to his most intimate friend had the author indeed exhibited Chichikov just as he exhibited himself to the townsmen of N and Manilov and the rest well then we may rest assured that every reader would have been delighted with him and have voted him a most interesting person For it is not nearly so necessary that Chichikov should figure before the reader as though his form and person were actually present to the eye as that on concluding a perusal of this work the reader should be able to return unharrowed in soul to that cult of the card table which is the solace and delight of all good Russians Yes readers of this book none of you really care to see humanity revealed in its nakedness Why should we do so you say What would be the use of it Do we not know for ourselves that human life contains much that is gross and contemptible Do we not with our own eyes have to look upon much that is anything but comforting Far better would it be if you would put before us what is comely and attractive so that we might forget ourselves a little In the same fashion does a landowner say to his bailiff Why do you come and tell me that the affairs of my estate are in a bad way I know that without YOUR help Have you nothing else to tell me Kindly allow me to forget the fact or else to remain in ignorance of it and I shall be much obliged to you Whereafter the said landowner probably proceeds to spend on his diversion the money which ought to have gone towards the rehabilitation of his affairs Possibly the author may also incur censure at the hands of those so called patriots who sit quietly in corners and become capitalists through making fortunes at the expense of others Yes let but something which they conceive to be derogatory to their country occur for instance let there be published some book which voices the bitter truth and out they will come from their hiding places like a spider which perceives a fly to be caught in its web Is it well to proclaim this to the world and to set folk talking about it they will cry What you have described touches US is OUR affair Is conduct of that kind right What will foreigners say Does any one care calmly to sit by and hear himself traduced Why should you lead foreigners to suppose that all is not well with us and that we are not patriotic Well to these sage remarks no answer can really be returned especially to such of the above as refer to foreign opinion But see here There once lived in a remote corner of Russia two natives of the region indicated One of those natives was a good man named Kifa Mokievitch and a man of kindly disposition a man who went through life in a dressing gown and paid no heed to his household for the reason that his whole being was centred upon the province of speculation and that in particular he was preoccupied with a philosophical problem usually stated by him thus A beast he would say is born naked Now why should that be Why should not a beast be born as a bird is born that is to say through the process of being hatched from an egg Nature is beyond the understanding however much one may probe her This was the substance of Kifa Mokievitch s reflections But herein is not the chief point The other of the pair was a fellow named Mofi Kifovitch and son to the first named He was what we Russians call a hero and while his father was pondering the parturition of beasts his the son s lusty twenty year old temperament was violently struggling for development Yet that son could tackle nothing without some accident occurring At one moment would he crack some one s fingers in half and at another would he raise a bump on somebody s nose so that both at home and abroad every one and everything from the serving maid to the yard dog fled on his approach and even the bed in his bedroom became shattered to splinters Such was Mofi Kifovitch and with it all he had a kindly soul But herein is not the chief point Good sir good Kifa Mokievitch servants and neighbours would come and say to the father what are you going to do about your Moki Kifovitch We get no rest from him he is so above himself That is only his play that is only his play the father would reply What else can you expect It is too late now to start a quarrel with him and moreover every one would accuse me of harshness True he is a little conceited but were I to reprove him in public the whole thing would become common talk and folk would begin giving him a dog s name And if they did that would not their opinion touch me also seeing that I am his father Also I am busy with philosophy and have no time for such things Lastly Moki Kifovitch is my son and very dear to my heart And beating his breast Kifa Mokievitch again asserted that even though his son should elect to continue his pranks it would not be for HIM for the father to proclaim the fact or to fall out with his offspring And this expression of paternal feeling uttered Kifa Mokievitch left Moki Kifovitch to his heroic exploits and himself returned to his beloved subject of speculation which now included also the problem Suppose elephants were to take to being hatched from eggs would not the shell of such eggs be of a thickness proof against cannonballs and necessitate the invention of some new type of firearm Thus at the end of this little story we have these two denizens of a peaceful corner of Russia looking thence as from a window in less terror of doing what was scandalous than of having it SAID of them that they were acting scandalously Yes the feeling animating our so called patriots is not true patriotism at all Something else lies beneath it Who if not an author is to speak aloud the truth Men like you my pseudo patriots stand in dread of the eye which is able to discern yet shrink from using your own and prefer rather to glance at everything unheedingly Yes after laughing heartily over Chichikov s misadventures and perhaps even commending the author for his dexterity of observation and pretty turn of wit you will look at yourselves with redoubled pride and a self satisfied smile and add Well we agree that in certain parts of the provinces there exists strange and ridiculous individuals as well as unconscionable rascals Yet which of you when quiet and alone and engaged in solitary self communion would not do well to probe YOUR OWN souls and to put to YOURSELVES the solemn question Is there not in ME an element of Chichikov For how should there not be Which of you is not liable at any moment to be passed in the street by an acquaintance who nudging his neighbour may say of you with a barely suppressed sneer Look there goes Chichikov That is Chichikov who has just gone by But here are we talking at the top of our voices whilst all the time our hero lies slumbering in his britchka Indeed his name has been repeated so often during the recital of his life s history that he must almost have heard us And at any time he is an irritable irascible fellow when spoken of with disrespect True to the reader Chichikov s displeasure cannot matter a jot but for the author it would mean ruin to quarrel with his hero seeing that arm in arm Chichikov and he have yet far to go Tut tut tut came in a shout from Chichikov Hi Selifan What is it came the reply uttered with a drawl What is it Why how dare you drive like that Come Bestir yourself a little And indeed Selifan had long been sitting with half closed eyes and hands which bestowed no encouragement upon his somnolent steeds save an occasional flicking of the reins against their flanks whilst Petrushka had lost his cap and was leaning backwards until his head had come to rest against Chichikov s knees a position which necessitated his being awakened with a cuff Selifan also roused himself and apportioned to the skewbald a few cuts across the back of a kind which at least had the effect of inciting that animal to trot and when presently the other two horses followed their companion s example the light britchka moved forwards like a piece of thistledown Selifan flourished his whip and shouted Hi hi as the inequalities of the road jerked him vertically on his seat and meanwhile reclining against the leather cushions of the vehicle s interior Chichikov smiled with gratification at the sensation of driving fast For what Russian does not love to drive fast Which of us does not at times yearn to give his horses their head and to let them go and to cry To the devil with the world At such moments a great force seems to uplift one as on wings and one flies and everything else flies but contrariwise both the verst stones and traders riding on the shafts of their waggons and the forest with dark lines of spruce and fir amid which may be heard the axe of the woodcutter and the croaking of the raven Yes out of a dim remote distance the road comes towards one and while nothing save the sky and the light clouds through which the moon is cleaving her way seem halted the brief glimpses wherein one can discern nothing clearly have in them a pervading touch of mystery Ah troika troika swift as a bird who was it first invented you Only among a hardy race of folk can you have come to birth only in a land which though poor and rough lies spread over half the world and spans versts the counting whereof would leave one with aching eyes Nor are you a modishly fashioned vehicle of the road a thing of clamps and iron Rather you are a vehicle but shapen and fitted with the axe or chisel of some handy peasant of Yaroslav Nor are you driven by a coachman clothed in German livery but by a man bearded and mittened See him as he mounts and flourishes his whip and breaks into a long drawn song Away like the wind go the horses and the wheels with their spokes become transparent circles and the road seems to quiver beneath them and a pedestrian with a cry of astonishment halts to watch the vehicle as it flies flies flies on its way until it becomes lost on the ultimate horizon a speck amid a cloud of dust And you Russia of mine are not you also speeding like a troika which nought can overtake Is not the road smoking beneath your wheels and the bridges thundering as you cross them and everything being left in the rear and the spectators struck with the portent halting to wonder whether you be not a thunderbolt launched from heaven What does that awe inspiring progress of yours foretell What is the unknown force which lies within your mysterious steeds Surely the winds themselves must abide in their manes and every vein in their bodies be an ear stretched to catch the celestial message which bids them with iron girded breasts and hooves which barely touch the earth as they gallop fly forward on a mission of God Whither then are you speeding O Russia of mine Whither Answer me But no answer comes only the weird sound of your collar bells Rent into a thousand shreds the air roars past you for you are overtaking the whole world and shall one day force all nations all empires to stand aside to give you way eighteen forty one PART II CHAPTER I Why do I so persistently paint the poverty the imperfections of Russian life and delve into the remotest depths the most retired holes and corners of our Empire for my subjects The answer is that there is nothing else to be done when an author s idiosyncrasy happens to incline him that way So again we find ourselves in a retired spot But what a spot Imagine if you can a mountain range like a gigantic fortress with embrasures and bastions which appear to soar a thousand versts towards the heights of heaven and towering grandly over a boundless expanse of plain are broken up into precipitous overhanging limestone cliffs Here and there those cliffs are seamed with water courses and gullies while at other points they are rounded off into spurs of green spurs now coated with fleece like tufts of young undergrowth now studded with the stumps of felled trees now covered with timber which has by some miracle escaped the woodman s axe Also a river winds awhile between its banks then leaves the meadow land divides into runlets all flashing in the sun like fire plunges re united into the midst of a thicket of elder birth and pine and lastly speeds triumphantly past bridges and mills and weirs which seem to be lying in wait for it at every turn At one particular spot the steep flank of the mountain range is covered with billowy verdure of denser growth than the rest and here the aid of skilful planting added to the shelter afforded by a rugged ravine has enabled the flora of north and south so to be brought together that twined about with sinuous hop tendrils the oak the spruce fir the wild pear the maple the cherry the thorn and the mountain ash either assist or check one another s growth and everywhere cover the declivity with their straggling profusion Also at the edge of the summit there can be seen mingling with the green of the trees the red roofs of a manorial homestead while behind the upper stories of the mansion proper and its carved balcony and a great semi circular window there gleam the tiles and gables of some peasants huts Lastly over this combination of trees and roofs there rises overtopping everything with its gilded sparkling steeple an old village church On each of its pinnacles a cross of carved gilt is stayed with supports of similar gilding and design with the result that from a distance the gilded portions have the effect of hanging without visible agency in the air And the whole the three successive tiers of woodland roofs and crosses whole lies exquisitely mirrored in the river below where hollow willows grotesquely shaped some of them rooted on the river s banks and some in the water itself and all drooping their branches until their leaves have formed a tangle with the water lilies which float on the surface seem to be gazing at the marvellous reflection at their feet Thus the view from below is beautiful indeed But the view from above is even better No guest no visitor could stand on the balcony of the mansion and remain indifferent So boundless is the panorama revealed that surprise would cause him to catch at his breath and exclaim Lord of Heaven but what a prospect Beyond meadows studded with spinneys and water mills lie forests belted with green while beyond again there can be seen showing through the slightly misty air strips of yellow heath and again wide rolling forests as blue as the sea or a cloud and more heath paler than the first but still yellow Finally on the far horizon a range of chalk topped hills gleams white even in dull weather as though it were lightened with perpetual sunshine and here and there on the dazzling whiteness of its lower slopes some plaster like nebulous patches represent far off villages which lie too remote for the eye to discern their details Indeed only when the sunlight touches a steeple to gold does one realise that each such patch is a human settlement Finally all is wrapped in an immensity of silence which even the far faint echoes of persons singing in the void of the plain cannot shatter Even after gazing at the spectacle for a couple of hours or so the visitor would still find nothing to say save Lord of Heaven but what a prospect Then who is the dweller in the proprietor of this manor a manor to which as to an impregnable fortress entrance cannot be gained from the side where we have been standing but only from the other approach where a few scattered oaks offer hospitable welcome to the visitor and then spreading above him their spacious branches as in friendly embrace accompany him to the facade of the mansion whose top we have been regarding from the reverse aspect but which now stands frontwise on to us and has on one side of it a row of peasants huts with red tiles and carved gables and on the other the village church with those glittering golden crosses and gilded open work charms which seem to hang suspended in the air Yes indeed to what fortunate individual does this corner of the world belong It belongs to Andrei Ivanovitch Tientietnikov landowner of the canton of Tremalakhan and withal a bachelor of about thirty Should my lady readers ask of me what manner of man is Tientietnikov and what are his attributes and peculiarities I should refer them to his neighbours Of these a member of the almost extinct tribe of intelligent staff officers on the retired list once summed up Tientietnikov in the phrase He is an absolute blockhead while a General who resided ten versts away was heard to remark that he is a young man who though not exactly a fool has at least too much crowded into his head I myself might have been of use to him for not only do I maintain certain connections with saint Petersburg but also And the General left his sentence unfinished Thirdly a captain superintendent of rural police happened to remark in the course of conversation To morrow I must go and see Tientietnikov about his arrears Lastly a peasant of Tientietnikov s own village when asked what his barin was like returned no answer at all All of which would appear to show that Tientietnikov was not exactly looked upon with favour To speak dispassionately however he was not a bad sort of fellow merely a star gazer and since the world contains many watchers of the skies why should Tientietnikov not have been one of them However let me describe in detail a specimen day of his existence one that will closely resemble the rest and then the reader will be enabled to judge of Tientietnikov s character and how far his life corresponded to the beauties of nature with which he lived surrounded On the morning of the specimen day in question he awoke very late and raising himself to a sitting posture rubbed his eyes And since those eyes were small the process of rubbing them occupied a very long time and throughout its continuance there stood waiting by the door his valet Mikhailo armed with a towel and basin For one hour for two hours did poor Mikhailo stand there then he departed to the kitchen and returned to find his master still rubbing his eyes as he sat on the bed At length however Tientietnikov rose washed himself donned a dressing gown and moved into the drawing room for morning tea coffee cocoa and warm milk of all of which he partook but sparingly while munching a piece of bread and scattering tobacco ash with complete insouciance Two hours did he sit over this meal then poured himself out another cup of the rapidly cooling tea and walked to the window This faced the courtyard and outside it as usual there took place the following daily altercation between a serf named Grigory who purported to act as butler and the housekeeper Perfilievna Grigory Ah you nuisance you good for nothing you had better hold your stupid tongue Perfilievna Yes and don t you wish that I would Grigory What You so thick with that bailiff of yours you housekeeping jade Perfilievna Nay he is as big a thief as you are Do you think the barin doesn t know you And there he is He must have heard everything Grigory Where Perfilievna There sitting by the window and looking at us Next to complete the hubbub a serf child which had been clouted by its mother broke out into a bawl while a borzoi puppy which had happened to get splashed with boiling water by the cook fell to yelping vociferously In short the place soon became a babel of shouts and squeals and after watching and listening for a time the barin found it so impossible to concentrate his mind upon anything that he sent out word that the noise would have to be abated The next item was that a couple of hours before luncheon time he withdrew to his study to set about employing himself upon a weighty work which was to consider Russia from every point of view from the political from the philosophical and from the religious as well as to resolve various problems which had arisen to confront the Empire and to define clearly the great future to which the country stood ordained In short it was to be the species of compilation in which the man of the day so much delights Yet the colossal undertaking had progressed but little beyond the sphere of projection since after a pen had been gnawed awhile and a few strokes had been committed to paper the whole would be laid aside in favour of the reading of some book and that reading would continue also during luncheon and be followed by the lighting of a pipe the playing of a solitary game of chess and the doing of more or less nothing for the rest of the day The foregoing will give the reader a pretty clear idea of the manner in which it was possible for this man of thirty three to waste his time Clad constantly in slippers and a dressing gown Tientietnikov never went out never indulged in any form of dissipation and never walked upstairs Nothing did he care for fresh air and would bestow not a passing glance upon all those beauties of the countryside which moved visitors to such ecstatic admiration From this the reader will see that Andrei Ivanovitch Tientietnikov belonged to that band of sluggards whom we always have with us and who whatever be their present appellation used to be known by the nicknames of lollopers bed pressers and marmots Whether the type is a type originating at birth or a type resulting from untoward circumstances in later life it is impossible to say A better course than to attempt to answer that question would be to recount the story of Tientietnikov s boyhood and upbringing Everything connected with the latter seemed to promise success for at twelve years of age the boy keen witted but dreamy of temperament and inclined to delicacy was sent to an educational establishment presided over by an exceptional type of master The idol of his pupils and the admiration of his assistants Alexander Petrovitch was gifted with an extraordinary measure of good sense How thoroughly he knew the peculiarities of the Russian of his day How well he understood boys How capable he was of drawing them out Not a practical joker in the school but after perpetrating a prank would voluntarily approach his preceptor and make to him free confession True the preceptor would put a stern face upon the matter yet the culprit would depart with head held higher not lower than before since in Alexander Petrovitch there was something which heartened something which seemed to say to a delinquent Forward you Rise to your feet again even though you have fallen Not lectures on good behaviour was it therefore that fell from his lips but rather the injunction I want to see intelligence and nothing else The boy who devotes his attention to becoming clever will never play the fool for under such circumstances folly disappears of itself And so folly did for the boy who failed to strive in the desired direction incurred the contempt of all his comrades and even dunces and fools of senior standing did not dare to raise a finger when saluted by their juniors with opprobrious epithets Yet This is too much certain folk would say to Alexander The result will be that your students will turn out prigs But no he would reply Not at all You see I make it my principle to keep the incapables for a single term only since that is enough for them but to the clever ones I allot a double course of instruction And true enough any lad of brains was retained for this finishing course Yet he did not repress all boyish playfulness since he declared it to be as necessary as a rash to a doctor inasmuch as it enabled him to diagnose what lay hidden within Consequently how the boys loved him Never was there such an attachment between master and pupils And even later during the foolish years when foolish things attract the measure of affection which Alexander Petrovitch retained was extraordinary In fact to the day of his death every former pupil would celebrate the birthday of his late master by raising his glass in gratitude to the mentor dead and buried then close his eyelids upon the tears which would come trickling through them Even the slightest word of encouragement from Alexander Petrovitch could throw a lad into a transport of tremulous joy and arouse in him an honourable emulation of his fellows Boys of small capacity he did not long retain in his establishment whereas those who possessed exceptional talent he put through an extra course of schooling This senior class a class composed of specially selected pupils was a very different affair from what usually obtains in other colleges Only when a boy had attained its ranks did Alexander demand of him what other masters indiscreetly require of mere infants namely the superior frame of mind which while never indulging in mockery can itself bear ridicule and disregard the fool and keep its temper and repress itself and eschew revenge and calmly proudly retain its tranquillity of soul In short whatever avails to form a boy into a man of assured character that did Alexander Petrovitch employ during the pupil s youth as well as constantly put him to the test How well he understood the art of life Of assistant tutors he kept but few since most of the necessary instruction he imparted in person and without pedantic terminology and inflated diction and views could so transmit to his listeners the inmost spirit of a lesson that even the youngest present absorbed its essential elements Also of studies he selected none but those which may help a boy to become a good citizen and therefore most of the lectures which he delivered consisted of discourses on what may be awaiting a youth as well as of such demarcations of life s field that the pupil though seated as yet only at the desk could beforehand bear his part in that field both in thought and spirit Nor did the master CONCEAL anything That is to say without mincing words he invariably set before his hearers the sorrows and the difficulties which may confront a man the trials and the temptations which may beset him And this he did in terms as though in every possible calling and capacity he himself had experienced the same Consequently either the vigorous development of self respect or the constant stimulus of the master s eye which seemed to say to the pupil Forward that word which has become so familiar to the contemporary Russian that word which has worked such wonders upon his sensitive temperament one or the other I repeat would from the first cause the pupil to tackle difficulties and only difficulties and to hunger for prowess only where the path was arduous and obstacles were many and it was necessary to display the utmost strength of mind Indeed few completed the course of which I have spoken without issuing therefrom reliable seasoned fighters who could keep their heads in the most embarrassing of official positions and at times when older and wiser men distracted with the annoyances of life had either abandoned everything or grown slack and indifferent had surrendered to the bribe takers and the rascals In short no ex pupil of Alexander Petrovitch ever wavered from the right road but familiar with life and with men armed with the weapons of prudence exerted a powerful influence upon wrongdoers For a long time past the ardent young Tientietnikov s excitable heart had also beat at the thought that one day he might attain the senior class described And indeed what better teacher could he have had befall him than its preceptor Yet just at the moment when he had been transferred thereto just at the moment when he had reached the coveted position did his instructor come suddenly by his death This was indeed a blow for the boy indeed a terrible initial loss In his eyes everything connected with the school seemed to undergo a change the chief reason being the fact that to the place of the deceased headmaster there succeeded a certain Thedor Ivanovitch who at once began to insist upon certain external rules and to demand of the boys what ought rightly to have been demanded only of adults That is to say since the lads frank and open demeanour savoured to him only of lack of discipline he announced as though in deliberate spite of his predecessor that he cared nothing for progress and intellect but that heed was to be paid only to good behaviour Yet curiously enough good behaviour was just what he never obtained for every kind of secret prank became the rule and while by day there reigned restraint and conspiracy by night there began to take place chambering and wantonness Also certain changes in the curriculum of studies came about for there were engaged new teachers who held new views and opinions and confused their hearers with a multitude of new terms and phrases and displayed in their exposition of things both logical sequence and a zest for modern discovery and much warmth of individual bias Yet their instruction alas contained no LIFE in the mouths of those teachers a dead language savoured merely of carrion Thus everything connected with the school underwent a radical alteration and respect for authority and the authorities waned and tutors and ushers came to be dubbed Old Thedor Crusty and the like And sundry other things began to take place things which necessitated many a penalty and expulsion until within a couple of years no one who had known the school in former days would now have recognised it Nevertheless Tientietnikov a youth of retiring disposition experienced no leanings towards the nocturnal orgies of his companions orgies during which the latter used to flirt with damsels before the very windows of the headmaster s rooms nor yet towards their mockery of all that was sacred simply because fate had cast in their way an injudicious priest No despite its dreaminess his soul ever remembered its celestial origin and could not be diverted from the path of virtue Yet still he hung his head for while his ambition had come to life it could find no sort of outlet Truly twere well if it had NOT come to life for throughout the time that he was listening to professors who gesticulated on their chairs he could not help remembering the old preceptor who invariably cool and calm had yet known how to make himself understood To what subjects to what lectures did the boy not have to listen to lectures on medicine and on philosophy and on law and on a version of general history so enlarged that even three years failed to enable the professor to do more than finish the introduction thereto and also the account of the development of some self governing towns in Germany None of the stuff remained fixed in Tientietnikov s brain save as shapeless clots for though his native intellect could not tell him how instruction ought to be imparted it at least told him that THIS was not the way And frequently at such moments he would recall Alexander Petrovitch and give way to such grief that scarcely did he know what he was doing But youth is fortunate in the fact that always before it there lies a future and in proportion as the time for his leaving school drew nigh Tientietnikov s heart began to beat higher and higher and he said to himself This is not life but only a preparation for life True life is to be found in the Public Service There at least will there be scope for activity So bestowing not a glance upon that beautiful corner of the world which never failed to strike the guest or chance visitor with amazement and reverencing not a whit the dust of his ancestors he followed the example of most ambitious men of his class by repairing to saint Petersburg whither as we know the more spirited youth of Russia from every quarter gravitates there to enter the Public Service to shine to obtain promotion and in a word to scale the topmost peaks of that pale cold deceptive elevation which is known as society But the real starting point of Tientietnikov s ambition was the moment when his uncle one State Councillor Onifri Ivanovitch instilled into him the maxim that the only means to success in the Service lay in good handwriting and that without that accomplishment no one could ever hope to become a Minister or Statesman Thus with great difficulty and also with the help of his uncle s influence young Tientietnikov at length succeeded in being posted to a Department On the day that he was conducted into a splendid shining hall a hall fitted with inlaid floors and lacquered desks as fine as though this were actually the place where the great ones of the Empire met for discussion of the fortunes of the State on the day that he saw legions of handsome gentlemen of the quill driving profession making loud scratchings with pens and cocking their heads to one side lastly on the day that he saw himself also allotted a desk and requested to copy a document which appeared purposely to be one of the pettiest possible order as a matter of fact it related to a sum of three roubles and had taken half a year to produce well at that moment a curious an unwonted sensation seized upon the inexperienced youth for the gentlemen around him appeared so exactly like a lot of college students And the further to complete the resemblance some of them were engaged in reading trashy translated novels which they kept hurriedly thrusting between the sheets of their apportioned work whenever the Director appeared as though to convey the impression that it was to that work alone that they were applying themselves In short the scene seemed to Tientietnikov strange and his former pursuits more important than his present and his preparation for the Service preferable to the Service itself Yes suddenly he felt a longing for his old school and as suddenly and with all the vividness of life there appeared before his vision the figure of Alexander Petrovitch He almost burst into tears as he beheld his old master and the room seemed to swim before his eyes and the tchinovniks and the desks to become a blur and his sight to grow dim Then he thought to himself with an effort No no I WILL apply myself to my work however petty it be at first And hardening his heart and recovering his spirit he determined then and there to perform his duties in such a manner as should be an example to the rest But where are compensations to be found Even in saint Petersburg despite its grim and murky exterior they exist Yes even though thirty degrees of keen cracking frost may have bound the streets and the family of the North Wind be wailing there and the Snowstorm Witch have heaped high the pavements and be blinding the eyes and powdering beards and fur collars and the shaggy manes of horses even THEN there will be shining hospitably through the swirling snowflakes a fourth floor window where in a cosy room and by the light of modest candles and to the hiss of the samovar there will be in progress a discussion which warms the heart and soul or else a reading aloud of a brilliant page of one of those inspired Russian poets with whom God has dowered us while the breast of each member of the company is heaving with a rapture unknown under a noontide sky Gradually therefore Tientietnikov grew more at home in the Service Yet never did it become for him the main pursuit the main object in life which he had expected No it remained but one of a secondary kind That is to say it served merely to divide up his time and enable him the more to value his hours of leisure Nevertheless just when his uncle was beginning to flatter himself that his nephew was destined to succeed in the profession the said nephew elected to ruin his every hope Thus it befell Tientietnikov s friends he had many included among their number a couple of fellows of the species known as embittered That is to say though good natured souls of that curiously restless type which cannot endure injustice nor anything which it conceives to be such they were thoroughly unbalanced of conduct themselves and while demanding general agreement with their views treated those of others with the scantiest of ceremony Nevertheless these two associates exercised upon Tientietnikov both by the fire of their eloquence and by the form of their noble dissatisfaction with society a very strong influence with the result that through arousing in him an innate tendency to nervous resentment they led him also to notice trifles which before had escaped his attention An instance of this is seen in the fact that he conceived against Thedor Thedorovitch Lienitsin Director of one of the Departments which was quartered in the splendid range of offices before mentioned a dislike which proved the cause of his discerning n the man a host of hitherto unmarked imperfections Above all things did Tientietnikov take it into his head that when conversing with his superiors Lienitsin became of the moment a stick of luscious sweetmeat but that when conversing with his inferiors he approximated more to a vinegar cruet Certain it is that like all petty minded individuals Lienitsin made a note of any one who failed to offer him a greeting on festival days and that he revenged himself upon any one whose visiting card had not been handed to his butler Eventually the youth s aversion almost attained the point of hysteria until he felt that come what might he MUST insult the fellow in some fashion To that task he applied himself con amore and so thoroughly that he met with complete success That is to say he seized on an occasion to address Lienitsin in such fashion that the delinquent received notice either to apologies or to leave the Service and when of these alternatives he chose the latter his uncle came to him and made a terrified appeal For God s sake remember what you are doing he cried To think that after beginning your career so well you should abandon it merely for the reason that you have not fallen in with the sort of Director whom you prefer What do you mean by it what do you mean by it Were others to regard things in the same way the Service would find itself without a single individual Reconsider your conduct forego your pride and conceit and make Lienitsin amends But dear Uncle the nephew replied that is not the point The point is not that I should find an apology difficult to offer seeing that since Lienitsin is my superior and I ought not to have addressed him as I did I am clearly in the wrong Rather the point is the following To my charge there has been committed the performance of another kind of service That is to say I am the owner of three hundred peasant souls a badly administered estate and a fool of a bailiff That being so whereas the State will lose little by having to fill my stool with another copyist it will lose very much by causing three hundred peasant souls to fail in the payment of their taxes As I say how am I to put it I am a landowner who has preferred to enter the Public Service Now should I employ myself henceforth in conserving restoring and improving the fortunes of the souls whom God has entrusted to my care and thereby provide the State with three hundred law abiding sober hard working taxpayers how will that service of mine rank as inferior to the service of a department directing fool like Lienitsin On hearing this speech the State Councillor could only gape for he had not expected Tientietnikov s torrent of words He reflected a few moments and then murmured Yes but but but how can a man like you retire to rustication in the country What society will you get there Here one meets at least a general or a prince sometimes indeed no matter whom you pass in the street that person represents gas lamps and European civilisation but in the country no matter what part of it you are in not a soul is to be encountered save muzhiks and their women Why should you go and condemn yourself to a state of vegetation like that Nevertheless the uncle s expostulations fell upon deaf ears for already the nephew was beginning to think of his estate as a retreat of a type more likely to nourish the intellectual faculties and afford the only profitable field of activity After unearthing one or two modern works on agriculture therefore he two weeks later found himself in the neighbourhood of the home where his boyhood had been spent and approaching the spot which never failed to enthral the visitor or guest And in the young man s breast there was beginning to palpitate a new feeling in the young man s soul there were reawakening old long concealed impressions with the result that many a spot which had long been faded from his memory now filled him with interest and the beautiful views on the estate found him gazing at them like a newcomer and with a beating heart Yes as the road wound through a narrow ravine and became engulfed in a forest where both above and below he saw three centuries old oaks which three men could not have spanned and where Siberian firs and elms overtopped even the poplars and as he asked the peasants to tell him to whom the forest belonged and they replied To Tientietnikov and he issued from the forest and proceeded on his way through meadows and past spinneys of elder and of old and young willows and arrived in sight of the distant range of hills and crossing by two different bridges the winding river which he left successively to right and to left of him as he did so he again questioned some peasants concerning the ownership of the meadows and the flooded lands and was again informed that they all belonged to Tientietnikov and then ascending a rise reached a tableland where on one side lay ungarnered fields of wheat and rye and barley and on the other the country already traversed but which now showed in shortened perspective and then plunged into the shade of some forked umbrageous trees which stood scattered over turf and extended to the manor house itself and caught glimpses of the carved huts of the peasants and of the red roofs of the stone manorial outbuildings and of the glittering pinnacles of the church and felt his heart beating and knew without being told by any one whither he had at length arrived well then the feeling which had been growing within his soul burst forth and he cried in ecstasy Why have I been a fool so long Why seeing that fate has appointed me to be ruler of an earthly paradise did I prefer to bind myself in servitude as a scribe of lifeless documents To think that after I had been nurtured and schooled and stored with all the knowledge necessary for the diffusion of good among those under me and for the improvement of my domain and for the fulfilment of the manifold duties of a landowner who is at once judge administrator and constable of his people I should have entrusted my estate to an ignorant bailiff and sought to maintain an absentee guardianship over the affairs of serfs whom I have never met and of whose capabilities and characters I am yet ignorant To think that I should have deemed true estate management inferior to a documentary fantastical management of provinces which lie a thousand versts away and which my foot has never trod and where I could never have effected aught but blunders and irregularities Meanwhile another spectacle was being prepared for him On learning that the barin was approaching the mansion the muzhiks collected on the verandah in very variety of picturesque dress and tonsure and when these good folk surrounded him and there arose a resounding shout of Here is our Foster Father He has remembered us and in spite of themselves some of the older men and women began weeping as they recalled his grandfather and great grandfather he himself could not restrain his tears but reflected How much affection And in return for what In return for my never having come to see them in return for my never having taken the least interest in their affairs And then and there he registered a mental vow to share their every task and occupation So he applied himself to supervising and administering He reduced the amount of the barstchina forty he decreased the number of working days for the owner and he augmented the sum of the peasants leisure time He also dismissed the fool of a bailiff and took to bearing a personal hand in everything to being present in the fields at the threshing floor at the kilns at the wharf at the freighting of barges and rafts and at their conveyance down the river wherefore even the lazy hands began to look to themselves But this did not last long The peasant is an observant individual and Tientietnikov s muzhiks soon scented the fact that though energetic and desirous of doing much the barin had no notion how to do it nor even how to set about it that in short he spoke by the book rather than out of his personal knowledge Consequently things resulted not in master and men failing to understand one another but in their not singing together in their not producing the very same note That is to say it was not long before Tientietnikov noticed that on the manorial lands nothing prospered to the extent that it did on the peasants The manorial crops were sown in good time and came up well and every one appeared to work his best so much so that Tientietnikov who supervised the whole frequently ordered mugs of vodka to be served out as a reward for the excellence of the labour performed Yet the rye on the peasants land had formed into ear and the oats had begun to shoot their grain and the millet had filled before on the manorial lands the corn had so much as grown to stalk or the ears had sprouted in embryo In short gradually the barin realised that in spite of favours conferred the peasants were playing the rogue with him Next he resorted to remonstrance but was met with the reply How could we not do our best for our barin You yourself saw how well we laboured at the ploughing and the sowing for you gave us mugs of vodka for our pains Then why have things turned out so badly the barin persisted Who can say It must be that a grub has eaten the crop from below Besides what a summer has it been never a drop of rain Nevertheless the barin noted that no grub had eaten the PEASANTS crops as well as that the rain had fallen in the most curious fashion namely in patches It had obliged the muzhiks but had shed a mere sprinkling for the barin Still more difficult did he find it to deal with the peasant women Ever and anon they would beg to be excused from work or start making complaints of the severity of the barstchina Indeed they were terrible folk However Tientietnikov abolished the majority of the tithes of linen hedge fruit mushrooms and nuts and also reduced by one half other tasks proper to the women in the hope that they would devote their spare time to their own domestic concerns namely to sewing and mending and to making clothes for their husbands and to increasing the area of their kitchen gardens Yet no such result came about On the contrary such a pitch did the idleness the quarrelsomeness and the intriguing and caballing of the fair sex attain that their helpmeets were for ever coming to the barin with a request that he would rid one or another of his wife since she had become a nuisance and to live with her was impossible Next hardening his heart the barin attempted severity But of what avail was severity The peasant woman remained always the peasant woman and would come and whine that she was sick and ailing and keep pitifully hugging to herself the mean and filthy rags which she had donned for the occasion And when poor Tientietnikov found himself unable to say more to her than just Get out of my sight and may the Lord go with you the next item in the comedy would be that he would see her even as she was leaving his gates fall to contending with a neighbour for say the possession of a turnip and dealing out slaps in the face such as even a strong healthy man could scarcely have compassed Again amongst other things Tientietnikov conceived the idea of establishing a school for his people but the scheme resulted in a farce which left him in sackcloth and ashes In the same way he found that when it came to a question of dispensing justice and of adjusting disputes the host of juridical subtleties with which the professors had provided him proved absolutely useless That is to say the one party lied and the other party lied and only the devil could have decided between them Consequently he himself perceived that a knowledge of mankind would have availed him more than all the legal refinements and philosophical maxims in the world could do He lacked something and though he could not divine what it was the situation brought about was the common one of the barin failing to understand the peasant and the peasant failing to understand the barin and both becoming disaffected In the end these difficulties so chilled Tientietnikov s enthusiasm that he took to supervising the labours of the field with greatly diminished attention That is to say no matter whether the scythes were softly swishing through the grass or ricks were being built or rafts were being loaded he would allow his eyes to wander from his men and to fall to gazing at say a red billed red legged heron which after strutting along the bank of a stream would have caught a fish in its beak and be holding it awhile as though in doubt whether to swallow it Next he would glance towards the spot where a similar bird but one not yet in possession of a fish was engaged in watching the doings of its mate Lastly with eyebrows knitted and face turned to scan the zenith he would drink in the smell of the fields and fall to listening to the winged population of the air as from earth and sky alike the manifold music of winged creatures combined in a single harmonious chorus In the rye the quail would be calling and in the grass the corncrake and over them would be wheeling flocks of twittering linnets Also the jacksnipe would be uttering its croak and the lark executing its roulades where it had become lost in the sunshine and cranes sending forth their trumpet like challenge as they deployed towards the zenith in triangle shaped flocks In fact the neighbourhood would seem to have become converted into one great concert of melody O Creator how fair is Thy world where in remote rural seclusion it lies apart from cities and from highways But soon even this began to pall upon Tientietnikov and he ceased altogether to visit his fields or to do aught but shut himself up in his rooms where he refused to receive even the bailiff when that functionary called with his reports Again although until now he had to a certain extent associated with a retired colonel of hussars a man saturated with tobacco smoke and also with a student of pronounced but immature opinions who culled the bulk of his wisdom from contemporary newspapers and pamphlets he found as time went on that these companions proved as tedious as the rest and came to think their conversation superficial and their European method of comporting themselves that is to say the method of conversing with much slapping of knees and a great deal of bowing and gesticulation too direct and unadorned So these and every one else he decided to drop and carried this resolution into effect with a certain amount of rudeness On the next occasion that Varvar Nikolaievitch Vishnepokromov called to indulge in a free and easy symposium on politics philosophy literature morals and the state of financial affairs in England he was in all matters which admit of superficial discussion the pleasantest fellow alive seeing that he was a typical representative both of the retired fire eater and of the school of thought which is now becoming the rage when I say this next happened Tientietnikov merely sent out to say that he was not at home and then carefully showed himself at the window Host and guest exchanged glances and while the one muttered through his teeth The cur the other relieved his feelings with a remark or two on swine Thus the acquaintance came to an abrupt end and from that time forth no visitor called at the mansion Tientietnikov in no way regretted this for he could now devote himself wholly to the projection of a great work on Russia Of the scale on which this composition was conceived the reader is already aware The reader also knows how strange how unsystematic was the system employed in it Yet to say that Tientietnikov never awoke from his lethargy would not be altogether true On the contrary when the post brought him newspapers and reviews and he saw in their printed pages perhaps the well known name of some former comrade who had succeeded in the great field of Public Service or had conferred upon science and the world s work some notable contribution he would succumb to secret and suppressed grief and involuntarily there would burst from his soul an expression of aching voiceless regret that he himself had done so little And at these times his existence would seem to him odious and repellent at these times there would uprise before him the memory of his school days and the figure of Alexander Petrovitch as vivid as in life And slowly welling the tears would course over Tientietnikov s cheeks What meant these repinings Was there not disclosed in them the secret of his galling spiritual pain the fact that he had failed to order his life aright to confirm the lofty aims with which he had started his course the fact that always poorly equipped with experience he had failed to attain the better and the higher state and there to strengthen himself for the overcoming of hindrances and obstacles the fact that dissolving like overheated metal his bounteous store of superior instincts had failed to take the final tempering the fact that the tutor of his boyhood a man in a thousand had prematurely died and left to Tientietnikov no one who could restore to him the moral strength shattered by vacillation and the will power weakened by want of virility no one in short who could cry hearteningly to his soul Forward the word for which the Russian of every degree of every class of every occupation of every school of thought is for ever hungering Indeed WHERE is the man who can cry aloud for any of us in the Russian tongue dear to our soul the all compelling command Forward Who is there who knowing the strength and the nature and the inmost depths of the Russian genius can by a single magic incantation divert our ideals to the higher life Were there such a man with what tears with what affection would not the grateful sons of Russia repay him Yet age succeeds to age and our callow youth still lies wrapped in shameful sloth or strives and struggles to no purpose God has not yet given us the man able to sound the call One circumstance which almost aroused Tientietnikov which almost brought about a revolution in his character was the fact that he came very near to falling in love Yet even this resulted in nothing Ten versts away there lived the general whom we have heard expressing himself in highly uncomplimentary terms concerning Tientietnikov He maintained a General like establishment dispensed hospitality that is to say was glad when his neighbours came to pay him their respects though he himself never went out spoke always in a hoarse voice read a certain number of books and had a daughter a curious unfamiliar type but full of life as life itself This maiden s name was Ulinka and she had been strangely brought up for losing her mother in early childhood she had subsequently received instruction at the hands of an English governess who knew not a single word of Russian Moreover her father though excessively fond of her treated her always as a toy with the result that as she grew to years of discretion she became wholly wayward and spoilt Indeed had any one seen the sudden rage which would gather on her beautiful young forehead when she was engaged in a heated dispute with her father he would have thought her one of the most capricious beings in the world Yet that rage gathered only when she had heard of injustice or harsh treatment and never because she desired to argue on her own behalf or to attempt to justify her own conduct Also that anger would disappear as soon as ever she saw any one whom she had formerly disliked fall upon evil times and at his first request for alms would without consideration or subsequent regret hand him her purse and its whole contents Yes her every act was strenuous and when she spoke her whole personality seemed to be following hot foot upon her thought both her expression of face and her diction and the movements of her hands Nay the very folds of her frock had a similar appearance of striving until one would have thought that all her self were flying in pursuit of her words Nor did she know reticence before any one she would disclose her mind and no force could compel her to maintain silence when she desired to speak Also her enchanting peculiar gait a gait which belonged to her alone was so absolutely free and unfettered that every one involuntarily gave her way Lastly in her presence churls seemed to become confused and fall to silence and even the roughest and most outspoken would lose their heads and have not a word to say whereas the shy man would find himself able to converse as never in his life before and would feel from the first as though he had seen her and known her at some previous period during the days of some unremembered childhood when he was at home and spending a merry evening among a crowd of romping children And for long afterwards he would feel as though his man s intellect and estate were a burden This was what now befell Tientietnikov and as it did so a new feeling entered into his soul and his dreamy life lightened for a moment At first the General used to receive him with hospitable civility but permanent concord between them proved impossible their conversation always merged into dissension and soreness seeing that while the General could not bear to be contradicted or worsted in an argument Tientietnikov was a man of extreme sensitiveness True for the daughter s sake the father was for a while deferred to and thus peace was maintained but this lasted only until the time when there arrived on a visit to the General two kinswomen of his the Countess Bordirev and the Princess Uziakin retired Court dames but ladies who still kept up a certain connection with Court circles and therefore were much fawned upon by their host No sooner had they appeared on the scene than so it seemed to Tientietnikov the General s attitude towards the young man became colder either he ceased to notice him at all or he spoke to him familiarly and as to a person having no standing in society This offended Tientietnikov deeply and though when at length he spoke out on the subject he retained sufficient presence of mind to compress his lips and to preserve a gentle and courteous tone his face flushed and his inner man was boiling General he said I thank you for your condescension By addressing me in the second person singular you have admitted me to the circle of your most intimate friends Indeed were it not that a difference of years forbids any familiarity on my part I should answer you in similar fashion The General sat aghast At length rallying his tongue and his faculties he replied that though he had spoken with a lack of ceremony he had used the term thou merely as an elderly man naturally employs it towards a junior he made no reference to difference of rank Nevertheless the acquaintance broke off here and with it any possibility of love making The light which had shed a momentary gleam before Tientietnikov s eyes had become extinguished for ever and upon it there followed a darkness denser than before Henceforth everything conduced to evolve the regime which the reader has noted that regime of sloth and inaction which converted Tientietnikov s residence into a place of dirt and neglect For days at a time would a broom and a heap of dust be left lying in the middle of a room and trousers tossing about the salon and pairs of worn out braces adorning the what not near the sofa In short so mean and untidy did Tientietnikov s mode of life become that not only his servants but even his very poultry ceased to treat him with respect Taking up a pen he would spend hours in idly sketching houses huts waggons troikas and flourishes on a piece of paper while at other times when he had sunk into a reverie the pen would all unknowingly sketch a small head which had delicate features a pair of quick penetrating eyes and a raised coiffure Then suddenly the dreamer would perceive to his surprise that the pen had executed the portrait of a maiden whose picture no artist could adequately have painted and therewith his despondency would become greater than ever and believing that happiness did not exist on earth he would relapse into increased ennui increased neglect of his responsibilities But one morning he noticed on moving to the window after breakfast that not a word was proceeding either from the butler or the housekeeper but that on the contrary the courtyard seemed to smack of a certain bustle and excitement This was because through the entrance gates which the kitchen maid and the scullion had run to open there were appearing the noses of three horses one to the right one in the middle and one to the left after the fashion of triumphal groups of statuary Above them on the box seat were seated a coachman and a valet while behind again there could be discerned a gentleman in a scarf and a fur cap Only when the equipage had entered the courtyard did it stand revealed as a light spring britchka And as it came to a halt there leapt on to the verandah of the mansion an individual of respectable exterior and possessed of the art of moving with the neatness and alertness of a military man Upon this Tientietnikov s heart stood still He was unused to receiving visitors and for the moment conceived the new arrival to be a Government official sent to question him concerning an abortive society to which he had formerly belonged Here the author may interpolate the fact that in Tientietnikov s early days the young man had become mixed up in a very absurd affair That is to say a couple of philosophers belonging to a regiment of hussars had together with an aesthete who had not yet completed his student s course and a gambler who had squandered his all formed a secret society of philanthropic aims under the presidency of a certain old rascal of a freemason and the ruined gambler aforesaid The scope of the society s work was to be extensive it was to bring lasting happiness to humanity at large from the banks of the Thames to the shores of Kamtchatka But for this much money was needed wherefore from the noble minded members of the society generous contributions were demanded and then forwarded to a destination known only to the supreme authorities of the concern As for Tientietnikov s adhesion it was brought about by the two friends already alluded to as embittered good hearted souls whom the wear and tear of their efforts on behalf of science civilisation and the future emancipation of mankind had ended by converting into confirmed drunkards Perhaps it need hardly be said that Tientietnikov soon discovered how things stood and withdrew from the association but meanwhile the latter had had the misfortune so to have engaged in dealings not wholly creditable to gentlemen of noble origin as likewise to have become entangled in dealings with the police Consequently it is not to be wondered at that though Tientietnikov had long severed his connection with the society and its policy he still remained uneasy in his mind as to what might even yet be the result However his fears vanished the instant that the guest saluted him with marked politeness and explained with many deferential poises of the head and in terms at once civil and concise that for some time past he the newcomer had been touring the Russian Empire on business and in the pursuit of knowledge that the Empire abounded in objects of interest not to mention a plenitude of manufactures and a great diversity of soil and that in spite of the fact that he was greatly struck with the amenities of his host s domain he would certainly not have presumed to intrude at such an inconvenient hour but for the circumstance that the inclement spring weather added to the state of the roads had necessitated sundry repairs to his carriage at the hands of wheelwrights and blacksmiths Finally he declared that even if this last had NOT happened he would still have felt unable to deny himself the pleasure of offering to his host that meed of homage which was the latter s due This speech a speech of fascinating bonhomie delivered the guest executed a sort of shuffle with a half boot of patent leather studded with buttons of mother of pearl and followed that up by in spite of his pronounced rotundity of figure stepping backwards with all the elan of an india rubber ball From this the somewhat reassured Tientietnikov concluded that his visitor must be a literary knowledge seeking professor who was engaged in roaming the country in search of botanical specimens and fossils wherefore he hastened to express both his readiness to further the visitor s objects whatever they might be and his personal willingness to provide him with the requisite wheelwrights and blacksmiths Meanwhile he begged his guest to consider himself at home and after seating him in an armchair made preparations to listen to the newcomer s discourse on natural history But the newcomer applied himself rather to phenomena of the internal world saying that his life might be likened to a barque tossed on the crests of perfidious billows that in his time he had been fated to play many parts and that on more than one occasion his life had stood in danger at the hands of foes At the same time these tidings were communicated in a manner calculated to show that the speaker was also a man of PRACTICAL capabilities In conclusion the visitor took out a cambric pocket handkerchief and sneezed into it with a vehemence wholly new to Tientietnikov s experience In fact the sneeze rather resembled the note which at times the trombone of an orchestra appears to utter not so much from its proper place on the platform as from the immediate neighbourhood of the listener s ear And as the echoes of the drowsy mansion resounded to the report of the explosion there followed upon the same a wave of perfume skilfully wafted abroad with a flourish of the eau de Cologne scented handkerchief By this time the reader will have guessed that the visitor was none other than our old and respected friend Paul Ivanovitch Chichikov Naturally time had not spared him his share of anxieties and alarms wherefore his exterior had come to look a trifle more elderly his frockcoat had taken on a suggestion of shabbiness and britchka coachman valet horses and harness alike had about them a sort of second hand worse for wear effect Evidently the Chichikovian finances were not in the most flourishing of conditions Nevertheless the old expression of face the old air of breeding and refinement remained unimpaired and our hero had even improved in the art of walking and turning with grace and of dexterously crossing one leg over the other when taking a seat Also his mildness of diction his discreet moderation of word and phrase survived in if anything increased measure and he bore himself with a skill which caused his tactfulness to surpass itself in sureness of aplomb And all these accomplishments had their effect further heightened by a snowy immaculateness of collar and dickey and an absence of dust from his frockcoat as complete as though he had just arrived to attend a nameday festival Lastly his cheeks and chin were of such neat clean shavenness that no one but a blind man could have failed to admire their rounded contours From that moment onwards great changes took place in Tientietnikov s establishment and certain of its rooms assumed an unwonted air of cleanliness and order The rooms in question were those assigned to Chichikov while one other apartment a little front chamber opening into the hall became permeated with Petrushka s own peculiar smell But this lasted only for a little while for presently Petrushka was transferred to the servants quarters a course which ought to have been adopted in the first instance During the initial days of Chichikov s sojourn Tientietnikov feared rather to lose his independence inasmuch as he thought that his guest might hamper his movements and bring about alterations in the established routine of the place But these fears proved groundless for Paul Ivanovitch displayed an extraordinary aptitude for accommodating himself to his new position To begin with he encouraged his host in his philosophical inertia by saying that the latter would help Tientietnikov to become a centenarian Next in the matter of a life of isolation he hit things off exactly by remarking that such a life bred in a man a capacity for high thinking Lastly as he inspected the library and dilated on books in general he contrived an opportunity to observe that literature safeguarded a man from a tendency to waste his time In short the few words of which he delivered himself were brief but invariably to the point And this discretion of speech was outdone by his discretion of conduct That is to say whether entering or leaving the room he never wearied his host with a question if Tientietnikov had the air of being disinclined to talk and with equal satisfaction the guest could either play chess or hold his tongue Consequently Tientietnikov said to himself For the first time in my life I have met with a man with whom it is possible to live In general not many of the type exist in Russia and though clever good humoured well educated men abound one would be hard put to it to find an individual of equable temperament with whom one could share a roof for centuries without a quarrel arising Anyway Chichikov is the first of his sort that I have met For his part Chichikov was only too delighted to reside with a person so quiet and agreeable as his host Of a wandering life he was temporarily weary and to rest even for a month in such a beautiful spot and in sight of green fields and the slow flowering of spring was likely to benefit him also from the hygienic point of view And indeed a more delightful retreat in which to recuperate could not possibly have been found The spring long retarded by previous cold had now begun in all its comeliness and life was rampant Already over the first emerald of the grass the dandelion was showing yellow and the red pink anemone was hanging its tender head while the surface of every pond was a swarm of dancing gnats and midges and the water spider was being joined in their pursuit by birds which gathered from every quarter to the vantage ground of the dry reeds Every species of creature also seemed to be assembling in concourse and taking stock of one another Suddenly the earth became populous the forest had opened its eyes and the meadows were lifting up their voice in song In the same way had choral dances begun to be weaved in the village and everywhere that the eye turned there was merriment What brightness in the green of nature what freshness in the air what singing of birds in the gardens of the mansion what general joy and rapture and exaltation Particularly in the village might the shouting and singing have been in honour of a wedding Chichikov walked hither thither and everywhere a pursuit for which there was ample choice and facility At one time he would direct his steps along the edge of the flat tableland and contemplate the depths below where still there lay sheets of water left by the floods of winter and where the island like patches of forest showed leafless boughs while at another time he would plunge into the thicket and ravine country where nests of birds weighted branches almost to the ground and the sky was darkened with the criss cross flight of cawing rooks Again the drier portions of the meadows could be crossed to the river wharves whence the first barges were just beginning to set forth with pea meal and barley and wheat while at the same time one s ear would be caught with the sound of some mill resuming its functions as once more the water turned the wheel Chichikov would also walk afield to watch the early tillage operations of the season and observe how the blackness of a new furrow would make its way across the expanse of green and how the sower rhythmically striking his hand against the pannier slung across his breast would scatter his fistfuls of seed with equal distribution apportioning not a grain too much to one side or to the other In fact Chichikov went everywhere He chatted and talked now with the bailiff now with a peasant now with a miller and inquired into the manner and nature of everything and sought information as to how an estate was managed and at what price corn was selling and what species of grain was best for spring and autumn grinding and what was the name of each peasant and who were his kinsfolk and where he had bought his cow and what he fed his pigs on Chichikov also made inquiry concerning the number of peasants who had lately died but of these there appeared to be few And suddenly his quick eye discerned that Tientietnikov s estate was not being worked as it might have been that much neglect and listlessness and pilfering and drunkenness was abroad and on perceiving this he thought to himself What a fool is that Tientietnikov To think of letting a property like this decay when he might be drawing from it an income of fifty thousand roubles a year Also more than once while taking these walks our hero pondered the idea of himself becoming a landowner not now of course but later when his chief aim should have been achieved and he had got into his hands the necessary means for living the quiet life of the proprietor of an estate Yes and at these times there would include itself in his castle building the figure of a young fresh fair faced maiden of the mercantile or other rich grade of society a woman who could both play and sing He also dreamed of little descendants who should perpetuate the name of Chichikov perhaps a frolicsome little boy and a fair young daughter or possibly two boys and quite two or three daughters so that all should know that he had really lived and had his being that he had not merely roamed the world like a spectre or a shadow so that for him and his the country should never be put to shame And from that he would go on to fancy that a title appended to his rank would not be a bad thing the title of State Councillor for instance which was deserving of all honour and respect Ah it is a common thing for a man who is taking a solitary walk so to detach himself from the irksome realities of the present that he is able to stir and to excite and to provoke his imagination to the conception of things he knows can never really come to pass Chichikov s servants also found the mansion to their taste and like their master speedily made themselves at home in it In particular did Petrushka make friends with Grigory the butler although at first the pair showed a tendency to outbrag one another Petrushka beginning by throwing dust in Grigory s eyes on the score of his Petrushka s travels and Grigory taking him down a peg or two by referring to saint Petersburg a city which Petrushka had never visited and Petrushka seeking to recover lost ground by dilating on towns which he HAD visited and Grigory capping this by naming some town which is not to be found on any map in existence and then estimating the journey thither as at least thirty thousand versts a statement which would so completely flabbergast the henchman of Chichikov s suite that he would be left staring open mouthed amid the general laughter of the domestic staff However as I say the pair ended by swearing eternal friendship with one another and making a practice of resorting to the village tavern in company For Selifan however the place had a charm of a different kind That is to say each evening there would take place in the village a singing of songs and a weaving of country dances and so shapely and buxom were the maidens maidens of a type hard to find in our present day villages on large estates that he would stand for hours wondering which of them was the best White necked and white bosomed all had great roving eyes the gait of peacocks and hair reaching to the waist And as with his hands clasping theirs he glided hither and thither in the dance or retired backwards towards a wall with a row of other young fellows and then with them returned to meet the damsels all singing in chorus and laughing as they sang it Boyars show me my bridegroom and dusk was falling gently and from the other side of the river there kept coming far faint plaintive echoes of the melody well then our Selifan hardly knew whether he were standing upon his head or his heels Later when sleeping and when waking both at noon and at twilight he would seem still to be holding a pair of white hands and moving in the dance Chichikov s horses also found nothing of which to disapprove Yes both the bay the Assessor and the skewbald accounted residence at Tientietnikov s a most comfortable affair and voted the oats excellent and the arrangement of the stables beyond all cavil True on this occasion each horse had a stall to himself yet by looking over the intervening partition it was possible always to see one s fellows and should a neighbour take it into his head to utter a neigh to answer it at once As for the errand which had hitherto led Chichikov to travel about Russia he had now decided to move very cautiously and secretly in the matter In fact on noticing that Tientietnikov went in absorbedly for reading and for talking philosophy the visitor said to himself No I had better begin at the other end and proceeded first to feel his way among the servants of the establishment From them he learnt several things and in particular that the barin had been wont to go and call upon a certain General in the neighbourhood and that the General possessed a daughter and that she and Tientietnikov had had an affair of some sort but that the pair had subsequently parted and gone their several ways For that matter Chichikov himself had noticed that Tientietnikov was in the habit of drawing heads of which each representation exactly resembled the rest Once as he sat tapping his silver snuff box after luncheon Chichikov remarked One thing you lack and only one Andrei Ivanovitch What is that asked his host A female friend or two replied Chichikov Tientietnikov made no rejoinder and the conversation came temporarily to an end But Chichikov was not to be discouraged wherefore while waiting for supper and talking on different subjects he seized an opportunity to interject Do you know it would do you no harm to marry As before Tientietnikov did not reply and the renewed mention of the subject seemed to have annoyed him For the third time it was after supper Chichikov returned to the charge by remarking To day as I was walking round your property I could not help thinking that marriage would do you a great deal of good Otherwise you will develop into a hypochondriac Whether Chichikov s words now voiced sufficiently the note of persuasion or whether Tientietnikov happened at the moment to be unusually disposed to frankness at all events the young landowner sighed and then responded as he expelled a puff of tobacco smoke To attain anything Paul Ivanovitch one needs to have been born under a lucky star And he related to his guest the whole history of his acquaintanceship and subsequent rupture with the General As Chichikov listened to the recital and gradually realised that the affair had arisen merely out of a chance word on the General s part he was astounded beyond measure and gazed at Tientietnikov without knowing what to make of him Andrei Ivanovitch he said at length what was there to take offence at Nothing as regards the actual words spoken replied the other The offence lay rather in the insult conveyed in the General s tone Tientietnikov was a kindly and peaceable man yet his eyes flashed as he said this and his voice vibrated with wounded feeling Yet even then need you have taken it so much amiss What Could I have gone on visiting him as before Certainly No great harm had been done I disagree with you Had he been an old man in a humble station of life instead of a proud and swaggering officer I should not have minded so much But as it was I could not and would not brook his words A curious fellow this Tientietnikov thought Chichikov to himself A curious fellow this Chichikov was Tientietnikov s inward reflection I tell you what resumed Chichikov To morrow I myself will go and see the General To what purpose asked Tientietnikov with astonishment and distrust in his eyes To offer him an assurance of my personal respect A strange fellow this Chichikov reflected Tientietnikov A strange fellow this Tientietnikov thought Chichikov and then added aloud Yes I will go and see him at ten o clock to morrow but since my britchka is not yet altogether in travelling order would you be so good as to lend me your koliaska for the purpose CHAPTER II Tientietnikov s good horses covered the ten versts to the General s house in a little over half an hour Descending from the koliaska with features attuned to deference Chichikov inquired for the master of the house and was at once ushered into his presence Bowing with head held respectfully on one side and hands extended like those of a waiter carrying a trayful of teacups the visitor inclined his whole body forward and said I have deemed it my duty to present myself to your Excellency I have deemed it my duty because in my heart I cherish a most profound respect for the valiant men who on the field of battle have proved the saviours of their country That this preliminary attack did not wholly displease the General was proved by the fact that responding with a gracious inclination of the head he replied I am glad to make your acquaintance Pray be so good as to take a seat In what capacity or capacities have you yourself seen service Of my service said Chichikov depositing his form not exactly in the centre of the chair but rather on one side of it and resting a hand upon one of its arms of my service the scene was laid in the first instance in the Treasury while its further course bore me successively into the employ of the Public Buildings Commission of the Customs Board and of other Government Offices But throughout my life has resembled a barque tossed on the crests of perfidious billows In suffering I have been swathed and wrapped until I have come to be as it were suffering personified while of the extent to which my life has been sought by foes no words no colouring no if I may so express it painter s brush could ever convey to you an adequate idea And now at length in my declining years I am seeking a corner in which to eke out the remainder of my miserable existence while at the present moment I am enjoying the hospitality of a neighbour of your acquaintance And who is that Your neighbour Tientietnikov your Excellency Upon that the General frowned Led me add put in Chichikov hastily that he greatly regrets that on a former occasion he should have failed to show a proper respect for for For what asked the General For the services to the public which your Excellency has rendered Indeed he cannot find words to express his sorrow but keeps repeating to himself Would that I had valued at their true worth the men who have saved our fatherland And why should he say that asked the mollified General I bear him no grudge In fact I have never cherished aught but a sincere liking for him a sincere esteem and do not doubt but that in time he may become a useful member of society In the words which you have been good enough to utter said Chichikov with a bow there is embodied much justice Yes Tientietnikov is in very truth a man of worth Not only does he possess the gift of eloquence but also he is a master of the pen Ah yes he DOES write rubbish of some sort doesn t he Verses or something of the kind Not rubbish your Excellency but practical stuff In short he is inditing a history A HISTORY But a history of what A history of of For a moment or two Chichikov hesitated Then whether because it was a General that was seated in front of him or because he desired to impart greater importance to the subject which he was about to invent he concluded A history of Generals your Excellency Of Generals Of WHAT Generals Of Generals generally of Generals at large That is to say and to be more precise a history of the Generals of our fatherland By this time Chichikov was floundering badly Mentally he spat upon himself and reflected Gracious heavens What rubbish I am talking Pardon me went on his interlocutor but I do not quite understand you Is Tientietnikov producing a history of a given period or only a history made up of a series of biographies Also is he including ALL our Generals or only those who took part in the campaign of eighteen twelve The latter your Excellency only the Generals of eighteen twelve replied Chichikov Then he added beneath his breath Were I to be killed for it I could not say what that may be supposed to mean Then why should he not come and see me in person went on his host Possibly I might be able to furnish him with much interesting material He is afraid to come your Excellency Nonsense Just because of a hasty word or two I am not that sort of man at all In fact I should be very happy to call upon HIM Never would he permit that your Excellency He would greatly prefer to be the first to make advances And Chichikov added to himself What a stroke of luck those Generals were Otherwise the Lord knows where my tongue might have landed me At this moment the door into the adjoining room opened and there appeared in the doorway a girl as fair as a ray of the sun so fair indeed that Chichikov stared at her in amazement Apparently she had come to speak to her father for a moment but had stopped short on perceiving that there was some one with him The only fault to be found in her appearance was the fact that she was too thin and fragile looking May I introduce you to my little pet said the General to Chichikov To tell you the truth I do not know your name That you should be unacquainted with the name of one who has never distinguished himself in the manner of which you yourself can boast is scarcely to be wondered at And Chichikov executed one of his sidelong deferential bows Well I should be delighted to know it It is Paul Ivanovitch Chichikov your Excellency With that went the easy bow of a military man and the agile backward movement of an india rubber ball Ulinka this is Paul Ivanovitch said the General turning to his daughter He has just told me some interesting news namely that our neighbour Tientietnikov is not altogether the fool we had at first thought him On the contrary he is engaged upon a very important work upon a history of the Russian Generals of eighteen twelve But who ever supposed him to be a fool asked the girl quickly What happened was that you took Vishnepokromov s word the word of a man who is himself both a fool and a good for nothing Well well said the father after further good natured dispute on the subject of Vishnepokromov Do you now run away for I wish to dress for luncheon And you sir he added to Chichikov will you not join us at table Chichikov bowed so low and so long that by the time that his eyes had ceased to see nothing but his own boots the General s daughter had disappeared and in her place was standing a bewhiskered butler armed with a silver soap dish and a hand basin Do you mind if I wash in your presence asked the host By no means replied Chichikov Pray do whatsoever you please in that respect Upon that the General fell to scrubbing himself incidentally to sending soapsuds flying in every direction Meanwhile he seemed so favourably disposed that Chichikov decided to sound him then and there more especially since the butler had left the room May I put to you a problem he asked Certainly replied the General What is it It is this your Excellency I have a decrepit old uncle who owns three hundred souls and two thousand roubles worth of other property Also except for myself he possesses not a single heir Now although his infirm state of health will not permit of his managing his property in person he will not allow me either to manage it And the reason for his conduct his very strange conduct he states as follows I do not know my nephew and very likely he is a spendthrift If he wishes to show me that he is good for anything let him go and acquire as many souls as I have acquired and when he has done that I will transfer to him my three hundred souls as well The man must be an absolute fool commented the General Possibly And were that all things would not be as bad as they are But unfortunately my uncle has gone and taken up with his housekeeper and has had children by her Consequently everything will now pass to THEM The old man must have taken leave of his senses remarked the General Yet how I can help you I fail to see Well I have thought of a plan If you will hand me over all the dead souls on your estate hand them over to me exactly as though they were still alive and were purchasable property I will offer them to the old man and then he will leave me his fortune At this point the General burst into a roar of laughter such as few can ever have heard Half dressed he subsided into a chair threw back his head and guffawed until he came near to choking In fact the house shook with his merriment so much so that the butler and his daughter came running into the room in alarm It was long before he could produce a single articulate word and even when he did so to reassure his daughter and the butler he kept momentarily relapsing into spluttering chuckles which made the house ring and ring again Chichikov was greatly taken aback Oh that uncle bellowed the General in paroxysms of mirth Oh that blessed uncle WHAT a fool he ll look Ha ha ha Dead souls offered him instead of live ones Oh my goodness I suppose I ve put my foot in it again ruefully reflected Chichikov But good Lord what a man the fellow is to laugh Heaven send that he doesn t burst of it Ha ha ha broke out the General afresh WHAT a donkey the old man must be To think of his saying to you You go and fit yourself out with three hundred souls and I ll cap them with my own lot My word What a jackass A jackass your Excellency Yes indeed And to think of the jest of putting him off with dead souls Ha ha ha WHAT wouldn t I give to see you handing him the title deeds Who is he What is he like Is he very old He is eighty your Excellency But still brisk and able to move about eh Surely he must be pretty strong to go on living with his housekeeper like that Yes But what does such strength mean Sand runs away your Excellency The old fool But is he really such a fool Yes your Excellency And does he go out at all Does he see company Can he still hold himself upright Yes but with great difficulty And has he any teeth left No more than two at the most The old jackass Don t be angry with me but I must say that though your uncle he is also a jackass Quite so your Excellency And though it grieves ME to have to confess that he is my uncle what am I to do with him Yet this was not altogether the truth What would have been a far harder thing for Chichikov to have confessed was the fact that he possessed no uncles at all I beg of you your Excellency he went on to hand me over those those Those dead souls eh Why in return for the jest I will give you some land as well Yes you can take the whole graveyard if you like Ha ha ha The old man Ha ha ha WHAT a fool he ll look Ha ha ha And once more the General s guffaws went ringing through the house At this point there is a long hiatus in the original CHAPTER III If Colonel Koshkarev should turn out to be as mad as the last one it is a bad look out said Chichikov to himself on opening his eyes amid fields and open country everything else having disappeared save the vault of heaven and a couple of low lying clouds Selifan he went on did you ask how to get to Colonel Koshkarev s Yes Paul Ivanovitch At least there was such a clatter around the koliaska that I could not but Petrushka asked the coachman You fool How often have I told you not to rely on Petrushka Petrushka is a blockhead an idiot Besides at the present moment I believe him to be drunk No you are wrong barin put in the person referred to turning his head with a sidelong glance After we get down the next hill we shall need but to keep bending round it That is all Yes and I suppose you ll tell me that sivnkha is the only thing that has passed your lips Well the view at least is beautiful In fact when one has seen this place one may say that one has seen one of the beauty spots of Europe This said Chichikov added to himself smoothing his chin What a difference between the features of a civilised man of the world and those of a common lacquey Meanwhile the koliaska quickened its pace and Chichikov once more caught sight of Tientietnikov s aspen studded meadows Undulating gently on elastic springs the vehicle cautiously descended the steep incline and then proceeded past water mills rumbled over a bridge or two and jolted easily along the rough set road which traversed the flats Not a molehill not a mound jarred the spine The vehicle was comfort itself Swiftly there flew by clumps of osiers slender elder trees and silver leaved poplars their branches brushing against Selifan and Petrushka and at intervals depriving the valet of his cap Each time that this happened the sullen faced servitor fell to cursing both the tree responsible for the occurrence and the landowner responsible for the tree being in existence yet nothing would induce him thereafter either to tie on the cap or to steady it with his hand so complete was his assurance that the accident would never be repeated Soon to the foregoing trees there became added an occasional birch or spruce fir while in the dense undergrowth around their roots could be seen the blue iris and the yellow wood tulip Gradually the forest grew darker as though eventually the obscurity would become complete Then through the trunks and the boughs there began to gleam points of light like glittering mirrors and as the number of trees lessened these points grew larger until the travellers debouched upon the shore of a lake four versts or so in circumference and having on its further margin the grey scattered log huts of a peasant village In the water a great commotion was in progress In the first place some twenty men immersed to the knee to the breast or to the neck were dragging a large fishing net inshore while in the second place there was entangled in the same in addition to some fish a stout man shaped precisely like a melon or a hogshead Greatly excited he was shouting at the top of his voice Let Kosma manage it you lout of a Denis Kosma take the end of the rope from Denis Don t bear so hard on it Thoma Bolshoy forty one Go where Thoma Menshov forty two is Damn it bring the net to land will you From this it became clear that it was not on his own account that the stout man was worrying Indeed he had no need to do so since his fat would in any case have prevented him from sinking Yes even if he had turned head over heels in an effort to dive the water would persistently have borne him up and the same if say a couple of men had jumped on his back the only result would have been that he would have become a trifle deeper submerged and forced to draw breath by spouting bubbles through his nose No the cause of his agitation was lest the net should break and the fish escape wherefore he was urging some additional peasants who were standing on the bank to lay hold of and to pull at an extra rope or two That must be the barin Colonel Koshkarev said Selifan Why asked Chichikov Because if you please his skin is whiter than the rest and he has the respectable paunch of a gentleman Meanwhile good progress was being made with the hauling in of the barin until feeling the ground with his feet he rose to an upright position and at the same moment caught sight of the koliaska with Chichikov seated therein descending the declivity Have you dined yet shouted the barin as still entangled in the net he approached the shore with a huge fish on his back With one hand shading his eyes from the sun and the other thrown backwards he looked in point of pose like the Medici Venus emerging from her bath No replied Chichikov raising his cap and executing a series of bows Then thank God for that rejoined the gentleman Why asked Chichikov with no little curiosity and still holding his cap over his head Because of THIS Cast off the net Thoma Menshov and pick up that sturgeon for the gentleman to see Go and help him Telepen Kuzma With that the peasants indicated picked up by the head what was a veritable monster of a fish Isn t it a beauty a sturgeon fresh run from the river exclaimed the stout barin And now let us be off home Coachman you can take the lower road through the kitchen garden Run you lout of a Thoma Bolshoy and open the gate for him He will guide you to the house and I myself shall be along presently Thereupon the barelegged Thoma Bolshoy clad in nothing but a shirt ran ahead of the koliaska through the village every hut of which had hanging in front of it a variety of nets for the reason that every inhabitant of the place was a fisherman Next he opened a gate into a large vegetable enclosure and thence the koliaska emerged into a square near a wooden church with showing beyond the latter the roofs of the manorial homestead A queer fellow that Koshkarev said Chichikov to himself Well whatever I may be at least I m here said a voice by his side Chichikov looked round and perceived that in the meanwhile the barin had dressed himself and overtaken the carriage With a pair of yellow trousers he was wearing a grass green jacket and his neck was as guiltless of a collar as Cupid s Also as he sat sideways in his drozhki his bulk was such that he completely filled the vehicle Chichikov was about to make some remark or another when the stout gentleman disappeared and presently his drozhki re emerged into view at the spot where the fish had been drawn to land and his voice could be heard reiterating exhortations to his serfs Yet when Chichikov reached the verandah of the house he found to his intense surprise the stout gentleman waiting to welcome the visitor How he had contrived to convey himself thither passed Chichikov s comprehension Host and guest embraced three times according to a bygone custom of Russia Evidently the barin was one of the old school I bring you said Chichikov a greeting from his Excellency From whom From your relative General Alexander Dmitrievitch Who is Alexander Dmitrievitch What You do not know General Alexander Dmitrievitch Betrishev exclaimed Chichikov with a touch of surprise No I do not replied the gentleman Chichikov s surprise grew to absolute astonishment How comes that about he ejaculated I hope that I have the honour of addressing Colonel Koshkarev Your hopes are vain It is to my house not to his that you have come and I am Peter Petrovitch Pietukh yes Peter Petrovitch Pietukh Chichikov dumbfounded turned to Selifan and Petrushka What do you mean he exclaimed I told you to drive to the house of Colonel Koshkarev whereas you have brought me to that of Peter Petrovitch Pietukh All the same your fellows have done quite right put in the gentleman referred to Do you this to Selifan and Petrushka go to the kitchen where they will give you a glassful of vodka apiece Then put up the horses and be off to the servants quarters I regret the mistake extremely said Chichikov But it is not a mistake When you have tried the dinner which I have in store for you just see whether you think IT a mistake Enter I beg of you And taking Chichikov by the arm the host conducted him within where they were met by a couple of youths Let me introduce my two sons home for their holidays from the Gymnasium forty three said Pietukh Nikolasha come and entertain our good visitor while you Aleksasha follow me And with that the host disappeared Chichikov turned to Nikolasha whom he found to be a budding man about town since at first he opened a conversation by stating that as no good was to be derived from studying at a provincial institution he and his brother desired to remove rather to saint Petersburg the provinces not being worth living in I quite understand Chichikov thought to himself The end of the chapter will be confectioners assistants and the boulevards Tell me he added aloud how does your father s property at present stand It is all mortgaged put in the father himself as he re entered the room Yes it is all mortgaged every bit of it What a pity thought Chichikov At this rate it will not be long before this man has no property at all left I must hurry my departure Aloud he said with an air of sympathy That you have mortgaged the estate seems to me a matter of regret No not at all replied Pietukh In fact they tell me that it is a good thing to do and that every one else is doing it Why should I act differently from my neighbours Moreover I have had enough of living here and should like to try Moscow more especially since my sons are always begging me to give them a metropolitan education Oh the fool the fool reflected Chichikov He is for throwing up everything and making spendthrifts of his sons Yet this is a nice property and it is clear that the local peasants are doing well and that the family too is comfortably off On the other hand as soon as ever these lads begin their education in restaurants and theatres the devil will away with every stick of their substance For my own part I could desire nothing better than this quiet life in the country Let me guess what is in your mind said Pietukh What then asked Chichikov rather taken aback You are thinking to yourself That fool of a Pietukh has asked me to dinner yet not a bite of dinner do I see But wait a little It will be ready presently for it is being cooked as fast as a maiden who has had her hair cut off plaits herself a new set of tresses Here comes Platon Mikhalitch father exclaimed Aleksasha who had been peeping out of the window Yes and on a grey horse added his brother Who is Platon Mikhalitch inquired Chichikov A neighbour of ours and an excellent fellow The next moment Platon Mikhalitch himself entered the room accompanied by a sporting dog named Yarb He was a tall handsome man with extremely red hair As for his companion it was of the keen muzzled species used for shooting Have you dined yet asked the host Yes replied Platon Indeed What do you mean by coming here to laugh at us all Do I ever go to YOUR place after dinner The newcomer smiled Well if it can bring you any comfort he said let me tell you that I ate nothing at the meal for I had no appetite But you should see what I have caught what sort of a sturgeon fate has brought my way Yes and what crucians and carp Really it tires one to hear you How come you always to be so cheerful And how come YOU always to be so gloomy retorted the host How you ask Simply because I am so The truth is you don t eat enough Try the plan of making a good dinner Weariness of everything is a modern invention Once upon a time one never heard of it Well boast away but have you yourself never been tired of things Never in my life I do not so much as know whether I should find time to be tired In the morning when one awakes the cook is waiting and the dinner has to be ordered Then one drinks one s morning tea and then the bailiff arrives for HIS orders and then there is fishing to be done and then one s dinner has to be eaten Next before one has even had a chance to utter a snore there enters once again the cook and one has to order supper and when she has departed behold back she comes with a request for the following day s dinner What time does THAT leave one to be weary of things Throughout this conversation Chichikov had been taking stock of the newcomer who astonished him with his good looks his upright picturesque figure his appearance of fresh unwasted youthfulness and the boyish purity innocence and clarity of his features Neither passion nor care nor aught of the nature of agitation or anxiety of mind had ventured to touch his unsullied face or to lay a single wrinkle thereon Yet the touch of life which those emotions might have imparted was wanting The face was as it were dreaming even though from time to time an ironical smile disturbed it I too cannot understand remarked Chichikov how a man of your appearance can find things wearisome Of course if a man is hard pressed for money or if he has enemies who are lying in wait for his life as have certain folk of whom I know well then Believe me when I say interrupted the handsome guest that for the sake of a diversion I should be glad of ANY sort of an anxiety Would that some enemy would conceive a grudge against me But no one does so Everything remains eternally dull But perhaps you lack a sufficiency of land or souls Not at all I and my brother own ten thousand desiatins forty four of land and over a thousand souls Curious I do not understand it But perhaps the harvest has failed or you have sickness about and many of your male peasants have died of it On the contrary everything is in splendid order for my brother is the best of managers Then to find things wearisome exclaimed Chichikov It passes my comprehension And he shrugged his shoulders Well we will soon put weariness to flight interrupted the host Aleksasha do you run helter skelter to the kitchen and there tell the cook to serve the fish pasties Yes and where have that gawk of an Emelian and that thief of an Antoshka got to Why have they not handed round the zakuski At this moment the door opened and the gawk and the thief in question made their appearance with napkins and a tray the latter bearing six decanters of variously coloured beverages These they placed upon the table and then ringed them about with glasses and platefuls of every conceivable kind of appetiser That done the servants applied themselves to bringing in various comestibles under covers through which could be heard the hissing of hot roast viands In particular did the gawk and the thief work hard at their tasks As a matter of fact their appellations had been given them merely to spur them to greater activity for in general the barin was no lover of abuse but rather a kind hearted man who like most Russians could not get on without a sharp word or two That is to say he needed them for his tongue as he need a glass of vodka for his digestion What else could you expect It was his nature to care for nothing mild To the zakuski succeeded the meal itself and the host became a perfect glutton on his guests behalf Should he notice that a guest had taken but a single piece of a comestible he added thereto another one saying Without a mate neither man nor bird can live in this world Should any one take two pieces he added thereto a third saying What is the good of the number two God loves a trinity Should any one take three pieces he would say Where do you see a waggon with three wheels Who builds a three cornered hut Lastly should any one take four pieces he would cap them with a fifth and add thereto the punning quip Na piat opiat forty five After devouring at least twelve steaks of sturgeon Chichikov ventured to think to himself My host cannot possibly add to THEM but found that he was mistaken for without a word Pietukh heaped upon his plate an enormous portion of spit roasted veal and also some kidneys And what veal it was That calf was fed two years on milk he explained I cared for it like my own son Nevertheless I can eat no more said Chichikov Do you try the veal before you say that you can eat no more But I could not get it down my throat There is no room left If there be no room in a church for a newcomer the beadle is sent for and room is very soon made yes even though before there was such a crush that an apple couldn t have been dropped between the people Do you try the veal I say That piece is the titbit of all So Chichikov made the attempt and in very truth the veal was beyond all praise and room was found for it even though one would have supposed the feat impossible Fancy this good fellow removing to saint Petersburg or Moscow said the guest to himself Why with a scale of living like this he would be ruined in three years For that matter Pietukh might well have been ruined already for hospitality can dissipate a fortune in three months as easily as it can in three years The host also dispensed the wine with a lavish hand and what the guests did not drink he gave to his sons who thus swallowed glass after glass Indeed even before coming to table it was possible to discern to what department of human accomplishment their bent was turned When the meal was over however the guests had no mind for further drinking Indeed it was all that they could do to drag themselves on to the balcony and there to relapse into easy chairs Indeed the moment that the host subsided into his seat it was large enough for four he fell asleep and his portly presence converting itself into a sort of blacksmith s bellows started to vent through open mouth and distended nostrils such sounds as can have greeted the reader s ear but seldom sounds as of a drum being beaten in combination with the whistling of a flute and the strident howling of a dog Listen to him said Platon Chichikov smiled Naturally on such dinners as that continued the other our host does NOT find the time dull And as soon as dinner is ended there can ensue sleep Yes but pardon me I still fail to understand why you should find life wearisome There are so many resources against ennui As for instance For a young man dancing the playing of one or another musical instrument and well yes marriage Marriage to whom To some maiden who is both charming and rich Are there none in these parts No Then were I you I should travel and seek a maiden elsewhere And a brilliant idea therewith entered Chichikov s head This last resource he added is the best of all resources against ennui What resource are you speaking of Of travel But whither Well should it so please you you might join me as my companion This said the speaker added to himself as he eyed Platon Yes that would suit me exactly for then I should have half my expenses paid and could charge him also with the cost of mending the koliaska And whither should we go In that respect I am not wholly my own master as I have business to do for others as well as for myself For instance General Betristchev an intimate friend and I might add a generous benefactor of mine has charged me with commissions to certain of his relatives However though relatives are relatives I am travelling likewise on my own account since I wish to see the world and the whirligig of humanity which in spite of what people may say is as good as a living book or a second education As a matter of fact Chichikov was reflecting Yes the plan is an excellent one I might even contrive that he should have to bear the whole of our expenses and that his horses should be used while my own should be put out to graze on his farm Well why should I not adopt the suggestion was Platon s thought There is nothing for me to do at home since the management of the estate is in my brother s hands and my going would cause him no inconvenience Yes why should I not do as Chichikov has suggested Then he added aloud Would you come and stay with my brother for a couple of days Otherwise he might refuse me his consent With great pleasure said Chichikov Or even for three days Then here is my hand on it Let us be off at once Platon seemed suddenly to have come to life again Where are you off to put in their host unexpectedly as he roused himself and stared in astonishment at the pair No no my good sirs I have had the wheels removed from your koliaska Monsieur Chichikov and have sent your horse Platon Mikhalitch to a grazing ground fifteen versts away Consequently you must spend the night here and depart to morrow morning after breakfast What could be done with a man like Pietukh There was no help for it but to remain In return the guests were rewarded with a beautiful spring evening for to spend the time the host organised a boating expedition on the river and a dozen rowers with a dozen pairs of oars conveyed the party to the accompaniment of song across the smooth surface of the lake and up a great river with towering banks From time to time the boat would pass under ropes stretched across for purposes of fishing and at each turn of the rippling current new vistas unfolded themselves as tier upon tier of woodland delighted the eye with a diversity of timber and foliage In unison did the rowers ply their sculls yet it was though of itself that the skiff shot forward bird like over the glassy surface of the water while at intervals the broad shouldered young oarsman who was seated third from the bow would raise as from a nightingale s throat the opening staves of a boat song and then be joined by five or six more until the melody had come to pour forth in a volume as free and boundless as Russia herself And Pietukh too would give himself a shake and help lustily to support the chorus and even Chichikov felt acutely conscious of the fact that he was a Russian Only Platon reflected What is there so splendid in these melancholy songs They do but increase one s depression of spirits The journey homeward was made in the gathering dusk Rhythmically the oars smote a surface which no longer reflected the sky and darkness had fallen when they reached the shore along which lights were twinkling where the fisherfolk were boiling live eels for soup Everything had now wended its way homeward for the night the cattle and poultry had been housed and the herdsmen standing at the gates of the village cattle pens amid the trailing dust lately raised by their charges were awaiting the milk pails and a summons to partake of the eel broth Through the dusk came the hum of humankind and the barking of dogs in other and more distant villages while over all the moon was rising and the darkened countryside was beginning to glimmer to light again under her beams What a glorious picture Yet no one thought of admiring it Instead of galloping over the countryside on frisky cobs Nikolasha and Aleksasha were engaged in dreaming of Moscow with its confectioners shops and the theatres of which a cadet newly arrived on a visit from the capital had just been telling them while their father had his mind full of how best to stuff his guests with yet more food and Platon was given up to yawning Only in Chichikov was a spice of animation visible Yes he reflected some day I too will become lord of such a country place And before his mind s eye there arose also a helpmeet and some little Chichikovs By the time that supper was finished the party had again over eaten themselves and when Chichikov entered the room allotted him for the night he lay down upon the bed and prodded his stomach It is as tight as a drum he said to himself Not another titbit of veal could now get into it Also circumstances had so brought it about that next door to him there was situated his host s apartment and since the intervening wall was thin Chichikov could hear every word that was said there At the present moment the master of the house was engaged in giving the cook orders for what under the guise of an early breakfast promised to constitute a veritable dinner You should have heard Pietukh s behests They would have excited the appetite of a corpse Yes he said sucking his lips and drawing a deep breath in the first place make a pasty in four divisions Into one of the divisions put the sturgeon s cheeks and some viaziga forty six and into another division some buckwheat porridge young mushrooms and onions sweet milk calves brains and anything else that you may find suitable anything else that you may have got handy Also bake the pastry to a nice brown on one side and but lightly on the other Yes and as to the under side bake it so that it will be all juicy and flaky so that it shall not crumble into bits but melt in the mouth like the softest snow that ever you heard of And as he said this Pietukh fairly smacked his lips The devil take him muttered Chichikov thrusting his head beneath the bedclothes to avoid hearing more The fellow won t give one a chance to sleep Nevertheless he heard through the blankets And garnish the sturgeon with beetroot smelts peppered mushrooms young radishes carrots beans and anything else you like so as to have plenty of trimmings Yes and put a lump of ice into the pig s bladder so as to swell it up Many other dishes did Pietukh order and nothing was to be heard but his talk of boiling roasting and stewing Finally just as mention was being made of a turkey cock Chichikov fell asleep Next morning the guest s state of repletion had reached the point of Platon being unable to mount his horse wherefore the latter was dispatched homeward with one of Pietukh s grooms and the two guests entered Chichikov s koliaska Even the dog trotted lazily in the rear for he too had over eaten himself It has been rather too much of a good thing remarked Chichikov as the vehicle issued from the courtyard Yes and it vexes me to see the fellow never tire of it replied Platon Ah thought Chichikov to himself if I had an income of seventy thousand roubles as you have I d very soon give tiredness one in the eye Take Murazov the tax farmer he again must be worth ten millions What a fortune Do you mind where we drive asked Platon I should like first to go and take leave of my sister and my brother in law With pleasure said Chichikov My brother in law is the leading landowner hereabouts At the present moment he is drawing an income of two hundred thousand roubles from a property which eight years ago was producing a bare twenty thousand Truly a man worthy of the utmost respect I shall be most interested to make his acquaintance To think of it And what may his family name be Kostanzhoglo And his Christian name and patronymic Constantine Thedorovitch Constantine Thedorovitch Kostanzhoglo Yes it will be a most interesting event to make his acquaintance To know such a man must be a whole education Here Platon set himself to give Selifan some directions as to the way a necessary proceeding in view of the fact that Selifan could hardly maintain his seat on the box Twice Petrushka too had fallen headlong and this necessitated being tied to his perch with a piece of rope What a clown had been Chichikov s only comment This is where my brother in law s land begins said Platon They give one a change of view And indeed from this point the countryside became planted with timber the rows of trees running as straight as pistol shots and having beyond them and on higher ground a second expanse of forest newly planted like the first while beyond it again loomed a third plantation of older trees Next there succeeded a flat piece of the same nature All this timber said Platon has grown up within eight or ten years at the most whereas on another man s land it would have taken twenty to attain the same growth And how has your brother in law effected this You must ask him yourself He is so excellent a husbandman that nothing ever fails with him You see he knows the soil and also knows what ought to be planted beside what and what kinds of timber are the best neighbourhood for grain Again everything on his estate is made to perform at least three or four different functions For instance he makes his timber not only serve as timber but also serve as a provider of moisture and shade to a given stretch of land and then as a fertiliser with its fallen leaves Consequently when everywhere else there is drought he still has water and when everywhere else there has been a failure of the harvest on his lands it will have proved a success But it is a pity that I know so little about it all as to be unable to explain to you his many expedients Folk call him a wizard for he produces so much Nevertheless personally I find what he does uninteresting Truly an astonishing fellow reflected Chichikov with a glance at his companion It is sad indeed to see a man so superficial as to be unable to explain matters of this kind At length the manor appeared in sight an establishment looking almost like a town so numerous were the huts where they stood arranged in three tiers crowned with three churches and surrounded with huge ricks and barns Yes thought Chichikov to himself one can see what a jewel of a landowner lives here The huts in question were stoutly built and the intervening alleys well laid out while wherever a waggon was visible it looked serviceable and more or less new Also the local peasants bore an intelligent look on their faces the cattle were of the best possible breed and even the peasants pigs belonged to the porcine aristocracy Clearly there dwelt here peasants who to quote the song were accustomed to pick up silver by the shovelful Nor were Englishified gardens and parterres and other conceits in evidence but on the contrary there ran an open view from the manor house to the farm buildings and the workmen s cots so that after the old Russian fashion the barin should be able to keep an eye upon all that was going on around him For the same purpose the mansion was topped with a tall lantern and a superstructure a device designed not for ornament nor for a vantage spot for the contemplation of the view but for supervision of the labourers engaged in distant fields Lastly the brisk active servants who received the visitors on the verandah were very different menials from the drunken Petrushka even though they did not wear swallow tailed coats but only Cossack tchekmenu forty seven of blue homespun cloth The lady of the house also issued on to the verandah With her face of the freshness of blood and milk and the brightness of God s daylight she as nearly resembled Platon as one pea resembles another save that whereas he was languid she was cheerful and full of talk Good day brother she cried How glad I am to see you Constantine is not at home but will be back presently Where is he Doing business in the village with a party of factors replied the lady as she conducted her guests to the drawing room With no little curiosity did Chichikov gaze at the interior of the mansion inhabited by the man who received an annual income of two hundred thousand roubles for he thought to discern therefrom the nature of its proprietor even as from a shell one may deduce the species of oyster or snail which has been its tenant and has left therein its impression But no such conclusions were to be drawn The rooms were simple and even bare Not a fresco nor a picture nor a bronze nor a flower nor a china what not nor a book was there to be seen In short everything appeared to show that the proprietor of this abode spent the greater part of his time not between four walls but in the field and that he thought out his plans not in sybaritic fashion by the fireside nor in an easy chair beside the stove but on the spot where work was actually in progress that in a word where those plans were conceived there they were put into execution Nor in these rooms could Chichikov detect the least trace of a feminine hand beyond the fact that certain tables and chairs bore drying boards whereon were arranged some sprinklings of flower petals What is all this rubbish for asked Platon It is not rubbish replied the lady of the house On the contrary it is the best possible remedy for fever Last year we cured every one of our sick peasants with it Some of the petals I am going to make into an ointment and some into an infusion You may laugh as much as you like at my potting and preserving yet you yourself will be glad of things of the kind when you set out on your travels Platon moved to the piano and began to pick out a note or two Good Lord what an ancient instrument he exclaimed Are you not ashamed of it sister Well the truth is that I get no time to practice my music You see she added to Chichikov I have an eight year old daughter to educate and to hand her over to a foreign governess in order that I may have leisure for my own piano playing well that is a thing which I could never bring myself to do You have become a wearisome sort of person commented Platon and walked away to the window Ah here comes Constantine presently he added Chichikov also glanced out of the window and saw approaching the verandah a brisk swarthy complexioned man of about forty a man clad in a rough cloth jacket and a velveteen cap Evidently he was one of those who care little for the niceties of dress With him bareheaded there came a couple of men of a somewhat lower station in life and all three were engaged in an animated discussion One of the barin s two companions was a plain peasant and the other clad in a blue Siberian smock a travelling factor The fact that the party halted awhile by the entrance steps made it possible to overhear a portion of their conversation from within This is what you peasants had better do the barin was saying Purchase your release from your present master I will lend you the necessary money and afterwards you can work for me No Constantine Thedorovitch replied the peasant Why should we do that Remove us just as we are You will know how to arrange it for a cleverer gentleman than you is nowhere to be found The misfortune of us muzhiks is that we cannot protect ourselves properly The tavern keepers sell us such liquor that before a man knows where he is a glassful of it has eaten a hole through his stomach and made him feel as though he could drink a pail of water Yes it knocks a man over before he can look around Everywhere temptation lies in wait for the peasant and he needs to be cunning if he is to get through the world at all In fact things seem to be contrived for nothing but to make us peasants lose our wits even to the tobacco which they sell us What are folk like ourselves to do Constantine Thedorovitch I tell you it is terribly difficult for a muzhik to look after himself Listen to me This is how things are done here When I take on a serf I fit him out with a cow and a horse On the other hand I demand of him thereafter more than is demanded of a peasant anywhere else That is to say first and foremost I make him work Whether a peasant be working for himself or for me never do I let him waste time I myself toil like a bullock and I force my peasants to do the same for experience has taught me that that is the only way to get through life All the mischief in the world comes through lack of employment Now do you go and consider the matter and talk it over with your mir forty eight We have done that already Constantine Thedorovitch and our elders opinion is There is no need for further talk Every peasant belonging to Constantine Thedorovitch is well off and hasn t to work for nothing The priests of his village too are men of good heart whereas ours have been taken away and there is no one to bury us Nevertheless do you go and talk the matter over again We will barin Here the factor who had been walking on the barin s other side put in a word Constantine Thedorovitch he said I beg of you to do as I have requested I have told you before replied the barin that I do not care to play the huckster I am not one of those landowners whom fellows of your sort visit on the very day that the interest on a mortgage is due Ah I know your fraternity thoroughly and know that you keep lists of all who have mortgages to repay But what is there so clever about that Any man if you pinch him sufficiently will surrender you a mortgage at half price any man that is to say except myself who care nothing for your money Were a loan of mine to remain out three years I should never demand a kopeck of interest on it Quite so Constantine Thedorovitch replied the factor But I am asking this of you more for the purpose of establishing us on a business footing than because I desire to win your favour Prey therefore accept this earnest money of three thousand roubles And the man drew from his breast pocket a dirty roll of bank notes which carelessly receiving Kostanzhoglo thrust uncounted into the back pocket of his overcoat Hm thought Chichikov For all he cares the notes might have been a handkerchief When Kostanzhoglo appeared at closer quarters that is to say in the doorway of the drawing room he struck Chichikov more than ever with the swarthiness of his complexion the dishevelment of his black slightly grizzled locks the alertness of his eye and the impression of fiery southern origin which his whole personality diffused For he was not wholly a Russian nor could he himself say precisely who his forefathers had been Yet inasmuch as he accounted genealogical research no part of the science of estate management but a mere superfluity he looked upon himself as to all intents and purposes a native of Russia and the more so since the Russian language was the only tongue he knew Platon presented Chichikov and the pair exchanged greetings To get rid of my depression Constantine continued Platon I am thinking of accompanying our guest on a tour through a few of the provinces An excellent idea said Kostanzhoglo But precisely whither he added turning hospitably to Chichikov To tell you the truth replied that personage with an affable inclination of the head as he smoothed the arm of his chair with his hand I am travelling less on my own affairs than on the affairs of others That is to say General Betristchev an intimate friend and I might add a generous benefactor of mine has charged me with commissions to some of his relatives Nevertheless though relatives are relatives I may say that I am travelling on my own account as well in that in addition to possible benefit to my health I desire to see the world and the whirligig of humanity which constitute so to speak a living book a second course of education Yes there is no harm in looking at other corners of the world besides one s own You speak truly There IS no harm in such a proceeding Thereby one may see things which one has not before encountered one may meet men with whom one has not before come in contact And with some men of that kind a conversation is as precious a benefit as has been conferred upon me by the present occasion I come to you most worthy Constantine Thedorovitch for instruction and again for instruction and beg of you to assuage my thirst with an exposition of the truth as it is I hunger for the favour of your words as for manna But how so What can I teach you exclaimed Kostanzhoglo in confusion I myself was given but the plainest of educations Nay most worthy sir you possess wisdom and again wisdom Wisdom only can direct the management of a great estate that can derive a sound income from the same that can acquire wealth of a real not a fictitious order while also fulfilling the duties of a citizen and thereby earning the respect of the Russian public All this I pray you to teach me I tell you what said Kostanzhoglo looking meditatively at his guest You had better stay with me for a few days and during that time I can show you how things are managed here and explain to you everything Then you will see for yourself that no great wisdom is required for the purpose Yes certainly you must stay here put in the lady of the house Then turning to her brother she added And you too must stay Why should you be in such a hurry Very well he replied But what say YOU Paul Ivanovitch I say the same as you and with much pleasure replied Chichikov But also I ought to tell you this that there is a relative of General Betristchev s a certain Colonel Koshkarev Yes we know him but he is quite mad As you say he is mad and I should not have been intending to visit him were it not that General Betristchev is an intimate friend of mine as well as I might add my most generous benefactor Then said Kostanzhoglo do you go and see Colonel Koshkarev NOW He lives less than ten versts from here and I have a gig already harnessed Go to him at once and return here for tea An excellent idea cried Chichikov and with that he seized his cap Half an hour s drive sufficed to bring him to the Colonel s establishment The village attached to the manor was in a state of utter confusion since in every direction building and repairing operations were in progress and the alleys were choked with heaps of lime bricks and beams of wood Also some of the huts were arranged to resemble offices and superscribed in gilt letters Depot for Agricultural Implements Chief Office of Accounts Estate Works Committee Normal School for the Education of Colonists and so forth Chichikov found the Colonel posted behind a desk and holding a pen between his teeth Without an instant s delay the master of the establishment who seemed a kindly approachable man and accorded to his visitor a very civil welcome plunged into a recital of the labour which it had cost him to bring the property to its present condition of affluence Then he went on to lament the fact that he could not make his peasantry understand the incentives to labour which the riches of science and art provide for instance he had failed to induce his female serfs to wear corsets whereas in Germany where he had resided for fourteen years every humble miller s daughter could play the piano None the less he said he meant to peg away until every peasant on the estate should as he walked behind the plough indulge in a regular course of reading Franklin s Notes on Electricity Virgil s Georgics or some work on the chemical properties of soil Good gracious mentally exclaimed Chichikov Why I myself have not had time to finish that book by the Duchesse de la Valliere Much else the Colonel said In particular did he aver that provided the Russian peasant could be induced to array himself in German costume science would progress trade increase and the Golden Age dawn in Russia For a while Chichikov listened with distended eyes Then he felt constrained to intimate that with all that he had nothing to do seeing that his business was merely to acquire a few souls and thereafter to have their purchase confirmed If I understand you aright said the Colonel you wish to present a Statement of Plea Yes that is so Then kindly put it into writing and it shall be forwarded to the Office for the Reception of Reports and Returns Thereafter that Office will consider it and return it to me who will in turn dispatch it to the Estate Works Committee who will in turn revise it and present it to the Administrator who jointly with the Secretary will Pardon me expostulated Chichikov but that procedure will take up a great deal of time Why need I put the matter into writing at all It is simply this I want a few souls which are well which are so to speak dead Very good commented the Colonel Do you write down in your Statement of Plea that the souls which you desire are so to speak dead But what would be the use of my doing so Though the souls are dead my purpose requires that they should be represented as alive Very good again commented the Colonel Do you write down in your Statement that it is necessary or should you prefer an alternative phrase it is requested or it is desiderated or it is prayed that the souls be represented as alive At all events WITHOUT documentary process of that kind the matter cannot possibly be carried through Also I will appoint a Commissioner to guide you round the various Offices And he sounded a bell whereupon there presented himself a man whom addressing as Secretary the Colonel instructed to summon the Commissioner The latter on appearing was seen to have the air half of a peasant half of an official This man the Colonel said to Chichikov will act as your escort What could be done with a lunatic like Koshkarev In the end curiosity moved Chichikov to accompany the Commissioner The Committee for the Reception of Reports and Returns was discovered to have put up its shutters and to have locked its doors for the reason that the Director of the Committee had been transferred to the newly formed Committee of Estate Management and his successor had been annexed by the same Committee Next Chichikov and his escort rapped at the doors of the Department of Estate Affairs but that Department s quarters happened to be in a state of repair and no one could be made to answer the summons save a drunken peasant from whom not a word of sense was to be extracted At length the escort felt himself removed to remark There is a deal of foolishness going on here Fellows like that drunkard lead the barin by the nose and everything is ruled by the Committee of Management which takes men from their proper work and sets them to do any other it likes Indeed only through the Committee does ANYTHING get done By this time Chichikov felt that he had seen enough wherefore he returned to the Colonel and informed him that the Office for the Reception of Reports and Returns had ceased to exist At once the Colonel flamed to noble rage Pressing Chichikov s hand in token of gratitude for the information which the guest had furnished he took paper and pen and noted eight searching questions under three separate headings one Why has the Committee of Management presumed to issue orders to officials not under its jurisdiction two Why has the Chief Manager permitted his predecessor though still in retention of his post to follow him to another Department and three Why has the Committee of Estate Affairs suffered the Office for the Reception of Reports and Returns to lapse Now for a row thought Chichikov to himself and turned to depart but his host stopped him saying I cannot let you go for in addition to my honour having become involved it behoves me to show my people how the regular the organised administration of an estate may be conducted Herewith I will hand over the conduct of your affair to a man who is worth all the rest of the staff put together and has had a university education Also the better to lose no time may I humbly beg you to step into my library where you will find notebooks paper pens and everything else that you may require Of these articles pray make full use for you are a gentleman of letters and it is your and my joint duty to bring enlightenment to all So saying he ushered his guest into a large room lined from floor to ceiling with books and stuffed specimens The books in question were divided into sections a section on forestry a section on cattle breeding a section on the raising of swine and a section on horticulture together with special journals of the type circulated merely for the purposes of reference and not for general reading Perceiving that these works were scarcely of a kind calculated to while away an idle hour Chichikov turned to a second bookcase But to do so was to fall out of the frying pan into the fire for the contents of the second bookcase proved to be works on philosophy while in particular six huge volumes confronted him under a label inscribed A Preparatory Course to the Province of Thought with the Theory of Community of Effort company operation and Subsistence in its Application to a Right Understanding of the Organic Principles of a Mutual Division of Social Productivity Indeed wheresoever Chichikov looked every page presented to his vision some such words as phenomenon development abstract contents and synopsis This is not the sort of thing for me he murmured and turned his attention to a third bookcase which contained books on the Arts Extracting a huge tome in which some by no means reticent mythological illustrations were contained he set himself to examine these pictures They were of the kind which pleases mostly middle aged bachelors and old men who are accustomed to seek in the ballet and similar frivolities a further spur to their waning passions Having concluded his examination Chichikov had just extracted another volume of the same species when Colonel Koshkarev returned with a document of some sort and a radiant countenance Everything has been carried through in due form he cried The man whom I mentioned is a genius indeed and I intend not only to promote him over the rest but also to create for him a special Department Herewith shall you hear what a splendid intellect is his and how in a few minutes he has put the whole affair in order May the Lord be thanked for that thought Chichikov Then he settled himself while the Colonel read aloud After giving full consideration to the Reference which your Excellency has entrusted to me I have the honour to report as follows one In the Statement of Plea presented by one Paul Ivanovitch Chichikov Gentleman Chevalier and Collegiate Councillor there lurks an error in that an oversight has led the Petitioner to apply to Revisional Souls the term Dead Now from the context it would appear that by this term the Petitioner desires to signify Souls Approaching Death rather than Souls Actually Deceased wherefore the term employed betrays such an empirical instruction in letters as must beyond doubt have been confined to the Village School seeing that in truth the Soul is Deathless The rascal Koshkarev broke off to exclaim delightedly He has got you there Monsieur Chichikov And you will admit that he has a sufficiently incisive pen two On this Estate there exist no Unmortgaged Souls whatsoever whether Approaching Death or Otherwise for the reason that all Souls thereon have been pledged not only under a First Deed of Mortgage but also for the sum of One Hundred and Fifty Roubles per Soul under a Second the village of Gurmailovka alone excepted in that in consequence of a Suit having been brought against Landowner Priadistchev and of a caveat having been pronounced by the Land Court and of such caveat having been published in No forty two of the Gazette of Moscow the said Village has come within the Jurisdiction of the Court Above Mentioned Why did you not tell me all this before cried Chichikov furiously Why you have kept me dancing about for nothing Because it was absolutely necessary that you should view the matter through forms of documentary process This is no jest on my part The inexperienced may see things subconsciously yet is imperative that he should also see them CONSCIOUSLY But to Chichikov s patience an end had come Seizing his cap and casting all ceremony to the winds he fled from the house and rushed through the courtyard As it happened the man who had driven him thither had warned by experience not troubled even to take out the horses since he knew that such a proceeding would have entailed not only the presentation of a Statement of Plea for fodder but also a delay of twenty four hours until the Resolution granting the same should have been passed Nevertheless the Colonel pursued his guest to the gates and pressed his hand warmly as he thanked him for having enabled him the Colonel thus to exhibit in operation the proper management of an estate Also he begged to state that under the circumstances it was absolutely necessary to keep things moving and circulating since otherwise slackness was apt to supervene and the working of the machine to grow rusty and feeble but that in spite of all the present occasion had inspired him with a happy idea namely the idea of instituting a Committee which should be entitled The Committee of Supervision of the Committee of Management and which should have for its function the detection of backsliders among the body first mentioned It was late when tired and dissatisfied Chichikov regained Kostanzhoglo s mansion Indeed the candles had long been lit What has delayed you asked the master of the house as Chichikov entered the drawing room Yes what has kept you and the Colonel so long in conversation together added Platon This the fact that never in my life have I come across such an imbecile was Chichikov s reply Never mind said Kostanzhoglo Koshkarev is a most reassuring phenomenon He is necessary in that in him we see expressed in caricature all the more crying follies of our intellectuals of the intellectuals who without first troubling to make themselves acquainted with their own country borrow silliness from abroad Yet that is how certain of our landowners are now carrying on They have set up offices and factories and schools and commissions and the devil knows what else besides A fine lot of wiseacres After the French War in eighteen twelve they had to reconstruct their affairs and see how they have done it Yet so much worse have they done it than a Frenchman would have done that any fool of a Peter Petrovitch Pietukh now ranks as a good landowner But he has mortgaged the whole of his estate remarked Chichikov Yes nowadays everything is being mortgaged or is going to be This said Kostanzhoglo s temper rose still further Out upon your factories of hats and candles he cried Out upon procuring candle makers from London and then turning landowners into hucksters To think of a Russian pomiestchik forty nine a member of the noblest of callings conducting workshops and cotton mills Why it is for the wenches of towns to handle looms for muslin and lace But you yourself maintain workshops remarked Platon I do but who established them They established themselves For instance wool had accumulated and since I had nowhere to store it I began to weave it into cloth but mark you only into good plain cloth of which I can dispose at a cheap rate in the local markets and which is needed by peasants including my own Again for six years on end did the fish factories keep dumping their offal on my bank of the river wherefore at last as there was nothing to be done with it I took to boiling it into glue and cleared forty thousand roubles by the process The devil thought Chichikov to himself as he stared at his host What a fist this man has for making money Another reason why I started those factories continued Kostanzhoglo is that they might give employment to many peasants who would otherwise have starved You see the year happened to have been a lean one thanks to those same industry mongering landowners in that they had neglected to sow their crops and now my factories keep growing at the rate of a factory a year owing to the circumstance that such quantities of remnants and cuttings become so accumulated that if a man looks carefully to his management he will find every sort of rubbish to be capable of bringing in a return yes to the point of his having to reject money on the plea that he has no need of it Yet I do not find that to do all this I require to build a mansion with facades and pillars Marvellous exclaimed Chichikov Beyond all things does it surprise me that refuse can be so utilised Yes and that is what can be done by SIMPLE methods But nowadays every one is a mechanic and wants to open that money chest with an instrument instead of simply For that purpose he hies him to England Yes THAT is the thing to do What folly Kostanzhoglo spat and added Yet when he returns from abroad he is a hundred times more ignorant than when he went Ah Constantine put in his wife anxiously you know how bad for you it is to talk like this Yes but how am I to help losing my temper The thing touches me too closely it vexes me too deeply to think that the Russian character should be degenerating For in that character there has dawned a sort of Quixotism which never used to be there Yes no sooner does a man get a little education into his head than he becomes a Don Quixote and establishes schools on his estate such as even a madman would never have dreamed of And from that school there issues a workman who is good for nothing whether in the country or in the town a fellow who drinks and is for ever standing on his dignity Yet still our landowners keep taking to philanthropy to converting themselves into philanthropic knights errant and spending millions upon senseless hospitals and institutions and so ruining themselves and turning their families adrift Yes that is all that comes of philanthropy Chichikov s business had nothing to do with the spread of enlightenment he was but seeking an opportunity to inquire further concerning the putting of refuse to lucrative uses but Kostanzhoglo would not let him get a word in edgeways so irresistibly did the flow of sarcastic comment pour from the speaker s lips Yes went on Kostanzhoglo folk are always scheming to educate the peasant But first make him well off and a good farmer THEN he will educate himself fast enough As things are now the world has grown stupid to a degree that passes belief Look at the stuff our present day scribblers write Let any sort of a book be published and at once you will see every one making a rush for it Similarly will you find folk saying The peasant leads an over simple life He ought to be familiarised with luxuries and so led to yearn for things above his station And the result of such luxuries will be that the peasant will become a rag rather than a man and suffer from the devil only knows what diseases until there will remain in the land not a boy of eighteen who will not have experienced the whole gamut of them and found himself left with not a tooth in his jaws or a hair on his pate Yes that is what will come of infecting the peasant with such rubbish But thank God there is still one healthy class left to us a class which has never taken up with the advantages of which I speak For that we ought to be grateful And since even yet the Russian agriculturist remains the most respect worthy man in the land why should he be touched Would to God every one were an agriculturist Then you believe agriculture to be the most profitable of occupations said Chichikov The best at all events if not the most profitable In the sweat of thy brow shalt thou till the land To quote that requires no great wisdom for the experience of ages has shown us that in the agricultural calling man has ever remained more moral more pure more noble than in any other Of course I do not mean to imply that no other calling ought to be practised simply that the calling in question lies at the root of all the rest However much factories may be established privately or by the law there will still lie ready to man s hand all that he needs he will still require none of those amenities which are sapping the vitality of our present day folk nor any of those industrial establishments which make their profit and keep themselves going by causing foolish measures to be adopted which in the end are bound to deprave and corrupt our unfortunate masses I myself am determined never to establish any manufacture however profitable which will give rise to a demand for higher things such as sugar and tobacco no not if I lose a million by my refusing to do so If corruption MUST overtake the MIR it shall not be through my hands And I think that God will justify me in my resolve Twenty years have I lived among the common folk and I know what will inevitably come of such things But what surprises me most persisted Chichikov is that from refuse it should be possible with good management to make such an immensity of profit And as for political economy continued Kostanzhoglo without noticing him and with his face charged with bilious sarcasm as for political economy it is a fine thing indeed Just one fool sitting on another fool s back and flogging him along even though the rider can see no further than his own nose Yet into the saddle will that fool climb spectacles and all Oh the folly the folly of such things And the speaker spat derisively That may be true said his wife Yet you must not get angry about it Surely one can speak on such subjects without losing one s temper As I listen to you most worthy Constantine Thedorovitch Chichikov hastened to remark it becomes plain to me that you have penetrated into the meaning of life and laid your finger upon the essential root of the matter Yet supposing for a moment we leave the affairs of humanity in general and turn our attention to a purely individual affair might I ask you how in the case of a man becoming a landowner and having a mind to grow wealthy as quickly as possible in order that he may fulfil his bounden obligations as a citizen he can best set about it How he can best set about growing wealthy repeated Kostanzhoglo Why Let us go to supper interrupted the lady of the house rising from her chair and moving towards the centre of the room where she wrapped her shivering young form in a shawl Chichikov sprang up with the alacrity of a military man offered her his arm and escorted her as on parade to the dining room where awaiting them there was the soup toureen From it the lid had just been removed and the room was redolent of the fragrant odour of early spring roots and herbs The company took their seats and at once the servants placed the remainder of the dishes under covers upon the table and withdrew for Kostanzhoglo hated to have servants listening to their employers conversation and objected still more to their staring at him all the while that he was eating When the soup had been consumed and glasses of an excellent vintage resembling Hungarian wine had been poured out Chichikov said to his host Most worthy sir allow me once more to direct your attention to the subject of which we were speaking at the point when the conversation became interrupted You will remember that I was asking you how best a man can set about proceed in the matter of growing Here from the original two pages are missing A property for which had he asked forty thousand I should still have demanded a reduction Hm thought Chichikov then added aloud But why do you not purchase it yourself Because to everything there must be assigned a limit Already my property keeps me sufficiently employed Moreover I should cause our local dvoriane to begin crying out in chorus that I am exploiting their extremities their ruined position for the purpose of acquiring land for under its value Of that I am weary How readily folk speak evil exclaimed Chichikov Yes and the amount of evil speaking in our province surpasses belief Never will you hear my name mentioned without my being called also a miser and a usurer of the worst possible sort whereas my accusers justify themselves in everything and say that though we have wasted our money we have started a demand for the higher amenities of life and therefore encouraged industry with our wastefulness a far better way of doing things than that practised by Kostanzhoglo who lives like a pig Would I could live in your piggish fashion ejaculated Chichikov And so forth and so forth Yet what are the higher amenities of life What good can they do to any one Even if a landowner of the day sets up a library he never looks at a single book in it but soon relapses into card playing the usual pursuit Yet folk call me names simply because I do not waste my means upon the giving of dinners One reason why I do not give such dinners is that they weary me and another reason is that I am not used to them But come you to my house for the purpose of taking pot luck and I shall be delighted to see you Also folk foolishly say that I lend money on interest whereas the truth is that if you should come to me when you are really in need and should explain to me openly how you propose to employ my money and I should perceive that you are purposing to use that money wisely and that you are really likely to profit thereby well in that case you would find me ready to lend you all that you might ask without interest at all That is a thing which it is well to know reflected Chichikov Yes repeated Kostanzhoglo under those circumstances I should never refuse you my assistance But I do object to throwing my money to the winds Pardon me for expressing myself so plainly To think of lending money to a man who is merely devising a dinner for his mistress or planning to furnish his house like a lunatic or thinking of taking his paramour to a masked ball or a jubilee in honour of some one who had better never have been born And spitting he came near to venting some expression which would scarcely have been becoming in the presence of his wife Over his face the dark shadow of hypochondria had cast a cloud and furrows had formed on his brow and temples and his every gesture bespoke the influence of a hot nervous rancour But allow me once more to direct your attention to the subject of our recently interrupted conversation persisted Chichikov as he sipped a glass of excellent raspberry wine That is to say supposing I were to acquire the property which you have been good enough to bring to my notice how long would it take me to grow rich That would depend on yourself replied Kostanzhoglo with grim abruptness and evident ill humour You might either grow rich quickly or you might never grow rich at all If you made up your mind to grow rich sooner or later you would find yourself a wealthy man Indeed ejaculated Chichikov Yes replied Kostanzhoglo as sharply as though he were angry with Chichikov You would merely need to be fond of work otherwise you would effect nothing The main thing is to like looking after your property Believe me you would never grow weary of doing so People would have it that life in the country is dull whereas if I were to spend a single day as it is spent by some folk with their stupid clubs and their restaurants and their theatres I should die of ennui The fools the idiots the generations of blind dullards But a landowner never finds the days wearisome he has not the time In his life not a moment remains unoccupied it is full to the brim And with it all goes an endless variety of occupations And what occupations Occupations which genuinely uplift the soul seeing that the landowner walks with nature and the seasons of the year and takes part in and is intimate with everything which is evolved by creation For let us look at the round of the year s labours Even before spring has arrived there will have begun a general watching and a waiting for it and a preparing for sowing and an apportioning of crops and a measuring of seed grain by byres and drying of seed and a dividing of the workers into teams For everything needs to be examined beforehand and calculations must be made at the very start And as soon as ever the ice shall have melted and the rivers be flowing and the land have dried sufficiently to be workable the spade will begin its task in kitchen and flower garden and the plough and the harrow their tasks in the field until everywhere there will be tilling and sowing and planting And do you understand what the sum of that labour will mean It will mean that the harvest is being sown that the welfare of the world is being sown that the food of millions is being put into the earth And thereafter will come summer the season of reaping endless reaping for suddenly the crops will have ripened and rye sheaf will be lying heaped upon rye sheaf with elsewhere stocks of barley and of oats and of wheat And everything will be teeming with life and not a moment will there need to be lost seeing that had you even twenty eyes you would have need for them all And after the harvest festivities there will be grain to be carted to byre or stacked in ricks and stores to be prepared for the winter and storehouses and kilns and cattle sheds to be cleaned for the same purpose and the women to be assigned their tasks and the totals of everything to be calculated so that one may see the value of what has been done And lastly will come winter when in every threshing floor the flail will be working and the grain when threshed will need to be carried from barn to binn and the mills require to be seen to and the estate factories to be inspected and the workmen s huts to be visited for the purpose of ascertaining how the muzhik is faring for given a carpenter who is clever with his tools I for one am only too glad to spend an hour or two in his company so cheering to me is labour And if in addition one discerns the end to which everything is moving and the manner in which the things of earth are everywhere multiplying and multiplying and bringing forth more and more fruit to one s profiting I cannot adequately express what takes place in a man s soul And that not because of the growth in his wealth money is money and no more but because he will feel that everything is the work of his own hands and that he has been the cause of everything and its creator and that from him as from a magician there has flowed bounty and goodness for all In what other calling will you find such delights in prospect As he spoke Kostanzhoglo raised his face and it became clear that the wrinkles had fled from it and that like the Tsar on the solemn day of his crowning Kostanzhoglo s whole form was diffusing light and his features had in them a gentle radiance In all the world he repeated you will find no joys like these for herein man imitates the God who projected creation as the supreme happiness and now demands of man that he too should act as the creator of prosperity Yet there are folk who call such functions tedious Kostanzhoglo s mellifluous periods fell upon Chichikov s ear like the notes of a bird of paradise From time to time he gulped and his softened eyes expressed the pleasure which it gave him to listen Constantine it is time to leave the table said the lady of the house rising from her seat Every one followed her example and Chichikov once again acted as his hostess s escort although with less dexterity of deportment than before owing to the fact that this time his thoughts were occupied with more essential matters of procedure In spite of what you say remarked Platon as he walked behind the pair I for my part find these things wearisome But the master of the house paid no attention to his remark for he was reflecting that his guest was no fool but a man of serious thought and speech who did not take things lightly And with the thought Kostanzhoglo grew lighter in soul as though he had warmed himself with his own words and were exulting in the fact that he had found some one capable of listening to good advice When they had settled themselves in the cosy candle lighted drawing room with its balcony and the glass door opening out into the garden a door through which the stars could be seen glittering amid the slumbering tops of the trees Chichikov felt more comfortable than he had done for many a day past It was as though after long journeying his own roof tree had received him once more had received him when his quest had been accomplished when all that he wished for had been gained when his travelling staff had been laid aside with the words It is finished And of this seductive frame of mind the true source had been the eloquent discourse of his hospitable host Yes for every man there exist certain things which instantly that they are said seem to touch him more closely more intimately than anything has done before Nor is it an uncommon occurrence that in the most unexpected fashion and in the most retired of retreats one will suddenly come face to face with a man whose burning periods will lead one to forget oneself and the tracklessness of the route and the discomfort of one s nightly halting places and the futility of crazes and the falseness of tricks by which one human being deceives another And at once there will become engraven upon one s memory vividly and for all time the evening thus spent And of that evening one s remembrance will hold true both as to who was present and where each such person sat and what he or she was wearing and what the walls and the stove and other trifling features of the room looked like In the same way did Chichikov note each detail that evening both the appointments of the agreeable but not luxuriously furnished room and the good humoured expression which reigned on the face of the thoughtful host and the design of the curtains and the amber mounted pipe smoked by Platon and the way in which he kept puffing smoke into the fat jowl of the dog Yarb and the sneeze which on each such occasion Yarb vented and the laughter of the pleasant faced hostess though always followed by the words Pray do not tease him any more and the cheerful candle light and the cricket chirping in a corner and the glass door and the spring night which laying its elbows upon the tree tops and spangled with stars and vocal with the nightingales which were pouring forth warbled ditties from the recesses of the foliage kept glancing through the door and regarding the company within How it delights me to hear your words good Constantine Thedorovitch said Chichikov Indeed nowhere in Russia have I met with a man of equal intellect Kostanzhoglo smiled while realising that the compliment was scarcely deserved If you want a man of GENUINE intellect he said I can tell you of one He is a man whose boot soles are worth more than my whole body Who may he be asked Chichikov in astonishment Murazov our local Commissioner of Taxes Ah I have heard of him before remarked Chichikov He is a man who were he not the director of an estate might well be a director of the Empire And were the Empire under my direction I should at once appoint him my Minister of Finance I have heard tales beyond belief concerning him for instance that he has acquired ten million roubles Ten More than forty Soon half Russia will be in his hands You don t say so cried Chichikov in amazement Yes certainly The man who has only a hundred thousand roubles to work with grows rich but slowly whereas he who has millions at his disposal can operate over a greater radius and so back whatsoever he undertakes with twice or thrice the money which can be brought against him Consequently his field becomes so spacious that he ends by having no rivals Yes no one can compete with him and whatsoever price he may fix for a given commodity at that price it will have to remain nor will any man be able to outbid it My God muttered Chichikov crossing himself and staring at Kostanzhoglo with his breath catching in his throat The mind cannot grasp it it petrifies one s thoughts with awe You see folk marvelling at what Science has achieved in the matter of investigating the habits of cowbugs but to me it is a far more marvellous thing that in the hands of a single mortal there can become accumulated such gigantic sums of money But may I ask whether the great fortune of which you speak has been acquired through honest means Yes through means of the most irreproachable kind through the most honourable of methods Yet so improbable does it seem that I can scarcely believe it Thousands I could understand but millions On the contrary to make thousands honestly is a far more difficult matter than to make millions Millions are easily come by for a millionaire has no need to resort to crooked ways the way lies straight before him and he needs but to annex whatsoever he comes across No rival will spring up to oppose him for no rival will be sufficiently strong and since the millionaire can operate over an extensive radius he can bring as I have said two or three roubles to bear upon any one else s one Consequently what interest will he derive from a thousand roubles Why ten or twenty per cent at the least And it is beyond measure marvellous that the whole should have started from a single kopeck Had it started otherwise the thing could never have been done at all Such is the normal course He who is born with thousands and is brought up to thousands will never acquire a single kopeck more for he will have been set up with the amenities of life in advance and so never come to stand in need of anything It is necessary to begin from the beginning rather than from the middle from a kopeck rather than from a rouble from the bottom rather than from the top For only thus will a man get to know the men and conditions among which his career will have to be carved That is to say through encountering the rough and the tumble of life and through learning that every kopeck has to be beaten out with a three kopeck nail and through worsting knave after knave he will acquire such a degree of perspicuity and wariness that he will err in nothing which he may tackle and never come to ruin Believe me it is so The beginning and not the middle is the right starting point No one who comes to me and says Give me a hundred thousand roubles and I will grow rich in no time do I believe for he is likely to meet with failure rather than with the success of which he is so assured Tis with a kopeck and with a kopeck only that a man must begin If that is so I shall grow rich said Chichikov involuntarily remembering the dead souls For of a surety I began with nothing Constantine pray allow Paul Ivanovitch to retire to rest put in the lady of the house It is high time and I am sure you have talked enough Yes beyond a doubt you will grow rich continued Kostanzhoglo without heeding his wife For towards you there will run rivers and rivers of gold until you will not know what to do with all your gains As though spellbound Chichikov sat in an aureate world of ever growing dreams and fantasies All his thoughts were in a whirl and on a carpet of future wealth his tumultuous imagination was weaving golden patterns while ever in his ears were ringing the words towards you there will run rivers and rivers of gold Really Constantine DO allow Paul Ivanovitch to go to bed What on earth is the matter retorted the master of the household testily Pray go yourself if you wish to Then he stopped short for the snoring of Platon was filling the whole room and also outrivalling it that of the dog Yarb This caused Kostanzhoglo to realise that bedtime really had arrived wherefore after he had shaken Platon out of his slumbers and bidden Chichikov good night all dispersed to their several chambers and became plunged in sleep All that is to say except Chichikov whose thoughts remained wakeful and who kept wondering and wondering how best he could become the owner not of a fictitious but of a real estate The conversation with his host had made everything clear had made the possibility of his acquiring riches manifest had made the difficult art of estate management at once easy and understandable until it would seem as though particularly was his nature adapted for mastering the art in question All that he would need to do would be to mortgage the dead souls and then to set up a genuine establishment Already he saw himself acting and administering as Kostanzhoglo had advised him energetically and through personal oversight and undertaking nothing new until the old had been thoroughly learned and viewing everything with his own eyes and making himself familiar with each member of his peasantry and abjuring all superfluities and giving himself up to hard work and husbandry Yes already could he taste the pleasure which would be his when he had built up a complete industrial organisation and the springs of the industrial machine were in vigorous working order and each had become able to reinforce the other Labour should be kept in active operation and even as in a mill flour comes flowing from grain so should cash and yet more cash come flowing from every atom of refuse and remnant And all the while he could see before him the landowner who was one of the leading men in Russia and for whom he had conceived such an unbounded respect Hitherto only for rank or for opulence had Chichikov respected a man never for mere intellectual power but now he made a first exception in favour of Kostanzhoglo seeing that he felt that nothing undertaken by his host could possibly come to naught And another project which was occupying Chichikov s mind was the project of purchasing the estate of a certain landowner named Khlobuev Already Chichikov had at his disposal ten thousand roubles and a further fifteen thousand he would try and borrow of Kostanzhoglo seeing that the latter had himself said that he was prepared to help any one who really desired to grow rich while as for the remainder he would either raise the sum by mortgaging the estate or force Khlobuev to wait for it just to tell him to resort to the courts if such might be his pleasure Long did our hero ponder the scheme until at length the slumber which had these four hours past been holding the rest of the household in its embraces enfolded also Chichikov and he sank into oblivion CHAPTER IV Next day with Platon and Constantine Chichikov set forth to interview Khlobuev the owner whose estate Constantine had consented to help Chichikov to purchase with a non interest bearing uncovenanted loan of ten thousand roubles Naturally our hero was in the highest of spirits For the first fifteen versts or so the road led through forest land and tillage belonging to Platon and his brother in law but directly the limit of these domains was reached forest land began to be replaced with swamp and tillage with waste Also the village in Khlobuev s estate had about it a deserted air and as for the proprietor himself he was discovered in a state of drowsy dishevelment having not long left his bed A man of about forty he had his cravat crooked his frockcoat adorned with a large stain and one of his boots worn through Nevertheless he seemed delighted to see his visitors What he exclaimed Constantine Thedorovitch and Platon Mikhalitch Really I must rub my eyes Never again in this world did I look to see callers arriving As a rule folk avoid me like the devil for they cannot disabuse their minds of the idea that I am going to ask them for a loan Yes it is my own fault I know but what would you To the end will swine cheat swine Pray excuse my costume You will observe that my boots are in holes But how can I afford to get them mended Never mind said Constantine We have come on business only May I present to you a possible purchaser of your estate in the person of Paul Ivanovitch Chichikov I am indeed glad to meet you was Khlobuev s response Pray shake hands with me Paul Ivanovitch Chichikov offered one hand but not both I can show you a property worth your attention went on the master of the estate May I ask if you have yet dined Yes we have put in Constantine desirous of escaping as soon as possible To save you further trouble let us go and view the estate at once Very well replied Khlobuev Pray come and inspect my irregularities and futilities You have done well to dine beforehand for not so much as a fowl is left in the place so dire are the extremities to which you see me reduced Sighing deeply he took Platon by the arm it was clear that he did not look for any sympathy from Constantine and walked ahead while Constantine and Chichikov followed Things are going hard with me Platon Mikhalitch continued Khlobuev How hard you cannot imagine No money have I no food no boots Were I still young and a bachelor it would have come easy to me to live on bread and cheese but when a man is growing old and has got a wife and five children such trials press heavily upon him and in spite of himself his spirits sink But should you succeed in selling the estate that would help to put you right would it not said Platon How could it do so replied Khlobuev with a despairing gesture What I might get for the property would have to go towards discharging my debts and I should find myself left with less than a thousand roubles besides Then what do you intend to do God knows But is there NOTHING to which you could set your hand in order to clear yourself of your difficulties How could there be Well you might accept a Government post Become a provincial secretary you mean How could I obtain such a post They would not offer me one of the meanest possible kind Even supposing that they did how could I live on a salary of five hundred roubles I who have a wife and five children Then try and obtain a bailiff s post Who would entrust their property to a man who has squandered his own estate Nevertheless when death and destitution threaten a man must either do something or starve Shall I ask my brother to use his influence to procure you a post No no Platon Mikhalitch sighed Khlobuev gripping the other s hand I am no longer serviceable I am grown old before my time and find that liver and rheumatism are paying me for the sins of my youth Why should the Government be put to a loss on my account not to speak of the fact that for every salaried post there are countless numbers of applicants God forbid that in order to provide me with a livelihood further burdens should be imposed upon an impoverished public Such are the results of improvident management thought Platon to himself The disease is even worse than my slothfulness Meanwhile Kostanzhoglo walking by Chichikov s side was almost taking leave of his senses Look at it he cried with a wave of his hand See to what wretchedness the peasant has become reduced Should cattle disease come Khlobuev will have nothing to fall back upon but will be forced to sell his all to leave the peasant without a horse and therefore without the means to labour even though the loss of a single day s work may take years of labour to rectify Meanwhile it is plain that the local peasant has become a mere dissolute lazy drunkard Give a muzhik enough to live upon for twelve months without working and you will corrupt him for ever so inured to rags and vagrancy will he grow And what is the good of that piece of pasture there of that piece on the further side of those huts It is a mere flooded tract Were it mine I should put it under flax and clear five thousand roubles or else sow it with turnips and clear perhaps four thousand And see how the rye is drooping and nearly laid As for wheat I am pretty sure that he has not sown any Look too at those ravines Were they mine they would be standing under timber which even a rook could not top To think of wasting such quantities of land Where land wouldn t bear corn I should dig it up and plant it with vegetables What ought to be done is that Khlobuev ought to take a spade into his own hands and to set his wife and children and servants to do the same and even if they died of the exertion they would at least die doing their duty and not through guzzling at the dinner table This said Kostanzhoglo spat and his brow flushed with grim indignation Presently they reached an elevation whence the distant flashing of a river with its flood waters and subsidiary streams caught the eye while further off a portion of General Betristchev s homestead could be discerned among the trees and over it a blue densely wooded hill which Chichikov guessed to be the spot where Tientietnikov s mansion was situated This is where I should plant timber said Chichikov And regarded as a site for a manor house the situation could scarcely be beaten for beauty of view You seem to get great store upon views and beauty remarked Kostanzhoglo with reproof in his tone Should you pay too much attention to those things you might find yourself without crops or view Utility should be placed first not beauty Beauty will come of itself Take for example towns The fairest and most beautiful towns are those which have built themselves those in which each man has built to suit his own exclusive circumstances and needs whereas towns which men have constructed on regular string taut lines are no better than collections of barracks Put beauty aside and look only to what is NECESSARY Yes but to me it would always be irksome to have to wait All the time that I was doing so I should be hungering to see in front of the me the sort of prospect which I prefer Come come Are you a man of twenty five you who have served as a tchinovnik in saint Petersburg Have patience have patience For six years work and work hard Plant sow and dig the earth without taking a moment s rest It will be difficult I know yes difficult indeed but at the end of that time if you have thoroughly stirred the soil the land will begin to help you as nothing else can do That is to say over and above your seventy or so pairs of hands there will begin to assist in the work seven hundred pairs of hands which you cannot see Thus everything will be multiplied tenfold I myself have ceased even to have to lift a finger for whatsoever needs to be done gets done of itself Nature loves patience always remember that It is a law given her of God Himself who has blessed all those who are strong to endure To hear your words is to be both encouraged and strengthened said Chichikov To this Kostanzhoglo made no reply but presently went on And see how that piece of land has been ploughed To stay here longer is more than I can do For me to have to look upon such want of orderliness and foresight is death Finish your business with Khlobuev without me and whatsoever you do get this treasure out of that fool s hands as quickly as possible for he is dishonouring God s gifts And Kostanzhoglo his face dark with the rage that was seething in his excitable soul left Chichikov and caught up the owner of the establishment What Constantine Thedorovitch cried Khlobuev in astonishment Just arrived you are going already Yes I cannot help it urgent business requires me at home And entering his gig Kostanzhoglo drove rapidly away Somehow Khlobuev seemed to divine the cause of his sudden departure It was too much for him he remarked An agriculturist of that kind does not like to have to look upon the results of such feckless management as mine Would you believe it Paul Ivanovitch but this year I have been unable to sow any wheat Am I not a fine husbandman There was no seed for the purpose nor yet anything with which to prepare the ground No I am not like Constantine Thedorovitch who I hear is a perfect Napoleon in his particular line Again and again the thought occurs to me Why has so much intellect been put into that head and only a drop or two into my own dull pate Take care of that puddle gentlemen I have told my peasants to lay down planks for the spring but they have not done so Nevertheless my heart aches for the poor fellows for they need a good example and what sort of an example am I How am I to give them orders Pray take them under your charge Paul Ivanovitch for I cannot teach them orderliness and method when I myself lack both As a matter of fact I should have given them their freedom long ago had there been any use in my doing so for even I can see that peasants must first be afforded the means of earning a livelihood before they can live What they need is a stern yet just master who shall live with them day in day out and set them an example of tireless energy The present day Russian I know of it myself is helpless without a driver Without one he falls asleep and the mould grows over him Yet I cannot understand WHY he should fall asleep and grow mouldy in that fashion said Platon Why should he need continual surveillance to keep him from degenerating into a drunkard and a good for nothing The cause is lack of enlightenment said Chichikov Possibly only God knows Yet enlightenment has reached us right enough Do we not attend university lectures and everything else that is befitting Take my own education I learnt not only the usual things but also the art of spending money upon the latest refinement the latest amenity the art of familiarising oneself with whatsoever money can buy How then can it be said that I was educated foolishly And my comrades education was the same A few of them succeeded in annexing the cream of things for the reason that they had the wit to do so and the rest spent their time in doing their best to ruin their health and squander their money Often I think there is no hope for the present day Russian While desiring to do everything he accomplishes nothing One day he will scheme to begin a new mode of existence a new dietary yet before evening he will have so over eaten himself as to be unable to speak or do aught but sit staring like an owl The same with every one Quite so agreed Chichikov with a smile Tis everywhere the same story To tell the truth we are not born to common sense I doubt whether Russia has ever produced a really sensible man For my own part if I see my neighbour living a regular life and making money and saving it I begin to distrust him and to feel certain that in old age if not before he too will be led astray by the devil led astray in a moment Yes whether or not we be educated there is something we lack But what that something is passes my understanding On the return journey the prospect was the same as before Everywhere the same slovenliness the same disorder was displaying itself unadorned the only difference being that a fresh puddle had formed in the middle of the village street This want and neglect was noticeable in the peasants quarters equally with the quarters of the barin In the village a furious woman in greasy sackcloth was beating a poor young wench within an ace of her life and at the same time devoting some third person to the care of all the devils in hell further away a couple of peasants were stoically contemplating the virago one scratching his rump as he did so and the other yawning The same yawn was discernible in the buildings for not a roof was there but had a gaping hole in it As he gazed at the scene Platon himself yawned Patch was superimposed upon patch and in place of a roof one hut had a piece of wooden fencing while its crumbling window frames were stayed with sticks purloined from the barin s barn Evidently the system of upkeep in vogue was the system employed in the case of Trishkin s coat the system of cutting up the cuffs and the collar into mendings for the elbows No I do not admire your way of doing things was Chichikov s unspoken comment when the inspection had been concluded and the party had re entered the house Everywhere in the latter the visitors were struck with the way in which poverty went with glittering fashionable profusion On a writing table lay a volume of Shakespeare and on an occasional table a carved ivory back scratcher The hostess too was elegantly and fashionably attired and devoted her whole conversation to the town and the local theatre Lastly the children bright merry little things were well dressed both as regards boys and girls Yet far better would it have been for them if they had been clad in plain striped smocks and running about the courtyard like peasant children Presently a visitor arrived in the shape of a chattering gossiping woman whereupon the hostess carried her off to her own portion of the house and the children following them the men found themselves alone How much do you want for the property asked Chichikov of Khlobuev I am afraid I must request you to name the lowest possible sum since I find the estate in a far worse condition than I had expected to do Yes it IS in a terrible state agreed Khlobuev Nor is that the whole of the story That is to say I will not conceal from you the fact that out of a hundred souls registered at the last revision only fifty survive so terrible have been the ravages of cholera And of these again some have absconded wherefore they too must be reckoned as dead seeing that were one to enter process against them the costs would end in the property having to pass en bloc to the legal authorities For these reasons I am asking only thirty five thousand roubles for the estate Chichikov it need hardly be said started to haggle Thirty five thousand he cried Come come Surely you will accept TWENTY five thousand This was too much for Platon s conscience Now now Paul Ivanovitch he exclaimed Take the property at the price named and have done with it The estate is worth at least that amount so much so that should you not be willing to give it my brother in law and I will club together to effect the purchase That being so said Chichikov taken aback I beg to agree to the price in question At the same time I must ask you to allow me to defer payment of one half of the purchase money until a year from now No no Paul Ivanovitch Under no circumstances could I do that Pay me half now and the rest in fifty You see I need the money for the redemption of the mortgage That places me in a difficulty remarked Chichikov Ten thousand roubles is all that at the moment I have available As a matter of fact this was not true seeing that counting also the money which he had borrowed of Kostanzhoglo he had at his disposal TWENTY thousand His real reason for hesitating was that he disliked the idea of making so large a payment in a lump sum I must repeat my request Paul Ivanovitch said Khlobuev namely that you pay me at least fifteen thousand immediately The odd five thousand I will lend you put in Platon to Chichikov Indeed exclaimed Chichikov as he reflected So he also lends money In the end Chichikov s dispatch box was brought from the koliaska and Khlobuev received thence ten thousand roubles together with a promise that the remaining five thousand should be forthcoming on the morrow though the promise was given only after Chichikov had first proposed that THREE thousand should be brought on the day named and the rest be left over for two or three days longer if not for a still more protracted period The truth was that Paul Ivanovitch hated parting with money No matter how urgent a situation might have been he would still have preferred to pay a sum to morrow rather than to day In other words he acted as we all do for we all like keeping a petitioner waiting Let him rub his back in the hall for a while we say Surely he can bide his time a little Yet of the fact that every hour may be precious to the poor wretch and that his business may suffer from the delay we take no account Good sir we say pray come again to morrow To day I have no time to spare you Where do you intend henceforth to live inquired Platon Have you any other property to which you can retire No replied Khlobuev I shall remove to the town where I possess a small villa That would have been necessary in any case for the children s sake You see they must have instruction in God s word and also lessons in music and dancing and not for love or money can these things be procured in the country Nothing to eat yet dancing lessons for his children reflected Chichikov An extraordinary man was Platon s unspoken comment However we must contrive to wet our bargain somehow continued Khlobuev Hi Kirushka Bring that bottle of champagne Nothing to eat yet champagne to drink reflected Chichikov As for Platon he did not know WHAT to think In Khlobuev s eyes it was de rigueur that he should provide a guest with champagne but though he had sent to the town for some he had been met with a blank refusal to forward even a bottle of kvass on credit Only the discovery of a French dealer who had recently transferred his business from saint Petersburg and opened a connection on a system of general credit saved the situation by placing Khlobuev under the obligation of patronising him The company drank three glassfuls apiece and so grew more cheerful In particular did Khlobuev expand and wax full of civility and friendliness and scatter witticisms and anecdotes to right and left What knowledge of men and the world did his utterances display How well and accurately could he divine things With what appositeness did he sketch the neighbouring landowners How clearly he exposed their faults and failings How thoroughly he knew the story of certain ruined gentry the story of how why and through what cause they had fallen upon evil days With what comic originality could he describe their little habits and customs In short his guests found themselves charmed with his discourse and felt inclined to vote him a man of first rate intellect What most surprises me said Chichikov is how in view of your ability you come to be so destitute of means or resources But I have plenty of both said Khlobuev and with that went on to deliver himself of a perfect avalanche of projects Yet those projects proved to be so uncouth so clumsy so little the outcome of a knowledge of men and things that his hearers could only shrug their shoulders and mentally exclaim Good Lord What a difference between worldly wisdom and the capacity to use it In every case the projects in question were based upon the imperative necessity of at once procuring from somewhere two hundred or at least one hundred thousand roubles That done so Khlobuev averred everything would fall into its proper place the holes in his pockets would become stopped his income would be quadrupled and he would find himself in a position to liquidate his debts in full Nevertheless he ended by saying What would you advise me to do I fear that the philanthropist who would lend me two hundred thousand roubles or even a hundred thousand does not exist It is not God s will that he should Good gracious inwardly ejaculated Chichikov To suppose that God would send such a fool two hundred thousand roubles However went on Khlobuev I possess an aunt worth three millions a pious old woman who gives freely to churches and monasteries but finds a difficulty in helping her neighbour At the same time she is a lady of the old school and worth having a peep at Her canaries alone number four hundred and in addition there is an army of pug dogs hangers on and servants Even the youngest of the servants is sixty but she calls them all young fellows and if a guest happens to offend her during dinner she orders them to leave him out when handing out the dishes THERE S a woman for you Platon laughed And what may her family name be asked Chichikov And where does she live She lives in the county town and her name is Alexandra Ivanovna Khanasarov Then why do you not apply to her asked Platon earnestly It seems to me that once she realised the position of your family she could not possibly refuse you Alas nothing is to be looked for from that quarter replied Khlobuev My aunt is of a very stubborn disposition a perfect stone of a woman Moreover she has around her a sufficient band of favourites already In particular is there a fellow who is aiming for a Governorship and to that end has managed to insinuate himself into the circle of her kinsfolk By the way the speaker added turning to Platon would you do me a favour Next week I am giving a dinner to the associated guilds of the town Platon stared He had been unaware that both in our capitals and in our provincial towns there exists a class of men whose lives are an enigma men who though they will seem to have exhausted their substance and to have become enmeshed in debt will suddenly be reported as in funds and on the point of giving a dinner And though at this dinner the guests will declare that the festival is bound to be their host s last fling and that for a certainty he will be haled to prison on the morrow ten years or more will elapse and the rascal will still be at liberty even though in the meanwhile his debts will have increased In the same way did the conduct of Khlobuev s menage afford a curious phenomenon for one day the house would be the scene of a solemn Te Deum performed by a priest in vestments and the next of a stage play performed by a troupe of French actors in theatrical costume Again one day would see not a morsel of bread in the house and the next day a banquet and generous largesse given to a party of artists and sculptors During these seasons of scarcity sufficiently severe to have led any one but Khlobuev to seek suicide by hanging or shooting the master of the house would be preserved from rash action by his strongly religious disposition which contriving in some curious way to conform with his irregular mode of life enabled him to fall back upon reading the lives of saints ascetics and others of the type which has risen superior to its misfortunes And at such times his spirit would become softened his thoughts full of gentleness and his eyes wet with tears he would fall to saying his prayers and invariably some strange coincidence would bring an answer thereto in the shape of an unexpected measure of assistance That is to say some former friend of his would remember him and send him a trifle in the way of money or else some female visitor would be moved by his story to let her impulsive generous heart proffer him a handsome gift or else a suit whereof tidings had never even reached his ears would end by being decided in his favour And when that happened he would reverently acknowledge the immensity of the mercy of Providence gratefully tender thanksgiving for the same and betake himself again to his irregular mode of existence Somehow I feel sorry for the man said Platon when he and Chichikov had taken leave of their host and left the house Perhaps so but he is a hopeless prodigal replied the other Personally I find it impossible to compassionate such fellows And with that the pair ceased to devote another thought to Khlobuev In the case of Platon this was because he contemplated the fortunes of his fellows with the lethargic half somnolent eye which he turned upon all the rest of the world for though the sight of distress of others would cause his heart to contract and feel full of sympathy the impression thus produced never sank into the depths of his being Accordingly before many minutes were over he had ceased to bestow a single thought upon his late host With Chichikov however things were different Whereas Platon had ceased to think of Khlobuev no more than he had ceased to think of himself Chichikov s mind had strayed elsewhere for the reason that it had become taken up with grave meditation on the subject of the purchase just made Suddenly finding himself no longer a fictitious proprietor but the owner of a real an actually existing estate he became contemplative and his plans and ideas assumed such a serious vein as imparted to his features an unconsciously important air Patience and hard work he muttered to himself The thing will not be difficult for with those two requisites I have been familiar from the days of my swaddling clothes Yes no novelty will they be to me Yet in middle age shall I be able to compass the patience whereof I was capable in my youth However no matter how he regarded the future and no matter from what point of view he considered his recent acquisition he could see nothing but advantage likely to accrue from the bargain For one thing he might be able to proceed so that first the whole of the estate should be mortgaged and then the better portions of land sold outright Or he might so contrive matters as to manage the property for a while and thus become a landowner like Kostanzhoglo whose advice as his neighbour and his benefactor he intended always to follow and then to dispose of the property by private treaty provided he did not wish to continue his ownership and still to retain in his hands the dead and abandoned souls And another possible coup occurred to his mind That is to say he might contrive to withdraw from the district without having repaid Kostanzhoglo at all Truly a splendid idea Yet it is only fair to say that the idea was not one of Chichikov s own conception Rather it had presented itself mocking laughing and winking unbidden Yet the impudent the wanton thing Who is the procreator of suddenly born ideas of the kind The thought that he was now a real an actual proprietor instead of a fictitious that he was now a proprietor of real land real rights of timber and pasture and real serfs who existed not only in the imagination but also in veritable actuality greatly elated our hero So he took to dancing up and down in his seat to rubbing his hands together to winking at himself to holding his fist trumpet wise to his mouth while making believe to execute a march and even to uttering aloud such encouraging nicknames and phrases as bulldog and little fat capon Then suddenly recollecting that he was not alone he hastened to moderate his behaviour and endeavoured to stifle the endless flow of his good spirits with the result that when Platon mistaking certain sounds for utterances addressed to himself inquired what his companion had said the latter retained the presence of mind to reply Nothing Presently as Chichikov gazed about him he saw that for some time past the koliaska had been skirting a beautiful wood and that on either side the road was bordered with an edging of birch trees the tenderly green recently opened leaves of which caused their tall slender trunks to show up with the whiteness of a snowdrift Likewise nightingales were warbling from the recesses of the foliage and some wood tulips were glowing yellow in the grass Next and almost before Chichikov had realised how he came to be in such a beautiful spot when but a moment before there had been visible only open fields there glimmered among the trees the stony whiteness of a church with on the further side of it the intermittent foliage buried line of a fence while from the upper end of a village street there was advancing to meet the vehicle a gentleman with a cap on his head a knotted cudgel in his hands and a slender limbed English dog by his side This is my brother said Platon Stop coachman And he descended from the koliaska while Chichikov followed his example Yarb and the strange dog saluted one another and then the active thin legged slender tongued Azor relinquished his licking of Yarb s blunt jowl licked Platon s hands instead and leaping upon Chichikov slobbered right into his ear The two brothers embraced Really Platon said the gentleman whose name was Vassili what do you mean by treating me like this How so said Platon indifferently What For three days past I have seen and heard nothing of you A groom from Pietukh s brought your cob home and told me you had departed on an expedition with some barin At least you might have sent me word as to your destination and the probable length of your absence What made you act so God knows what I have not been wondering Does it matter rejoined Platon I forgot to send you word and we have been no further than Constantine s who with our sister sends you his greeting By the way may I introduce Paul Ivanovitch Chichikov The pair shook hands with one another Then doffing their caps they embraced What sort of man is this Chichikov thought Vassili As a rule my brother Platon is not over nice in his choice of acquaintances And eyeing our hero as narrowly as civility permitted he saw that his appearance was that of a perfectly respectable individual Chichikov returned Vassili s scrutiny with a similar observance of the dictates of civility and perceived that he was shorter than Platon that his hair was of a darker shade and that his features though less handsome contained far more life animation and kindliness than did his brother s Clearly he indulged in less dreaming though that was an aspect which Chichikov little regarded I have made up my mind to go touring our Holy Russia with Paul Ivanovitch said Platon Perhaps it will rid me of my melancholy What has made you come to such a sudden decision asked the perplexed Vassili very nearly he added Fancy going travelling with a man whose acquaintance you have just made and who may turn out to be a rascal or the devil knows what But in spite of his distrust he contented himself with another covert scrutiny of Chichikov and this time came to the conclusion that there was no fault to be found with his exterior The party turned to the right and entered the gates of an ancient courtyard attached to an old fashioned house of a type no longer built the type which has huge gables supporting a high pitched roof In the centre of the courtyard two great lime trees covered half the surrounding space with shade while beneath them were ranged a number of wooden benches and the whole was encircled with a ring of blossoming lilacs and cherry trees which like a beaded necklace reinforced the wooden fence and almost buried it beneath their clusters of leaves and flowers The house too stood almost concealed by this greenery except that the front door and the windows peered pleasantly through the foliage and that here and there between the stems of the trees there could be caught glimpses of the kitchen regions the storehouses and the cellar Lastly around the whole stood a grove from the recesses of which came the echoing songs of nightingales Involuntarily the place communicated to the soul a sort of quiet restful feeling so eloquently did it speak of that care free period when every one lived on good terms with his neighbour and all was simple and unsophisticated Vassili invited Chichikov to seat himself and the party approached for that purpose the benches under the lime trees after which a youth of about seventeen and clad in a red shirt brought decanters containing various kinds of kvass some of them as thick as syrup and others hissing like aerated lemonade deposited the same upon the table and taking up a spade which he had left leaning against a tree moved away towards the garden The reason of this was that in the brothers household as in that of Kostanzhoglo no servants were kept since the whole staff were rated as gardeners and performed that duty in rotation Vassili holding that domestic service was not a specialised calling but one to which any one might contribute a hand and therefore one which did not require special menials to be kept for the purpose Moreover he held that the average Russian peasant remains active and willing rather than lazy only so long as he wears a shirt and a peasant s smock but that as soon as ever he finds himself put into a German tailcoat he becomes awkward sluggish indolent disinclined to change his vest or take a bath fond of sleeping in his clothes and certain to breed fleas and bugs under the German apparel And it may be that Vassili was right At all events the brothers peasantry were exceedingly well clad the women in particular having their head dresses spangled with gold and the sleeves of their blouses embroidered after the fashion of a Turkish shawl You see here the species of kvass for which our house has long been famous said Vassili to Chichikov The latter poured himself out a glassful from the first decanter which he lighted upon and found the contents to be linden honey of a kind never tasted by him even in Poland seeing that it had a sparkle like that of champagne and also an effervescence which sent a pleasant spray from the mouth into the nose Nectar he proclaimed Then he took some from a second decanter It proved to be even better than the first A beverage of beverages he exclaimed At your respected brother in law s I tasted the finest syrup which has ever come my way but here I have tasted the very finest kvass Yet the recipe for the syrup also came from here said Vassili seeing that my sister took it with her By the way to what part of the country and to what places are you thinking of travelling To tell the truth replied Chichikov rocking himself to and fro on the bench and smoothing his knee with his hand and gently inclining his head I am travelling less on my own affairs than on the affairs of others That is to say General Betristchev an intimate friend and I might add a generous benefactor of mine has charged me with commissions to some of his relatives Nevertheless though relatives are relatives I may say that I am travelling on my own account as well in that in addition to possible benefit to my health I desire to see the world and the whirligig of humanity which constitute to so speak a living book a second course of education Vassili took thought The man speaks floridly he reflected yet his words contain a certain element of truth After a moment s silence he added to Platon I am beginning to think that the tour might help you to bestir yourself At present you are in a condition of mental slumber You have fallen asleep not so much from weariness or satiety as through a lack of vivid perceptions and impressions For myself I am your complete antithesis I should be only too glad if I could feel less acutely if I could take things less to heart Emotion has become a disease with you said Platon You seek your own troubles and make your own anxieties How can you say that when ready made anxieties greet one at every step exclaimed Vassili For example have you heard of the trick which Lienitsin has just played us of his seizing the piece of vacant land whither our peasants resort for their sports That piece I would not sell for all the money in the world It has long been our peasants play ground and all the traditions of our village are bound up with it Moreover for me old custom is a sacred thing for which I would gladly sacrifice everything else Lienitsin cannot have known of this or he would not have seized the land said Platon He is a newcomer just arrived from saint Petersburg A few words of explanation ought to meet the case But he DOES know of what I have stated he DOES know of it Purposely I sent him word to that affect yet he has returned me the rudest of answers Then go yourself and explain matters to him No I will not do that he has tried to carry off things with too high a hand But YOU can go if you like I would certainly go were it not that I scarcely like to interfere Also I am a man whom he could easily hoodwink and outwit Would it help you if I were to go put in Chichikov Pray enlighten me as to the matter Vassili glanced at the speaker and thought to himself What a passion the man has for travelling Yes pray give me an idea of the kind of fellow repeated Chichikov and also outline to me the affair I should be ashamed to trouble you with such an unpleasant commission replied Vassili He is a man whom I take to be an utter rascal Originally a member of a family of plain dvoriane in this province he entered the Civil Service in saint Petersburg then married some one s natural daughter in that city and has returned to lord it with a high hand I cannot bear the tone he adopts Our folk are by no means fools They do not look upon the current fashion as the Tsar s ukaz any more than they look upon saint Petersburg as the Church Naturally said Chichikov But tell me more of the particulars of the quarrel They are these He needs additional land and had he not acted as he has done I would have given him some land elsewhere for nothing but as it is the pestilent fellow has taken it into his head to I think I had better go and have a talk with him That might settle the affair Several times have people charged me with similar commissions and never have they repented of it General Betristchev is an example Nevertheless I am ashamed that you should be put to the annoyance of having to converse with such a fellow At this point there occurs a long hiatus And above all things such a transaction would need to be carried through in secret said Chichikov True the law does not forbid such things but there is always the risk of a scandal Quite so quite so said Lienitsin with head bent down Then we agree exclaimed Chichikov How charming As I say my business is both legal and illegal Though needing to effect a mortgage I desire to put no one to the risk of having to pay the two roubles on each living soul wherefore I have conceived the idea of relieving landowners of that distasteful obligation by acquiring dead and absconded souls who have failed to disappear from the revision list This enables me at once to perform an act of Christian charity and to remove from the shoulders of our more impoverished proprietors the burden of tax payment upon souls of the kind specified Should you yourself care to do business with me we will draw up a formal purchase agreement as though the souls in question were still alive But it would be such a curious arrangement muttered Lienitsin moving his chair and himself a little further away It would be an arrangement which er er Would involve you in no scandal whatever seeing that the affair would be carried through in secret Moreover between friends who are well disposed towards one another Nevertheless Chichikov adopted a firmer and more decided tone I repeat that there would be no scandal he said The transaction would take place as between good friends and as between friends of mature age and as between friends of good status and as between friends who know how to keep their own counsel And so saying he looked his interlocutor frankly and generously in the eyes Nevertheless Lienitsin s resourcefulness and acumen in business matters failed to relieve his mind of a certain perplexity and the less so since he had contrived to become caught in his own net Yet in general he possessed neither a love for nor a talent for underhand dealings and had not fate and circumstances favoured Chichikov by causing Lienitsin s wife to enter the room at that moment things might have turned out very differently from what they did Madame was a pale thin insignificant looking young lady but none the less a lady who wore her clothes a la saint Petersburg and cultivated the society of persons who were unimpeachably comme il faut Behind her borne in a nurse s arms came the first fruits of the love of husband and wife Adopting his most telling method of approach the method accompanied with a sidelong inclination of the head and a sort of hop Chichikov hastened to greet the lady from the metropolis and then the baby At first the latter started to bellow disapproval but the words Agoo agoo my pet added to a little cracking of the fingers and a sight of a beautiful seal on a watch chain enabled Chichikov to weedle the infant into his arms after which he fell to swinging it up and down until he had contrived to raise a smile on its face a circumstance which greatly delighted the parents and finally inclined the father in his visitor s favour Suddenly however whether from pleasure or from some other cause the infant misbehaved itself My God cried Madame He has gone and spoilt your frockcoat True enough on glancing downwards Chichikov saw that the sleeve of his brand new garment had indeed suffered a hurt If I could catch you alone you little devil he muttered to himself I d shoot you Host hostess and nurse all ran for eau de Cologne and from three sides set themselves to rub the spot affected Never mind never mind it is nothing said Chichikov as he strove to communicate to his features as cheerful an expression as possible What does it matter what a child may spoil during the golden age of its infancy To himself he remarked The little brute Would it could be devoured by wolves It has made only too good a shot the cussed young ragamuffin How after this after the guest had shown such innocent affection for the little one and magnanimously paid for his so doing with a brand new suit could the father remain obdurate Nevertheless to avoid setting a bad example to the countryside he and Chichikov agreed to carry through the transaction PRIVATELY lest otherwise a scandal should arise In return said Chichikov would you mind doing me the following favour I desire to mediate in the matter of your difference with the Brothers Platonov I believe that you wish to acquire some additional land Is not that so Here there occurs a hiatus in the original Everything in life fulfils its function and Chichikov s tour in search of a fortune was carried out so successfully that not a little money passed into his pockets The system employed was a good one he did not steal he merely used And every one of us at times does the same one man with regard to Government timber and another with regard to a sum belonging to his employer while a third defrauds his children for the sake of an actress and a fourth robs his peasantry for the sake of smart furniture or a carriage What can one do when one is surrounded on every side with roguery and everywhere there are insanely expensive restaurants masked balls and dances to the music of gipsy bands To abstain when every one else is indulging in these things and fashion commands is difficult indeed Chichikov was for setting forth again but the roads had now got into a bad state and in addition there was in preparation a second fair one for the dvoriane only The former fair had been held for the sale of horses cattle cheese and other peasant produce and the buyers had been merely cattle jobbers and kulaks but this time the function was to be one for the sale of manorial produce which had been bought up by wholesale dealers at Nizhni Novgorod and then transferred hither To the fair of course came those ravishers of the Russian purse who in the shape of Frenchmen with pomades and Frenchwomen with hats make away with money earned by blood and hard work and like the locusts of Egypt to use Kostanzhoglo s term not only devour their prey but also dig holes in the ground and leave behind their eggs Although unfortunately the occurrence of a bad harvest retained many landowners at their country houses the local tchinovniks whom the failure of the harvest did NOT touch proceeded to let themselves go as also to their undoing did their wives The reading of books of the type diffused in these modern days for the inoculation of humanity with a craving for new and superior amenities of life had caused every one to conceive a passion for experimenting with the latest luxury and to meet this want the French wine merchant opened a new establishment in the shape of a restaurant as had never before been heard of in the province a restaurant where supper could be procured on credit as regarded one half and for an unprecedentedly low sum as regarded the other This exactly suited both heads of boards and clerks who were living in hope of being able some day to resume their bribes taking from suitors There also developed a tendency to compete in the matter of horses and liveried flunkeys with the result that despite the damp and snowy weather exceedingly elegant turnouts took to parading backwards and forwards Whence these equipages had come God only knows but at least they would not have disgraced saint Petersburg From within them merchants and attorneys doffed their caps to ladies and inquired after their health and likewise it became a rare sight to see a bearded man in a rough fur cap since every one now went about clean shaven and with dirty teeth after the European fashion Sir I beg of you to inspect my goods said a tradesman as Chichikov was passing his establishment Within my doors you will find a large variety of clothing Have you a cloth of bilberry coloured check inquired the person addressed I have cloths of the finest kind replied the tradesman raising his cap with one hand and pointing to his shop with the other Chichikov entered and in a trice the proprietor had dived beneath the counter and appeared on the other side of it with his back to his wares and his face towards the customer Leaning forward on the tips of his fingers and indicating his merchandise with just the suspicion of a nod he requested the gentleman to specify exactly the species of cloth which he required A cloth with an olive coloured or a bottle tinted spot in its pattern anything in the nature of bilberry explained Chichikov That being so sir I may say that I am about to show you clothes of a quality which even our illustrious capitals could not surpass Hi boy Reach down that roll up there number thirty four No NOT that one fool Such fellows as you are always too good for your job There hand it to me This is indeed a nice pattern Unfolding the garment the tradesman thrust it close to Chichikov s nose in order that he might not only handle but also smell it Excellent but not what I want pronounced Chichikov Formerly I was in the Custom s Department and therefore wear none but cloth of the latest make What I want is of a ruddier pattern than this not exactly a bottle tinted pattern but something approaching bilberry I understand sir Of course you require only the very newest thing A cloth of that kind I DO possess sir and though excessive in price it is of a quality to match Carrying the roll of stuff to the light even stepping into the street for the purpose the shopman unfolded his prize with the words A truly beautiful shade A cloth of smoked grey shot with flame colour The material met with the customer s approval a price was agreed upon and with incredible celerity the vendor made up the purchase into a brown paper parcel and stowed it away in Chichikov s koliaska At this moment a voice asked to be shown a black frockcoat The devil take me if it isn t Khlobuev muttered our hero turning his back upon the newcomer Unfortunately the other had seen him Come come Paul Ivanovitch he expostulated Surely you do not intend to overlook me I have been searching for you everywhere for I have something important to say to you My dear sir my very dear sir said Chichikov as he pressed Khlobuev s hand I can assure you that had I the necessary leisure I should at all times be charmed to converse with you And mentally he added Would that the Evil One would fly away with you Almost at the same time Murazov the great landowner entered the shop As he did so our hero hastened to exclaim Why it is Athanasi Vassilievitch How ARE you my very dear sir Well enough replied Murazov removing his cap Khlobuev and the shopman had already done the same How may I ask are YOU But poorly replied Chichikov for of late I have been troubled with indigestion and my sleep is bad I do not get sufficient exercise However instead of probing deeper into the subject of Chichikov s ailments Murazov turned to Khlobuev I saw you enter the shop he said and therefore followed you for I have something important for your ear Could you spare me a minute or two Certainly certainly said Khlobuev and the pair left the shop together I wonder what is afoot between them said Chichikov to himself A wise and noble gentleman Athanasi Vassilievitch remarked the tradesman Chichikov made no reply save a gesture Paul Ivanovitch I have been looking for you everywhere Lienitsin s voice said from behind him while again the tradesman hastened to remove his cap Pray come home with me for I have something to say to you Chichikov scanned the speaker s face but could make nothing of it Paying the tradesman for the cloth he left the shop Meanwhile Murazov had conveyed Khlobuev to his rooms Tell me he said to his guest exactly how your affairs stand I take it that after all your aunt left you something It would be difficult to say whether or not my affairs are improved replied Khlobuev True fifty souls and thirty thousand roubles came to me from Madame Khanasarova but I had to pay them away to satisfy my debts Consequently I am once more destitute But the important point is that there was trickery connected with the legacy and shameful trickery at that Yes though it may surprise you it is a fact that that fellow Chichikov Yes Semen Semenovitch but before you go on to speak of Chichikov pray tell me something about yourself and how much in your opinion would be sufficient to clear you of your difficulties My difficulties are grievous replied Khlobuev To rid myself of them and also to have enough to go on with I should need to acquire at least a hundred thousand roubles if not more In short things are becoming impossible for me And had you the money what should you do with it I should rent a tenement and devote myself to the education of my children Not a thought should I give to myself for my career is over seeing that it is impossible for me to re enter the Civil Service and I am good for nothing else Nevertheless when a man is leading an idle life he is apt to incur temptations which shun his better employed brother Yes but beyond question I am good for nothing so broken is my health and such a martyr I am to dyspepsia But how to you propose to live without working How can a man like you exist without a post or a position of any kind Look around you at the works of God Everything has its proper function and pursues its proper course Even a stone can be used for one purpose or another How then can it be right for a man who is a thinking being to remain a drone But I should not be a drone for I should employ myself with the education of my children No Semen Semenovitch no THAT you would find the hardest task of all For how can a man educate his children who has never even educated himself Instruction can be imparted to children only through the medium of example and would a life like yours furnish them with a profitable example a life which has been spent in idleness and the playing of cards No Semen Semenovitch You had far better hand your children over to me Otherwise they will be ruined Do not think that I am jesting Idleness has wrecked your life and you must flee from it Can a man live with nothing to keep him in place Even a journeyman labourer who earns the barest pittance may take an interest in his occupation Athanasi Vassilievitch I have tried to overcome myself but what further resource lies open to me Can I who am old and incapable re enter the Civil Service and spend year after year at a desk with youths who are just starting their careers Moreover I have lost the trick of taking bribes I should only hinder both myself and others while as you know it is a department which has an established caste of its own Therefore though I have considered and even attempted to obtain every conceivable post I find myself incompetent for them all Only in a monastery should I Nay nay Monasteries again are only for those who have worked To those who have spent their youth in dissipation such havens say what the ant said to the dragonfly namely Go you away and return to your dancing Yes even in a monastery do folk toil and toil they do not sit playing whist Murazov looked at Khlobuev and added Semen Semenovitch you are deceiving both yourself and me Poor Khlobuev could not utter a word in reply and Murazov began to feel sorry for him Listen Semen Semenovitch he went on I know that you say your prayers and that you go to church and that you observe both Matins and Vespers and that though averse to early rising you leave your bed at four o clock in the morning before the household fires have been lit Ah Athanasi Vassilievitch said Khlobuev that is another matter altogether That I do not for man s sake but for the sake of Him who has ordered all things here on earth Yes I believe that He at least can feel compassion for me that He at least though I be foul and lowly will pardon me and receive me when all men have cast me out and my best friend has betrayed me and boasted that he has done it for a good end Khlobuev s face was glowing with emotion and from the older man s eyes also a tear had started You will do well to hearken unto Him who is merciful he said But remember also that in the eyes of the All Merciful honest toil is of equal merit with a prayer Therefore take unto yourself whatsoever task you may and do it as though you were doing it not unto man but unto God Even though to your lot there should fall but the cleaning of a floor clean that floor as though it were being cleaned for Him alone And thence at least this good you will reap that there will remain to you no time for what is evil for card playing for feasting for all the life of this gay world Are you acquainted with Ivan Potapitch Yes not only am I acquainted with him but I also greatly respect him Time was when Ivan Potapitch was a merchant worth half a million roubles In everything did he look but for gain and his affairs prospered exceedingly so much so that he was able to send his son to be educated in France and to marry his daughter to a General And whether in his office or at the Exchange he would stop any friend whom he encountered and carry him off to a tavern to drink and spend whole days thus employed But at last he became bankrupt and God sent him other misfortunes also His son Ah well Ivan Potapitch is now my steward for he had to begin life over again Yet once more his affairs are in order and had it been his wish he could have restarted in business with a capital of half a million roubles But no he said A steward am I and a steward will I remain to the end for from being full stomached and heavy with dropsy I have become strong and well Not a drop of liquor passes his lips but only cabbage soup and gruel And he prays as none of the rest of us pray and he helps the poor as none of the rest of us help them and to this he would add yet further charity if his means permitted him to do so Poor Khlobuev remained silent as before The elder man took his two hands in his Semen Semenovitch he said you cannot think how much I pity you or how much I have had you in my thoughts Listen to me In the monastery there is a recluse who never looks upon a human face Of all men whom I know he has the broadest mind and he breaks not his silence save to give advice To him I went and said that I had a friend though I did not actually mention your name who was in great trouble of soul Suddenly the recluse interrupted me with the words God s work first and our own last There is need for a church to be built but no money wherewith to build it Money must be collected to that end Then he shut to the wicket I wondered to myself what this could mean and concluded that the recluse had been unwilling to accord me his counsel Next I repaired to the Archimandrite and had scarce reached his door when he inquired of me whether I could commend to him a man meet to be entrusted with the collection of alms for a church a man who should belong to the dvoriane or to the more lettered merchants but who would guard the trust as he would guard the salvation of his soul On the instant thought I to myself Why should not the Holy Father appoint my friend Semen Semenovitch For the way of suffering would benefit him greatly and as he passed with his ledger from landowner to peasant and from peasant to townsman he would learn where folk dwell and who stands in need of aught and thus would become better acquainted with the countryside than folk who dwell in cities And thus become he would find that his services were always in demand Only of late did the Governor General say to me that could he but be furnished with the name of a secretary who should know his work not only by the book but also by experience he would give him a great sum since nothing is to be learned by the former means and through it much confusion arises You confound me you overwhelm me said Khlobuev staring at his companion in open eyed astonishment I can scarcely believe that your words are true seeing that for such a trust an active indefatigable man would be necessary Moreover how could I leave my wife and children unprovided for Have no fear said Murazov I myself will take them under my care as well as procure for the children a tutor Far better and nobler were it for you to be travelling with a wallet and asking alms on behalf of God then to be remaining here and asking alms for yourself alone Likewise I will furnish you with a tilt waggon so that you may be saved some of the hardships of the journey and thus be preserved in good health Also I will give you some money for the journey in order that as you pass on your way you may give to those who stand in greater need than their fellows Thus if before giving you assure yourself that the recipient of the alms is worthy of the same you will do much good and as you travel you will become acquainted with all men and sundry and they will treat you not as a tchinovnik to be feared but as one to whom as a petitioner on behalf of the Church they may unloose their tongues without peril I feel that the scheme is a splendid one and would gladly bear my part in it were it not likely to exceed my strength What is there that does NOT exceed your strength said Murazov Nothing is wholly proportionate to it everything surpasses it Help from above is necessary otherwise we are all powerless Strength comes of prayer and of prayer alone When a man crosses himself and cries Lord have mercy upon me he soon stems the current and wins to the shore Nor need you take any prolonged thought concerning this matter All that you need do is to accept it as a commission sent of God The tilt waggon can be prepared for you immediately and then as soon as you have been to the Archimandrite for your book of accounts and his blessing you will be free to start on your journey I submit myself to you and accept the commission as a divine trust And even as Khlobuev spoke he felt renewed vigour and confidence arise in his soul and his mind begin to awake to a sense of hopefulness of eventually being able to put to flight his troubles And even as it was the world seemed to be growing dim to his eyes Meanwhile plea after plea had been presented to the legal authorities and daily were relatives whom no one had before heard of putting in an appearance Yes like vultures to a corpse did these good folk come flocking to the immense property which Madam Khanasarov had left behind her Everywhere were heard rumours against Chichikov rumours with regard to the validity of the second will rumours with regard to will number one and rumours of larceny and concealment of funds Also there came to hand information with regard both to Chichikov s purchase of dead souls and to his conniving at contraband goods during his service in the Customs Department In short every possible item of evidence was exhumed and the whole of his previous history investigated How the authorities had come to suspect and to ascertain all this God only knows but the fact remains that there had fallen into the hands of those authorities information concerning matters of which Chichikov had believed only himself and the four walls to be aware True for a time these matters remained within the cognisance of none but the functionaries concerned and failed to reach Chichikov s ears but at length a letter from a confidential friend gave him reason to think that the fat was about to fall into the fire Said the letter briefly Dear sir I beg to advise you that possibly legal trouble is pending but that you have no cause for uneasiness seeing that everything will be attended to by yours very truly Yet in spite of its tenor the epistle reassured its recipient What a genius the fellow is thought Chichikov to himself Next to complete his satisfaction his tailor arrived with the new suit which he had ordered Not without a certain sense of pride did our hero inspect the frockcoat of smoked grey shot with flame colour and look at it from every point of view and then try on the breeches the latter fitting him like a picture and quite concealing any deficiencies in the matter of his thighs and calves though when buckled behind they left his stomach projecting like a drum True the customer remarked that there appeared to be a slight tightness under the right armpit but the smiling tailor only rejoined that that would cause the waist to fit all the better Sir he said triumphantly you may rest assured that the work has been executed exactly as it ought to have been executed No one except in saint Petersburg could have done it better As a matter of fact the tailor himself hailed from saint Petersburg but called himself on his signboard Foreign Costumier from London and Paris the truth being that by the use of a double barrelled flourish of cities superior to mere Karlsruhe and Copenhagen he designed to acquire business and cut out his local rivals Chichikov graciously settled the man s account and as soon as he had gone paraded at leisure and con amore and after the manner of an artist of aesthetic taste before the mirror Somehow he seemed to look better than ever in the suit for his cheeks had now taken on a still more interesting air and his chin an added seductiveness while his white collar lent tone to his neck the blue satin tie heightened the effect of the collar the fashionable dickey set off the tie the rich satin waistcoat emphasised the dickey and the smoked grey shot with flame colour frockcoat shining like silk splendidly rounded off the whole When he turned to the right he looked well when he turned to the left he looked even better In short it was a costume worthy of a Lord Chamberlain or the species of dandy who shrinks from swearing in the Russian language but amply relieves his feelings in the language of France Next inclining his head slightly to one side our hero endeavoured to pose as though he were addressing a middle aged lady of exquisite refinement and the result of these efforts was a picture which any artist might have yearned to portray Next his delight led him gracefully to execute a hop in ballet fashion so that the wardrobe trembled and a bottle of eau de Cologne came crashing to the floor Yet even this contretemps did not upset him he merely called the offending bottle a fool and then debated whom first he should visit in his attractive guise Suddenly there resounded through the hall a clatter of spurred heels and then the voice of a gendarme saying You are commanded to present yourself before the Governor General Turning round Chichikov stared in horror at the spectacle presented for in the doorway there was standing an apparition wearing a huge moustache a helmet surmounted with a horsehair plume a pair of crossed shoulder belts and a gigantic sword A whole army might have been combined into a single individual And when Chichikov opened his mouth to speak the apparition repeated You are commanded to present yourself before the Governor General and at the same moment our hero caught sight both of a second apparition outside the door and of a coach waiting beneath the window What was to be done Nothing whatever was possible Just as he stood in his smoked grey shot with flame colour suit he had then and there to enter the vehicle and shaking in every limb and with a gendarme seated by his side to start for the residence of the Governor General And even in the hall of that establishment no time was given him to pull himself together for at once an aide de camp said Go inside immediately for the Prince is awaiting you And as in a dream did our hero see a vestibule where couriers were being handed dispatches and then a salon which he crossed with the thought I suppose I am not to be allowed a trial but shall be sent straight to Siberia And at the thought his heart started beating in a manner which the most jealous of lovers could not have rivalled At length there opened a door and before him he saw a study full of portfolios ledgers and dispatch boxes with standing behind them the gravely menacing figure of the Prince There stands my executioner thought Chichikov to himself He is about to tear me to pieces as a wolf tears a lamb Indeed the Prince s lips were simply quivering with rage Once before did I spare you he said and allow you to remain in the town when you ought to have been in prison yet your only return for my clemency has been to revert to a career of fraud and of fraud as dishonourable as ever a man engaged in To what dishonourable fraud do you refer your Highness asked Chichikov trembling from head to foot The Prince approached and looked him straight in the eyes Let me tell you he said that the woman whom you induced to witness a certain will has been arrested and that you will be confronted with her The world seemed suddenly to grow dim before Chichikov s sight Your Highness he gasped I will tell you the whole truth and nothing but the truth I am guilty yes I am guilty but I am not so guilty as you think for I was led away by rascals That any one can have led you away is impossible retorted the Prince Recorded against your name there stand more felonies than even the most hardened liar could have invented I believe that never in your life have you done a deed not innately dishonourable that not a kopeck have you ever obtained by aught but shameful methods of trickery and theft the penalty for which is Siberia and the knut But enough of this From this room you will be conveyed to prison where with other rogues and thieves you will be confined until your trial may come on And this is lenient treatment on my part for you are worse far worse than the felons who will be your companions THEY are but poor men in smocks and sheepskins whereas YOU Without concluding his words the Prince shot a glance at Chichikov s smoked grey shot with flame colour apparel Then he touched a bell Your Highness cried Chichikov have mercy upon me You are the father of a family Spare me for the sake of my aged mother Rubbish exclaimed the Prince Even as before you besought me for the sake of a wife and children whom you did not even possess so now you would speak to me of an aged mother Your Highness protested Chichikov though I am a wretch and the lowest of rascals and though it is true that I lied when I told you that I possessed a wife and children I swear that as God is my witness it has always been my DESIRE to possess a wife and to fulfil all the duties of a man and a citizen and to earn the respect of my fellows and the authorities But what could be done against the force of circumstances By hook or by crook I have ever been forced to win a living though confronted at every step by wiles and temptations and traitorous enemies and despoilers So much has this been so that my life has throughout resembled a barque tossed by tempestuous waves a barque driven at the mercy of the winds Ah I am only a man your Highness And in a moment the tears had gushed in torrents from his eyes and he had fallen forward at the Prince s feet fallen forward just as he was in his smoked grey shot with flame colour frockcoat his velvet waistcoat his satin tie and his exquisitely fitting breeches while from his neatly brushed pate as again and again he struck his hand against his forehead there came an odorous whiff of best quality eau de Cologne Away with him exclaimed the Prince to the gendarme who had just entered Summon the escort to remove him Your Highness Chichikov cried again as he clasped the Prince s knees but shuddering all over and struggling to free himself the Prince repeated his order for the prisoner s removal Your Highness I say that I will not leave this room until you have accorded me mercy cried Chichikov as he clung to the Prince s leg with such tenacity that frockcoat and all he began to be dragged along the floor Away with him I say once more the Prince exclaimed with the sort of indefinable aversion which one feels at the sight of a repulsive insect which he cannot summon up the courage to crush with his boot So convulsively did the Prince shudder that Chichikov clinging to his leg received a kick on the nose Yet still the prisoner retained his hold until at length a couple of burly gendarmes tore him away and grasping his arms hurried him pale dishevelled and in that strange half conscious condition into which a man sinks when he sees before him only the dark terrible figure of death the phantom which is so abhorrent to all our natures from the building But on the threshold the party came face to face with Murazov and in Chichikov s heart the circumstance revived a ray of hope Wresting himself with almost supernatural strength from the grasp of the escorting gendarmes he threw himself at the feet of the horror stricken old man Paul Ivanovitch Murazov exclaimed what has happened to you Save me gasped Chichikov They are taking me away to prison and death Yet almost as he spoke the gendarmes seized him again and hurried him away so swiftly that Murazov s reply escaped his ears A damp mouldy cell which reeked of soldiers boots and leggings an unvarnished table two sorry chairs a window closed with a grating a crazy stove which while letting the smoke emerge through its cracks gave out no heat such was the den to which the man who had just begun to taste the sweets of life and to attract the attention of his fellows with his new suit of smoked grey shot with flame colour now found himself consigned Not even necessaries had he been allowed to bring away with him nor his dispatch box which contained all his booty No with the indenture deeds of the dead souls it was lodged in the hands of a tchinovnik and as he thought of these things Chichikov rolled about the floor and felt the cankerous worm of remorse seize upon and gnaw at his heart and bite its way ever further and further into that heart so defenceless against its ravages until he made up his mind that should he have to suffer another twenty four hours of this misery there would no longer be a Chichikov in the world Yet over him as over every one there hung poised the All Saving Hand and an hour after his arrival at the prison the doors of the gaol opened to admit Murazov Compared with poor Chichikov s sense of relief when the old man entered his cell even the pleasure experienced by a thirsty dusty traveller when he is given a drink of clear spring water to cool his dry parched throat fades into insignificance Ah my deliverer he cried as he rose from the floor where he had been grovelling in heartrending paroxysms of grief Seizing the old man s hand he kissed it and pressed it to his bosom Then bursting into tears he added God Himself will reward you for having come to visit an unfortunate wretch Murazov looked at him sorrowfully and said no more than Ah Paul Ivanovitch Paul Ivanovitch What has happened What has happened cried Chichikov I have been ruined by an accursed woman That was because I could not do things in moderation I was powerless to stop myself in time Satan tempted me and drove me from my senses and bereft me of human prudence Yes truly I have sinned I have sinned Yet how came I so to sin To think that a dvorianin yes a dvorianin should be thrown into prison without process or trial I repeat a dvorianin Why was I not given time to go home and collect my effects Whereas now they are left with no one to look after them My dispatch box my dispatch box It contained my whole property all that my heart s blood and years of toil and want have been needed to acquire And now everything will be stolen Athanasi Vassilievitch everything will be taken from me My God And unable to stand against the torrent of grief which came rushing over his heart once more he sobbed aloud in tones which penetrated even the thickness of the prison walls and made dull echoes awake behind them Then tearing off his satin tie and seizing by the collar the smoked grey shot with flame colour frockcoat he stripped the latter from his shoulders Ah Paul Ivanovitch said the old man how even now the property which you have acquired is blinding your eyes and causing you to fail to realise your terrible position Yes my good friend and benefactor wailed poor Chichikov despairingly and clasping Murazov by the knees Yet save me if you can The Prince is fond of you and would do anything for your sake No Paul Ivanovitch however much I might wish to save you and however much I might try to do so I could not help you as you desire for it is to the power of an inexorable law and not to the authority of any one man that you have rendered yourself subject Satan tempted me and has ended by making of me an outcast from the human race Chichikov beat his head against the wall and struck the table with his fist until the blood spurted from his hand Yet neither his head nor his hand seemed to be conscious of the least pain Calm yourself Paul Ivanovitch said Murazov Calm yourself and consider how best you can make your peace with God Think of your miserable soul and not of the judgment of man I will Athanasi Vassilievitch I will But what a fate is mine Did ever such a fate befall a man To think of all the patience with which I have gathered my kopecks of all the toil and trouble which I have endured Yet what I have done has not been done with the intention of robbing any one nor of cheating the Treasury Why then did I gather those kopecks I gathered them to the end that one day I might be able to live in plenty and also to have something to leave to the wife and children whom for the benefit and welfare of my country I hoped eventually to win and maintain That was why I gathered those kopecks True I worked by devious methods that I fully admit but what else could I do And even devious methods I employed only when I saw that the straight road would not serve my purpose so well as a crooked Moreover as I toiled the appetite for those methods grew upon me Yet what I took I took only from the rich whereas villains exist who while drawing thousands a year from the Treasury despoil the poor and take from the man with nothing even that which he has Is it not the cruelty of fate therefore that just when I was beginning to reap the harvest of my toil to touch it so to speak with the tip of one finger there should have arisen a sudden storm which has sent my barque to pieces on a rock My capital had nearly reached the sum of three hundred thousand roubles and a three storied house was as good as mine and twice over I could have bought a country estate Why then should such a tempest have burst upon me Why should I have sustained such a blow Was not my life already like a barque tossed to and fro by the billows Where is Heaven s justice where is the reward for all my patience for my boundless perseverance Three times did I have to begin life afresh and each time that I lost my all I began with a single kopeck at a moment when other men would have given themselves up to despair and drink How much did I not have to overcome How much did I not have to bear Every kopeck which I gained I had to make with my whole strength for though to others wealth may come easily every coin of mine had to be forged with a nail worth three kopecks as the proverb has it With such a nail with the nail of an iron unwearying perseverance did I forge my kopecks Convulsively sobbing with a grief which he could not repress Chichikov sank upon a chair tore from his shoulders the last ragged trailing remnants of his frockcoat and hurled them from him Then thrusting his fingers into the hair which he had once been so careful to preserve he pulled it out by handfuls at a time as though he hoped through physical pain to deaden the mental agony which he was suffering Meanwhile Murazov sat gazing in silence at the unwonted spectacle of a man who had lately been mincing with the gait of a worldling or a military fop now writhing in dishevelment and despair as he poured out upon the hostile forces by which human ingenuity so often finds itself outwitted a flood of invective Paul Ivanovitch Paul Ivanovitch at length said Murazov what could not each of us rise to be did we but devote to good ends the same measure of energy and of patience which we bestow upon unworthy objects How much good would not you yourself have effected Yet I do not grieve so much for the fact that you have sinned against your fellow as I grieve for the fact that you have sinned against yourself and the rich store of gifts and opportunities which has been committed to your care Though originally destined to rise you have wandered from the path and fallen Ah Athanasi Vassilievitch cried poor Chichikov clasping his friends hands I swear to you that if you would but restore me my freedom and recover for me my lost property I would lead a different life from this time forth Save me you who alone can work my deliverance Save me How can I do that So to do I should need to procure the setting aside of a law Again even if I were to make the attempt the Prince is a strict administrator and would refuse on any consideration to release you Yes but for you all things are possible It is not the law that troubles me with that I could find a means to deal It is the fact that for no offence at all I have been cast into prison and treated like a dog and deprived of my papers and dispatch box and all my property Save me if you can Again clasping the old man s knees he bedewed them with his tears Paul Ivanovitch said Murazov shaking his head how that property of yours still seals your eyes and ears so that you cannot so much as listen to the promptings of your own soul Ah I will think of my soul too if only you will save me Paul Ivanovitch the old man began again and then stopped For a little while there was a pause Paul Ivanovitch at length he went on to save you does not lie within my power Surely you yourself see that But so far as I can I will endeavour to at all events lighten your lot and procure your eventual release Whether or not I shall succeed I do not know but I will make the attempt And should I contrary to my expectations prove successful I beg of you in return for these my efforts to renounce all thought of benefit from the property which you have acquired Sincerely do I assure you that were I myself to be deprived of my property and my property greatly exceeds yours in magnitude I should not shed a single tear It is not the property of which men can deprive us that matters but the property of which no one on earth can deprive or despoil us You are a man who has seen something of life to use your own words you have been a barque tossed hither and thither by tempestuous waves yet still will there be left to you a remnant of substance on which to live and therefore I beseech you to settle down in some quiet nook where there is a church and where none but plain good hearted folk abide Or should you feel a yearning to leave behind you posterity take in marriage a good woman who shall bring you not money but an aptitude for simple modest domestic life But this life the life of turmoil with its longings and its temptations forget and let it forget YOU for there is no peace in it See for yourself how at every step it brings one but hatred and treachery and deceit Indeed yes agreed the repentant Chichikov Gladly will I do as you wish since for many a day past have I been longing to amend my life and to engage in husbandry and to reorder my affairs A demon the tempter Satan himself has beguiled me and led me from the right path Suddenly there had recurred to Chichikov long unknown long unfamiliar feelings Something seemed to be striving to come to life again in him something dim and remote something which had been crushed out of his boyhood by the dreary deadening education of his youthful days by his desolate home by his subsequent lack of family ties by the poverty and niggardliness of his early impressions by the grim eye of fate an eye which had always seemed to be regarding him as through a misty mournful frost encrusted window pane and to be mocking at his struggles for freedom And as these feelings came back to the penitent a groan burst from his lips and covering his face with his hands he moaned It is all true it is all true Of little avail are knowledge of the world and experience of men unless based upon a secure foundation observed Murazov Though you have fallen Paul Ivanovitch awake to better things for as yet there is time No no groaned Chichikov in a voice which made Murazov s heart bleed It is too late too late More and more is the conviction gaining upon me that I am powerless that I have strayed too far ever to be able to do as you bid me The fact that I have become what I am is due to my early schooling for though my father taught me moral lessons and beat me and set me to copy maxims into a book he himself stole land from his neighbours and forced me to help him I have even known him to bring an unjust suit and defraud the orphan whose guardian he was Consequently I know and feel that though my life has been different from his I do not hate roguery as I ought to hate it and that my nature is coarse and that in me there is no real love for what is good no real spark of that beautiful instinct for well doing which becomes a second nature a settled habit Also never do I yearn to strive for what is right as I yearn to acquire property This is no more than the truth What else could I do but confess it The old man sighed Paul Ivanovitch he said I know that you possess will power and that you possess also perseverance A medicine may be bitter yet the patient will gladly take it when assured that only by its means can he recover Therefore if it really be that you have no genuine love for doing good do good by FORCING yourself to do so Thus you will benefit yourself even more than you will benefit him for whose sake the act is performed Only force yourself to do good just once and again and behold you will suddenly conceive the TRUE love for well doing That is so believe me A kingdom is to be won only by striving says the proverb That is to say things are to be attained only by putting forth one s whole strength since nothing short of one s whole strength will bring one to the desired goal Paul Ivanovitch within you there is a source of strength denied to many another man I refer to the strength of an iron perseverance Cannot THAT help you to overcome Most men are weak and lack will power whereas I believe that you possess the power to act a hero s part Sinking deep into Chichikov s heart these words would seem to have aroused in it a faint stirring of ambition so much so that if it was not fortitude which shone in his eyes at all events it was something virile and of much the same nature Athanasi Vassilievitch he said firmly if you will but petition for my release as well as for permission for me to leave here with a portion of my property I swear to you on my word of honour that I will begin a new life and buy a country estate and become the head of a household and save money nor for myself but for others and do good everywhere and to the best of my ability and forget alike myself and the feasting and debauchery of town life and lead instead a plain sober existence In that resolve may God strengthen you cried the old man with unbounded joy And I for my part will do my utmost to procure your release And though God alone knows whether my efforts will be successful at all events I hope to bring about a mitigation of your sentence Come let me embrace you How you have filled my heart with gladness With God s help I will now go to the Prince And the next moment Chichikov found himself alone His whole nature felt shaken and softened even as when the bellows have fanned the furnace to a sufficient heat a plate compounded even of the hardest and most fire resisting metal dissolves glows and turns to the liquefied state I myself can feel but little he reflected but I intend to use my every faculty to help others to feel I myself am but bad and worthless but I intend to do my utmost to set others on the right road I myself am but an indifferent Christian but I intend to strive never to yield to temptation but to work hard and to till my land with the sweat of my brow and to engage only in honourable pursuits and to influence my fellows in the same direction For after all am I so very useless At least I could maintain a household for I am frugal and active and intelligent and steadfast The only thing is to make up my mind to it Thus Chichikov pondered and as he did so his half awakened energies of soul touched upon something That is to say dimly his instinct divined that every man has a duty to perform and that that duty may be performed here there and everywhere and no matter what the circumstances and the emotions and the difficulties which compass a man about And with such clearness did Chichikov mentally picture to himself the life of grateful toil which lies removed from the bustle of towns and the temptations which man forgetful of the obligation of labour has invented to beguile an hour of idleness that almost our hero forgot his unpleasant position and even felt ready to thank Providence for the calamity which had befallen him provided that it should end in his being released and in his receiving back a portion of his property Presently the massive door of the cell opened to admit a tchinovnik named Samosvitov a robust sensual individual who was reputed by his comrades to be something of a rake Had he served in the army he would have done wonders for he would have stormed any point however dangerous and inaccessible and captured cannon under the very noses of the foe but as it was the lack of a more warlike field for his energies caused him to devote the latter principally to dissipation Nevertheless he enjoyed great popularity for he was loyal to the point that once his word had been given nothing would ever make him break it At the same time some reason or another led him to regard his superiors in the light of a hostile battery which come what might he must breach at any weak or unguarded spot or gap which might be capable of being utilised for the purpose We have all heard of your plight he began as soon as the door had been safely closed behind him Yes every one has heard of it But never mind Things will yet come right We will do our very best for you and act as your humble servants in everything Thirty thousand roubles is our price no more Indeed said Chichikov And for that shall I be completely exonerated Yes completely and also given some compensation for your loss of time And how much am I to pay in return you say Thirty thousand roubles to be divided among ourselves the Governor General s staff and the Governor General s secretary But how is even that to be managed for all my effects including my dispatch box will have been sealed up and taken away for examination In an hour s time they will be within your hands again said Samosvitov Shall we shake hands over the bargain Chichikov did so with a beating heart for he could scarcely believe his ears For the present then farewell concluded Samosvitov I have instructed a certain mutual friend that the important points are silence and presence of mind Hm thought Chichikov It is to my lawyer that he is referring Even when Samosvitov had departed the prisoner found it difficult to credit all that had been said Yet not an hour had elapsed before a messenger arrived with his dispatch box and the papers and money therein practically undisturbed and intact Later it came out that Samosvitov had assumed complete authority in the matter First he had rebuked the gendarmes guarding Chichikov s effects for lack of vigilance and then sent word to the Superintendent that additional men were required for the purpose after which he had taken the dispatch box into his own charge removed from it every paper which could possibly compromise Chichikov sealed up the rest in a packet and ordered a gendarme to convey the whole to their owner on the pretence of forwarding him sundry garments necessary for the night In the result Chichikov received not only his papers but also some warm clothing for his hypersensitive limbs Such a swift recovery of his treasures delighted him beyond expression and gathering new hope he began once more to dream of such allurements as theatre going and the ballet girl after whom he had for some time past been dangling Gradually did the country estate and the simple life begin to recede into the distance gradually did the town house and the life of gaiety begin to loom larger and larger in the foreground Oh life life Meanwhile in Government offices and chancellories there had been set on foot a boundless volume of work Clerical pens slaved and brains skilled in legal casus toiled for each official had the artist s liking for the curved line in preference to the straight And all the while like a hidden magician Chichikov s lawyer imparted driving power to that machine which caught up a man into its mechanism before he could even look round And the complexity of it increased and increased for Samosvitov surpassed himself in importance and daring On learning of the place of confinement of the woman who had been arrested he presented himself at the doors and passed so well for a smart young officer of gendarmery that the sentry saluted and sprang to attention Have you been on duty long asked Samosvitov Since this morning your Excellency And shall you soon be relieved In three hours from now your Excellency Presently I shall want you so I will instruct your officer to have you relieved at once Very good your Excellency Hastening home thereafter at top speed and donning the uniform of a gendarme with a false moustache and a pair of false whiskers an ensemble in which the devil himself would not have known him Samosvitov then made for the gaol where Chichikov was confined and en route impressed into the service the first street woman whom he encountered and handed her over to the care of two young fellows of like sort with himself The next step was to hurry back to the prison where the original woman had been interned and there to intimate to the sentry that he Samosvitov with whiskers and rifle complete had been sent to relieve the said sentry at his post a proceeding which of course enabled the newly arrived relief to ensure while performing his self assumed turn of duty that for the woman lying under arrest there should be substituted the woman recently recruited to the plot and that the former should then be conveyed to a place of concealment where she was highly unlikely to be discovered Meanwhile Samosvitov s feats in the military sphere were being rivalled by the wonders worked by Chichikov s lawyer in the civilian field of action As a first step the lawyer caused it to be intimated to the local Governor that the Public Prosecutor was engaged in drawing up a report to his the local Governor s detriment whereafter the lawyer caused it to be intimated also to the Chief of Gendarmery that a certain confidential official was engaged in doing the same by HIM whereafter again the lawyer confided to the confidential official in question that owing to the documentary exertions of an official of a still more confidential nature than the first he the confidential official first mentioned was in a fair way to find himself in the same boat as both the local Governor and the Chief of Gendarmery with the result that the whole trio were reduced to a frame of mind in which they were only too glad to turn to him Samosvitov for advice The ultimate and farcical upshot was that report came crowding upon report and that such alleged doings were brought to light as the sun had never before beheld In fact the documents in question employed anything and everything as material even to announcing that such and such an individual had an illegitimate son that such and such another kept a paid mistress and that such and such a third was troubled with a gadabout wife whereby there became interwoven with and welded into Chichikov s past history and the story of the dead souls such a crop of scandals and innuendoes that by no manner of means could any mortal decide to which of these rubbishy romances to award the palm since all them presented an equal claim to that honour Naturally when at length the dossier reached the Governor General himself it simply flabbergasted the poor man and even the exceptionally clever and energetic secretary to whom he deputed the making of an abstract of the same very nearly lost his reason with the strain of attempting to lay hold of the tangled end of the skein It happened that just at that time the Prince had several other important affairs on hand and affairs of a very unpleasant nature That is to say famine had made its appearance in one portion of the province and the tchinovniks sent to distribute food to the people had done their work badly in another portion of the province certain Raskolniki fifty one were in a state of ferment owing to the spreading of a report than an Antichrist had arisen who would not even let the dead rest but was purchasing them wholesale wherefore the said Raskolniki were summoning folk to prayer and repentance and under cover of capturing the Antichrist in question were bludgeoning non Antichrists in batches lastly the peasants of a third portion of the province had risen against the local landowners and superintendents of police for the reason that certain rascals had started a rumour that the time was come when the peasants themselves were to become landowners and to wear frockcoats while the landowners in being were about to revert to the peasant state and to take their own wares to market wherefore one of the local volosts fifty two oblivious of the fact that an order of things of that kind would lead to a superfluity alike of landowners and of superintendents of police had refused to pay its taxes and necessitated recourse to forcible measures Hence it was in a mood of the greatest possible despondency that the poor Prince was sitting plunged when word was brought to him that the old man who had gone bail for Chichikov was waiting to see him Show him in said the Prince and the old man entered A fine fellow your Chichikov began the Prince angrily You defended him and went bail for him even though he had been up to business which even the lowest thief would not have touched Pardon me your Highness I do not understand to what you are referring I am referring to the matter of the fraudulent will The fellow ought to have been given a public flogging for it Although to exculpate Chichikov is not my intention might I ask you whether you do not think the case is non proven At all events sufficient evidence against him is still lacking What We have as chief witness the woman who personated the deceased and I will have her interrogated in your presence Touching a bell the Prince ordered her to be sent for It is a most disgraceful affair he went on and ashamed though I am to have to say it some of our leading tchinovniks including the local Governor himself have become implicated in the matter Yet you tell me that this Chichikov ought not to be confined among thieves and rascals Clearly the Governor General s wrath was very great indeed Your Highness said Murazov the Governor of the town is one of the heirs under the will wherefore he has a certain right to intervene Also the fact that extraneous persons have meddled in the matter is only what is to be expected from human nature A rich woman dies and no exact regular disposition of her property is made Hence there comes flocking from every side a cloud of fortune hunters What else could one expect Such is human nature Yes but why should such persons go and commit fraud asked the Prince irritably I feel as though not a single honest tchinovnik were available as though every one of them were a rogue Your Highness which of us is altogether beyond reproach The tchinovniks of our town are human beings and no more Some of them are men of worth and nearly all of them men skilled in business though also unfortunately largely inter related Now tell me this Athanasi Vassilievitch said the Prince for you are about the only honest man of my acquaintance What has inspired in you such a penchant for defending rascals This replied Murazov Take any man you like of the persons whom you thus term rascals That man none the less remains a human being That being so how can one refuse to defend him when all the time one knows that half his errors have been committed through ignorance and stupidity Each of us commits faults with every step that we take each of us entails unhappiness upon others with every breath that we draw and that although we may have no evil intention whatever in our minds Your Highness himself has before now committed an injustice of the gravest nature I have cried the Prince taken aback by this unexpected turn given to the conversation Murazov remained silent for a moment as though he were debating something in his thoughts Then he said Nevertheless it is as I say You committed the injustice in the case of the lad Dierpiennikov What Athanasi Vassilievitch The fellow had infringed one of the Fundamental Laws He had been found guilty of treason I am not seeking to justify him I am only asking you whether you think it right that an inexperienced youth who had been tempted and led away by others should have received the same sentence as the man who had taken the chief part in the affair That is to say although Dierpiennikov and the man Voron Drianni received an equal measure of punishment their CRIMINALITY was not equal If exclaimed the Prince excitedly you know anything further concerning the case for God s sake tell it me at once Only the other day did I forward a recommendation that saint Petersburg should remit a portion of the sentence Your Highness replied Murazov I do not mean that I know of anything which does not lie also within your own cognisance though one circumstance there was which might have told in the lad s favour had he not refused to admit it lest another should suffer injury All that I have in my mind is this On that occasion were you not a little over hasty in coming to a conclusion You will understand of course that I am judging only according to my own poor lights and for the reason that on more than one occasion you have urged me to be frank In the days when I myself acted as a chief of gendarmery I came in contact with a great number of accused some of them bad some of them good and in each case I found it well also to consider a man s past career for the reason that unless one views things calmly instead of at once decrying a man he is apt to take alarm and to make it impossible thereafter to get any real confession from him If on the other hand you question a man as friend might question friend the result will be that straightway he will tell you everything nor ask for mitigation of his penalty nor bear you the least malice in that he will understand that it is not you who have punished him but the law The Prince relapsed into thought until presently there entered a young tchinovnik Portfolio in hand this official stood waiting respectfully Care and hard work had already imprinted their insignia upon his fresh young face for evidently he had not been in the Service for nothing As a matter of fact his greatest joy was to labour at a tangled case and successfully to unravel it At this point a long hiatus occurs in the original I will send corn to the localities where famine is worst said Murazov for I understand that sort of work better than do the tchinovniks and will personally see to the needs of each person Also if you will allow me your Highness I will go and have a talk with the Raskolniki They are more likely to listen to a plain man than to an official God knows whether I shall succeed in calming them but at least no tchinovnik could do so for officials of the kind merely draw up reports and lose their way among their own documents with the result that nothing comes of it Nor will I accept from you any money for these purposes since I am ashamed to devote as much as a thought to my own pocket at a time when men are dying of hunger I have a large stock of grain lying in my granaries in addition to which I have sent orders to Siberia that a new consignment shall be forwarded me before the coming summer Of a surety will God reward you for your services Athanasi Vassilievitch Not another word will I say to you on the subject for you yourself feel that any words from me would be inadequate Yet tell me one thing I refer to the case of which you know Have I the right to pass over the case Also would it be just and honourable on my part to let the offending tchinovniks go unpunished Your Highness it is impossible to return a definite answer to those two questions and the more so because many rascals are at heart men of rectitude Human problems are difficult things to solve Sometimes a man may be drawn into a vicious circle so that having once entered it he ceases to be himself But what would the tchinovniks say if I allowed the case to be passed over Would not some of them turn up their noses at me and declare that they have effected my intimidation Surely they would be the last persons in the world to respect me for my action Your Highness I think this that your best course would be to call them together and to inform them that you know everything and to explain to them your personal attitude exactly as you have explained it to me and to end by at once requesting their advice and asking them what each of them would have done had he been placed in similar circumstances What You think that those tchinovniks would be so accessible to lofty motives that they would cease thereafter to be venal and meticulous I should be laughed at for my pains I think not your Highness Even the baser section of humanity possesses a certain sense of equity Your wisest plan your Highness would be to conceal nothing and to speak to them as you have just spoken to me If at present they imagine you to be ambitious and proud and unapproachable and self assured your action would afford them an opportunity of seeing how the case really stands Why should you hesitate You would but be exercising your undoubted right Speak to them as though delivering not a message of your own but a message from God I will think it over the Prince said musingly and meanwhile I thank you from my heart for your good advice Also I should order Chichikov to leave the town suggested Murazov Yes I will do so Tell him from me that he is to depart hence as quickly as possible and that the further he should remove himself the better it will be for him Also tell him that it is only owing to your efforts that he has received a pardon at my hands Murazov bowed and proceeded from the Prince s presence to that of Chichikov He found the prisoner cheerfully enjoying a hearty dinner which under hot covers had been brought him from an exceedingly excellent kitchen But almost the first words which he uttered showed Murazov that the prisoner had been having dealings with the army of bribe takers as also that in those transactions his lawyer had played the principal part Listen Paul Ivanovitch the old man said I bring you your freedom but only on this condition that you depart out of the town forthwith Therefore gather together your effects and waste not a moment lest worse befall you Also of all that a certain person has contrived to do on your behalf I am aware wherefore let me tell you as between ourselves that should the conspiracy come to light nothing on earth can save him and in his fall he will involve others rather then be left unaccompanied in the lurch and not see the guilt shared How is it that when I left you recently you were in a better frame of mind than you are now I beg of you not to trifle with the matter Ah me what boots that wealth for which men dispute and cut one another s throats Do they think that it is possible to prosper in this world without thinking of the world to come Believe me when I say that until a man shall have renounced all that leads humanity to contend without giving a thought to the ordering of spiritual wealth he will never set his temporal goods either upon a satisfactory foundation Yes even as times of want and scarcity may come upon nations so may they come upon individuals No matter what may be said to the contrary the body can never dispense with the soul Why then will you not try to walk in the right way and by thinking no longer of dead souls but only of your only living one regain with God s help the better road I too am leaving the town to morrow Hasten therefore lest bereft of my assistance you meet with some dire misfortune And the old man departed leaving Chichikov plunged in thought Once more had the gravity of life begun to loom large before him Yes Murazov was right he said to himself It is time that I were moving Leaving the prison a warder carrying his effects in his wake he found Selifan and Petrushka overjoyed at seeing their master once more at liberty Well good fellows he said kindly And now we must pack and be off True true Paul Ivanovitch agreed Selifan And by this time the roads will have become firmer for much snow has fallen Yes high time is it that we were clear of the town So weary of it am I that the sight of it hurts my eyes Go to the coachbuilder s commanded Chichikov and have sledge runners fitted to the koliaska Chichikov then made his way into the town though not with the object of paying farewell visits in view of recent events that might have given rise to some awkwardness but for the purpose of paying an unobtrusive call at the shop where he had obtained the cloth for his latest suit There he now purchased four more arshins of the same smoked grey shot with flame colour material as he had had before with the intention of having it made up by the tailor who had fashioned the previous costume and by promising double remuneration he induced the tailor in question so to hasten the cutting out of the garments that through sitting up all night over the work the man might have the whole ready by break of day True the goods were delivered a trifle after the appointed hour yet the following morning saw the coat and breeches completed and while the horses were being put to Chichikov tried on the clothes and found them equal to the previous creation even though during the process he caught sight of a bald patch on his head and was led mournfully to reflect Alas Why did I give way to such despair Surely I need not have torn my hair out so freely Then when the tailor had been paid our hero left the town But no longer was he the old Chichikov he was only a ruin of what he had been and his frame of mind might have been compared to a building recently pulled down to make room for a new one while the new one had not yet been erected owing to the non receipt of the plans from the architect Murazov too had departed but at an earlier hour and in a tilt waggon with Ivan Potapitch An hour later the Governor General issued to all and sundry officials a notice that on the occasion of his departure for saint Petersburg he would be glad to see the corps of tchinovniks at a private meeting Accordingly all ranks and grades of officialdom repaired to his residence and there awaited not without a certain measure of trepidation and of searching of heart the Governor General s entry When that took place he looked neither clear nor dull Yet his bearing was proud and his step assured The tchinovniks bowed some of them to the waist and he answered their salutations with a slight inclination of the head Then he spoke as follows Since I am about to pay a visit to saint Petersburg I have thought it right to meet you and to explain to you privately my reasons for doing so An affair of a most scandalous character has taken place in our midst To what affair I am referring I think most of those present will guess Now an automatic process has led to that affair bringing about the discovery of other matters Those matters are no less dishonourable than the primary one and to that I regret to have to add that there stand involved in them certain persons whom I had hitherto believed to be honourable Of the object aimed at by those who have complicated matters to the point of making their resolution almost impossible by ordinary methods I am aware as also I am aware of the identity of the ringleader despite the skill with which he has sought to conceal his share in the scandal But the principal point is that I propose to decide these matters not by formal documentary process but by the more summary process of court martial and that I hope when the circumstances have been laid before his Imperial Majesty to receive from him authority to adopt the course which I have mentioned For I conceive that when it has become impossible to resolve a case by civil means and some of the necessary documents have been burnt and attempts have been made both through the adduction of an excess of false and extraneous evidence and through the framing of fictitious reports to cloud an already sufficiently obscure investigation with an added measure of complexity when all these circumstances have arisen I conceive that the only possible tribunal to deal with them is a military tribunal But on that point I should like your opinion The Prince paused for a moment or two as though awaiting a reply but none came seeing that every man had his eyes bent upon the floor and many of the audience had turned white in the face Then he went on I may say that I am aware also of a matter which those who have carried it through believe to lie only within the cognisance of themselves The particulars of that matter will not be set forth in documentary form but only through process of myself acting as plaintiff and petitioner and producing none but ocular evidence Among the throng of tchinovniks some one gave a start and thereby caused others of the more apprehensive sort to fall to trembling in their shoes Without saying does it go that the prime conspirators ought to undergo deprivation of rank and property and that the remainder ought to be dismissed from their posts for though that course would cause a certain proportion of the innocent to suffer with the guilty there would seem to be no other course available seeing that the affair is one of the most disgraceful nature and calls aloud for justice Therefore although I know that to some my action will fail to serve as a lesson since it will lead to their succeeding to the posts of dismissed officials as well as that others hitherto considered honourable will lose their reputation and others entrusted with new responsibilities will continue to cheat and betray their trust although all this is known to me I still have no choice but to satisfy the claims of justice by proceeding to take stern measures I am also aware that I shall be accused of undue severity but lastly I am aware that it is my duty to put aside all personal feeling and to act as the unconscious instrument of that retribution which justice demands Over ever face there passed a shudder Yet the Prince had spoken calmly and not a trace of anger or any other kind of emotion had been visible on his features Nevertheless he went on the very man in whose hands the fate of so many now lies the very man whom no prayer for mercy could ever have influenced himself desires to make a request of you Should you grant that request all will be forgotten and blotted out and pardoned for I myself will intercede with the Throne on your behalf That request is this I know that by no manner of means by no preventive measures and by no penalties will dishonesty ever be completely extirpated from our midst for the reason that its roots have struck too deep and that the dishonourable traffic in bribes has become a necessity to even the mainstay of some whose nature is not innately venal Also I know that to many men it is an impossibility to swim against the stream Yet now at this solemn and critical juncture when the country is calling aloud for saviours and it is the duty of every citizen to contribute and to sacrifice his all I feel that I cannot but issue an appeal to every man in whom a Russian heart and a spark of what we understand by the word nobility exist For after all which of us is more guilty than his fellow It may be to ME the greatest culpability should be assigned in that at first I may have adopted towards you too reserved an attitude that I may have been over hasty in repelling those who desired but to serve me even though of their services I did not actually stand in need Yet had they really loved justice and the good of their country I think that they would have been less prone to take offence at the coldness of my attitude but would have sacrificed their feelings and their personality to their superior convictions For hardly can it be that I failed to note their overtures and the loftiness of their motives or that I would not have accepted any wise and useful advice proffered At the same time it is for a subordinate to adapt himself to the tone of his superior rather than for a superior to adapt himself to the tone of his subordinate Such a course is at once more regular and more smooth of working since a corps of subordinates has but one director whereas a director may have a hundred subordinates But let us put aside the question of comparative culpability The important point is that before us all lies the duty of rescuing our fatherland Our fatherland is suffering not from the incursion of a score of alien tongues but from our own acts in that in addition to the lawful administration there has grown up a second administration possessed of infinitely greater powers than the system established by law And that second administration has established its conditions fixed its tariff of prices and published that tariff abroad nor could any ruler even though the wisest of legislators and administrators do more to correct the evil than limit it in the conduct of his more venal tchinovniks by setting over them as their supervisors men of superior rectitude No until each of us shall come to feel that just as arms were taken up during the period of the upheaval of nations so now each of us must make a stand against dishonesty all remedies will end in failure As a Russian therefore as one bound to you by consanguinity and identity of blood I make to you my appeal I make it to those of you who understand wherein lies nobility of thought I invite those men to remember the duty which confronts us whatsoever our respective stations I invite them to observe more closely their duty and to keep more constantly in mind their obligations of holding true to their country in that before us the future looms dark and that we can scarcely Here the manuscript of the original comes abruptly to an end FOOTNOTES Footnote one Essays
