none	none	PAUL KEGWORTHY lived with his mother missus Button his stepfather mister Button and six little Buttons his half brothers and sisters His was not an ideal home it consisted in a bedroom a kitchen and a scullery in a grimy little house in a grimy street made up of rows of exactly similar grimy little houses and forming one of a hundred similar streets in a northern manufacturing town mister and missus Button worked in a factory and took in as lodgers grimy single men who also worked in factories They were not a model couple they were rather in fact the scandal of Budge Street which did not itself enjoy in Bludston a reputation for holiness Neither was good to look upon mister Button who was Lancashire bred and born divided the yearnings of his spirit between strong drink and dog fights missus Button a viperous Londoner yearned for noise When mister Button came home drunk he punched his wife about the head and kicked her about the body while they both exhausted the vocabulary of vituperation of North and South to the horror and edification of the neighbourhood When mister Button was sober missus Button chastised little Paul She would have done so when mister Button was drunk but she had not the time The periods therefore of his mother s martyrdom were those of Paul s enfranchisement If he saw his stepfather come down the street with steady gait he fled in terror if he saw him reeling homeward he lingered about with light and joyous heart The brood of young Buttons was fed spasmodically and clad at random but their meals were regular and their raiment well assorted compared with Paul s Naturally they came in for clouts and thumps like all the children in Budge Street it was only Paul who underwent organized chastisement The little Buttons often did wrong but in the mother s eyes Paul could never do right In an animal way she was fond of the children of Button and in a way equally animal she bore a venomous dislike to the child of Kegworthy Who and what Kegworthy had been neither Paul nor any inhabitant of Bludston knew Once the boy inquired and she broke a worn frying pan over his head Kegworthy whoever he might have been was wrapt in mystery She had appeared in the town when Paul was a year old giving herself out as a widow That she was by no means destitute was obvious from the fact that she at once rented the house in Budge Street took in lodgers and lived at her ease Button who was one of the lodgers cast upon her the eyes of desire and married her Why she married Button she could never determine Perhaps she had a romantic idea and there is romance even in Budge Street that Button would support her He very soon shattered any such illusion by appropriating the remainder of her fortune and kicking her into the factory with hobnailed boots It would be wrong to say that missus Button did not complain she did She rent the air of Budge Street with horrible execration but she went to the factory where save for the intervals of retirement rendered necessary by the births of the little Buttons she was contented enough to stay If Paul Kegworthy had been of the same fibre as the little Buttons he would have felt thought and acted as they and this history would never have been written He would have grown up to man s estate in the factory and have been merged an indistinguishable unit in the drab mass of cloth capped humans who at certain hours of the day flood the streets of Bludston and swarm on the roofs of clanging and shrieking tramcars and on Saturday afternoons gather in clotted greyness on the football ground He might have been sober and industrious the proletariat of Bludston is not entirely composed of Buttons but he would have taken the colour of his environment and the world outside Bludston would never have heard of him Paul however differed greatly from the little Buttons They children of the grey cap and the red shawl resembled hundreds of thousands of little human rabbits similarly parented Only the trained eye could have identified them among a score or two of their congeners For the most part they were dingily fair with snub noses coarse mouths and eyes of an indeterminate blue Of that type once blowsily good looking was missus Button herself But Paul wandered a changeling about the Bludston streets In the rows of urchins in the crowded Board School classroom he sat as conspicuous as any little Martian who might have been bundled down to earth He had wavy black hair of raven black a dark olive complexion flushed in spite of haphazard nourishment and nights spent on the stone floor of the reeking scullery with the warm blood of health great liquid black eyes and the exquisitely delicate features of a young Praxitelean god It was this preposterous perfection which while redeeming him from ridiculous beauty by giving his childish face a certain rigidity differentiated him outwardly from his fellows mister Button to whom the unusual was anathema declared that the sight of the monstrosity made him sick and rarely suffered him in his presence and one day missus Button discovering him in front of the cracked mirror in which mister Button shaved when his hand was steady enough on Sunday afternoons smote him over the face with a pound of rump steak which she happened to be carrying instinctively desirous not only to correct her son for vanity but also to spoil the comeliness of which he might be vain Until a wonderful and illuminating happening in his eleventh year little Paul Kegworthy had taken existence with the fatalism of a child Of his stepfather who smelt lustily of sour beer bad tobacco and incidentally of other things undetected by Paul s nostrils and whom he saw rarely he dwelt in mortal terror When he heard of the Devil at Sunday school which he attended to his stepfather s disgust he pictured the Prince of Darkness not as a gentleman not even as a picturesque personage with horns and tail but as mister Button As regards his mother he had a confused idea that he was a living blight on her existence He was not sorry because it was not his fault but in his childish way he coldly excused her and more from a queer consciousness of blighterdom than from dread of her hand and tongue he avoided her as much as possible In the little Buttons his experience as scapegoat taught him to take but little interest From his earliest memories they were the first to be fed clothed and bedded to his own share fell the exiguous scraps As they were much younger than himself he found no pleasure in their companionship For society he sought such of the youth of Budge Street as would admit him into their raucous fellowship But for some reason which his immature mind could not fathom he felt a pariah even among his coevals He could run as fast as Billy Goodge the undisputed leader of the gang he could dribble the rag football past him any time he desired once he had sent him home to his mother with a bleeding nose and even in that hour of triumph popular sympathy had been with Billy not with him It was the only problem in existence to which his fatalism did not supply the key He knew himself to be a better man than Billy Goodge There was no doubt about it At school where Billy was the woodenest blockhead he was top of his class He knew things about troy weight and geography and Isaac and the Mariners of England of which Billy did not dream To Billy the football news in the Saturday afternoon edition of The Bludston Herald was a cryptogram to him it was an open book He would stand acknowledged scholar at the street corner and read out from the soiled copy retrieved by Chunky the newsboy the enthralling story of the football day never stumbling over a syllable athrill with the joy of being the umbilicus of a tense world and when the recital was over he would have the mortification of seeing the throng pass away from him with the remorselessness of a cloud scudding from the moon And he would hear Billy Goodge say exultantly Didn t Aw tell yo the Wolves hadn t a dog s chance And he would see the admiring gang slap Billy on the back and hear Good owd Billy and never a word of thanks to him Then knowing Billy to be a liar he would tell him so yelping shrilly in Buttonesque vernacular North and South This morning tha said it was five to one on Sheffield United Listen to Susie The parasitic urchins would yell at the witticism the eternal petitio principii of childhood which Billy secure in his cohort from bloody nose felt justified in making And Paul Kegworthy the rag of a newspaper crumpled tight in his little hand would watch them disappear and wonder at the paradox of life In any sphere of human effort so he dimly and childishly realized he could wipe out Billy Goodge He had a soul reaching contempt for Billy Goodge a passionate envy of him Why did Billy hold his position instead of crumbling into dust before him Assuredly he was a better man than Billy When Billy duce et auspice Billy the gang played at pirates or Red Indians it was pitiful to watch their ignorant endeavours Paul deeply read in the subject gave them chapter and verse for his suggestions But they heeded him so little that he would turn away contemptuously disdaining the travesty of the noble game and dream of a gang of brighter spirits whom he could lead to glory Paul had many such dreams wherewith he sought to cheat the realities of existence but until the Great Happening the dream was not better than the drink after it came the Vision Splendid The wonderful thing happened all because Maisie Shepherd a slip of a girl of nineteen staying at saint Luke s Vicarage spilled a bottle of scent over her frock It was the morning of the saint Luke s annual Sunday school treat The waggonette was at the vicarage door The vicar and his wife and daughter waited fussily for Maisie an unpunctual damsel The vicar looked at his watch They were three minutes late He tut tutted impatiently The vicar s daughter ran indoors in search of Maisie and pounced upon her as she sat on the edge of the bed in the act of perfuming a handkerchief The shock caused the bottle to slip mouth downward from her hand and empty the contents into her lap She cried out in dismay Never mind said the vicar s daughter Come along Dad and mother are prancing about downstairs But I must change my dress You ve no time I m wet through This is the strongest scent known It s twenty six shillings a bottle and one little drop is enough I shall be a walking pestilence The vicar s daughter laughed heartlessly You do smell strong But you ll disinfect Bludston and that will be a good thing Whereupon she dragged the tearful and redolent damsel from the room In the hard featured yard of the schoolhouse the children were assembled the girls on one side the boys on the other Curates and teachers hovered about the intervening space Almost every child wore its Sunday best Even the shabbiest little girls had a clean white pinafore to hide deficiencies beneath and the untidiest little boy showed a scrubbed face The majority of the boys wore clean collars some grinned over gaudy neckties The only one who appeared in his week day grime and tatterdemalion outfit was little Paul Kegworthy He had not changed his clothes because he had no others and he had not washed his face because it had not occurred to him to do so Moreover missus Button had made no attempt to improve his forlorn aspect for the simple reason that she had never heard of the Sunday school treat It was part of Paul s philosophy to dispense as far as he could with parental control On Sunday afternoons the little Buttons played in the streets where Paul had he so chosen might have played also but he put himself so to speak to Sunday school where besides learning lots of queer things about God and Jesus Christ which interested him keenly he could shine above his fellows by recitations of collects and bits of Catechism which did not interest him at all Then he won scores of good conduct cards gaudy treasures with pictures of Daniel in the Lions Den and the Marriage of Cana and such like which he secreted preciously beneath a loose slab in the scullery floor He did not show them to his mother knowing that she would tear them up and bang him over the head and for similar reasons he refrained from telling her of the Sunday school treat If she came to hear of it as possibly she would through one of the little Buttons who might pick up the news in the street he would be soundly beaten But there was a chance of her not hearing and he desired to be no more of a blight than he could help So Paul vagabond and self reliant from his babyhood turned up at the Sunday school treat hatless and coatless his dirty little toes visible through the holes in his boots and his shapeless and tattered breeches secured to his person by a single brace The better dressed urchins moved away from him and made rude remarks after the generous manner of their kind but Paul did not care Pariahdom was his accustomed portion He was there for his own pleasure They were going to ride in a train They were going to have a wonderful afternoon in a nobleman s park a place all grass and trees elusive to the imagination There was a stupefying prospect of wondrous things in profusion to eat and drink jam ginger beer cake So rumour had it and to unsophisticated Paul rumour was gospel truth With all these unexperienced joys before him what cared he for the blankety little blanks who gibed at him If you imagine that little Paul Kegworthy formulated his thoughts as would the angel choir boy in the pictures you are mistaken The baby language of Bludston would petrify the foc sle of a tramp steamer The North of England is justly proud of its virility The Sunday school marshalled by curates and teachers awaited the party from the vicarage The thick and darkened sunshine of Bludston flooded the asphalt of the yard which sent up a reek of heat causing curates to fan themselves with their black straw hats and little boys in clean collars to wriggle in sticky discomfort while in the still air above the ignoble town hung the heavy pall of smoke Presently there was the sound of wheels and the sight of the head of the vicar s coachman above the coping of the schoolyard wall Then the gates opened and the vicar and his wife and Miss Merewether her daughter and Maisie Shepherd appeared and were immediately greeted by curates and teachers Maisie Shepherd a stranger in a strange land pretty pink blushing hatefully self conscious detached herself after a minute or two from the group and looked with timid curiosity on the children She was a London girl her head still dancing with the delights of her first season and she had never been to a Sunday school treat in her life Madge Merewether her old schoolfellow had told her she was to help amuse the little girls Heaven knew how she was to do it Already the unintelligibility of Lancashire speech had filled her with dismay The array of hard faced little girls daunted her she turned to the boys but she only saw one the little hatless coatless scarecrow with the perfect features And arresting grace who stood out among his smug companions with the singularly vivid incongruity of a Greek Hermes in the central hall of Madame Tussaud s waxwork exhibition Fascinated she strayed down the line toward him She halted looked for a second or two into a pair of liquid black eyes and then blushed in agonized shyness She stared at the beautiful boy and the beautiful boy stared at her and not a word could she find in her head to speak She turned abruptly and moved away The boy broke rank and slowly followed her For little Paul Kegworthy the heavens had opened and flooded his senses till he nearly fainted with the perfume of celestial lands The intoxicating sweetness of it bewildered his young brain It was 
7594_81881_000039_000004	train-clean-360	nothing 
none	none	delicate evanescent like the smell of a flower It as thick pungent cloying compelling Mouth agape and nostril wide he followed the exquisite source of the emanation like one in a dream half across the yard A curate laughingly and unsuspectingly brought him back to earth by laying hands on him and bundling him back into his place There he remained being a docile urchin but his eyes remained fixed on Maisie Shepherd She was only a rosebud beauty of an English girl her beauty heightened by the colour of distress but to Paul the radiance of her person almost rivalled the wonder of her perfume It was his first meeting of a goddess face to face and he surrendered his whole being in adoration In a few minutes the children were marched through the squalid streets a strident band to the dingy railway station a grimy proletariat third class railway station in which the sign First Class Waiting Room glared an outrage and a mockery and were marshalled into the waiting train The wonderful experience of which Paul had dreamed for weeks he had never ridden in a train before began and soon the murky environs of the town were left behind and the train sped through the open country His companions in the railway carriage crowded at the windows fighting vigorously for right of place but Paul sat alone in the middle of the seat unmoved by the new sensation and speed and by the glimpses of blue sky and waving trees above the others heads The glory of the day was blotted out until he should see and smell the goddess again At the wayside station where they descended he saw her in the distance and the glory came once more She caught his eye smiled and nodded He felt a queer thrill run through him He had been singled out from among all the boys He alone knew her Brakes took them from the station down a country road and after a mile or so through stone gates of a stately park where wonder after wonder was set out before Paul s unaccustomed eyes On either side of this roadway stretched rolling grass with clumps and glades of great trees in their July bravery more trees than Paul imagined could be in the world There were sunlit upland patches and cool dells of shade carpeted with golden buttercups where cattle fed lazily Once a herd of fallow deer browsing by the wayside scuttled away at the noisy approach of the brakes Only afterward did Paul learn their name and nature to him then they were mythical beasts of fairyland Once also the long pile of the Tudor house came into view flashing white in the sunshine The teacher in charge of the brake explained that it was the Marquis of Chudley s residence It was more beautiful than anything Paul had ever seen it was bigger than many churches put together the word Palace came into his head it transcended all his preconceived ideas of palaces yet in such a palace only could dwell the radiant and sweet smelling lady of his dream The certainty gave him a curious satisfaction They arrived at the spot where the marquees were erected and at once began the traditional routine of the school treat games for the girls manlier sports for the boys Lord Chudley patron of the living of saint Luke s Bludston and Lord Bountiful of the feast had provided swing boats and a merry go round which discoursed infernal music to enraptured ears Paul stood aloof for a while from these delights his eye on the section of the girls among whom his goddess moved As soon as she became detached and he could approach her without attracting notice he crept within the magic circle of the scent and lay down prone drinking in its intoxication and as she moved he wriggled toward her on his stomach like a young snake After a time she came near him Why aren t you playing with the other boys she asked Paul sat on his heels Dunno miss he said shyly She glanced at his rapscallion attire blushed and blamed herself for the tactless question This is a beautiful place isn t it It s heavenly said Paul with his eyes on her One scarcely wants to do anything but just just well be here She smiled He nodded and said Ay Then he grew bolder I like being alone he declared defiantly Then I ll leave you she laughed The blood flushed deep under his unwashed olive skin and he leaped to his feet Aw didn t mean that he protested hotly It wur them other boys She was touched by his beauty and quick sensitiveness I was only teasing I m sure you like being with me Paul had never heard such exquisite tones from human lips To his ears accustomed to the harsh Lancashire burr her low accentless voice was music So another of his senses was caught in the enchantment Yo speak so pretty said he At that moment a spruce but perspiring young teacher came up We re going to have some boys races miss and we want the ladies to look on His lordship has offered prizes The first is a boys race under eleven You can join in that anyhow she said to Paul Go along and let me see you win Paul scudded off his heart aflame his hand as he ran tucking in the shirt whose evasion from the breeches was beyond the control of the single brace Besides crawling on your stomach is dislocating even to the most neatly secured attire But his action was mechanical His thoughts were with his goddess In his inarticulate mind he knew himself to be her champion He sped under her consecration He knew he could run He could run like a young deer Though despised could he not outrun any of the youth in Budge Street He took his place in the line of competing children Far away in the grassy distance were two men holding a stretched string On one side of him was a tubby boy with a freckled face and an amorphous nose on which the perspiration beaded on the other a lank consumptive creature in Eton collar and red tie and a sprig of sweet William in his buttonhole a very superior person Neither of them desired his propinquity They tried to hustle him from the line But Paul born Ishmael had his hand against them The fat boy smitten beneath the belt doubled up in pain and the consumptive person rubbed agonized shins A curate walking down repressing bulges and levelling up concavities ordained order The line stood tense Away beyond toward the goal appeared a white mass which Paul knew to be the ladies in their summer dresses and among them though he could not distinguish her was she in whose eyes he was to win glory The prize did not matter It was for her that he was running In his childish mind he felt passionately identified with her He was her champion The word was given The urchins started Paul his little elbows squared behind him and his eyes fixed vacantly in space ran with his soul in the toes that protruded through the ragged old boots He knew not who was in front or who was behind It was the madness of battle He ran and ran until somebody put his arms round him and stopped him Steady on my boy steady on Paul looked round in a dazed way Have A won th race I m afraid not my lad With a great effort he screwed his mind to another question Wheer did A coom in About sixth but you ran awfully well Sixth He had come in sixth Sky and grass and trees and white mass of ladies among whom was the goddess and unconsiderable men and boys became a shimmering blur He seemed to stagger away stagger miles away until finding himself quite alone he threw himself down under a beech tree and after a few moments vivid realization
6956_81870_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 of what 
none	none	had happened sobbed out the agony of his little soul s despair Sixth He had come in sixth He had failed miserably in his championship How she must despise him she who had sent him forth to victory And yet how had it been possible How had it been possible that other boys could beat him He was he An indomitable personage Some hideous injustice guided human affairs Why shouldn t he have won He could not tell But he had not won She had sent him forth to win He had lost He had come in a sickening sixth The disgrace devastated him Maisie Shepherd interested in her child champion sought him out and easily found him under the beech tree Why what is the matter As he did not answer she knelt by his side and put her hand on his lean shoulder Tell me what has happened Again the celestial fragrance overspread his senses He checked his sobs and wiped his eyes with the back of his grubby hand Aw didn t win he moaned Poor little chap she said comfortingly Did you want to win so very much He got up and stared at her Yo told me to win So you ran for me Ay She rose to her feet and looked down upon him somewhat overwhelmed by her responsibility So in ancient days might a fair maiden have regarded her knight who underwent entirely unnecessary batterings for her sake Then for me you ve won she said I wish I could give you a prize But what in the nature of a prize for a gutter imp of eleven does a pocketless young woman attired for the serious business of a school treat carry upon her person She laughed in pretty embarrassment If I gave you something quite useless what would you do with it I u d hide it safe so ut nobody should see it said Paul thinking of his precious cards Wouldn t you show it to anybody By Gum he checked himself suddenly Such he had learned was not Sunday school language I wouldno show it to a dog said he Maisie Shepherd aware of romantic foolishness slipped a cornelian heart from a thin gold chain round her neck It s all I can give you for a prize if you will have it If he would have it The Koh i Noor in his clutch and a knowledge of its value could not have given him more thrilling rapture He was speechless with amazement Maisie thrilled too realized that a word spoken would have rung false The boy gloated over his treasure but she did not know how could she what it meant to him To Paul the bauble was a bit of the warm wonder that was she How are you going to keep it she asked He hoicked a bit of his shirt tail from his breeches and proceeded to knot the cornelian heart secure therein Maisie fled rapidly on the verge of hysterics After that the school treat had but one meaning for Paul He fed it is true in Pantagruelian fashion on luscious viands transcending his imagination of those which lay behind Blinks the confectioner s window in Bludston there he succumbed to the animal but the sports the swing boats the merry go round offered no temptation He hovered around Maisie Shepherd like a little dog quite content to keep her in sight And every two or three minutes he fumbled about his breeches to see that the knotted treasure was safe The day sank into late afternoon The children had been fed The weary elders had their tea The vicarage party took a few moments rest in the shade of a clump of firs some distance away from the marquee Behind the screen lay Paul his eyes on his goddess his heels in the air a buttercup stalk between his teeth He felt the comforting knot beneath his thigh For the first time perhaps in his life he knew utter happiness He heard the talk but did not listen Suddenly however the sound of his own name caused him to prick his ears Paul Kegworthy They were talking about him There could be no mistake He slithered a foot or two nearer No matter whether his people are drunkards or murderers said the beloved voice he is the most beautiful thing I ve ever seen in my life Have you ever spoken to him Winifred No said the vicar s daughter Of course I ve noticed him Every one does he is remarkable I don t believe he s a child of these people at all Maisie declared He s of a different clay He s as sensitive as as a sensitive plant You ought to keep your eye on him mister Merewether I believe he s a poor little prince in a fairy tale A freak a lusus naturae said the vicar Paul did not know what a lusus naturae was but it sounded mighty grand He s a fairy prince and one day he ll come into his kingdom My dear if you saw his mother But I m sure no one but a princess could be Paul Kegworthy s mother laughed Maisie And his father A prince too And Paul listened and drank in his goddess s words greedily Truth clear as crystal fell from her lips A wild wonder racked his little soul She had said that his mother was not his mother and that his father was a prince The tidings capped the glory of an effulgent day When he sneaked home late missus Button who had learned how he had misspent his time gave him a merciless thrashing Why should he be trapesing about with Sunday schools she asked with impolite embroidery while his poor little brothers and sisters were crying in the street She would learn him to Mess about with parsons and Sunday school teachers She was in process of learning him when mister Button entered He swore in a manner which would have turned our armies in Flanders pallid and kicked Paul into the scullery There the boy remained and went supperless to his bed of sacks aching and tearless Before he slept he put his cornelian heart in his hiding hole What cared he for stripes or kicks or curses with the Vision Splendid glowing before his eyes CHAPTER II FOR splenetic reasons which none but the Buttons of this world can appreciate Paul was forbidden under pain of ghastly tortures to go near the Sunday school again and lest he should defy authority he was told off on Sunday afternoons to mind the baby either in the street or the scullery according to the weather while the other little Buttons were not allowed to approach him The defection of the brilliant scholar having been brought to the vicar s notice he ventured to call one Saturday afternoon on the Buttons but such was the contumely with which he was received that the good man hastily retreated In lung power he was outmatched In repartee he was singularly outclassed He then sent the superintendent of the school a man of brawn and zeal to see what muscular Christianity could accomplish But muscular Christianity losing its head came off with a black eye After that the Buttons were left alone and no friendly hand drew Paul within the gates of his Sunday Paradise He thought of it with aching wistfulness The only thing that the superintendent could do was to give him surreptitiously a prayer book bidding him perfect himself in the Catechism in view of future Confirmation But as emulation of his fellows and not religious zeal was the mainspring of Paul s enthusiasm the pious behest was disregarded Paul dived into the volume occasionally however for intellectual entertainment As for the fragrant and beautiful goddess she had disappeared into thin air Paul hung for a week or two about the vicarage in the hope of seeing her but in vain As a matter of fact Maisie Shepherd had left for Scotland the morning after the school treat people don t come to Bludston for long and happy holidays So Paul had to feed his ardent little soul on memories That she had not been an impalpable creature of his fancy was proven by the precious cornelian heart Her words too were written in fine flame across his childish mind Paul began to live the life of dreams He longed for books The fragmentary glimpses of history and geography in the Board school standard whetted without satisfying his imagination There was not a book in the house in Budge Street and he had never a penny to buy one Sometimes Button would bring home a dirty newspaper which Paul would steal and read in secret but its contents seemed to lack continuity He thirsted for a story Once a generous boy since dead he was too good to live had given him a handful of penny dreadfuls whence he had derived his knowledge of pirates and Red Indians Too careless and confident he had left them about the kitchen and his indignant mother had used them to light the fire The burning of his library was an enduring tragedy He realized that it must be reconstituted but how His nimble wit hit on a plan Vagrant as an unowned dog he could roam the streets at pleasure Why should he not sell newspapers in a quarter of the town be it understood remote from both factory and Budge Street He sold newspapers for three weeks before he was found out Then he was chastised and forced to go on selling newspapers with no profit to himself for his person was rigorously searched and coppers confiscated as soon as he came home But during the three weeks traffic on his own account he had amassed a sufficient hoard of pennies for the purchase of several books in gaudy paper covers exposed for sale in the little stationer s shop round the corner Soon he discovered that if he could batik a copper or two on his way home his mother would be none the wiser The stationer became his banker and when the amount of the deposit equaled the price of a book Paul withdrew his money s worth So a goodly library of amazing rubbish was stored by degrees under the scullery slab until it outgrew safe accommodation whereupon Paul transferred the bulk of it to a hole in a bit of waste ground a deserted brickfield on the ragged outskirts of the town At last misfortune befell him One dreary afternoon of rain he dropped his new bundle of papers in the mud of the roadway To avoid death he had to spring from the path of a thundering tramcar A heavy cart ran over the bundle While he was ruefully and hastily gathering the papers together a band of street children swooped down and kicked them lustily about the filth He was battling with one urchin when a policeman grabbed him With an elusive twist he escaped and ran like a terrified hare Disaster followed and that was the end of his career as a newsvendor Greater leisure for reading however compensated the loss of the occasional penny He read dazzling tales of dukes with palaces like Chudley Court and countesses with ropes of diamonds in their hair who all bore a resemblance to the fragrant one And dukes and countesses lived the most resplendent lives and spoke such beautiful language and had such a way with them He felt a curious pride in being able to enter into all their haughty emotions Then one day he began a story about a poor little outcast boy in a slum At first he did not care for it His soaring spirit disdained boys in slums It had its being on higher planes But he read on and reading on grew interested until interest was intensified into absorption For the outcast boy in the slums you must know was really the kidnapped child of a prince and a princess and after the most romantic adventures was enfolded in his parents arms married a duke s beauteous daughter whom in his poverty he had worshipped from afar and drove away with his bride in a coach and six To little Paul Kegworthy the clotted nonsense was a revelation from on high He was that outcast boy The memorable pronouncement of the goddess received confirmation in some kind of holy writ The Vision Splendid hitherto confused crystallized into focus He realized vividly how he differed in feature and form and intellect and character from the low crowd with whom he was associated His unpopularity was derived from envy His manifest superiority was gall to their base natures

none	none	he had got to the heart of the mystery missus Button was not his mother For reasons unknown he had been kidnapped Aware of his high lineage she hated him and beat him and despitefully used him She never gushed it is true over her offspring but the little Buttons flourished under genuine motherment They inconsiderable brats were her veritable children Whereas he Paul it was as plain as daylight Somewhere far away in the great world an august and griefstricken pair at that very moment were mourning the loss of their only son There they were in their marble palace surrounded by flunkeys all crimson and gold men servants were always gorgeously apparelled flunkeys in Paul s books sitting at a table loaded with pineapples on golden dishes and eating out their hearts with longing He could hear their talk If only our beloved son were with us said the princess wiping away a tear We must be patient my sweet Highness replied the prince with lofty resignation stamped on his noble brow Let us trust to Heaven to remove the cankerworm that is gnawing our vitals Paul felt very sorry for them and he too wiped away a tear For many years he remembered that day He was alone in his brickfield on a gusty March morning the Easter holidays had released him from school squatting by his hole under the lee of a mass of earth and rubbish It was a mean expanse blackened by soot and defiled by refuse Here and there bramble and stunted gorse struggled for an existence but the flora mainly consisted in bits of old boots and foul raiment protruding grotesquely from the soil half buried cans rusty bits of iron and broken bottles On one side the backs of grimy little houses their yards full of fluttering drab underwear marked the edge of the hopeless town which rose above them in forbidding buildings belching chimney shafts and the spikes of a couple of spires On the other sides it was bounded by the brick walls of factories the municipal gasworks and the approach to the railway station indicated by signal posts standing out against the sky like gallows and a tram line bordered by a row of skeleton cottages Golgotha was a grim garden compared with Paul s brickfield Sometimes the children of the town scuttled about it like dingy little rabbits But more often it was a desolate solitude Perhaps all but the lowest of the parents of Bludston had put the place out of bounds as gipsies and other dwellers in vans were allowed to camp there It also bore an evil name because a night murder or two had been committed in its murky seclusion Paul knew the exact spot an ugly cavity toward the gasworks end where a woman had been done in and even he lord of the brickfield preferred to remain at a purifying distance But it was his own domain He felt in it a certain pride of possession The hollow under the lee of the rubbish heap by the side of the hole where he kept his paper library was the most homelike place he knew For many years he remembered that day The light that never was on sea or land fell upon the brickfield He had read the story at one stretch He had sat there for hours reading for hours rapt in his Vision At last material darkness began to gather round him and he awoke with a start to realization that he had been sitting there most of the day With a sigh he replaced his book in the hole which he cunningly masked with a lump of hard clay and feeling stiff and cold ran childlike homeward In the silence of the night he took out his cornelian heart and fondled it The day had been curiously like yet utterly unlike the day on which she had taken it from her neck In a dim fashion he knew that the two days were of infinite significance in his life and were complementary He had been waiting as it were for nine months for this day s revelation this day s confirmation Paul rose the next morning a human being with a fixed idea an unquestioned faith in his destiny His star shone clear He was born to great things In those early years that followed it was not a matter of an imaginative child s vanity but the unalterable serene conviction of a child s soul The prince and princess were realities his future greatness a magnificent certitude You must remember this if you would understand Paul s after life It was built on this radiant knowledge In the afternoon he met Billy Goodge and the gang They were playing at soldiers Billy distinguished by a cocked hat made out of newspaper and a wooden sword Coom on Susie wi be going to knock hell out of the boys in Stamford Street Paul folded his arms and looked at him contemptuously as became one of his noble blood You could no knock hell out of a bug What s that tha says Paul repeated the insult Say that agen blustered the cocked hatted leader Paul said it again and nothing happened Billy received vociferous and sanguinary advice couched in sanguinary terms Try and hit me said Billy The scene was oddly parallel with one in the story of the outcast boy of the gutter Paul conscious of experiment calmly went up to him and kicked him He kicked him hard The sensation was delicious Billy edged away He knew from past experience that if it came to blows he was no match for Paul but hitherto having shown fight he had received the support of the gang Now however there was an extraordinary quality in Paul s defiance which took the spirit out of him Once more he was urged by the ragged brats to deeds of blood He did not respond Paul kicked him again before his followers If he could have gone on kicking him for ever and ever what delirium of joy were eternity Billy edged farther away The mongrel game cock was beaten Paul dramatically conscious of what the unrecognized prince would do in such a circumstance advanced smacked his face plucked the cocked hat from his head the sword from his hand and invested himself with these insignia of leadership Billy melted silently into the subfusc air of Budge Street The ragged regiment looked around and there was no Billy Paul Kegworthy the raggedest of them all with nothing to recommend him but his ridiculous exotic beauty and the paper and wooden spolia opima of the vanquished stood before them a tattered Caesar The gang hung spellbound They were ready small band of heroes to follow him against the hordes of Stamford Street They only awaited his signal Paul tasted a joy known but to few of the sons of men absolute power over and supreme contempt for his fellows He stood for a moment or two in the grey miserable street discordant with the wailings of babies and the clamour of futile little girls who after the manner of women had no idea of political crisis and the shrill objurgations of slattern mothers and the raucous cries of an idealist vendor of hyacinths and cocked hat on head and wooden sword in hand he looked at his fawning army Then came the touch of genius that was often to characterize his actions in after years It was mimetic as he had read of such a thing in his paper covered textbooks but it was none the less a touch of genius He frowned on the dirty ignoble little boys What had he in common with them he the son of a prince Nothing He snapped his sword across his knee tore his cocked hat in two and casting the fragments before them marched proudly toward the very last place on the face of the earth that he desired to visit his own home The army remained for a few seconds bewildered by the dramatic and unexpected and leaderless did what many a real army has done in similar circumstances straggled into disintegration Thenceforward Paul had he so chosen could have ruled despotically in Budge Street But he did not choose The games from which he used to be excluded or in which he used to be allowed to join on sufferance no longer appealed to him He preferred to let Joey Meakin lead the gang vice Billy Goodge deposed while he himself remained aloof Now and then he condescended to arbitrate between disputants or to kick a little brute of a bully but he felt that in doing so he was derogating from his high dignity It was his joy to feel himself a dark majestic power overshadowing the street a kind of Grand Llama hidden in mystery Often he would walk through the midst of the children seemingly unconscious of their existence acting strenuously to himself his part of a high born prince This lasted till a dark and awful day when mister Button pitched him into the factory These were times before kindly Education Acts and Factory Acts decreed that no boy under twelve years of age should work in a factory and that every boy under fourteen should spend half his time at the factory and half at school Paul s education was considered complete and he had to plunge into full time at the grim and grinding place He had joined the great army of workers A wide gulf separated him from the gang of Budge Street It existed for him no more than did the little girls and babies Life changed its aspect entirely Gone were the days of vagabondage the lazy the delicious even though cold and hungry hours of dreaming and reading in the brickfield gone was the happy freedom of the chartered libertine of the gutter He was bound a little slave like hundreds of other little slaves and thousands of big ones to a relentless machine He entered the hopeless factory gate at six in the morning and left it at half past five in the evening and his rough food swallowed slunk to his kennel in the scullery like a little tired dog And mister Button drank and beat missus Button and missus Button beat Paul whenever she felt in the humour and had anything handy to do it with and as a matter of course confiscated his wages on Saturday and set him to mind the baby on Sunday afternoons In the monotony weariness and greyness of life the glory of the Vision began to grow dim In the factory he was not thrown into competition with other boys He was the skip the drudge the carrier and fetcher the cleaner and polisher for a work bench of men devoid of sentiment and blind to his princely qualities He tried indeed by nimbleness of hand and intelligence to impress them with his superiority to his predecessors but they were not impressed At the most he escaped curses His mind began to work in the logic of the real Entrance into his kingdom implied as a primary condition release from the factory But how could such release come when every morning a remorseless and insensate hook just like a certain hook in the machinery whose deadly certainty of grip fascinated and terrified him caught him from his morning sleep every morning of his life save Sunday and swung him inexorably into the factory He looked around and saw that no one was released except through death or illness or incompetence And the incompetent starved Any child in Budge Street with a grain of sense knew that There was no release He son of a prince would work for ever and ever in Bludston His heart failed him And there was no one to whom he could tell the tragic and romantic story of his birth One or two happy gleams of brightness however lightened his darkness and prevented the Vision from fading entirely into the greyness of the factory sky Once the Owner an unspeakable god with a bald pink head and a paunch vastly chained with gold conducted a party of ladies over the works One of the latter a very grand lady noticed him at his bench and came and spoke kindly to him Her voice had the same sweet timbre as his goddess s After she had left him his quick ears caught her question to the Owner Where did you get your young Apollo Not out of Lancashire surely He s wonderful And just before she passed out of sight she turned and looked at him and smiled He learned on inquiry that she was the Marchioness of Chudley The instant recognition of him by one of his own aristocratic caste revived his faith The day would assuredly come Suppose it had been his own mother instead of the Marchioness Stranger things happened in the books The other gleam proceeded from one of the workmen at his bench a serious and socialistic person who occasionally lent him something to read Foxe s Book of Martyrs Mill on Liberty Bellamy s Looking Backward at that time at the height of its popularity And sometimes he would talk to Paul about collectivism and the new era that was coming when there would be no such words as rich and poor because there would be no such classes as they denoted Paul would say Then a prince will be no better than a factory hand There won t be any princes I tell thee his friend would reply and launch out into a denunciation of tyrants But this did not suit Paul If there were to be no princes where would he come in So while grateful to the evangelist for talking to him and treating him as a human being he totally rejected his gospel It struck at the very foundations of his visionary destiny He was afraid to argue for his friend was vehement Also confession of aristocratic prejudices might turn friendship into enmity But his passionate antagonism to the communistic theory all the more intense through suppression strengthened his fantastic faith Still the transient smile of a marchioness and the political economy of a sour avised operative are not enough to keep alive the romance of underfed ill clad overdriven childhood And after a while he was deprived even of the latter consolation his friend being shifted to another end of the factory In despair he turned to Ada the eldest of the little Buttons who now had reached years of comparative discretion and strove to interest her in his dreams veiling his identity under a fictitious name but Ada an unimaginative and practical child with a growing family to look after either listened stupidly or consigned him in the local vernacular to perdition But suppose it was me that was the unknown prince Supposing it was me I ve been talking about all the time Supposing it was me that went away and came back in a gold coach and six horses with a duke s daughter all over diamonds by my side what would tha say I think tha art nowt but a fool said the elderly child of ten and if mother heard thee she d lamm the life out of thee Paul had the sickening sensation of the man who has confided the high secrets of his soul to coarsefibred woman He turned away darkly conscious of having magnanimously given Ada a chance to mount with him into the upper air which opportunity she daughter of earth had in her purblind manner refused Thenceforward Ada was to him an unnoticeable item in the cosmos One hopeless month succeeded another until a cloud seemed to close round Paul s brain rendering him automatic in his actions merely animal in his half satisfied appetites Fines and curses were his portion at the factory curses and beatings deserved if Justice held a hurried scale at home Paul who had read of suicide in The Bludston Herald turned his thoughts morbidly to death But his dramatic imagination always carried him beyond his own demise to the scene in the household when his waxlike corpse should be discovered dangling from a rope fixed to the hook in the kitchen ceiling He posed cadaverous before a shocked Budge Street before a conscience stricken factory and he wept on his sack bed in the scullery because the prince and the princess his august parents would never know that he had died A whit less gloomy were his imaginings of the said prince and princess rushing into the house in the nick of time just before life was extinct and cutting him down How they were to find him he did not know This side track exploration of possibilities was a symptom of sanity Yet Heaven knows what would have happened to Paul after a year or so at the factory if Barney Bill a grotesque god from the wide and breezy spaces of the world had not limped into his life Barney Bill wore the cloth cap and conventional and unpicturesque though shapeless and weather stained garment of the late nineteenth century Neither horns nor goat s feet were visible nor was the pipe of reed on which he played Yet he played in Paul s ear the comforting melody of Pan and the glory of the Vision once more flooded Paul s senses and the factory and Budge Street and the Buttons and the scullery faded away like an evil dream CHAPTER III THE Fates arranged Barney Bill s entrance late on a Saturday afternoon in August It was not dramatic It was merely casual They laid the scene in the brickfield It had rained all day and now there was sullen clearance Paul who had been bathing with some factory boys in the not very savoury canal a mile or so distant had wandered mechanically to his brickfield library which by means of some scavenging process he managed to keep meagrely replenished Here he had settled himself with a dilapidated book on his knees for an hour s intellectual enjoyment It was not a cheerful evening The ground was sodden and rank emanations rose from the refuse From where he sat he could see an angry sunset like a black winged dragon with belly of flame brooding over the town The place wore an especial air of desolation Paul felt depressed Bathing in the pouring wet is a chilly sport and his midday meal of cold potatoes had not been invigorating These he had grabbed and having done them up hastily in newspaper had bolted with them out of the house He had been fined heavily for slackness during the week and mister Button s inevitable wrath at docked wages he desired to undergo as late as possible Then the sun had blazed furiously during the last six imprisoned days and now the long looked for hours of freedom were disfigured by rain and blight He resented the malice of things He also resented the invasion of his brickfield by an alien van a gaudy vehicle yellow and red to the exterior of which clinging wicker chairs brooms brushes and jute mats gave the impression of a lunatic s idea of decoration An old horse hobbled a few feet away philosophically cropped the abominable grass On the front of the van a man squatted with food and drink Paul hated him as a trespasser and a gormandizer Presently the man shading his eyes with his hand scrutinized the small melancholy figure and then hopping from his perch sped toward him with a nimble and curiously tortuous gait He approached a wiry almost wizened little man of fifty tanned to gipsy brown He had a shrewd thin face with an oddly flattened nose and little round moist dark eyes that glittered like diamonds He wore cloth cap on the back of his head showing in front a thick mass of closely cropped hair His collarless shirt was open at the neck and his sleeves were rolled up above the elbow You re Polly Kegworthy s kid ain t you he asked Ay said Paul Seen you afore haven t I Then Paul remembered Three or four times during his life at long long intervals the van had passed down Budge Street stopping at houses here and there About two years ago coming home he had met it at his own door His mother and the little man were talking together The man had taken him under the chin and twisted his face up Is that the nipper he had asked His mother had nodded and releasing Paul with a clumsy gesture of simulated affection had sent him with twopence for a pint of beer to the public house at the end of the street He recalled how the man had winked his little bright eye at his mother before putting the jug to his lips I browt th beer for yo said Paul You did It was the worst beer bar none I ve ever had I can taste it now He made a wry face Then he cocked his head on one side I suppose you re wondering who I am said he Ay said Paul Who art tha I m Barney Bill replied the man Did you never hear of me I m known on the road from Taunton to Newcastle and from Hereford to Lowestoft You can tell yer mother that you seed me A smile curled round Paul s lips at the comic idea of giving his mother unsolicited information Barney Bill said he Yuss said the man Then after a pause What are you doing of there Reading said Paul Let s have a look at it Paul regarded him suspiciously but there was kindliness in the twinkling glance He handed him the sorry apology for a book Barney Bill turned it over Why said he it ain t got no beginning and no end It s all middle Kenilworth Do yer like it Ay said Paul It s foine Who do yer think wrote it As both cover and a hundred pages at the beginning including the title page to say nothing of a hundred pages at the end were missing Paul had no clue to the authorship Dunno said he Sir Walter Scott Paul jumped to his feet Sir Walter Scott he knew not why or how was one of those bright names that starred in his historical darkness like Caesar and Napoleon and Ridley and Latimer and W G Grace Tha art sure Sir Water Scott The shock of meeting Sir Walter in the flesh could not have been greater The man nodded Think I d tell yer a lie I do a bit of reading myself in the old bus there he jerked a thumb I ve got some books now Would yer like to see em Would a mouse like cheese Paul started off with his new companion If it wasn t for a book or two I d go melancholy mad and bust myself the latter remarked Paul s spirit leaped toward a spiritual brother It was precisely his own case You ll find a lot of chaps that don t hold with books Dessay you ve met em Paul laughed precipient of irony Barney Bill continued I ve heard some on em say What s the good of books Give me nature and they goes and asks for it at the public ouse Most say nothing at all but just booze Like father said Paul Eh cried his friend sharply Sam Button what married mother Ali so he boozes a lot does he Paul drew an impressionistic and lurid picture of mister Button And they fight Like billy o said Paul They reached the van Barney Bill surprisingly agile in spite of his twisted leg sprang into the interior Paul standing between the shafts looked in with curiosity There was a rough though not unclean bed running down one side Beyond at the stern so to speak was a kind of galley containing cooking stove kettle and pot There were shelves some filled with stock in trade others with miscellaneous things the nature of which he could not distinguish in the gloom Barney Bill presently turned and dumped an armful of books on the footboard an inch or two below Paul s nose Paul scanned the title pages They were Goldsmith s Animated Nature Enquire Within Upon Everything an old bound volume of Cassell s Family Reader The Remains of Henry Kirke White and Martin Chuzzlewit The owner looked down upon them proudly I ve got some more but I can t get at em Paul regarded him with envy This was a man of great possessions How long are yo going to stay here he asked hopefully Till sunrise to morrow Paul s face fell He seemed to have no luck nowadays Barney Bill let himself down to a sitting position on the footboard and reached to the end for a huge pork pie and a clasp knife which lay beside a tin can I ll go on with my supper said he then noticing a wistful hungry look in the child s eyes Have a bit he asked He cut off a mighty hunk and put it into Paul s ready hand Paul perched himself beside him and they both ate for a long while in silence dangling their legs Now and again the host passed the tin of tea to wash down the food The flaming dragon died into a smoky red above the town A light or two already appeared in the fringe of mean houses Twilight fell rapidly Oughtn t you to be getting home Paul his hunger appeased grinned His idea was to sneak into the scullery just after the public houses closed when his mother would be far too much occupied with mister Button to worry about him Chastisement would then be postponed till the morning Artlessly he laid the situation before his friend who led him on to relate other amenities of his domestic life Well I m jiggered said Barney Bill She must be a she devil Paul cordially agreed He had already imagined the Prince of Darkness in the guise of mister Button missus Button was in every way fit to be the latter s diabolical mate Encouraged by sympathy and shrewd questions he sketched in broad detail his short career glorifying himself as the prize scholar and the erstwhile Grand Llama of Budge Street and drawing a dismal picture of the factory Barney Bill listened comprehendingly Then smoking a well blackened clay he began to utter maledictions on the suffocating life in towns and to extol his own manner of living Having an appreciative audience he grew eloquent over his lonely wanderings the length and breadth of the land over the joy of country things the sweetness of the fields the wayside flowers the vaulted highways in the leafy summer the quiet sleepy towns the fragrant villages the peace and cleanness of the open air The night had fallen and in the cleared sky the stars shone bright Paul his head against the lintel of the van door looked up at them enthralled by the talk of Barney Bill The vagabond merchant had the slight drawling inflection of the Home Counties which gave a soothing effect to a naturally soft voice To Paul it was the pipes of Pan It mightn t suit everybody said Barney Bill philosophically Some folks prefer gas to laylock I don t say that they re wrong But I likes laylock What s laylock asked Paul His friend explained No lilac bloomed in the blighted Springs of Bludston Does it smell sweet Yuss So does the may and the syringa and the new mown hay and the seaweed Never smelt any of em No sighed Paul sensuously conscious of new and vague horizons I once smelled summat sweet he said dreamily It wur a lady D ye mean a woman No A lady Like what yo read of I ve heard as they do smell good like violets some on em the philosopher remarked Drawn magnetically to this spiritual brother Paul said almost without volition She said I were the son of a prince Son of a WOT cried Barney Bill sitting up with a jerk that shook a volume or two onto the ground Paul repeated the startling word Lor lumme exclaimed the other don t yer know who yer father was Paul told of his disastrous attempts to pierce the mystery of his birth A frying pan Did she now That s a mother for yer Paul disowned her He disowned her with reprehensible emphasis Barney Bill pulled reflectively at his pipe Then he laid a bony hand on the boy s shoulder Who do you think yer mother was he asked gravely A princess Ay why not said Paul Why not echoed Barney Bill Why not You re a blooming lucky kid I wish I was a missin heir I know what I d do What asked Paul the ingenuous I d find my igh born parents How asked Paul I d go through the whole of England asking all the princes I met You don t meet em at every village pump ye know he added quickly lest the boy detecting the bantering note should freeze into reserve but if you keep yer eyes skinned and yer ears standing up you can learn where they are Lor lumme I wouldn t be a little nigger slave in a factory if I was the missin heir Not much I wouldn t be starved and beaten by Sam and Polly Button Not me D ye think yer aforesaid igh born parents are going to dive down into this stinkin suburb of hell to find yer out Not likely You ve got to find em sonny Yer can find anybody on the ighroad if yer tramps long enough What d yer think I ll find em said Paul in dizzy contemplation of possibilities When are yer going to start asked Barney Bill Paul felt his wages jingle in his pocket He was a capitalist The thrill of independence swept him from head to foot What time like the present I ll start now said he It was night Quite dark save for the stars the lights already disappearing in the fringe of mean houses whose outline was merged against the blackness of the town the green and red and white disks along the railway line behind the dim mass of the gasworks the occasional streak of conglomerate fireflies that was a tramcar and the red remorseless glow of here and there a furnace that never was extinct in the memory of man And save for the far shriek of trains the less remote and more frequent clanging of passing tramcars along the road edged with the skeleton cottages and startlingly near the vain munching and dull footfall of the old horse all was still Compared with home and Budge Street it was the reposeful quiet of the tomb Barney Bill smoked for a time in silence while Paul sat with clenched fists and a beating heart The simplicity of the high adventure dazed him All he had to do was to walk away walk and walk free as a sparrow Presently Barney Bill slid from the footboard You stay here sonny till I come back He limped away across the dim brickfield and sat down at the edge of the hollow where the woman had been murdered He had to think to decide a nice point of ethics A vagrant seller of brooms and jute mats even though he does carry about with him Cassell s Family Reader and The Remains of Henry Kirke White is distracted by few psychological problems Sufficient for the day is the physical thereof And when a man like Barney Bill is unencumbered by the continuous feminine the ordinary solution of life is simple But now the man had to switch his mind back to times before Paul was born when the eternal feminine had played the very devil with him when all sorts of passions and emotions had whirled his untrained being into dizziness No passions or emotions now affected him but their memory created an atmosphere of puzzledom He had to adjust values He had to deputize for Destiny He also had to harmonize the pathetically absurd with the grimly real He took off his cap and scratched his cropped head After a while he damned something indefinite and hastened in his dot and carry one fashion to the van Quite made up yer mind to go in search of yer ighborn parents Ay said Paul Like me to give yer a lift say as far as London Paul sprang to the ground and opened his mouth to speak But his knees grew weak and he quivered all over like one who beholds the god The abstract nebulous romance of his pilgrimage had been crystallized in a flash into the concrete Ay he panted Ay and he steadied himself with his back and elbows against the shafts That s all right said Barney Bill in a matter of fact way calm and godlike to Paul You can make up a bed on the floor of the old bus with some of them there mats inside and we ll turn in and have a sleep and start at sunrise He clambered into the van followed by Paul and lit an oil lamp In a few moments Paul s bed was made He threw himself down The resilient surface of the mats was luxury after the sacking on the scullery stone Barney Bill performed his summary toilet blew out the lamp and went to his couch Presently Paul started up smitten by a pang straight through his heart He sprang to his feet Mister he cried in the darkness not knowing how else to address his protector I mun go whoam Wot exclaimed the other Thought better of it already Well go then yer little eathen ippocrite I ll coom back said Paul Yer afeared yer little rat said Barney Bill out of the blackness I m not retorted Paul indignantly I m freeten d of nowt Then what d yer want to go for If you ve made up yer mind to come along of me just stay where you are If you go home they ll nab you and whack you for staying out late and lock you up and you ll not be able to get out in time in the morning And I ain t a going to wait for yer I tell yer straight I ll be back said Paul Don t believe it Good mind not to let yer go The touch of genius suddenly brushed the boy s forehead He drew from his pockets the handful of silver and copper that was his week s wages and groping in the darkness poured it over Barney Bill Then keep that for me till I coom back He fumbled hurriedly for the latch of the van door found it and leaped out into the waste under the stars just as the owner of the van rose with a clatter of coins To pick up money is a deeply rooted human instinct Barney Bill lit his lamp and uttering juicy though innocuous flowers of anathema searched for the scattered treasure When he had retrieved three shillings and sevenpence halfpenny he peered out Paul was far away Barney Bill put the money on the shelf and looked at it in a puzzled way Was it an earnest of the boy s return or was it a bribe to let him go The former hypothesis seemed untenable for if he got nabbed his penniless condition would be such an aggravation of his offence as to call down upon him a more ferocious punishment than he need have risked And why in the name of sanity did he want to go home To kiss his sainted mother in her sleep To pack his blankety portmanteau Barney Bill s fancy took a satirical turn On the latter hypothesis the boy was in deadly fear and preferred the certainty of the ferocious punishment to the terrors of an unknown future Barney Bill smoked a reflective pipe looking at the matter from the two points of view Not being able to decide he put out his lamp shut his door and went to sleep Dawn awoke him He sat up and rubbed his eyes Paul was not there He did not expect him to be there He felt sorry The poor little kid had funked it He had hoped for better stuff He rose and stretched himself put on socks and boots lit his cooking stove set a kettle to boil and opening the door remained for a while breathing the misty morning air Then he let himself down and proceeded to the back of the van where stood a pail of water and a tin basin his simple washing apparatus Having sluiced head and neck and dried them with something resembling a towel he hooked up the pail stowed the basin in a rack unslung a nosebag which he attached to the head of the old horse and went indoors to prepare his own elementary breakfast That over he put the horse into the shafts Barney Bill was a man of his word He was not going to wait for Paul but he cast a glance round the limited horizon of the brickfield hoping against reason to see the little slim figure emerge from some opening and run toward him Darn the boy said Barney Bill taking off his cap and scratching his wet head A low moan broke the dead silence of the Sunday dawn He started and looked about him He listened There was another The moans were those of a sleeper He bent down and looked under the van There lay Paul huddled up fast asleep on the bare ground Well I m jiggered I m just jiggered Here you hello cried Barney Bill Paul awakened suddenly half sat up grinned grabbed at something on the ground beside him and wriggled out between the wheels How long you been there About two hours said Paul Why didn t yer wake me I didn t like to disturb thee said Paul Did yer go home Ay said Paul Into the house Paul nodded and smiled Now that it was all over he could smile But only afterwards when he had greater command of language could he describe the awful terror that shook his soul when he opened the front door crept twice through the darkness of the sleeping kitchen and noiselessly closed the door again For many months he felt the terror of his dreams Briefly he told Barney Bill of his exploit How he had to lurk in the shadow of the street during the end of a battle between the Buttons in which the lodgers and a policeman had intervened How he had to wait interminable hours until the house was quiet How he had stumbled over things in the drunken disorder of the kitchen floor dreading to arouse the four elder little Buttons who slept in the room How narrowly he had missed running into the arms of the policeman who had passed the door some seconds before he opened it How he had crouched on the pavement until the policeman turned the corner and how he had fled in the opposite direction And if yer mother had caught ye what would she have done to yer Half killed me said Paul Barney Bill twisted his head on one side and looked at him out of his twinkling eyes Paul thought he resembled a grotesque bird Wot did yer do it for he asked This said Paul holding out a grubby palm in which lay the precious cornelian heart His friend blinked at it Wot the blazes is the good of that It s a talisman replied Paul who having come across the word in a book had at once applied it to his treasure Lor lumme cried Barney Bill And it was for that bit of stuff yer ran the risk of being flayed alive by yer loving parents Paul was quick to detect a note of admiration underlying the superficial contemptuousness of the words I d ha gone through fire and water for it he declared theatrically Lor lumme said Barney Bill again I got summat else said Paul taking from his pocket his little pack of Sunday school cards Barney Bill examined them gravely I think you d better do away with these Why They establishes yer identity said Barney Bill What s that Barney Bill explained Paul was running away from home The police informed of the fact would raise a hue and cry The cards if found would be evidence Paul laughed The constabulary was not popular in Budge Street Mother ain t going to ha nowt to do with the police nor father either He hinted that the cards might be useful later His childish vanity loved the trivial encomiums inscribed thereon They would impress beholders who had not the same reasons for preoccupation as Barney Bill You re thinking of your igh born parents said Barney Bill All right keep em Only hide ern away safe And now get in and let us clear out of this place It smelts like a cheese with an escape of gas running through it And you d better stay inside and not show your face all day long I don t want to be had up for kidnapping Paul jumped in Barney Bill clambered onto the footboard and took the reins The old horse started and the van jolted its way to the road on which as yet no tramcars clattered As the van turned Paul craning his neck out of the window obtained the last glimpse of Bludston He had no regrets As far as such a thought could be formulated in his young mind he wished that the place could be blotted out from his memory as it was now hidden forever from his vision He stood at the little window facing south gazing toward the unknown region at the end of which lay London city of dreams He was not quite fourteen His destiny was before him and to the fulfilment thereof he saw no hindrance No more would the remorseless factory hook catch him from his sleep and swing him into the relentless machine Never again would he hear his mother s shrewish voice or feel her heavy greasy hand about his ears He was free free to read free to sleep free to talk free to drink in the beauty of the lazy hours Vaguely he was conscious that one of the wonders that would come would be his own expansion He would learn many things which he did not know things that would fit him for his high estate He looked down upon the foreshortened figure of Barney Bill his cloth cap his shoulders his bare brown arms a patch of knee To the boy at that moment he was less a man than an instrument of Destiny guiding him not knowing why to the Promised Land At last on the quiet road Paul saw a bicyclist approaching them Mindful of Barney Bill s injunction he withdrew his head Presently he lay down on the couch and soothed by the jogging of the van and the pleasant creaking of the baskets fell into the deep sleep of tired and happy childhood CHAPTER IV IT was a day of dust and blaze Dust lay thick on the ground it filled the air it silvered the lower branches of the wayside trees it turned the old brown horse into a dappled grey it powdered the black hair of Barney Bill and of Paul until they looked like vagabond millers They sat side by side on the footboard while the old horse jogged on whisking flies away with a scanty but persistent tail Paul barefoot and barelegged hatless coatless absorbed blaze and dust with the animal content of a young lizard A month s summer wandering had baked him to gipsy brown A month s sufficient food and happiness had filled gaunt hollows in his face and covered all too visible ribs with flesh Since his flight from Bludston his life had been one sensuous trance His hungry young soul had been gorged with beauty the beauty of fields and trees and rolling country of still quivering moons and starlit nights of exultant freedom of never failing human sympathy He had a confused memory of everything They had passed through many towns as similar to Bludston as one factory chimney to another and had plied their trade in many a mean street so much the counterpart of Budge Street that he had watched a certain window or door with involuntary trepidation until he realized that it was not Budge Street that he was a happy alien to its squalor that he was a butterfly a thing of woods and hedgerows fluttering for an inconsequent moment in the gloom He came among them none knew whence he was going none knew whither He was conscious of being a creature of mystery He pitied the fettered youth of these begrimed and joyless towns slaves Men with Muckrakes he had fished up an old Pilgrim s Progress from the lower depths of the van who obstinately refused to raise their eyes to the glorious sun in heaven In his childish arrogance he would ask Barney Bill Why don t they go away and leave it like me And the wizened little man would reply with the flicker of an eyelid unperceived by Paul Because they haven t no igh born parents waiting for em They re born to their low estate and they knows it Which to Paul was a solution of peculiar comfort Even the blackened lands between the towns had their charm for Paul in that he had a gleeful sense of being excluded from the wrath of God which fell continuously upon them and the inhabitants thereof And here and there a belt of leafy country gave promise or confirmed Barney Bill s promise of the Paradise that would come Besides what mattered the perpetuations of Bludston brickfields when the Land of Beulah shimmered ahead in the blue distance when Martin Chuzzlewit lay open on his knees when the smell of the bit of steak sizzling on the cooking stove stung his young blood And now they were in Warwickshire county of verdant undulations and deep woods and embowered villages Every promise that Barney Bill had made to him of beauty was in process of fulfilment There were no more blighted towns no more factories no more chimneys belching forth smoke This was the Earth the real broad bosomed Mother Earth What he had left was the Hell upon Earth What he was going to might be Paradise but Paul s imagination rightly boggled at the conception of a Paradise more perfect And as Paul s prescient wit had conjectured he was learning many things the names of trees and wild flowers the cries of birds the habits of wayside beasts what was good for a horse to eat and what was bad which was the Waggon and Orion s Belt and the Bunch of Keys in the heavens how to fry bacon and sew up rents in his clothing how to deal with his fellow man or rather with his fellow woman in a persuasive manner how to snare a rabbit or a pheasant and convert it into food and how at the same time to evade the terrors of the law the differences between wheat and oats and barley the main lines of cleavage between political parties hitherto a puzzle to Paul for Barney Bill was a politician on the Conservative side and read his newspaper and argued craftily in taverns and the styles and titles of great landowners by whose estates they passed and how to avoid the nets that were perpetually spread by a predatory sex before the feet of the incautious male On the last point Barney Bill was eloquent but Paul with delicious memories sanctifying his young soul turned a deaf ear to his misogyny Barney Bill was very old and crooked and dried up what beautiful lady would waste her blandishments on him Even the low born lasses with whom they at times consorted had scarce an eye for Barney Bill The grapes were sour Paul smiled indulgently on the little foible of his friend They jogged along the highroad on this blazing and dusty day Their bower of wicker chairs crackled in the heat It was too hot for sustained conversation Once Barney Bill said If Bob Bob was the old horse s unimaginative name if Bob doesn t have a drink soon his darned old hide ll crack Ten minutes later Nothing under a quart ll wash down this dust Have a drink of water suggested Paul who had already adopted this care for drouth with satisfactory results A grown man s thirst and a boy s thirst is two entirely different things said Barney Bill sententiously To spoil this grown up thirst of mine with water would be a crime A mile or so farther on the road he stretched out a lean brown arm and pointed See that there clump of trees Behind that is the Little Bear Inn They gives you cool china pots with blue round the edge You can only have em if you asks for em Jim Blake the landlord being pertickler like And if yer breaks em What would happen asked Paul who was always very much impressed by Barney Bill s detailed knowledge of the roads and the inns of England Barney Bill shook his head It would break is eart Them pots was being used when William the Conqueror was a boy Ten sixty six to ten eighty seven said Paul the scholar They mun be nine hundred years old Not quite said Barney Bill with an air of scrupulous desire for veracity But nearly Lor lumme he exclaimed after a pause it makes one think doesn t it One of them there quart mugs suppose it has been filled say ten times a day every day for nine hundred years my Gosh what a Pacific Ocean of beer must have been poured from it It makes one come over all of religious like when one puts it to one s head Paul did not reply and reverential emotion kept Barney Bill silent until they reached the clump of trees and the Little Bear Inn It was set back from the road in a kind of dusty courtyard masked off on one side by a gigantic elm and on the other by the fringe of an orchard with ruddy apples hanging patiently beneath the foliage Close by the orchard stood the post bearing the signboard on which the Little Bear an engaging beast was pictured and presiding in a ceremonious way over the horse trough below In the shade of the elm stretched a trestle table and two wooden benches The old inn gabled half timbered its upper story overhanging the doorway bent and crippled though serene with age mellow in yellow and russet spectacled as befitted its years with leaded diamond panes crowned deep in secular thatch smiled with the calm and homely peace of everlasting things Its old dignity even covered the perky gilt inscription over the doorway telling how James Blake was licensed to sell a variety of alcoholic beverages One human figure alone was visible as the chairs and mat laden van slowly turned from the road toward the horse trough that of a young man in straw hat and grey flannels making a water colour sketch of the inn Barney Bill slid off the footboard and looking neither to right nor left bolted like a belated crab into the cool recesses of the bar in search of ambrosia from the blue and white china mug Paul also afoot led Bob to the trough Bob drank with the lusty moderation of beasts When he had assuaged his thirst Paul backed him into the road and slinging over his head a comforting nosebag left him to his meal The young man sitting on an upturned wooden case at the extreme edge of the elm tree s shade a slender easel before him a litter of paraphernalia on the ground by his side painted assiduously Paul idly crept behind him and watched in amazement the smears of wet colour after a second or two of apparent irrelevance take their place in the essential structure of the drawing He stood absorbed He knew that there were such things as pictures He knew too that they were made by hands But he had never seen one in the making After a while the artist threw back his head looked at the inn and looked at his sketch There was a hot bit of thatch at the corner near the orchard and below the eaves bold shadow The shadow had not come right He put in a touch of burnt umber and again considered the effect Confound it that s all wrong he muttered It s blue said Paul The artist started twisted his head and for the first time became conscious of the ragamuffin s presence Oh you see it blue do you He smiled ironically Ay said Paul with pointing finger Look at it It s not brown anyhow Yon s black inside and blue outside The young man shaded his brow and gazed intently Brilliant sunshine plays the deuce with tones My hat cried he you re right It was this confounded yellow of the side of the house He put in a few hasty strokes That better Ay said Paul The artist laid down his brush and swung round on his box clasping knees How the devil did you manage to see that when I didn t Dun no said Paul The young man stretched himself and lit a cigarette What are yo doing that for mister Paul asked seriously That Ay said Paul You mun have a reason You re a queer infant laughed the artist Do you really want to know I ve asked yo said Paul Well if you re anxious to know I m an architect on a holiday and I m sketching any old thing I come across I don t pretend to be a painter my youthful virtuoso and that s why I go wrong sometimes on colour Do you know what an architect is No said Paul eagerly What is it He had been baffled by the meaning of the word which he had seen all his life inscribed on a brass plate in the Bludston High Street E Thomson Architect Surveyor It had seemed to him odd cryptically fascinating The young man laughed and explained Paul listened seriously Another mystery was solved He had often wondered how the bricklayers knew where to lay the bricks He grasped the idea that they were but instruments carrying out the conception of the architect s brain I d like to be an architect he said Would you After a pause the young man continued Anyhow you can earn a shilling Just sit down there and let me make a sketch of you What for asked Paul Because you re a picturesque person Now I suppose you ll be asking me what s the meaning of picturesque Nay said Paul I know Yo see it in books Th owd grey tower stood out picturesque against the crimson sky Hullo you re a literary gent said the young man Ay replied Paul proudly He was greatly attracted towards this new acquaintance whom by his speech and dress and ease of manner he judged to belong to the same caste as his lost but ever remembered goddess The young man picked up pencil and sketch book and posed Paul at the end of the seat by the trestle table Now then said he setting to work Head a little more that way Capital Don t move If you re very quiet I ll give you a shilling Presently he asked What are you If you hadn t been a literary gent I d have thought you might be a gipsy Paul flushed and started I m not a gipsy Steady steady exclaimed the artist I ve just said you couldn t be one Italian You don t look English For the first time the idea of exotic parentage entered Paul s head He dallied for a moment or two with the thought I dunno what I am he said romantically Oh What s your father The young man motioned with his head toward the inn Yon s not my father said Paul It s only Barney Bill Only Barney Bill echoed the other amused Well who is your father Dunno said Paul And your mother Dunno either said Paul in a mysterious tone I dunno if my parents are living or dead I think they re living That s interesting What are you doing with what s his name Bill I m just travelling wi him to London And what are you going to do in London I ll see when I get there said Paul So you re out for adventure Ay said the boy a gleam of the Vision dancing before his eyes

none	none	I m going on an adventure There keep like that cried the artist Don t stir I do believe I m getting you Holy Moses it will be great If only I could catch the expression There s nothing like adventure is there The glorious uncertainty of it To wake up in the morning and know that the unexpected is bound to happen during the day Exciting isn t it Ay said Paul his face aglow The young man worked tense and quick at the luminous eyes He broke a long silence by asking What s your name Paul Kegworthy Paul That s odd In the sphere of life to which the ragged urchin belonged Toms and Bills and Jims were as thick as blackberries but Pauls were rare What s odd said Paul Your name How did you get it It s uncommon I suppose it is said Paul I never thowt of it I never knew anybody of that name afore Here was another sign and token of romantic origin suddenly revealed Paul felt the thrill of it He resisted a temptation to ask his new friend whether it was an appellation generally reserved for princes Look here joking apart said the artist putting in the waves of the thick black hair are you really going to be dumped down in London to seek your fortune Don t you know anybody there No said Paul How are you going to live Paul dived a hand into his breeches pocket and jingled coins I ve got th brass said he How much Three shillings and sevenpence ha penny said Paul with an opulent air And yo r shilling will make it four and sevenpence ha penny Good God said the young man He went on drawing for some time in silence Then he said My brother is a painter rather a swell a Royal Academician He would love to paint you So would other fellows You could easily earn your living as a model doing as a business you know what you re doing now for fun more or less How much could I earn It all depends Say a pound to thirty shillings a week Paul gasped and sat paralyzed Artist dusty road gaudy van distant cornfields and uplands were blotted from his senses The cool waves of Pactolus lapped his feet Come and look me up when you get to London continued the friendly voice My name is Rowlatt W W Rowlatt four Gray s Inn Square Can you remember it Ay said Paul Shall I write it down Nay W W Rowlatt four Gray s Inn Square I m noan likely to forget it I never forget nowt said Paul life returning through a vein of boastfulness Tell me all you remember said mister Rowlatt with a laugh I can say all the Kings of England with their dates and the counties and chief towns of Great Britain and Ireland and all the weights and measures and The Assyrian came down like a wolf on the fold Holy Moses cried Rowlatt Anything else Ay Lots more said Paul anxious to stamp vividly the impression he saw that he was making I know the Plagues of Egypt I bet you don t Rivers of Blood Frogs Lice Flies Murrain Boils Hails Locusts Darkness and Death of Firstborn said Paul in a breath Jehosaphat cried Rowlatt I suppose now you d have no difficulty in reciting the Thirty nine Articles Paul puckered his forehead in thought D yo mean he asked after a pause the Thirty nine Articles o Religion as is in th Prayerbuk I ha tried to read em but couldno understand em reet Rowlatt who had not expected his facetious query to be so answered stopped his drawing for a moment What in the name of goodness attracted you to the Thirty nine Articles I wanted to learn about things said Paul The young man looked at him and smiled Self education is a jolly good thing said he Learn all you can and you ll be a famous fellow one of these days But you must cultivate a sense of humour Paul was about to seek enlightenment as to this counsel when Barney Bill appeared cool and refreshed from the inn door and lifted a cheery voice Let s be getting along sonny Rowlatt held up a detaining hand Just a couple of minutes if you can spare them I ve nearly finished All right sir said Barney Bill limping across the yard Taking a picture of him The artist nodded Barney Bill looked over his shoulder By Gosh he cried in admiration By Gosh It has come out rather well hasn t it said the artist complacently It s the living image of im said Barney Bill He tells me he s going up to London to seek his fortune said Rowlatt putting in the finishing touches And his igh born parents said Barney Bill winking at Paul Paul flushed and wriggled uncomfortably Instinct deprecated crude revelation of the mystery of his birth to the man of refinement He felt that Barney Bill was betraying confidence Gutter bred though he was he accused his vagrant protector of a lack of good taste Of such a breach he himself son of princes could not have been guilty Luckily and as Paul thought with admirable tact mister Rowlatt did not demand explanation A young Japhet in search of a father Well I hope he ll find him There s nothing like romance Without it life is flat and dead It s what atmosphere is to a picture And onions to a stew said Barney Bill Quite right said Rowlatt Paul my boy I think after all you d better stick to mister Barney Bill sir at your service And if you want a comfortable chair or an elegant mat or a hearth brush at a ridiculous cheap price he waved toward the van Rowlatt turned his head and laughing looked into the twinkling black eyes I don t for a moment expect you to buy sir but I was only a satisfying of my artistic conscience Rowlatt shut his sketch book with a snap and rose Let us have a drink said he Artists should be better acquainted He whispered a message to Paul who sped to the inn and presently returned with a couple of the famous blue and white mugs frothing deliciously at the brims The men their lips to the bubbles nodded to each other The still beat of the August noon enveloped their bodies but a streak of heavenly coolness trickled through their souls Paul looking at them enviously longed to be grown up Then followed a pleasant half hour of desultory talk Although the men did not make him save for here and there a casual reference the subject of their conversation Paul with the Vision shimmering before his eyes was sensitive enough to perceive in a dim and elusive way that he was at the back of each man s thoughts and that for his sake each was trying to obtain the measure of the other At last Barney Bill cocking at the sun the skilled eye of the dweller in the wilderness called the time for departure Could I see th picture asked Paul Rowlatt passed him the sketch book The sudden sight of oneself as one appears in another s eyes is always a shock even to the most sophisticated sitter To Paul it was uncanny He had often seen his own reflection and was familiar with his own appearance but this was the first time that he had looked at himself impersonally The sketch was vivid the likeness excellent the motive the picturesque and romantic A proud lift of the chin an eager glance in the eye a sensitive curve of the lip attracted his boyish egotism The portrait was an ideal something to live up to Involuntarily he composed his features Barney Bill again called time Paul surrendered the sketch book reluctantly Rowlatt with a cheery word handed him the shilling fee Paul than whom none better knew the magic quality of money hesitated for a second The boy in the sketch would have refused Paul drew himself up Nay I ll take noan I liked doing it Rowlatt laughed and pocketed the coin All right said he with a playful bow I m exceedingly indebted to your courtesy Barney Bill gave Paul an approving glance Good for you boy Never take money you ve not earned Good day to you sir he touched his cap And with a motion toward the empty mugs thank you kindly Rowlatt strolled with them to the van Barney Bill limping a pace or two ahead Remember what I told you my young friend said he in a low voice I don t go back upon my word I ll help you But if you re a wise boy and know what s good for you you ll stick to mister Barney Bill and the freedom of the high road and the light heart of the vagabond You ll have a devilish sight more happiness in the end But Paul who already looked upon his gipsy self as dead as his Bludston self and these dead selves as stepping stones to higher things turned a deaf ear to his new friend s paradoxical philosophy I ll remember said he mister W W Rowlatt four Gray s Inn Square The young architect watched the van with its swinging creaking excrescences lumber away down the hot and dusty road and turned with a puzzled expression to his easel Joy in the Little Bear Inn had for the moment departed Presently he found himself scribbling a letter in pencil to his brother the Royal Academician So you see my dear fellow he wrote toward the end of the epistle I am in a quandary That the little beggar is of startling beauty is undeniable That he has got his bill agape like a young bird for whatever food of beauty and emotion and knowledge comes his way is obvious to any fool But whether in what I propose I m giving a helping hand to a kind of wild genius or whether I m starting a vain boy along the primrose path in the direction of everlasting bonfire I m damned if I know But Paul jogged along by the side of Barney Bill in no such state of dubiety God was in His Heaven arranging everything for his especial benefit All was well with the world where dazzling destinies like his were bound to be fulfilled I ve heard of such things said Barney Bill with a reflective twist of his head when Paul had told him of mister Rowlatt s suggestion A cousin of mine married a man who knew a gal who used to stand in her birthday suit in front of a lot of young painter chaps and I m bound to say he used to declare she was as good a gal as his own wife especially seeing as how she supported an old father what had got a stroke and a houseful of young brothers and sisters So I m not saying there s any harm in it And I wouldn t stand in your way sonny seeing as how you want to get to your igh born parents You might find em on the road and then again you mightn t And thirty bob a week at fourteen no it would be flying in the face of Providence to say don t do it But what licks me is what the blazes do they want with a little varmint like you Why shouldn t they pay thirty bob a week to paint me Paul did not reply being instinctively averse from wounding susceptibilities But in his heart rose a high pity for the common though kindly clay that was Barney Bill CHAPTER V WHEN they reached London in November after circuitous wanderings Barney Bill said to Paul You ve seed enough of me matey to know that I wish yer good and not harm I ve fed yer and I ve housed yer I can t say as how I ve done much toward clothing yer and three months on the road has knocked corners off the swell toggery yer came to me in but I ain t beat yer or cussed yer more than yer deserved whereat Paul grinned and I ve spent a lot of valuable time when I might have been profitably doing nothing a larning yer of things and so to speak completing yer eddication Is that the truth or am I a bloomin liar Paul thus challenged confirmed the absolute veracity of Barney Bill s statement The latter continued bending forward his lean brown hand on the boy s shoulder and looking at him earnestly I took yer away from your appy ome because though the ome might have been appy in its own sweet way you wasn t I wanted to set yer on the track of yer ighborn parents I wanted to make a man of yer I want to do the best for yer now so I put it to yer straight If yer likes to come along of me altogether I ll pay yer wages on the next round and when yer gets a little older I ll take yer into partnership and leave yer the business when I die It s a man s life and a free life and I think yer likes it don t yer Ay said Paul it s foine On the other hand as I said afore I won t stand in yer way and if yer thinks you ll get nearer to your igh born parents by hitching up with mister Architect well you re old enough to choose I leave it to you But Paul had already chosen The Road had its magical fascination to which he would have surrendered all his boyish soul had not the call of his destiny been more insistent The Road led nowhither Princes and princesses were as rare as hips and haws in summer time Their glittering equipages did not stop the van nor did they stand at the emblazoned gateways of great parks waiting patiently for long lost sons He knew that he must seek them in their own social world and to this he would surely be raised by his phantasmagorial income of thirty shillings a week You won t object to my keeping a friendly eye on yer for the next year or two asked Barney Bill with twisted mouth and a kindly satirical glance Paul flushed He had the consciousness of being a selfish self centered little beast not half enough grateful to Barney Bill for delivering him out of the House of Bondage and leading him into the Land of Milk and Honey He was as much stung by the delicately implied rebuke as touched by the solicitude as to his future welfare Romantic words such as he had read in the story books surged vaguely in his head but he could find none to utter He kept silent for a few moments his hand in his breeches pocket Presently he drew it forth rather slowly and held out the precious cornelian heart to his benefactor I ud like to give it thee said Paul Barney Bill took it Thank ee sonny I ll remember that you gave it to me But I won t keep yer talisman Ere see he made a pretence to spit on it that s for luck Barney Bill s luck and good wishes So Paul pocketed the heart again immensely relieved by his friend s magnanimity and the little sentimental episode was over A month later when Barney Bill started on his solitary winter pilgrimage in the South of England he left behind him a transmogrified Paul a Paul thanks to his munificence arrayed in decent garments including collar and tie insignia of caste and an overcoat symbol of luxury for which Paul was to repay him out of his future earnings a Paul lodged in a small but comfortable third floor back a bedroom all to himself with a real bed mattress pillow sheets and blankets all complete and a looking glass and a stand with ewer and basin so beautiful that at first Paul did not dare wash for fear of making the water dirty a Paul already engaged for a series of sittings by mister Cyrus Rowlatt R A his head swimming with the wonder of the fashionable painter s studio a Paul standing in radiant confidence upon the brink of life Sonny said Barney Bill when he said good bye d yer see them there lovely lace up boots you ve got on Ay said Paul regarding them complacently Well they ve got to take yer all the way up the hill like the young man what s his name Excelsure in the piece of poetry you recite but they ll only do it if they continues to fit Don t get too big for em At any rate wait till they re worn out and yer can buy another pair with yer own money Paul grinned because he did not know what else to do so as to show his intellectual appreciation of the parable but in his heart for all his gratitude he thought Barney bill rather a prosy moralizer It was one of the disabilities of advanced old age Alas what can bridge the gulf between fourteen and fifty Anyhow you ve got a friend at the back of yer sonny and don t make no mistake about it If you re in trouble let me know I can t say fairer than that can I That for a season was the end of Barney Bill and Paul found himself thrillingly alone in London At first its labyrinthine vastness overwhelmed him causing him to feel an unimportant atom which may have been good for his soul but was not agreeable to his vanity By degrees however he learned the lay of the great thoroughfares especially those leading to the quarters where artists congregate and conscious of purpose and of money jingling in his pocket he began to hold his head high in the crowded streets In the house in Barn Street off the Euston Road where he lodged he was called mister Paul by his landlady missus Seddon and her thirteen year old daughter Jane which was comforting and stimulating Jane a lanky fair blue eyed girl who gave promise of good looks attended to his modest wants with a zeal somewhat out of proportion to the payment received Paul had the novel sensation of finding some one at his beck and call He beckoned and called often for the sheer pleasure of it So great was the change in his life that in these early days it seemed as if he had already come into his kingdom He strutted about poor child like the prince in a fairy tale and in spite of Barney Bill s precepts he outgrew his boots immediately missus Seddon an old friend of Barney Bill whom she addressed and spoke as mister William kept a small shop in which she sold newspapers and twine and penny bottles of ink In the little back parlour missus Seddon and Tane and Paul had their meals while the shop boy an inconsiderable creature with a perpetual cold in his head attended to the unexpected customer To Paul this boy with whom a few months ago he would have joyously changed places was as the dust beneath his feet He sent him on errands in a lordly way treating him as indeed he had treated the youth of Budge Street after his triumph over Billy Goodge and the boy obeyed meekly Paul believed in himself the boy didn t Almost from the beginning he usurped an ascendancy over the little household For all their having lived in the great maelstrom of London he found his superficial experience of life larger than that of mother and daughter They had never seen machinery at work did not know the difference between an elm and a beech and had never read Sir Walter Scott missus Seddon thin careworn and slackly good natured ever lamented the loss of an astonishingly brilliant husband Jane was markedly the more competent of the two She had character and even while slaving for the romantic youth made it clear to him that for no other man alive would she so demean herself Paul resolved to undertake her education The months slipped by golden with fulfilment News of the beautiful boy model went the round of the studios Those were simpler times although not so very long ago in British art than the present and the pretty picture was still in vogue As mister Rowlatt the young architect had foretold Paul had no difficulty in obtaining work Indeed it was fatally easy mister Cyrus Rowlatt R A had launched him Being fabulously paid he thought his new profession the most aristocratic calling in the world In a remarkably short time he was able to repay Barney Bill The day when he purchased the postal order was the proudest in his life The transaction gave him a princely feeling He alone of boys by special virtue of his origin was capable of such a thing Again his welcome in the painting world confirmed him in the belief that he was a personage born to great things Posed on the model throne the object of the painter s intense scrutiny he swelled ingenuously with the conviction of his supreme importance The lazy luxury of the model s life appealed to his sensuous temperament He loved the warmth the artistic setting of the studios the pictures the oriental rugs the bits of armour the old brocade the rich cushions If he had not been born to it why had he not remained like all the youth of Bludston amid the filth and clatter of the factory He loved too to hear the studio talk though at first he comprehended little of it The men and women for whom he sat possessed the same quality as his never forgotten goddess and Lady Chudley and the young architect a quality which he recognized keenly but for which his limited vocabulary could find no definition Afterward he realized that it was refinement in manner and speech and person This quality he felt it essential to acquire Accordingly he played the young ape to those who aroused his admiration One day when Jane entered the back parlour he sprang from his seat and advanced with outstretched hand to meet her My dear Lady Jane how good of you to come Do let me clear a chair for you What are you playing at asked Jane That s the way to receive a lady when she calls on you Oh said Jane He practised on her each newly learned social accomplishment He minced his broad Lancashire when he spoke to her in such a way as to be grotesquely unintelligible By listening to conversations he learned many amazing social facts among them that the gentry had a bath every morning of their lives This stirred his imagination to such a pitch that he commanded Jane to bring up the matutinal washtub to his bedroom By instinct refined he revelled in the resultant sensation of cleanliness He paid great attention to his attire modelling himself as far as he could on young Rowlatt the architect on whom he occasionally called to report progress He bought such neckties and collars as Rowlatt wore and submitted them for Jane s approval She thought them vastly genteel He also entertained her with whatever jargon of art talk he managed to pick up Thus though the urchin gave himself airs and invested himself with affectations which rendered him intolerable to all of his own social status except the placid missus Seddon and the adoring Jane he was under the continuous influence of a high ambition It made him ridiculous but it preserved him from vicious and vulgar things If you are conscious of being a prince in disguise qualifying for butterfly entrance into your kingdom it behoves you to behave in a princely manner not to consort with lewd fellows and not to neglect opportunities for education You owe to yourself all the good that you can extract from the world Acting from this point of view and guided by the practical advice of young Rowlatt he attended evening classes where he gulped down knowledge hungrily So what with sitting and studying and backward and forward journeying and educating Jane and practising the accomplishments of a prince and sleeping the long sound sleep of a tired youngster Paul had no time to think of evil He was far too much absorbed in himself Meanwhile of Bludston not a sign For all that he had heard of search being made for him he might have been a runaway kitten Sometimes he wondered what steps the Buttons had taken in order to find him If they had communicated with the police surely at some stage of their journey Barney Bill would have been held up and questioned But had they even troubled to call in the police Barney Bill thought not and Paul agreed The police were very unpopular in Budge Street almost as unpopular as Paul In all probability the Buttons were only too glad to be rid of him If he found no favour in the eyes of missus Button in the eyes of Button he was detestable Occasionally he spoke of them to Barney Bill on his rare appearances in London but for prudential motives the latter had struck Bludston out of his itinerary and could give no information At last Paul ceased altogether to think of them They belonged to a far distant past already becoming blurred in his memory So Paul lived his queer sedulous life month after month year after year known among the studios as a quaint oddity drawn out indulgently by the men somewhat petted monkey fashion by the women forgotten by both when out of their presence but developing imperceptibly day by day along the self centring line A kindly adviser suggested a gymnasium to keep him in condition for professional purposes He took the advice and in the course of time became a splendid young animal a being so physically perfect as to be what the good vicar of Bludston had called him in tired jest a lusus naturae But though proud of his body as any finely formed human may honorably be a far higher arrogance saved him from Narcissus vanity It was the inner and essential Paul and not the outer investiture that was born to great things In his eighteenth year he gradually awoke to consciousness of change One of his classmates at the Polytechnic institute with whom he had picked a slight acquaintance said one evening as they were walking homeward together I shan t be coming here after next week I ve got a good clerkship in the city What are you doing I m an artist s model said Paul The other a pale and perky youth sniffed His name was Higgins Good Lord What do you mean I m a model in the life class of the Royal Academy School said Paul proudly You stand up naked in front of all kinds of people for them to paint you Of course said Paul How beastly said Higgins What do you mean Just that said Higgins It s beastly A minute or two afterward he jumped on a passing omnibus and thenceforward avoided Paul at the Polytechnic Institute This uncompromising pronouncement on the part of Higgins was a shock but together with other incidents chiefly psychological vague intangible phenomena of his spiritual development it showed Paul the possibility of another point of view He took stock of himself From the picturesque boy he had grown into the physically perfect man As a model he was no longer sought after for subject pieces He was in clamorous demand at Life Schools where he drew a higher rate of pay but where he was as impersonal to the intently working students as the cast of the Greek torso which other students were copying in the next room The intimacy of the studio the warmth and the colour and the meretricious luxury were gone from his life On the other hand he was making money He had fifty pounds in the Savings Bank the maximum of petty thrift which an incomprehensive British Government encourages and a fair though unknown sum in an iron money box hidden behind his washstand Up to now he had had no time to learn how to spend money When he took to smoking cigarettes which he had done quite recently he regarded himself as a man Higgins s How beastly rang in his head Although he could not quite understand the full meaning of the brutal judgment it brought him disquiet and discontent For one thing like the high road his profession led nowhither The thrill of adventure had gone from it It was static and Paul s temperament was dynamic He had also lost his boyish sense of importance of being the central figure in the little stage Disillusion began to creep over him Would he do nothing else but this all his life Old Erricone the patriarchal white bearded Italian the doyen of the models of London came before his mind a senile posturer mumbling dreary tales of his inglorious achievements how he was the Roman Emperor in this picture and Father Abraham in the other how painters could not get on without him how once he had been summoned from Rome to London how Rossetti had shaken hands with him Paul shivered at the thought of himself as the Erricone of a future generation The next day was Saturday and he had no sitting The morning he spent in his small bedroom in the soothing throes of literary composition Some time ago he had thought it would be a mighty fine thing to be a poet and had tried his hand at verse Finding he possessed some facility he decided that he was a poet and at once started an epic poem in rhyme on the Life of Nelson the material being supplied by Southey This morning he did the Battle of the Baltic He put the glass to his blind eye And said No signals do I spy wrote Paul Poetry taken at the gallop like this was a very simple affair and Paul covered an amazing amount of ground In the afternoon he walked abroad with Jane who having lengthened her skirts and put up her hair was now a young woman looking older than her years She too had developed Her lank figure had rounded into pretty curves Her sharp little Cockney face had filled out She had a pleasant smile and a capable brow and correcting a tendency to fluffiness of hair of which she disapproved and dressing herself neatly made herself by no means unattractive Constant association with Paul had fired her ambitions Like him she might have a destiny though not such a majestic one Accordingly she had studied stenography and typewriting with a view to earning her livelihood away from the little shop which did not offer the prospect of a dazzling career At the back of her girlish mind was the desire to keep pace with Paul in his upward flight so that he should not be ashamed of her when he sat upon the clouds in glory In awful secrecy she practised the social accomplishments which Paul brought home She loved her Saturday and Sunday excursions with Paul of late they had gone far afield the Tower Greenwich Richmond exploring London and making splendid discoveries such as Westminster Abbey and a fourpenny tea garden at Putney She scarcely knew whether she cared for these things for themselves but she saw them through Paul coloured by his vivid personality Once on Chelsea Bridge he had pointed out a peculiarly ugly stretch of low tide mud and said Look at that She by unprecedented chance mistaking his tone had replied How lovely And she had thought it lovely until his stare of rebuke and wonderment brought disillusion and spurting tears which for the life of him he could not understand It is very foolish and often suicidal of men to correct women for going into rapture over mud flats On that occasion however the only resultant harm was the conviction in the girl s heart that the presence of Paul turned mud flats into beds of asphodel Then just as she saw outer things through his eyes she felt herself regarded by outer eyes through him His rare and absurd beauty made him a cynosure whithersoever he went London vast and seething could produce no such perfect Apollo When she caught the admiring glances of others of her sex little Jane drew herself up proudly and threw back insolent glances of triumph You would like to be where I am wouldn t you the glance would say with the words almost formulated in her mind But you won t You never will be I ve got him He s walking out with me and not with you I like to see you squirm you envious little cat Jane was not a princess she was merely a child of the people but I am willing to eat my boots if it can be satisfactorily proved that there is a princess living on the face of the earth who would not be delighted at seeing another woman cast covetous eyes on the man she loved and would not call her a cat or its homonym for doing so On this mild March afternoon Paul and Jane walked in the Euston Road he in a loose blue serge suit floppy black tie low collar and black soft felt hat this was in the last century please remember epoch almost romantic so fast does time fly she in neat black braided jacket and sailor hat They looked pathetically young Where shall we go asked Jane Paul in no mood for high adventure suggested Regent s Park At least we can breathe there said he Jane sniffed up the fresh spring air unconscious of the London taint and laughed Why what s the matter with the Euston Road It s vulgar said Paul In the Park the hyacinths and the daffodils will be out What he meant he scarcely knew When one is very young and out of tune with life one is apt to speak discordantly They mounted a westward omnibus Paul lit a cigarette and smoked almost in silence until they alighted by the Park gates As they entered he turned to her suddenly Look here Jane I want to ask you something The other night I told a man I was an artist s model and he said How beastly and turned away as if I wasn t fit for him to associate with What was he driving at He was a nasty cad said Jane promptly Of course he was said Paul But why did he say it Do you think there s anything beastly in being a model Certainly not She added in modification That is if you like it Well supposing I don t like it She did not reply for a minute or two Then If you really don t like it I should be rather glad Why asked Paul She raised a piteous face Yes tell me he insisted Tell me why you agree with that cad Higgins I don t agree with him You must They fenced for a while At last he pinned her down Well if you want to know she declared with a flushed cheek I don t think it s a man s job He bit his lip He had asked for the truth and he had got it His own dark suspicions were confirmed Jane glanced at him fearful of offence When they had walked some yards he spoke What would you call a man s job Jane hesitated for an answer Her life had been passed in a sphere where men carpentered or drove horses or sold things in shops Deeply impressed by the knowledge of Paul s romantic birth and high destiny she could not suggest any such lowly avocations and she did not know what men s jobs were usually executed by scions of the nobility A clerk s work was certainly genteel but even that would be lowering to the hero She glanced at him again swiftly No he was too beautiful to be penned up in an office from nine to six thirty every day of his life On the other hand her feminine intuition appreciated keenly the withering criticism of Higgins Ever since Paul had first told her of his engagements at the Life Schools she had shrunk from the idea It was all

none	none	for the boy but for the man and being younger than he she regarded him now as a man there was something in it that offended her nice sense of human dignity Well he said Tell me what do you call a man s job Oh I don t know she said in distress something you do with your hands or your brain You think being a model is undignified Yes So do I said Paul But I m doing things with my brain too you know he added quickly anxious to be seen again on his pedestal I am getting on with my epic poem I ve done a lot since you last heard it I ll read you the rest when we get home That will be lovely said Jane to whom the faculty of rhyming was a never ceasing wonder She would sit bemused by the jingling lines and wrapt in awe at the minstrel They sat on a bench by the flower beds gay in their spring charm of belated crocus and hyacinth and daffodil with here and there a precocious tulip Paul sensitive to beauty discoursed on flowers Max Field had a studio in saint John s Wood opening out into a garden which last summer was a dream of delight He described it When he came into his kingdom he intended to have such a garden You ll let me have a peep at it sometimes won t you said Jane Of course said Paul The lack of enthusiasm in his tone chilled the girl s heart But she did not protest In these days in spite of occasional outspokenness she was still a humble little girl worshipping her brilliant companion from afar How often could I come she asked That said he in his boyish pashadom would depend on how good you were Obedient to the thought processes of her sex she made a bee line to the particular Oh Paul I hope you re not angry At what At what I said about your being a model Not a bit said he If I hadn t wanted to know your opinion I wouldn t have asked you She brightened You really wanted to know what I thought Naturally said Paul You re the most commonsense girl I ve ever met Paul walked soberly home Jane accompanied him on wings On Monday Paul went to the Life School and stripped with a heavy heart Jane was right It was not a man s job The fact too of his doing it lowered him in her esteem and though he had no romantic thoughts whatever with regard to Jane he enjoyed being Lord Paramount in her eyes He went into the studio and took up his pose and as he stood on the model throne conspicuous glaring the one startling central object Higgins s How beastly came like a material echo and smote him in the face He felt like Adam when he first proceeded to his primitive tailoring A wave of shame ran through him He looked around the great silent room at the rows of students each in front of an easel using his naked body for their purposes A phrase flashed across his mind in three years his reading had brought vocabulary they were using his physical body for their spiritual purposes For the moment he hated them all fiercely They were a band of vampires Habit and discipline alone saved him from breaking his pose and fleeing headlong But there he was fixed like marble in an athlete s attitude showing rippling muscles of neck and chest and arms and thighs all developed by the gymnasium into the perfection of Greek beauty and all useless more useless even as far as the world s work was concerned than the muscles of a racehorse There he was fixed with outstretched limbs and strained loins a human being far more alive than the peering measuring throng far more important called by a destiny infinitely higher than theirs And none of them suspected it For the first time he saw himself as they saw him They admired him as a thing an animal trained especially for them a prize bullock As a human being they disregarded him Nay in the depth of their hearts they despised him Not one of them would have stood where he did He would have considered it rightly as degrading to his manhood The head of the school snapped his fingers impatiently and fussed up to the model stand What s the matter Tired already Take it easy for a minute if you like No said Paul instinctively stiffening himself I m never tired It was his boast that he could stand longer in a given pose than any other model and thereby he had earned reputation Then don t go to pieces my boy said the head of the school not unkindly You re supposed to be a Greek athlete and not Venus rising from the sea or a jelly at a children s party Paul flushed all over and insane anger shook him How dared the man speak to him like that He kept the pose thinking wild thoughts Every moment the strain grew less bearable the consciousness of his degradation more intense He longed for something to happen something dramatic something that would show the vampires what manner of man he was He was histrionic in his anguish A fly settled on his back a damp sluggish fly that had survived the winter and it crawled horribly up his spine He bore it for a few moments and then his over excited nerves gave way and he dashed his hand behind him Somebody laughed He raised his clenched fists and glared at the class Ay yo can laugh you can laugh till yo bust he cried falling back into his Lancashire accent But yo ll never see me here agen Never never never so help me God He rushed away The head of the school followed him and while he was dressing reasoned with him Nay said Paul Never agen Aw m doan wi th whole business And as Paul walked home through the hurrying streets he thought regretfully of twenty speeches which would have more adequately signified his indignant retirement from the profession CHAPTER VI PAUL S model self being dead he regarded it with complacency and set his foot on it little doubting that it was another stepping stone He spoke loftily of his independence But how are you going to earn your living asked Jane the practical I shall follow one of the arts Paul replied I think I am a poet but I might be a painter or a musician You do sing and play lovely said Jane He had recently purchased from a pawnshop a second hand mandoline which he had mastered by the aid of a sixpenny handbook and he would play on it accompaniments to sentimental ballads which he sang in a high baritone I ll not choose yet awhile said Paul disregarding the tribute Something will happen The moving finger will point What moving finger The finger of Destiny said Paul And as the superb youth predicted something did happen a day or two afterwards They were walking in Regent Street and stopped as was their wont before a photographer s window where portraits of celebrities were exposed to view Paul loved this window had loved it from the moment of discovery a couple of years before It was a Temple of Fame The fact of your portrait being exhibited with your style and title printed below marked you as one of the great ones of the earth Often he had said to Jane When I am there you ll be proud won t you And she had looked up to him adoringly and wondered why he was not there already It was Paul s habit to scrutinize the faces of those who had achieved greatness Archbishops Field Marshals Cabinet Ministers and to speculate on the quality of mind that had raised them to their high estate and often he would shift his position so as to obtain a glimpse of his own features in the plate glass window and compare them with those of the famous Thus he would determine that he had the brow of the divine the nose of the statesman and the firm lips of the soldier It was a stimulating pastime He was born to great things but to what great things he knew not The sphere in which his glory should be fulfilled was as yet hidden in the mists of time But this morning instead of roving over the illustrious gallery his eye caught and was fascinated by a single portrait He stood staring at it for a long time lost in the thrill of thought At last Jane touched his arm What are you looking at He pointed Do you see that Yes It s She named an eminent actor then in the heyday of his fame of whom legend hath it that his photographs were bought in thousands by love lorn maidens who slept with them beneath their pillows Paul drew her away from the little knot of idlers clustered round the window There s nothing that man can do that I can t do said Paul You re twenty times better looking said Jane I have more intelligence said Paul Of course said Jane I m going to be an actor said Paul Oh cried Jane in sudden rapture Then her sturdy common sense asserted itself But can you act I m sure I could if I tried You ve only got to have the genius to start with and the rest is easy As she did not dare question his genius she remained silent I m going to be an actor said he and when I m not acting I shall be a poet In spite of her adoration Jane could not forbear a shaft of raillery You ll leave yourself some time to be a musician won t you He laughed His alert and retentive mind had seized long ago on Rowlatt s recommendation at the Little Bear Inn and he had developed perhaps half consciously a half sense of humour A whole sense however is not congruous with the fervid beliefs and soaring ambitions of eighteen Your sense of humour that delicate percipience of proportion that subrident check on impulse that touch of the divine fellowship with human frailty is a thing of mellower growth It is a solvent and not an excitant It does not stimulate to sublime effort but it can cool raging passion It can take the salt from tears the bitterness from judgment the keenness from despair but in its universal manifestation it would effectually stop a naval engagement Paul laughed You mustn t think I brag too much Jane said he For anybody else I know what I say would be ridiculous But for me it s different I m going to be a great man I know it If I m not going to be a great actor I shall be a great something else God doesn t put such things into people s heads for nothing He didn t take me from the factory in Bludston and set me here with you walking up Regent Street like a gentleman just to throw me back into the gutter But who said you were going back to the gutter asked Jane Nobody I wanted to get right with myself But that getting right with oneself do you think it egotistic I don t quite know what that is He defined the term No she said seriously I don t think it is Everybody has got a self to consider I don t look on it as ego what d you call it to strike out for myself instead of going on helping mother to mind the shop So why should you Besides I owe a duty to my parents don t I he asked eagerly But here Jane took her own line I can t see that you do considering that they ve done nothing for you They ve done everything for me he protested vehemently They ve made me what I am They didn t take much trouble about it said Jane They squabbled for a while after the manner of boy and girl At last she cried Don t you see I m proud of you for yourself and not for your silly old parents What have they got to do with me And besides you ll never find them I don t think you know what you re talking about he said loftily It is time we were getting home He walked on for some time stiffly his head in the air not condescending to speak She had uttered blasphemy He would find his parents he vowed to himself if only to spite Jane Presently his ear caught a little sniff and looking down saw her dabbing her eyes with her handkerchief His heart softened at once Never mind said he You didn t mean it It s only because I love you Paul she murmured wretchedly That s all right he said Let us go in here they were passing a confectioner s and we ll have some jam puffs Paul went to his friend Rowlatt who had already heard through one of his assistants who had a friend in the Life School of the dramatic end of the model s career I quite sympathize with you Rowlatt laughed I ve wondered how you stuck it so long What are you going to do now I m going on the stage How are you going to get there I don t know said Paul but if I knew an actor he would be able to tell me I thought perhaps you might know an actor I do one or two replied Rowlatt but they re just ordinary actors not managers and I shouldn t think they d be able to do anything for you Except what I say Paul persisted They ll tell me how one sets about being an actor Rowlatt scribbled a couple of introductions on visiting cards and Paul went away satisfied He called on the two actors The first in atrabiliar mood advised him to sweep crossings black shoes break stones by the roadside cart manure sell tripe or stocks and shares blow out his brains rather than enter a profession over whose portals was inscribed the legend Lasciate ogni speranza he snapped his finger and thumb to summon memory as if it were a dog Voi che intrate continued Paul delighted at showing off the one Italian tag he had picked up from his reading And filled with one of the purest joys of the young literary life and therefore untouched by pessimistic counsel he left the despairing actor The second a brighter and more successful man talked with Paul for a long time about all manner of things Having no notion of his antecedents he assumed him to be a friend of Rowlatt and met him on terms of social equality Paul expanded like a flower to the sun It was the first time he had spoken with an educated man on common ground a man to whom the great imaginative English writers were familiar friends who ran from Chaucer to Lamb and from Dryden to Browning with amazing facility The strong wine of allusive talk mounted to Paul s brain Tingling with excitement he brought out all his small artillery of scholarship and acquitted himself so well that his host sent him off with a cordial letter to a manager of his acquaintance The letter opened the difficult door of the theatre His absurd beauty of face and figure a far greater recommendation in the eyes of the manager who had begun rehearsals for an elaborate romantic production than a knowledge of The Faerie Queene obtained for him an immediate engagement to walk on as a gilded youth of Italy in two or three scenes at a salary of thirty shillings a week Paul went home and spread himself like a young peacock before Jane and said I am an actor The girl s eyes glowed You are wonderful No not I replied Paul modestly It is my star Have you got a big part asked Jane He laughed pityingly sweeping back his black curls No you silly I haven t any lines to speak he had at once caught up the phrase I must begin at the beginning Every actor has to do it You ll get mother and me orders to come and see you won t you You shall have a box declared Paul the magnificent Thus began a new phase in the career of Paul Kegworthy After the first few days of bewilderment on the bare bleak stage where oddments of dilapidated furniture served to indicate thrones and staircases and palace doors and mossy banks where men and women in ordinary costume behaved towards one another in the most ridiculous way and went through unintelligible actions with phantom properties where the actor manager would pause in the breath of an impassioned utterance and cry out Oh my God stop that hammering where nothing looked the least bit in the world like the lovely ordered picture he had been accustomed to delight in from the shilling gallery after the first few days he began to focus this strange world and to suffer its fascination And he was proud of the silent part allotted to him a lazy lute player in attendance on the great lady who lounged about on terrace steps in picturesque attitudes He was glad that he was not an unimportant member of the crowd of courtiers who came on in a bunch and bowed and nodded and pretended to talk to one another and went off again He realized that he would be in sight of the audience all the time It did not strike him that the manager was using him merely as a piece of decoration One day however at rehearsal the leading lady said If my lute player could play a few chords here or the orchestra for him it would help me tremendously I ve got all this long cross with nothing to say Paul seized his opportunity I can play the mandoline said he Oh can you said the manager and Paul was handed over to the musical director and the next day rehearsed with a real instrument which he twanged in the manner prescribed He did not fail to announce himself to Jane as a musician Gradually he found his feet among the heterogeneous band who walk on at London theatres Some were frankly vulgar some were pretentiously genteel a good many were young men of gentle birth from the public schools and universities Paul s infallible instinct drew him into timid companionship with the last He knew little of the things they talked about golf and cricket prospects and the then brain baffling Ibsen but he listened modestly hoping to learn He reaped the advantage of having played the sedulous ape to his patrons of the studios His tricks were somewhat exaggerated his sweep of the hat when ladies passed him at the stage door entrance was lower than custom deems necessary he was quicker in courteous gesture than the young men from the universities he bowed more deferentially to an interlocutor than is customary outside Court circles but they were all the tricks of good breeding More than one girl asked if he were of foreign extraction He remembered Rowlatt s question of years ago and as then he felt curiously pleased He confessed to an exotic strain to Italian origin Italy was romantic When he obtained a line part and he appeared on the bill he took the opportunity of changing a name linked with unpleasant associations which he did not regard as his own Kegworthy was cast into the limbo of common things and he became Paul Savelli But this was later He made friends at the theatre Some of the women by petting and flattery did their best to spoil him but Paul was too ambitious too much absorbed in his dream of greatness and his dilettante literary and musical pursuits too much yet of a boy to be greatly affected What he prized far more highly than feminine blandishments was the new comradeship with his own sex Instinctively he sought them as a sick dog seeks grass unconsciously feeling the need of them in his mental and moral development Besides the attitude of the women reminded him of that of the women painters in his younger days He had no intention of playing the pet monkey again His masculinity revolted The young barbarian clamoured A hard day on the river he found much more to his taste than sporting in the shade of a Kensington flat over tea and sandwiches with no matter how sentimental an Amaryllis Jane who had seen the performance though not from a box a couple of upper circle seats being all that Paul could obtain from the acting manager and had been vastly impressed by Paul s dominating position in the stage fairy world said to him with a sniff that choked a sigh Now that you ve got all those pretty girls around you I suppose you soon won t think of me any longer Paul waved the dreaded houris away as though they were midges I m sick of girls he replied in a tone of such sincerity that Jane tossed her head Oh Then I suppose you lump me with the rest and are sick of me too Don t worry a fellow said Paul You re not a girl not in that sense I mean You re a pal Anyway they re lots prettier than what I am she said defiantly He looked at her critically after the brutal manner of obtuse boyhood and beheld an object quite agreeable to the sight Her Londoner s ordinarily colourless checks were flushed her blue eyes shone bright her little chin was in the air and her parted lips showed a flash of white teeth She wore a neat simple blouse and skirt and held her slim half developed figure taut Paul shook his head Jolly few of them without grease paint on But you see them all painted up He burst into laughter Then they re beastly near by You silly kid don t you know We ve got to make up otherwise no one in front would be able to see our mouths and noses and eyes From the front we look lovely but close to we re horrors Well how should I know that asked Jane You couldn t unless you saw us or were told But now you know Do you look beastly too Vile he laughed I m glad I didn t think of going on the stage she said childish yet very feminine unreason combining with atavistic puritanism I shouldn t like to paint my face You get used to it said Paul the experienced I think it horrid to paint your face He swung to the door they were in the little parlour behind the shop a flash of anger in his eyes If you think everything I do horrid I can t talk to you He marched out Jane suddenly realized that she had behaved badly She whipped herself She had behaved atrociously Of course she had been jealous of the theatre girls but had he not been proving to her all the time in what small account he held them And now he had gone At seventeen a beloved gone for an hour is a beloved gone for ever She rushed to the foot of the stairs on which his ascending steps still creaked Paul Yes Come back Do come back Paul came back and followed her into the parlour I m sorry she said He graciously forgave her having already arrived at the mature conclusion that females were unaccountable folk whose excursions into unreason should be regarded by man with pitying indulgence And in spite of the seriousness with which he took himself he was a sunny tempered youth Barney Bill putting into the Port of London so to speak in order to take in cargo also visited the theatre towards the end of the run of the piece He waited by arrangement for Paul outside the stage door and Paul coming out linked arms and took him to a blazing bar in Piccadilly Circus and ministered to his thirst with a princely air It seems rum said Bill wiping his lips with the back of his hand after a mighty pull at the pint tankard it seems rum that you should be standing me drinks at a swell place like this It seems only yesterday that you was a two penn orth of nothing jogging along o me in the old bus I ve moved a bit since then haven t I said Paul You have sonny said Barney Bill But he sighed and looked around the noisy glittering place at the smart barmaids the well clad throng of loungers some in evening dress the half dozen gorgeous ladies sitting with men at little tables by the window I thinks as how you gets more real happiness in a quiet village pub and the beer is cheaper and gorblimey He ran his finger between his stringy neck and the frayed stand up collar that would have sawn his head off but for the toughness of his hide To do Paul honour he had arrayed himself in his best a wondrously cut and heavily braided morning coat and lavender coloured trousers of eccentric shape and a funny little billycock hat too small for him and a thunder and lightning necktie all of which he had purchased nearly twenty years ago to grace a certain wedding at which he had been best man Since then he had worn the Nessus shirt of a costume not more than half a dozen times The twisted bright eyed little man so obviously ill at ease in his amazing garb and the beautiful youth debonair in his well fitting blue serge formed a queer contrast Don t you never long for the wind of God and the smell of the rain asked Barney Bill I haven t the time said Paul I m busy all day long Well well said Barney Bill the fellow wasn t far wrong who said it takes all sorts to make a world There are some as likes electric light and some as likes the stars Gimme the stars And in his countryman s way he set the beer in his tankard swirling round and round before he put it again to his lips Paul sipped his beer reflectively You may find happiness and peace of soul under the stars said he sagely and if I were a free agent I d join you tomorrow But you can t find fame You can t rise to great things I want to well I don t quite know what I want to do he laughed but it s something big Yuss my boy said Barney Bill I understand You was always like that You haven t come any nearer finding your igh born parents there was a twinkle in his eyes ave yer I m not going to bother any more about them whoever they are said Paul lighting a cigarette When I was a kid I used to dream that they would find me and do everything for me Now I m a man with experience of life I find that I ve got to do everything for myself And by George he thumped the bar and smiled the radiant smile of the young Apollo I m going to do it Barney Bill took off his Luke s iron crown of a billycock hat and scratched his cropped and grizzled head How old are you sonny Nearly nineteen said Paul By Gosh said Barney Bill He put on his hat at a comfortable but rakish angle He looked like a music hall humourist A couple of the gorgeous ladies giggled Yuss said he you re a man with an experience of life and nobody can do nothing for you but yerself Poor old Barney Bill has been past helping you this many a year But I owe everything to you cried Paul boyishly If it hadn t been for you I should still be working in that factory at Bludston Bill winked and nodded acquiescence as he finished his tankard I ve often wondered since I ve grown up what induced you to take me away What was it Bill cocked his head on one side and regarded him queerly Now you re arsking said he Paul persisted You must have had some reason I suppose I was interested in them parents of yours said Barney Bill And that was all he would say on the subject The days went on The piece had run through the summer and autumn and Paul a favourite with the management was engaged for the next production At rehearsal one day the author put in a couple of lines of which he was given one to speak He now was in very truth an actor Jane could no longer taunt him in her naughty moods invariably followed by bitter repentance with playing a dumb part like a trained dog He had a real part typewritten and done up in a brown paper cover which was handed to him with lack of humour by the assistant stage manager In view of his own instantaneous success he tried to persuade Jane to go on the stage but Jane had no artistic ambitions to say nothing of her disinclination to paint her face She preferred the prosaic reality of stenography and typewriting No sphere could be too dazzling for Paul he was born to great things the consciousness of his high destiny being at once her glory and her despair but as regards herself her outlook on life was cool and sober Paul was peacock born it was for him to strut about in iridescent plumage She was a humble daw and knew her station It must be said that Paul held out the stage as a career more on account of the social status that it would give to Jane than through a belief in her histrionic possibilities He too fond as he was of the girl with whom he had grown up recognized the essential difference between them She was as pretty as sensible as helpful a little daw as ever chattered but the young peacock never for an instant forgot her daw dom Jane s profound common sense reaped its reward the following spring when she found herself obliged to earn her livelihood Her mother died and the shop was sold and an aunt in Cricklewood offered Jane a home on condition that she paid for her keep This she was soon able to do when she obtained a situation with a business firm in the city The work was hard and the salary small but Jane had a brave heart and held her head high In her simple philosophy life was work and dreaming an occasional luxury Her mother s death grieved her deeply for she was a girl of strong affections and the breaking up of her life with Paul seemed an irremediable catastrophe It s just as well said her aunt that there s an end of it or you d be making a fool of yourself over that young actor chap with his pretty face I don t hold with any of them But Jane was too proud to reply On their last night together in the Barn Street house they sat alone in the little back parlour as they had done for the last six years all their impressionable childish days It was the only home that Paul had known and he felt the tragedy of its dissolution They sat on the old horsehair sofa behind the table very tearful very close together in spirit holding each other s hands They talked as the young talk and the old for the matter of that She trembled at his wants unministered to in his new lodgings He waved away prospective discomfort what did it matter He was a man and could rough it It was she herself whose loss would be irreparable She sighed he would soon forget her He vowed undying remembrance by all his gods Some beautiful creature of the theatre would carry him off He laughed at such an absurdity Jane would always be his confidante his intimate Even though they lived under different roofs they would meet and have their long happy jaunts together Jane said dolefully that it could only be on Sundays as their respective working hours would never correspond And you haven t given me your Sundays for a year she added Paul slid from the dark theme and to comfort her spoke glowingly of the future when he should have achieved his greatness He would give her a beautiful house with carriages and servants and she would not have to work But if you are not there what s the good of anything she said I ll come to see you silly dear he replied ingenuously Before they parted for the night she threw her arms round his neck impulsively Don t quite forget me Paul It would break my heart I ve only you left now poor mother s gone Paul kissed her and vowed again He did not vow that he would be a mother to her though to the girl s heart it seemed as if he did The little girl was aching for a note in his voice that never came Now ninety nine youths in a hundred who held at such a sentimental moment a comely and not uncared for maiden in their arms would have lost their heads and their hearts and vowed in the desired manner But Paul was different and Jane knew it to her sorrow He was by no means temperamentally cold far from it But you see he lived intensely in his dream and only on its outer fringe had Jane her place In the heart of it hidden in amethystine mist from which only flashed the diadem on her hair dwelt the exquisite the incomparable lady the princess who should share his kingdom while he knelt at her feet and worshipped her and kissed the rosy tips of her calm fingers So as it never entered his head to kiss the finger tips of poor Jane it never entered his head to fancy himself in love with her Therefore when she threw herself into his arms he hugged her in a very sincere and brotherly way but kissed her with a pair of cast lips of Adonis Of course he would never forget her Jane went to bed and sobbed her heart out Paul slept but little The breaking up of the home meant the end of many precious and gentle things and without them he knew that his life would be the poorer And he vowed once more to himself that he would never prove disloyal to Jane While he remained in London he saw what he could of her sacrificing many a Sunday s outing with the theatre folk Jane instinctively aware of this and finding in his demeanour after examining it with femininely jealous microscopic eyes nothing perfunctory was duly grateful and gave him of her girlish best She developed very quickly after her entrance into the world of struggle Very soon it was the woman and not the child who listened to the marvellous youth s story of the wonders that would be She never again threw herself into his arms and he never again called her a little silly She was dimly aware of change though she knew that the world could hold no other man for her But Paul was not And then Paul went on tour CHAPTER VII PAUL had been four years on the stage Save as a memory they had as little influence on the colour of his after life as his years at Bludston or his years in the studios He was the man born to be king The attainment of his kingdom alone mattered The intermediary phases were of no account It had been a period of struggle hardship and as far as the stage itself was concerned disillusion After the first year or so the goddess Fortune more fickle in Theatreland perhaps than anywhere else passed him by London had no use for his services especially when it learned that he aspired to play parts It even refused him the privilege of walking on and understudying He drifted into the provinces where when he obtained an engagement he found more scope for his ambitions Often he was out and purchased with his savings the bread of idleness He knew the desolation of the agent s dingy stairs he knew the heartache of the agent s dingy outer office He was familiar too with bleak rehearsals hours of listless waiting for his little scenes with his powerlessness to get into his simple words the particular intonation required by an overdriven producer Familiar too with long and hungry Sunday railway journeys when pious refreshment rooms are shut with little mean towns like Bludston where he and three or four of the company shared the same mean theatrical lodgings with the dirty insanitary theatres with the ceaseless petty jealousies and bickerings of the ill paid itinerant troupe The discomforts affected Paul but little he had never had experience of luxuries and the life itself was silken ease compared with what it would have been but for Barney Bill s kidnapping It never occurred to him to complain of nubbly bed and ill cooked steak and crowded and unventilated dressing rooms but it always struck him as being absurd that such should continue to be the lot of one predestined to greatness There was some flaw in the working of destiny It puzzled him Once indeed being out but having an engagement ahead and waiting for rehearsals to begin he had found himself sufficiently prosperous to take a third class ticket to Paris where he spent a glorious month But the prosperity never returned and he had to live on his memories of Paris During these years books were as ever his joy and his consolation He taught himself French and a little German He read history philosophy a smattering of science and interested himself in politics So aristocratic a personage naturally had passionate Tory sympathies Now and again but not often for the theatrical profession is generally Conservative he came across a furious Radical in the company and tasted the joy of fierce argument Now and again too he came across a young woman of high modern cultivation and once or twice narrowly escaped wrecking his heart on the Scylline rock of her intellect It was only when he discovered that she had lost her head over his romantic looks and not over his genius and his inherited right to leadership that he began to question her intellectual sincerity And there is nothing to send love scuttling away with his quiver between his legs like a note of interrogation of that sort The only touch of the morbid in Paul was his resentment at owing anything to his mere personal appearance He could not escape the easy chaff of his fellows on his fatal beauty He dreaded the horrible and hackneyed phrase which every fresh intimacy either with man or woman would inevitably evoke and he hated it beyond reason There was a tour during which he longed for small pox or a broken nose or facial paralysis so that no woman should ever look at him again and no man accuse him in vulgar jest He played small utility parts and understudied the leading man On the rare occasions when he played the lead he made no great hit The company did not after the generous way of theatre folks surround him when the performance was over with a chorus of congratulation The manager would say Quite all right my boy as far as it goes but still wooden You must get more life into it And Paul who knew himself to be a better man in every way than the actor whose part he was playing just as in his childhood days he knew himself to be a better man than Billy Goodge could not understand the general lack of appreciation Then he remembered the early struggles of the great actors Edmund Kean who on the eve of his first appearance at Drury Lane cried If I succeed I shall go mad of Henry Irving then at his zenith and the five hundred parts he had played before he came to London he recalled also the failure of Disraeli s first speech in the House of Commons and his triumphant prophecy He had dreams of that manager on his bended knees imploring him with prayerful hands and streaming eyes to play Hamlet at a salary of a thousand a week and of himself haughtily snapping his fingers at the paltry fellow Well which one of us who has ever dreamed at all has not had such dreams at twenty Let him cast at Paul the first stone And then you must remember Paul s faith in his vague but glorious destiny was the dynamic force of his young life Its essential mystery kept him alert and buoyant His keen self centred mind realized that his search on the stage for the true expression of his genius was only empirical If he failed there it was for him to try a hundred other spheres until he found the right one But just as in his childish days he could not understand why he was not supreme in everything so now he could not appreciate the charge of wooden inferiority brought against him by theatrical managers He had been on the stage about three years when for the first time in his emancipated life something like a calamity befell him He lost Jane Like most calamities it happened in a foolishly accidental manner He received a letter from Jane during the last three weeks of a tour they always kept up an affectionate but desultory correspondence giving a new address The lease of her aunt s house having fallen in they were moving to the south side of London When he desired to answer the letter he found he had lost it and could not remember the suburb much less the street and number whither Jane had migrated A letter posted to the old address was returned through the post The tour over and he being again in London he went on an errand of inquiry to Cricklewood found the house empty and the neighbours and tradespeople ignorant The poorer classes of London in their migrations seldom leave a trail behind them Their correspondence being rare it is not within their habits of life to fill up post office forms with a view to the forwarding of letters He could not write to Jane because he did not in the least know where she was He reflected with dismay that Jane could for the same reason no longer write to him Ironic chance had so arranged that the landlady with whom he usually lodged in town and whose house he used as a permanent address had given up letting lodgings at the beginning of the tour and had drifted into the limbo of London Jane s only guide to his whereabouts had been the tour card which he had sent her as usual giving dates and theatres And the tour was over On the chance that Jane not hearing from him should address a letter to the last theatre on the list he communicated at once with the local management But as local managements of provincial theatres shape their existences so as to avoid responsibilities of any kind save the maintenance of their bars and the deduction of their percentages from the box office receipts Paul knew that it was ludicrous to expect it to interest itself in the correspondence of an obscure member of a fourth rate company which had once played to tenth rate business within its mildewed walls Being young he wrote also to the human envelope containing the essence of stale beer tobacco and lethargy that was the stage doorkeeper But he might just as well have written to the station master or the municipal gasworks As a matter of fact Jane and he were as much lost to one another as if the whole of England had been primaeval forest It was a calamity which he regarded with dismay He had many friends of the easy theatrical sort who knew him as Paul Savelli a romantically visaged bright natured charming intellectual and execrably bad young actor But there was only one Jane who knew him as little Paul Kegworthy No woman he had ever met and in the theatrical world one is thrown willy nilly into close contact with the whole gamut of the sex gave him just the same close intimate comforting companionship From Jane he hid nothing Before all the others he was conscious of pose Jane with her cockney common sense her shrewdness her outspoken criticism of follies her unfailing sympathy in essentials was welded into the very structure of his being Only when he had lost her did he realize this Amidst all the artificialities and pretences and pseudo emotionalities of his young actor s life she was the one thing that was real She alone knew of Bludston of Barney Bill of the model days the memory of which made him shiver She alone save Barney Bill knew of his high destiny for Paul quick to recognize the cynical scepticism of an indifferent world had not revealed the Vision Splendid to any of his associates To her he could write to her when he was in London he could talk to her he could outpour all the jumble of faith vanity romance egotism and poetry that was his very self without thought of miscomprehension And of late she had mastered the silly splenetics of childhood He had an uncomfortable yet comforting impression that latterly she had developed an odd calm wisdom just as she had developed a calm generous personality The last time he had seen her his quick sensitiveness had noted the growth from girl to woman She was large full bosomed wide browed clear eyed She had not worried him about other girls She had reproved him for confessed follies in just the way that man loves to be reproved She had mildly soared with him into the empyrean of his dreams She had enjoyed whole heartedly from the back row of the dress circle the play to which he had taken her as a member of the profession he had in Jane s eyes princely privileges and on the top of the Cricklewood omnibus she had eaten with the laughter and gusto of her twenty years the exotic sandwiches he had bought at the delicatessen shop in Leicester Square She was the ideal sister And now she was gone like a snow flake on a river For a long while it seemed absurd incredible He went on all sorts of preposterous adventures to find her He walked through the city day after day at the hours when girls and men pour out of their honeycombs of offices into the streets She had never told him where she was employed thinking the matter of little interest and he in his careless way had never inquired Once he had suggested calling for her at her office and she had abruptly vetoed the suggestion Paul was too remarkable a young man to escape the notice of her associates her feelings towards him were too fine to be scratched by jocular allusion After a time having failed to meet her in the human torrents of Cheapside and Cannon Street Paul gave up the search Jane was lost absolutely lost and with her Barney Bill He went on tour again heavy hearted He felt that in losing these two he had committed an act of base ingratitude He had been four years on the stage and had grown from youth into manhood But one day at three and twenty he found himself as poor in pence though as rich in dreams as at thirteen Necessity had compelled him to take what he could get This time it was a leading part but a leading part in a crude melodrama in a fit up company They had played in halls and concert rooms on pier pavilions in wretched little towns It was glorious July Weather and business was bad so bad that the manager abruptly closed the treasury and disappeared leaving the company stranded a hundred and fifty miles from London with a couple of weeks salary unpaid Paul was packing his clothes in the portmanteau that lay on the narrow bed in his tiny back bedroom watched disconsolately by a sallow careworn man who sat astride the one cane chair his hat on the back of his head the discoloured end of a cigarette between his lips It s all very well for you to take it cheerfully said the latter You re young You re strong You re rich You ve no one but yourself You haven t a wife and kids depending on you I know it makes a devil of a difference replied Paul disregarding the allusion to his wealth As the leading man he was the most highly paid member of the disastrous company and he had acquired sufficient worldly wisdom to know that to him who has but a penny the possessor of a shilling appears arrogantly opulent But still said he what can we do We must get back to London and try again If there was justice in this country that son of a thief would get fifteen years for it I never trusted the skunk A fortnight s salary gone and no railway fare to London I wish to God I had never taken it on I could have gone with Garbutt in The White Woman he s straight enough only this was a joint engagement Oh the swine He rose with a clatter threw his cigarette on the floor and stamped on it violently He s a pretty bad wrong un said Paul We hadn t been going a fortnight before he asked me to accept half salary swearing he would make it up with a rise as soon as business got better Like an idiot I consented His friend sat down again hopelessly I don t know what s going to become of us The missus has pawned everything she has got poor old girl Oh it s damned hard We had been out six months Poor old chap said Paul sitting on the bed beside his portmanteau How does missus Wilmer take it She s knocked endways You see cried Wilmer desperately we ve had to send home everything we could scrape together to keep the kids there s five of them and now and now there s nothing left I m wrong There s that He fished three or four coppers from his pocket and held them out with a harsh laugh There s that after twenty years work in this profession Poor old chap said Paul again He liked Wilmer a sober earnest ineffectual man and his haggard kindly natured wife They had put on a brave face all through the tour letting no one suspect their straits and doing both him and other members of the company many little acts of kindness and simple hospitality In the lower submerged world of the theatrical profession in which Paul found himself he had met with many such instances of awful poverty He had brushed elbows with Need himself That morning he had given out of his scanty resources her railway fare to a tearful and despairing girl who played the low comedy part But he had not yet come across any position quite so untenable as that of Wilmer Forty odd years old a wife five children all his life given honestly to his calling and threepence half penny to his fortune But good God said he after a pause your kiddies If you have nothing what will happen to them Lord knows groaned Wilmer staring in front of him his elbows on the back of the chair and his head between his fists And missus Wilmer and yourself have got to get back to London I ve got the dress suit I wear in the last act It s fairly new I can get enough on it But that s part of your outfit your line of business you ll want it again said Paul Wilmer had played butlers up and down the land for many years Now and again when the part did not need any special characterization he obtained London engagements He was one of the known stage butlers I can hire if I m pushed said he It s hell isn t it Something told me not to go out with a fit up We d never come down to it before And I mistrusted Larkins but we were out six months Paul my boy chuck it You re young you re clever you ve had a swell education you come of gentlefolk my father kept a small hardware shop in Leicester you have the smitten and generally inarticulate man hesitated well you have extraordinary personal beauty you have charm you could do anything you like in the world save act and you can t act for toffee Why the blazes do you stick to it I ve got to earn my living just like you said Paul greatly flattered by the artless tribute to his aristocratic personality and not offended by the professional censure which he knew to be just I ve tried all sorts of other things music painting poetry novel writing but none of them has come off Your people don t make you an allowance I ve no people living said Paul with a smile and when Paul smiled it was as if Eros s feathers had brushed the cheek of a Praxitelean Hermes and then with an outburst half sincere half braggart I ve been on my own ever since I was thirteen Wilmer regarded him wearily The missus and I have always thought you were born with a silver spoon in your mouth So I was Paul declared from his innermost conviction But he laughed I lost it before my teeth came and I could get a grip on it Do you mean to say exclaimed Wilmer that you re not doing this for fun Fun cried Paul Fun Do you call this comic He waved his hand comprehensively indicating the decayed pink and purple wall paper the ragged oil cloth on the floor the dingy window with its dingier outlook the rickety deal wash stand with the paint peeling off a horrible clothless tray on a horrible splotchy chest of drawers containing the horrible scraggy remains of a meal Do you think I would have this if I could command silken sloth I long like hell old chap for silken sloth and if I could get it you wouldn t see me here Wilmer rose and stretched out his hand I m sorry dear boy said he The wife and I thought it didn t very much matter to you We always thought you were a kind of young swell doing it for amusement and experience and because you never put on side we liked you Paul rose from the bed and put his hand on Wilmer s shoulder And now you re disappointed He laughed and his eyes twinkled humorously His vagabond life had taught him some worldly wisdom The sallow and ineffectual man looked confused His misery was beyond the relief of smiles We re all in the same boat old chap said Paul except that I m alone and haven t got wife and kids to look after Good bye my boy said Wilmer Better luck next time But chuck it if you can Paul held his hand for a while Then his left hand dived into his waistcoat pocket and taking the place of his right thrust three sovereigns into Wilmer s palm For the kiddies said he Wilmer looked at the coins in his palm and then at Paul and the tears spurted I can t my boy You must be as broke as any of us you half salary no my boy I can t I m old enough to be your father It s damned good of you but it s my one pride left the pride of both of us the missus and me that we ve never borrowed money But it isn t borrowed you silly ass cried Paul cheerfully It s just your share of the spoils such as they are I wish to God it was more With both hands he clasped the thin ineffectual fingers over the coins and pushed the man with his young strength out of the door It s for the kiddies Give them my love he cried and slammed the door and locked it from the inside Poor old chap said he Then he went through his pockets and laid the contents on the narrow mantel piece These were a gold watch and chain a cornelian heart fixed to the free end of the chain a silver cigarette case a couple of keys one sovereign four shillings three pennies and two half pennies A trunk already fastened and filled with books and clothes and the portmanteau on the bed contained the rest of his possessions In current coin his whole fortune amounted to one pound four shillings and fourpence Luckily he had paid his landlady One pound four and fourpence to begin again at three and twenty the battle of life on which he had entered at thirteen He laughed because he was young and strong and knew that such reverses were foreordained chapters in the lives of those born to a glorious destiny They were also preordained chapters in the lives of those born to failure like poor old Wilmer He was conscious of the wide difference between Wilmer and himself Good Heavens To face the world at forty three with wife and children and threepence halfpenny and the once attendant hope replaced by black vestured doom Poor Wilmer He felt certain that Wilmer had not been able to pay his landlady and he felt that he had been mean in keeping back the other sovereign The sudden loss however of three fourths of his fortune brought him up against practical considerations The more he had in his pocket when he arrived in London the longer could he subsist That was important because theatrical engagements are not picked up in a hurry Now the railway fare would swallow a goodly number of shillings Obviously it was advisable to save the railway fare and the only way to do this was to walk to London His young blood thrilled at the notion It was romantic It was also inspiring of health and joy He had been rather run down lately and fearful of the catastrophe which had in fact occurred he had lived this last week very sparingly chiefly on herrings and tea A hundred and fifty miles tramp along the summer roads with bread and cheese and an occasional glass of beer to keep him going would be just the thing to set him up again He looked in the glass Yes his face was a bit pinched and his eyes were rather too bright A glorious tramp to London thirty or forty miles a day in the blazing and beautiful sunshine was exactly what he needed Joyously he unpacked his trunk and took from it a Norfolk jacket suit and stockings changed and leaving his luggage with his landlady who was to obey further instructions as to its disposal marched buoyantly away through the sun filled streets of the little town stick in hand gripsack on shoulder and the unquenchable fire of youth and hope in his heart CHAPTER VIII MISS URSULA WINWOOD hatless but with a cotton sunshade swinging over her shoulder and with a lean shiny mahogany coloured Sussex spaniel trailing behind walked in her calm deliberate way down the long carriage drive of Drane s Court She was stout and florid and had no scruples as to the avowal of her age which was forty three She had clear blue eyes which looked steadily upon a complicated world of affairs and a square heavy chin which showed her capacity for dealing with it Miss Ursula Winwood knew herself to be a notable person and the knowledge did not make her vain or crotchety or imperious She took her notability for granted as she took her mature good looks and her independent fortune For some years she had kept house for her widowed brother Colonel Winwood Conservative Member for the Division of the county in which they resided and helped him efficiently in his political work The little township of Morebury half a mile from the great gates of Drane s Court felt Miss Winwood s control in diverse ways Another town a little further off with five or six millions of inhabitants was also through its newspapers aware of Miss Winwood Many leagues societies associations claimed her as President Vice President or Member of Council She had sat on Royal Commissions Her name under an appeal for charity guaranteed the deserts of the beneficiaries What she did not know about housing problems factory acts female prisons hospitals asylums for the blind decayed gentlewomen sweated trades dogs homes and Friendly Societies could not be considered in the light of knowledge She sat on platforms with Royal princesses Archbishops welcomed her as a colleague and Cabinet Ministers sought her counsel For some distance from the porch of the red brick creeper covered Queen Anne house the gravel drive between the lawns blazed in the afternoon sun For this reason the sunshade But after a while came an avenue of beech and plane and oak casting delectable shade on the drive and its double edging of grass and the far stretching riot of flowers beneath the trees foxgloves and canterbury bells and campanulas and delphiniums all blues and purples and whites with here and there the pink of dog roses and gorgeous yellow splashes of celandine On entering the stately coolness Miss Winwood closed her sunshade and looked at her watch a solid timepiece harboured in her belt A knitted brow betrayed mathematical calculation 
6956_81870_000002_000005	train-clean-360	It would take her five minutes to reach the lodge gate 
none	none	The train bringing her venerable uncle Archdeacon Winwood for a week s visit would not arrive at the station for another three minutes and the two fat horses would take ten minutes to drag from the station the landau which she had sent to meet him 
6956_81870_000002_000007	train-clean-360	She had therefore eight minutes to spare 
none	none	A rustic bench invited repose 
6956_81870_000002_000009	train-clean-360	Graciously she accepted the invitation 
none	none	Now it must be observed that it was not Miss Winwood s habit to waste time 
6956_81870_000003_000001	train-clean-360	Her appointments were kept to the minute and her appointment self made on this occasion was the welcoming of her uncle the Archdeacon on the threshold of Drane s Court 
none	none	But Miss Winwood was making holiday and allowed herself certain relaxations Her brother s health having broken down he had paired for the rest of the session and gone to Contrexeville for a cure She had therefore shut up her London house in Portland Place Colonel Winwood s home while Parliament sat and had come to her brother s house Drane s Court her home when her presence was not needed in London She was tired Drane s Court where she had been born and had lived all her girlhood s life was restful and the seat in the shade of the great beech was cunningly curved The shiny mahogany coloured spaniel prescient of siesta leaped to her side and lay down with his chin on her lap and blinked his yellow eyes She lay back on the seat her hand on the dog s head looking contentedly at the opposite wilderness of bloom and the glimpses through the screen of trees and shrubs of the sunlit stretches of park beyond 
6956_81870_000004_000001	train-clean-360	She loved Drane s Court 
6956_81870_000004_000002	train-clean-360	Save for the three years of her brother s short married life it had been part of herself 
none	none	A Winwood a very younger son of the Family the Family being that of which the Earl of Harpenden is Head these things can only be written of in capital letters had acquired wealth in the dark political days of Queen Anne and had bought the land and built the house and the property had never passed into alien hands

none	none	They fought one spring dawn in the park the traditional spot could be seen from where Ursula Winwood was sitting 
6956_81870_000005_000000	train-clean-360	Ursula and her brother were proud of the romantic episode and would relate it to guests and point out the scene of the duel 
none	none	Happy and illusory days of Romance now dead and gone It is not conceivable that generations hence the head of a family will exhibit with pride the stained newspaper cuttings containing the unsavoury details of the divorce case of his great great grandmother 
6956_81870_000006_000000	train-clean-360	This aspect of family history seldom presented itself to Ursula Winwood 
none	none	It did not do so this mellow and contented afternoon Starlings mindful of a second brood chattered in the old walnut trees far away on the lawn thrushes sang their deep throated bugle calls finches twittered A light breeze creeping up the avenue rustled the full foliage languorously 
6956_81870_000006_000003	train-clean-360	Ursula Winwood closed her eyes 
none	none	A bumble bee droned between visits to foxglove bells near by She loved bumble bees They reminded her of a summer long ago when she sat not on this seat as a matter of fact it was in the old walled garden a quarter of a mile away with a gallant young fellow s arms about her and her head on his shoulder A bumble bee had droned round her while they kissed She could never hear a bumble bee without thinking of it But the gallant young fellow had been killed in the Soudan in eighteen eighty five and Ursula Winwood s heart had been buried in his sandy grave That was the beginning and end of her sentimental history She had recovered from the pain of it all and now she loved the bumble bee for invoking the exquisite memory The lithe Sussex spaniel crept farther on her lap and her hand caressed his polished coat Drowsiness disintegrated the exquisite memories 
6956_81870_000006_000012	train-clean-360	Miss Ursula Winwood fell asleep 
none	none	The sudden plunging of strong young paws into her body and a series of sharp barks and growls awakened her with a start and for a second still dazed by the drowsy invocation of the bumble bee she saw approaching her the gallant fellow who had been pierced through the heart by a Soudanese spear in eighteen eighty five 
6956_81870_000007_000001	train-clean-360	He was dark and handsome and by a trick of coincidence was dressed in loose knickerbocker suit just as he was when he had walked up that very avenue to say his last good bye 
6956_81870_000007_000002	train-clean-360	She remained for a moment tense passively awaiting company ordination of her faculties 
6956_81870_000007_000003	train-clean-360	Then clear awake and sending scudding the dear ghosts of the past she sat up and catching the indignant spaniel by the collar looked with a queer sudden interest at the newcomer 
6956_81870_000007_000004	train-clean-360	He was young extraordinarily beautiful but he staggered and reeled like a drunken man 
6956_81870_000007_000005	train-clean-360	The spaniel barked his respectable disapproval 
none	none	In his long life of eighteen months he had seen many people postmen and butcher boys and casual diggers in kitchen gardens whose apparent permit to exist in Drane s Court had been an insoluble puzzle but never had he seen so outrageous a trespasser With unparalleled moral courage he told him exactly what he thought of him 
6956_81870_000007_000008	train-clean-360	But the trespasser did not hear 
6956_81870_000007_000009	train-clean-360	He kept on advancing Miss Winwood rose disgusted and drew herself up 
6956_81870_000007_000010	train-clean-360	The young man threw out his hands towards her tripped over the three inch high border of grass and fell in a sprawling heap at her feet 
6956_81870_000008_000000	train-clean-360	He lay very still 
6956_81870_000008_000001	train-clean-360	Ursula Winwood looked down upon him 
6956_81870_000008_000002	train-clean-360	The shiny brown spaniel took up a strategic position three yards away and growled his chin between his paws 
none	none	But the more Miss Winwood looked and her blue eyes were trained to penetrate the more was she convinced that both she and the dog were wrong in their diagnosis The young man s face was deadly white his cheeks gaunt It was evidently a grave matter 
6956_81870_000008_000006	train-clean-360	For a moment or so she had a qualm of fear lest he might be dead 
none	none	She bent down took him in her capable grip and composed his inert body decently and placed the knapsack he was wearing beneath his head The faintly beating heart proved him to be alive but her touch on his brow discovered fever Kneeling by his side she wiped his lips with her handkerchief and gave herself up to the fraction of a minute s contemplation of the most beautiful youth she had ever seen 
6956_81870_000008_000010	train-clean-360	So there he lay a new Endymion while the most modern of Dianas hung over him stricken with great wonderment at his perfection 
none	none	In this romantic attitude was she surprised first by the coachman of the landau and pair as he swung round the bend of the drive and then by the Archdeacon who leaned over the door of the carriage Miss Winwood sprang to her feet the coachman pulled up and the Archdeacon alighted My dear Uncle Edward she wrung his hand I m so glad to see you Do help me grapple with an extraordinary situation The Archdeacon smiled humorously He was a spare man of seventy with thin pointed clean shaven face and clear blue eyes like Miss Winwood s If there s a situation my dear Ursula with which you can t grapple said he it must indeed be extraordinary 
6956_81870_000012_000000	train-clean-360	She narrated what had occurred and together they bent over the unconscious youth 
6956_81870_000012_000001	train-clean-360	 I would suggest said she that we put him into the carriage drive him up to the house and send for doctor Fuller 
6956_81870_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 I can only support your suggestion said the Archdeacon 
none	none	So the coachman came down from his box and helped them to lift the young man into the landau and his body swayed helplessly between Miss Winwood and the Archdeacon whose breeches and gaiters were smeared with dust from his heavy boots A few moments afterwards he was carried into the library and laid upon a sofa and Miss Winwood administered restoratives The deep stupor seemed to pass and he began to moan Miss Winwood and the housekeeper stood by his side 
6956_81870_000015_000001	train-clean-360	The Archdeacon his hands behind his back paced the noiseless Turkey carpet 
none	none	I hope said he your doctor will not be long in coming It looks like a sunstroke the housekeeper remarked as her mistress scrutinized the clinical thermometer It doesn t said Miss Winwood bluntly In sunstroke the face is either congested or clammy I know that much He has a temperature of one hundred three
6956_81870_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 Poor fellow said the Archdeacon 
none	none	I wonder who he is said Miss Winwood
6956_81870_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 Perhaps this may tell us said the Archdeacon 
none	none	From the knapsack carelessly handled by the servant who had brought it in had escaped a book and the servant had laid the book on the top of the knapsack 
6956_81870_000021_000001	train-clean-360	The Archdeacon took it up 
none	none	Sir Thomas Browne s Religio Medici and Urn Burial 
6956_81870_000022_000001	train-clean-360	On the flyleaf Paul Savelli An undergraduate I should say on a walking tour 
6956_81870_000023_000000	train-clean-360	Miss Winwood took the book from his hands a little cheap reprint 
6956_81870_000023_000001	train-clean-360	 I m glad she said 
6956_81870_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 Why my dear Ursula 
6956_81870_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 I m very fond of Sir Thomas Browne myself she replied 
none	none	Presently the doctor came and made his examination 
6956_81870_000026_000001	train-clean-360	He shook a grave head 
6956_81870_000026_000002	train-clean-360	 Pneumonia 
none	none	And he has got it bad 
6956_81870_000026_000004	train-clean-360	Perhaps a touch of the sun as well The housekeeper smiled discreetly 
none	none	Looks half starved too I ll send up the ambulance at once and get him to the cottage hospital 
6956_81870_000027_000000	train-clean-360	Miss Winwood a practical woman was aware that the doctor gave wise counsel 
6956_81870_000027_000001	train-clean-360	But she looked at Paul and hesitated

none	none	Eh said the doctor The Archdeacon raised his eyebrows My dear Ursula I thought you had made the Morebury Cottage Hospital the model of its kind Its kind is not for people who carry about Sir Thomas Browne in their pocket retorted the disingenuous lady
6956_81870_000030_000001	train-clean-360	 If I turned him out of my house doctor and anything happened to him I should have to reckon with his people 
6956_81870_000030_000002	train-clean-360	He stays here

6956_81870_000030_000007	train-clean-360	That s quite right isn t it 
none	none	Ideal But I warn you Miss Winwood you may be letting yourself in for a perfectly avoidable lot of trouble
6956_81870_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 I like trouble said Miss Winwood 
6956_81870_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 You re certainly looking for it replied the doctor glancing at Paul and stuffing his stethoscope into his pocket 
none	none	And in this case I can promise you worry beyond dreams of anxiety The word of Ursula Winwood was law for miles around 
6956_81870_000034_000001	train-clean-360	doctor Fuller rosy fat and fifty obeyed like everyone else but during the process of law making he had often before now played the part of an urbane and gently satirical leader of the opposition 
none	none	She flashed round on him with a foolish pain through her heart that caused her to catch her breath
6956_81870_000035_000001	train-clean-360	 Is he as bad as that she asked quickly 
6956_81870_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 As bad as that said the doctor with grave significance 
none	none	How he managed to get here is a mystery Within a quarter of an hour the unconscious Paul clad in a suit of Colonel Winwood s silk pyjamas lay in a fragrant room hung with green and furnished in old black oak Never once in all his life had Paul Kegworthy lain in such a room And for him a great house was in commotion Messages went forth for nurses and medicines and the paraphernalia of a luxurious sick chamber and the lady of the house being absurdly anxious for a great London specialist whose fee in doctor Fuller s quiet eyes would be amusingly fantastic It seems horrible to search the poor boy s pockets said Miss Winwood when after these excursions and alarms the Archdeacon and herself had returned to the library but we must try to find out who he is and communicate with his people Savelli I ve never heard of them I wonder who they are There is an historical Italian family of that name said the Archdeacon
6956_81870_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 I was sure of it said Miss Winwood 
none	none	Of what That his people are well all right

6956_81870_000043_000000	train-clean-360	Ursula was very fond of her uncle 
none	none	He represented to her the fine flower of the Church of England a gentleman a scholar an ideal physical type of the Anglican dignitary a man of unquestionable piety and Christian charity a personage who would be recognized for what he was by Hottentots or Esquimaux or attendants of wagon lits trains or millionaires of the Middle West of America or Parisian Apaches In him the branch of the family tree had burgeoned into the perfect cleric Yet sometimes the play of light beneath the surface of those blue eyes so like her own and the delicately intoned challenges of his courtly voice exasperated her beyond measure It s obvious to any idiot my dear she replied testily
6956_81870_000043_000004	train-clean-360	 Just look at him 
6956_81870_000043_000005	train-clean-360	It speaks for itself 
none	none	The Archdeacon put his thin hand on her plump shoulder and smiled The old man had a very sunny smile
6956_81870_000044_000002	train-clean-360	 I m sorry to carry on a conversation so Socratically said he 
6956_81870_000044_000003	train-clean-360	 But what is it

none	none	And then she waved a plump hand and then as I ve mentioned before he reads the Religio Medici The commonplace vulgar young man of to day no more reads Sir Thomas Browne than he reads Tertullian or the Upanishads He also reads said the Archdeacon stuffing his hand into Paul s knapsack against whose canvas the stiff outline of a book revealed itself he also reads he held up a little fat duodecimo the Chansons de Beranger That proves it cried Miss Winwood
6956_81870_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 Proves what 
none	none	His blue eyes twinkled Having a sense of humour she laughed and flung her great arm round his frail shoulders It proves my venerable and otherwise distinguished dear that I am right and you are wrong My good Ursula said he disengaging himself I have not advanced one argument either in favour of or in opposition to one single proposition the whole of this afternoon She shook her head at him pityingly The housekeeper entered carrying a double handful of odds and ends which she laid on the library table a watch and chain and cornelian heart a cigarette case bearing the initials P S some keys a very soiled handkerchief a sovereign a shilling and a penny doctor Fuller had sent them down with his compliments they were the entire contents of the young gentleman s pockets Not a card not a scrap of paper with a name and address on it cried Miss Winwood Not a scrap miss The doctor and I searched most thoroughly Perhaps the knapsack will tell us more said the Archdeacon The knapsack however revealed nothing but a few toilet necessaries a hunk of stale bread and a depressing morsel of cheese and a pair of stockings and a shirt declared by the housekeeper to be wet through As the Beranger like the Sir Thomas Browne was inscribed Paul Savelli which corresponded with the initials on the cigarette case they were fairly certain of the young man s name But that was all they could discover regarding him We ll have to wait until he can tell us himself said Miss Winwood later to the doctor We ll have to wait a long time said he CHAPTER IX THE London physician arrived sat up with Paul most of the night and went away the next morning saying that he was a dead man doctor Fuller however advanced the uncontrovertible opinion that a man was not dead till he died and Paul was not dead yet As a matter of fact Paul did not die If he had done so there would have been an end of him and this history would never have been written He lay for many days at the gates of Death and Miss Winwood terribly fearful lest they should open and the mysterious unconscious shape of beauty and youth should pass through had all the trouble promised her by the doctor But the gates remained shut When Paul took a turn for the better the London physician came down again and declared that he was living in defiance of all the laws of pathology and with a graceful compliment left the case in the hands of doctor Fuller When his life was out of danger doctor Fuller attributed the miracle to the nurses Ursula Winwood attributed it to doctor Fuller the London physician to Paul s superb constitution and Paul himself perhaps the most wisely to the pleasant faced masterful lady who had concentrated on his illness all the resources of womanly tenderness But it was a long time before Paul was capable of formulating such an opinion It was a long time before he could formulate any opinion at all When not delirious or comatose he had the devil of pleurisy tearing at the wall of his lung like a wild cat Only gradually did he begin to observe and to question That noiseless woman in coot blue and white was a nurse He knew that So he must be in hospital But the room was much smaller than a hospital ward and where were the other patients The question worried him for a whole morning Then there was a pink faced man in gold spectacles Obviously the doctor Then there was a sort of nurse whom he liked very much but she was not in uniform Who could she be He realized that he was ill as weak as a butterfly and the pain when he coughed was agonizing It was all very odd How had he come here He remembered walking along a dusty road in the blazing sun his head bursting every limb a moving ache He also vaguely remembered being awakened at night by a thunder storm as he lay snugly asleep beneath a hedge The German Ocean had fallen down upon him He was quite sure it was the German Ocean because he had fixed it in his head by repeating the North Sea or German Ocean Mixing up delirious dream with fact he clearly remembered the green waves rearing themselves up first an immeasurable wall then spreading a translucent canopy beneath the firmament and then descending in awful deluge He had a confused memory of morning sunshine of a cottage of a hard featured woman of sitting before a fire with a blanket round his shoulders of a toddling child smeared to the eyebrows with dirt and treacle whom he had wanted to wash Over and over again lately he had wanted to wash that child but it had always eluded his efforts Once he had thought of scraping it with a bit of hoof iron but it had turned into a Stilton cheese It was all very puzzling Then he had gone on tramping along the high road What was that about bacon and eggs The horrible smell offended his nostrils It must have been a wayside inn and a woman twenty feet high with a face like a cauliflower or was it spinach or Brussels sprouts silly not to remember one of the three certainly desired to murder him with a thousand eggs bubbling up against rank reefs of bacon He had escaped from her somehow and he had been very lucky His star had saved him It had also saved him from a devil on a red hot bicycle He had stood quite still calm and undismayed in the awful path of the straddling Apollyon whose head was girt around with yellow fire and had seen him swerve madly and fall off the machine And when the devil had picked himself up he had tried to blast him with the Great Curse of the Underworld but Paul had shown him his cornelian heart his talisman and the devil had remounted his glowing vehicle and had ridden away in a spume of flame The Father of Lies had tried to pass himself off as a postman The memory of the shallow pretence tickled Paul so that he laughed and then he half fainted in pleuritic agony After the interlude with the devil he could recollect little He was going up to London to make his fortune A princess was waiting for him at the golden gate of London with a fortune piled up in a coach and six But being very sick and dizzy he thought he would sit down and rest in a great green cathedral whose doors stood invitingly open and now he found himself in the hospital ward Sometimes he felt a desire to question the blue and white nurse but it seemed too much trouble to move his lips Then in a flash came the solution of the puzzle and he chuckled to himself over his cunning Of course it was a dream The nurse was a dream nurse who wanted to make him believe that she was real But she was not clever enough The best way to pay her out for her deception was to take no notice of her whatsoever So comforted he would go to sleep At last one morning he woke a miserably weak but perfectly sane man and he turned his head from side to side and looked wonderingly at the fresh and exquisite room A bowl of Morning Glow roses stood by his bedside gracious things for fevered eyes to rest upon A few large photographs of famous pictures hung on the walls In front of him was the Santa Barbara of Palma Vecchio which he recognized with a smile He had read about it and knew that the original was in Venice Knowledge of things like that was comforting The nurse noticing the change came up to him and spoke in a soothing voice Are you feeling better I think so said Paul I suppose I ve been very ill Very ill said the nurse This can t be a hospital Oh no It s the house of some very kind good friends You don t know them she added quickly seeing him knit a perplexed brow You stumbled into their garden and fainted And they re very anxious for you to get well and strong Who are they asked Paul Colonel and Miss Winwood They will be so glad to see you better at least Miss Winwood will the Colonel s not at home She lifted his head gently and smoothed his pillows and ordained silence Presently the doctor came and spoke kindly You ve had a narrow shave my friend and you re not out of the wood yet said he And you ll have to go slow and take things for granted for some time Then came Miss Winwood whom he recognized as the puzzling but pleasant nurse out of uniform I don t know how to thank you for taking me in a stranger like this said Paul She smiled It s Providence not me that you must thank You might have been taken ill by the roadside far away from anybody Providence guided you here Providence or Destiny murmured Paul closing his eyes It was absurd to feel so weak That s a theological question on which we won t enter laughed Miss Winwood Anyhow thank God you re better A little later she came to him again I ve been so anxious about your people you see we ve had no means of communicating with them My people asked Paul surprised Yes They must be wondering what has become of you I have no people said Paul No people What do you mean she asked sharply for the moment forgetful of the sick room She herself had hundreds of relations The branches of her family tree were common to half the country families of England Have you no parents brothers or sisters None that I know of said Paul I m quite alone in the world Have you no friends to whom I could write about you He shook his head and his great eyes all the greater and more lustrous through illness smiled into hers No None that count At least there are two friends but I ve lost sight of them for years No there s nobody who would be in the least interested to know Please don t trouble I shall be all right Miss Winwood put her cool hand on his forehead and bent over him You You alone like that My poor boy She turned away It was almost incredible It was monstrously pathetic The phenomenon baffled her Tears came into her eyes She had imagined him the darling of mother and sisters the gay centre of troops of friends And he was alone on the earth Who was he She turned again Will you tell me your name Savelli Paul Savelli I thought so It was in the two books in your knapsack A historical Italian name Yes said Paul Noble All dead He lay back exhausted Suddenly a thought smote him He beckoned She approached My heart is it safe he whispered Your heart At the end of my watch chain Quite safe Could I have it near me Of course Paul closed his eyes contentedly With his talisman in his hand all would be well For the present he need take thought of nothing His presence in the beautiful room being explained there was an end of the perplexity of his semi delirium Of payment for evident devoted service there could be no question Time enough when he grew well and able to fare forth again to consider the immediate future He was too weak to lift his head and something inside him hurt like the devil when he moved Why worry about outer and unimportant matters The long days of pain and illness slipped gradually away Miss Winwood sat by his bedside and talked but not until he was much stronger did she question him as to his antecedents The Archdeacon had gone away after a week s visit without being able to hold any converse with Paul Colonel Winwood was still at Contrexeville whence he wrote sceptically of the rare bird whom Ursula had discovered and Ursula was alone in the house save for a girl friend who had no traffic with the sick chamber She had therefore much leisure to devote to Paul Her brother s scepticism most naturally strengthened her belief in him He was her discovery He grew almost to be her invention Just consider Here was a young Greek god everyone who had a bowing acquaintance with ancient sculpture immediately likened Paul to a Greek god and Ursula was not so far different from her cultured fellow mortals as to liken him to anything else here was a young Phoebus Apollo all the more Olympian because of his freedom from earthly ties fallen straight from the clouds He had fallen at her feet His beauty had stirred her His starlike loneliness had touched her heart His swift intelligence growing more manifest each day as he grew stronger moved her admiration He had too she realized a sunny and sensuous nature alive to beauty even the beauty of the trivial things in his sickroom He had an odd poetical trick of phrase He was a paragon of young Greek gods She had discovered him and women don t discover even mortal paragons every day in the week Also she was a woman of forty three which after all is not wrinkled and withered eld and she was not a soured woman she radiated health and sweetness she had loved once in her life very dearly Romance touched her with his golden feather and in the most sensible and the most unreprehensible way in the world she fell in love with Paul I wonder what made you put that Santa Barbara of Palma Vecchio just opposite the bed he said one day He had advanced so far toward recovery as to be able to sit up against his pillows Don t you like it She turned in her chair by his bedside I worship it Do you know she has a strange look of you When I was half off my head I used to mix you up together She has such a generous and holy bigness the generosity of the All woman Ursula flushed at the personal tribute but let it pass without comment It s not a bad photograph but the original that is too lovely It s in the Church of Santa Maria Formosa in Venice said Paul quickly He had passed through a period of wild enthusiasm for Italian painting and had haunted the National Gallery and knew by heart Sir Charles Eastlake s edition of Kugler s unique textbook Ah you know it said Ursula I ve never been to Venice replied Paul with a sigh It s the dream of my life to go there She straightened herself on her chair How do you know the name of the church Paul smiled and looked round the walls and reflected for a moment Yes said he in answer to his own questioning I think I can tell you where all these pictures are though I ve never seen them except one The two angels by Melozzo da Forli are in saint Peter s at Rome The Sposalia of Raphael is in the Breza Milan The Andrea del Sarto is in the Louvre That s the one I ve seen That little child of Heaven playing the lute is in the predella of an altar piece by Vittore Carpaccio in the in the please don t tell me in the Academia of Venice Am I right Absolutely right said Miss Winwood He laughed delighted At three and twenty one thank goodness is very young One hungers for recognition of the wonder inspiring self that lies hidden beneath the commonplace mask of clay And that said he the Madonna being crowned the Botticelli is in the Uffizi at Florence Walter Pater talks about it you know in his Renaissance the pen dropping from her hand the high cold words that have no meaning for her the intolerable honour Oh it s enormous isn t it I m afraid I ve not read my Pater as I ought said Miss Winwood But you must cried Paul with the gloriously audacious faith of youth which has just discovered a true apostle Pater puts you on to the inner meaning of everything in art I mean He doesn t wander about in the air like Ruskin though of course if you get your mental winnowing machine in proper working order you can get the good grain out of Ruskin The Stones of Venice and The Seven Lamps have taught me a lot But you always have to be saying to yourself Is this gorgeous nonsense or isn t it whereas in Pater there s no nonsense at all You re simply carried along on a full stream of Beauty straight into the open Sea of Truth And Ursula Winwood to whom Archbishops had been deferential and Cabinet Ministers had come for guidance meekly promised to send at once for Pater s Renaissance and so fill in a most lamentable gap in her education My uncle the Archdeacon she said after a while reminded me that the great Savelli was a Venetian general of Roman family and strangely enough his name too was Paul Perhaps that s how you got the name That must be how said Paul dreamily He had not heard of the great general He had seen the name of Savelli somewhere also that of Torelli and had hesitated between the two Thinking it no great harm he wove into words the clamour of his cherished romance My parents died when I was quite young a baby and then I was brought to England So you see he smiled in his winning way I m absolutely English But you ve kept your Italian love of beauty I hope so said Paul Then I suppose you were brought up by guardians said Ursula A guardian said Paul anxious to cut down to a minimum the mythical personages that might be connected with his career But I seldom saw him He lived in Paris chiefly He s dead now What a poor little uncared for waif you must have been Paul laughed Oh don t pity me I ve had to think for myself a good deal it is true But it has done me good Don t you find it s the things one learns for oneself whether they are about life or old china that are the most valuable Of course said Miss Winwood But she sighed womanlike at the thought of the little Paul how beautiful he must have been as a child being brought up by servants and hirelings in a lonely house his very guardian taking no concern in his welfare Thus it came about that from the exiguous material supplied by Paul Miss Winwood not doubting his gentle birth and breeding constructed for him a wholly fictitious set of antecedents Paul invented as little as possible and gratefully accepted her suggestions They worked together unconsciously Paul had to give some account of himself He had blotted Bludston and his modeldom out of his existence The passionate belief in his high and romantic birth was part of his being and Miss Winwood s recognition was a splendid confirmation of his faith It was rather the suppressio veri of which he was guilty than the propositio falsi So between them his childhood was invested with a vague semblance of reality in which the fact of his isolation stood out most prominent They had many talks together not only on books and art but on the social subjects in which Ursula was so deeply interested She found him well informed with a curiously detailed knowledge of the everyday lives of the poor It did not occur to her that this knowledge came from his personal experience She attributed it to the many sided genius of her paragon When you get well you must help us There s an infinite amount to be done I shall be delighted said Paul politely You ll find I m a terrible person to deal with when once I ve laid my hands on anybody she said with a smile I drag in all kinds of people and they can t escape I sent young Harry Gostling Lord Ruthmere s son you know to look into a working girls club in the Isle of Dogs that was going wrong He hated it at first but now he s as keen as possible And you ll be keen too It was flattering to be classified with leisured and opulent young Guardsmen but what Paul reflected with a qualm would the kind lady say if she learned the real state of his present fortunes He thought of the guinea that lay between him and starvation and was amused by the irony of her proposition Miss Winwood evidently took it for granted that he was in easy circumstances living on the patrimony administered during his boyhood by a careless guardian He shrank from undeceiving her His dream was beginning to come true He was accepted by one of the high caste as belonging to the world where princes and princesses dwelt serene If only he could put the theatre behind him as he had put the rest and make a stepping stone of his dead actor self But that was impossible or at least the question would have to be fought out between himself and fortune after he had left Drane s Court In the meanwhile he glowed with the ambition to leave it in his newly acquired splendour drums beating banners flying the young prince returning to his romantic and mysterious solitude The time was approaching when he should get up He sent for his luggage The battered trunk and portmanteau plastered with the labels of queer provincial towns did not betray great wealth Nor did the contents taken out by the man servant and arranged in drawers by the nurse His toilet paraphernalia was of the simplest and scantiest His stock of frayed linen and darned underclothes made rather a poor little heap on the chair He watched the unpacking somewhat wistfully from his bed and like many another poor man inwardly resented his poverty being laid bare to the eyes of the servants of the rich The only thing that the man seemed to handle respectfully as a recognized totem of a superior caste was a brown canvas case of golf clubs which he stood up in a conspicuous corner of the room Paul had taken to the Ancient and Royal game when first he went on tour and it had been a health giving resource during the listless days when there was no rehearsal or no matinee hundreds of provincial actors to say nothing of retired colonels and such like derelicts owe their salvation of body and soul to the absurd but hygienic pastime and with a naturally true eye and a harmonious body trained to all demands on its suppleness in the gymnasium proficiency had come with little trouble He was a born golfer for the physically perfect human is a born anything physical you please But he had not played for a long time Half crowns had been very scarce on this last disastrous tour and comrades who included golf in their horizon of human possibilities had been rarer When would he play again Heaven knew So he looked wistfully too at his set of golf clubs He remembered how he had bought them one by one Do you want this on the dressing table The nurse held up a little oblong case It was his make up box luckily tied round with string Good heavens no he exclaimed He wished he could have told her to burn it He felt happier when all his belongings were stowed away out of sight and the old trunk and portmanteau hauled out of the room Colonel Winwood came home and asked his sister pertinent questions He was a bald sad looking man with a long grizzling moustache that drooped despondently But he had a square obstinate chin and his eyes though they seldom smiled were keen and direct like Miss Winwood s Romance had passed him by long since He did not believe in paragons I gather my dear Ursula said he in a dry voice that our guest is an orphan of good Italian family brought up in England by a guardian now dead who lived in France Also that he is of prepossessing exterior of agreeable manners of considerable cultivation and apparently of no acquaintance But what I can t make out is what he does for a living how he came to be half starved on his walking tour the doctor said so you remember where he was going from and where he is going to when he leaves our house In fact he seems to be a very vague and mysterious person of whom for a woman of your character and peculiar training you know singularly little Miss Winwood replied that she could not pry into the lad s private affairs Her brother retorted that a youth in his physically helpless condition who was really ingenuous would have poured out his life s history into the ears of so sympathetic a woman and have bored her to tears with the inner secrets of his soul He has high aspirations He has told me of them But he hasn t bored me a bit said Ursula What does he aspire to What does any brilliant young fellow of two or three and twenty aspire to Anything everything He has only to find his path Yes but what is his path I wish you weren t so much like Uncle Edward James said Ursula He s a damned clever old man said Colonel Winwood and I wish he had stayed here long enough to be able to put our young friend through a searching cross examination Ursula lifted her finger bowl an inch from the doiley and carefully put it down again It was the evening of Colonel Winwood s arrival and they were lingering over coffee in the great picture hung and softly lighted dining room Having fixed the bowl in the exact centre of the doiley she flashed round on her brother My dear James do you think I m an idiot He took his cigar from his lips and looked at her with not unhumorous dryness When the world was very young my dear said he I ve no doubt I called you so But not since She stretched out her hand and tapped his She was very fond of him You can t help being a man my poor boy and thinking manly thoughts of me a woman But I m not an idiot Our young friend as you call him is as poor as a church mouse I know it No don t say How like Uncle Edward He hasn t told me but Nurse has a heart breaking history of socks and things There s the doctor s diagnosis too I haven t forgotten But the boy is too proud to cry poverty among strangers He keeps his end up like a man To hear him talk one would think he not only hadn t a care in the world but that he commanded the earth How can one help admiring the boy s pluck and that s where my reticence comes in respecting the boy s reserve H m said Colonel Winwood But good gracious Jim dear supposing you or any of us men I mean had been in this boy s extraordinary position would you have acted differently You would have died rather than give your poverty away to absolute strangers to whom you were indebted in the way this boy is indebted to us Good God Jim she sent her dessert knife skimming across the table don t you see Any reference to poverty would be an invitation a veiled request for further help To a gentleman like Paul Savelli the thing s unthinkable Colonel Winwood selected a fresh cigar clipped off the end and lit it from a silver spirit lamp by his side He blew out the first exquisite puff the smoker s paradise would be the one first full and fragrant virginal puff of an infinite succession of perfect cigars looked anxiously at the glowing point to see that it was exactly lighted and leaned back in his chair What you say dear said he is plausible Plausible almost to the point of conviction But there s a hole somewhere in your argument I m sure and I m too tired after my journey to find it Thus as the stars in their courses fought against Sisera so did they fight for Paul and in both cases they used a woman as their instrument Colonel Winwood in spite of a masculine air of superiority joined with the Archbishops and Cabinet Ministers above referred to in their appreciation of his sister s judgment After all what business of his were the private affairs of his involuntary guest He paid him a visit the next day and found him lying on a couch by the sunny window clad in dressing gown and slippers Paul rose politely though he winced with pain Don t get up please I m Colonel Winwood They shook hands Paul began to wheel an armchair from the bedside but Colonel Winwood insisted on his lying down again and drew up the chair himself I m afraid said Paul I ve been a sad trespasser on your hospitality Miss Winwood must have told you it has scarcely been my fault but I don t know how to express my thanks As Paul made it the little speech could not have been better Colonel Winwood who like the seniors of every age deplored the lack of manners of the rising generation was pleased by the ever so little elaborate courtesy I m only too glad we ve pulled you round You ve had a bad time I hear Paul smiled Pretty bad If it hadn t been for Miss Winwood and all she has done for me I should have pegged out My sister s a notable woman said the Colonel When she sets out to do a thing she does it thoroughly I owe her my life said Paul simply There was a pause The two men both bright eyed looked at each other for the fraction of a second One the aristocrat secure of his wealth of his position of himself with no illusion left him save pride of birth no dream save that of an England mighty and prosperous under continuous centuries of Tory rule no memories but of stainless honour he had fought gallantly for his Queen he had lived like a noble gentleman he had done his country disinterested service no ambition but to keep himself on the level of the ideal which he had long since attained the other the creation of nothing but of dreams the child of the gutter the adventurer the vagabond with no address not even a back room over a sweetstuff shop in wide England the possessor of a few suits of old clothes and one pound one shilling and a penny with nothing in front of him but the vast blankness of life nothing behind him save memories of sordid struggle with nothing to guide him nothing to set him on his way with thrilling pulse and quivering fibres save the Vision Splendid the glorious Hope the unconquerable Faith In the older man s eyes Paul read the calm stern certainty of things both born to and achieved and Colonel Winwood saw in the young man s eyes as in a glass darkly the reflection of the Vision And yours is a very young life said he Gad it must be wonderful to be twenty Rich in the glory of my rising sun You know your Thackeray Riche de ma jeunesse laughed Paul Thackeray went one better than Beranger that time I forgot said Colonel Winwood My sister told me You go about with Beranger as a sort of pocket Bible Paul laughed again When one is on the tramp one s choice of books is limited by their cubical content One couldn t take Gibbon for instance or a complete Balzac Colonel Winwood tugged at his drooping moustache and again scrutinized the frank and exceedingly attractive youth His astonishing perfection of feature was obvious to anybody Yet any inconsiderable human a peasant of the Campagna a Venetian gondolier a swaggering brigand of Macedonia could be astonishingly beautiful And being astonishingly beautiful that was the beginning and end of him But behind this merely physical attractiveness of his guest glowed a lambent intelligence quick as lightning There was humorous challenge in those laughing and lucent dark eyes Do you know your Balzac he asked Oh yes said Paul I wonder if you do said Colonel Winwood I m rather a Balzacian myself I can t say I ve read all Balzac That s a colossal order said Paul rather excited for in his limited acquaintance with cultivated folk Colonel Winwood was the only human being who could claim acquaintance with one of the literary gods of his idolatry but I know him pretty well I can t stand his Theatre that s footle but the big things Le Pere Goriot La Cousine Bette Cesar Birotteau what a great book Cesar Birotteau is You re right said Colonel Winwood forgetful of any possible barriers between himself and the young enthusiast It s one of the four or five great books and very few people recognize it Le Lys dans la Vallee said Paul There s another And they talked for half an hour of the Baron Nucingen and Rastignac and Hulot and Bixiou and Lousteau and Gobsec and Gaudissart and Vautrin and many another vivid personage in the human comedy That man could have gone on writing for a hundred years cried Paul and he could have exhausted all the possibilities of human life Colonel Winwood smiled courteously We have a bond in Balzac said he But I must go My sister said I mustn t tire you He rose We re having a lot of people down here this week for the shooting There ll be good sport Pity you re not well enough to join us Paul smiled He had one of his flashes of tact I m afraid said he modestly that I ve never fired off a gun in my life What cried the Colonel It s true Colonel Winwood looked at him once more It s not many young men said he who would dare to make such a confession But what is the good of lying asked Paul with the eyes of a cherub None that I know of replied the Colonel He returned to his chair and rested his hand on the back You play golf anyhow said he pointing to the brown canvas bag in the corner Oh yes said Paul Any good Fair to middling What s your handicap asked the Colonel an enthusiastic though inglorious practitioner of the game One said Paul The deuce it is cried the Colonel Mine is fifteen You must give me a lesson or two when you pull round We ve a capital course here That s very kind of you said Paul but I m afraid I shall be well enough for ordinary purposes long before I m able to handle a golf club What do you mean This silly pleurisy It will hang about for ages Well I ll have to go my ways from here long before I can play Any great hurry I can t go on accepting your wonderful hospitality indefinitely said Paul That s nonsense Stay as long as ever you like If I did that said Paul I would stay on forever The Colonel smiled and shook hands with him In the ordinary way of social life this was quite an unnecessary thing to do But he acted according to the impulses common to a thousand of his type and a fine type in England Setting aside the mere romantic exterior of a Macedonian brigand here was a young man of the period with astonishingly courteous manners of and this was of secondary consideration of frank and winning charm with a free and easy intimacy with Balzac of fearless truthfulness regarding his deficiencies and with a golf handicap of one The Colonel s hand and heart went out in instinctive coordination The Colonel Winwoods of this country are not gods they are very humanly fallible but of such is the Kingdom of England At any rate said he you mustn t dream of leaving us yet He went downstairs and met his sister in the hall Well she asked with just a gleam of quizzicality in her eyes for she knew whence he had come One of these days I ll take him out and teach him to shoot said the Colonel CHAPTER X THE shooting party came and Paul able to leave his room and sit in the sunshine and crawl about the lawn and come down to dinner though early retirement was prescribed went among the strange men and women of the aristocratic caste like one in a dream of bliss Much of their talk sport and personalities was unintelligible every man seemed to have killed everything everywhere and every woman seemed to know everybody and everybody s intimate secrets So when conversation was general Paul who had killed nothing and knew nobody listened in silent perplexity But even the perplexity was a happiness It was all so new so fascinating For was not this world of aristocrats there were lords and ladies and great personages whose names he had read in the newspapers his rightful inheritance the sphere to which he had been born And they did not always talk of things which he did not understand They received him among them with kind welcome and courtesy No one asked him whence he came and whither he was going They took him for granted as a guest of the Winwoods Of course if Paul had seen himself on the way to rival the famous actor whose photograph in the window of the London Stereoscopic Company had inspired him with histrionic ambitions he would have been at no pains to hide his profession But between the darling of the London stage and a seedy member of a fit up company lies a great gulf He shrank from being associated with mister Vincent Crummles One thing however of invaluable use he had brought with him from Theatreland the dress suit which formed part of his stage wardrobe There were other things too which he did not appreciate ease of manner victory over the lingering Lancastrian burr and a knowledge of what to do with his feet and hands One day he had a great shock The house party were assembling in the drawing room when in sailed the great lady the ever memorable great lady the Marchioness of Chudley who had spoken to him and smiled on him in the Bludston factory Fear laid a cold grip on his heart He thought of pleading weakness and running away to the safe obscurity of his room But it was too late The procession was formed immediately and he found himself in his place with his partner on his arm Dinner was torture What he said to his neighbours he knew not He dared not look up the table where Lady Chudley sat in full view Every moment he expected ridiculous apprehension of an accusing conscience Colonel Winwood to come and tap him on the shoulder and bid him begone But nothing happened Afterwards in the drawing room Fate drove him into a corner near Lady Chudley whose eyes he met clear upon him He turned away hurriedly and plunged into conversation with a young soldier standing by Presently he heard Miss Winwood s voice mister Savelli I want to introduce you to Lady Chudley The fear gripped him harder and colder How could he explain that he was occupying his rightful place in that drawing room But he held himself up and resolved to face the peril like a man Lady Chudley smiled on him graciously how well he remembered her smile and made him sit by her side She was a dark stately woman of forty giving the impression that she could look confoundedly cold and majestic when she chose She wore diamonds in her hair and a broad diamond clasp to the black velvet round her throat Miss Winwood has been telling me what an awful time you ve had mister Savelli she said pleasantly Now whenever I hear of people having had pneumonia I always want to talk to them and sympathize with them That s very kind of you Lady Chudley said Paul Only a fellow feeling I nearly died of it once myself I hope you re getting strong I m feeling my strength returning every day It s a queer new joy Isn t it They discussed the exhilaration of convalescence It was a wonderful springtide They reverted to the preceding misery You re far luckier than I was she remarked You ve had a comfy English house to be ill in I was in a stone cold palazzo in Florence in winter Ugh Shall I ever forget it I don t want to speak evil of Italy to an Italian I m only Italian by descent exclaimed Paul with a laugh his first frank laugh during the whole of that gloomy evening And he laughed louder than was necessary for as it suddenly dawned upon him that he did not in the least recall to her mind the grimy little Bludston boy the cold hand of fear was dissolved in a warm gush of exultation You can abuse Italy or any country but England as much as you like Why mustn t I abuse England Because it s the noblest country in the world he cried and seeing approval in her eyes he yielded to an odd temptation If one could only do something great for her What would you like to do she asked Anything Sing for her Work for her Die for her It makes one so impatient to sit down and do nothing If one could only stir her up to a sense of her nationality he went on less lyrically though with the same fine enthusiasm She seems to be losing it letting the smaller nations assert theirs to such an extent that she is running the risk of becoming a mere geographical expression She has merged herself in the Imperial Ideal That s magnificent but the Empire ought to realize her as the great Motherheart If England could only wake up as England again what a wonderful thing it would be It would said Lady Chudley And you would like to be the awakener Ay said Paul what a dream There was never a dream worth calling a dream that did not come true Do you believe that too he asked delightedly I ve held to it all my life Colonel Winwood who had been moving hostwise from group to group in the great drawing room where already a couple of bridge tables had been arranged approached slowly Lady Chudley gave him a laughing glance of dismissal Paul s spacious Elizabethan patriotism rare at least in expression among the young men of the day interested and amused her Have you dreamed all your life of being the Awakener of England I have dreamed of being so many things he said anxious not to commit himself For truth to say this new ambition was but a couple of minutes old It had sprung into life however like Pallas Athene all armed and equipped And they have all come true His great eyes laughed and his curly head bent ever so slightly Those worth calling dreams said he A little later in the evening when on retiring to an early bed he was wishing Miss Winwood good night she said You re a lucky young man I know but He looked smiling inquiry Lady Chudley s the most valuable woman in England for a young man to get on the right side of Paul went to bed dazed The great lady who had recognized the divine fire in the factory boy had again recognized it in the grown man She had all but said that if he chose he could be the Awakener of England The Awakener of England The watchword of his new born ambition rang in his brain until he fell asleep The time soon came when the prospective Awakener of England awoke to the fact that he must fare forth into the sleeping land with but a guinea in his pocket The future did not dismay him for he knew now that his dreams came true But he was terribly anxious more anxious than ever to leave Drane s Court with all the prestige of the prospective Awakener Now this final scene of the production could not be worked for a guinea There were golden tips to servants there was the first class railway fare Once in London he could pawn things to keep him going and a Bloomsbury landlady with whom he had lodged since the loss of Jane would give him a fortnight or three weeks credit But he had to get to London to get there gloriously so that when the turn of Fortune s wheel enabled him to seek again these wonderful friends in the aristocratic sphere to which he belonged he could come among them untarnished the conquering prince But that miserable guinea He racked his brains There was his gold watch and chain a symbol to his young mind of high estate When he had bought it there crossed his mind the silly thought of its signification of the infinite leagues that lay between him and Billy Goodge He could pawn it for ten pounds it would be like pawning his heart s blood but where Not in Morebury even supposing there was a pawnbroker s in the place He had many friends in his profession scattered up and down the land But he had created round himself the atmosphere of the young magnifico It was he who had lent others who had borrowed Rothschild or Rockefeller inviting any of them to lend him money would have produced less jaw dropping amazement Even if he sent his pride flying and appealed to the most friendly and generous he shrank from the sacrifice he would call upon the poor devil to make There was only his beautiful and symbolic watch and chain The nearest great town where he could be sure of finding a pawnbroker was distant an hour s train journey So on the day before that for which in spite of hospitable protestations on the part of Colonel and Miss Winwood he had fixed his departure he set forth on the plea of private business and returned with a heavier pocket and a heavier heart He had been so proud poor boy of the gold insignia across his stomach He had had a habit of fingering it lovingly Now it was gone He felt naked in a curious way dishonoured There only remained his cornelian talisman He got back in time for tea and kept his jacket closely buttoned But in the evening he had perforce to appear stark and ungirt in those days Fashion had not yet decreed as it does now the absence of watchchain on evening dress and Paul shambled into the drawing room like a guest without a wedding garment There were still a few people staying in the house the shooting party proper and Lady Chudley had long since gone but enough remained to be a social microcosm for Paul Every eye was upon him In spite of himself his accusing hand went fingering the inanity of his waistcoat front He also fingered with a horrible fascination the dirty piece of card that took the place of his watch in his pocket One must be twenty to realize the tragedy of it Dans un grenier qu on est bien a vingt ans To be twenty in a garret with the freedom and the joy of it Yes the dear poet was right In those brave days the poignancy of life comes not in the garret but in the palace To morrow with his jacket buttoned he could make his exit from Drane s Court in the desired splendour scattering largesse to menials and showing to hosts the reflected glow of the golden prospects before him but for this evening the glory had departed Besides it was his last evening there and London s welcome tomorrow would be none too exuberant The little party was breaking up the ladies retiring for the night and the men about to accompany Colonel Winwood to the library for a final drink and cigarette Paul shook hands with Miss Winwood Good night and good bye she said if you take the early train But must you really go to morrow I must said Paul I hope we ll very soon be seeing you again Give me your address She moved to a bridge table and caught up the marking block which she brought to him Now I ve forgotten the pencil I ve got one said Paul and impulsively thrusting his fingers into his waistcoat pocket flicked them out with the pencil But he also flicked out the mean looking card of which he had been hatefully conscious all the evening The Imp of Mischance arranged that as Miss Winwood stood close by his side it should fall unperceived by him on the folds of her grey velvet train He wrote the Bloomsbury address and handed her the leaf torn from the pad She folded it up moved away turning back to smile As she turned she happened to look downward then she stooped and picked the card from her dress A conjecture of horror smote Paul He made a step forward and stretched out his hand but not before she had instinctively glanced first at the writing and then at his barren waistcoat She repressed a slight gasp regarding him with steady searching eyes His dark face flushed crimson as he took the accursed thing desiring no greater boon from Heaven than instant death He felt sick with humiliation The brightly lit room grew black It was in a stupor of despair that he heard her say Wait a bit here till I ve got rid of these people He stumbled away and stood on the bearskin rug before the fireplace while she joined the lingering group by the door The two or three minutes were an eternity of agony to Paul He had lost his great game Miss Winwood shut the door and came swiftly to him and laid her hand on his arm Paul hung his head and looked into the fire My poor boy she said very tenderly What are you going to do with yourself If it had not been for the diabolical irony of the mishap he would have answered with his gay flourish But now he could not so answer Boyish hateful tears stood in his eyes and in spite of anguished effort of will threatened to fall He continued to look into the fire so that she should not see them I shall go on as I always have done he said as stoutly as he could Your prospects are not very bright I fear I shall keep my head above water said Paul Oh please don t he cried shivering You have been so good to me I can t bear you to have seen that thing I can t stand it My dear boy she said coming a little nearer I don t think the worse of you for that On the contrary I admire your pluck and your brave attitude towards life Indeed I do I respect you for it Do you remember the old Italian story of Ser Federigo and his falcon How he hid his poverty like a knightly gentleman You see what I mean don t you You mustn t be angry with me Her words were Gilead balm of instantaneous healing Angry His voice quavered In a revulsion of emotion he turned blindly seized her hand and kissed it It was all he could do If I have found it out not just now she quickly interjected seeing him wince but long ago it was not your fault You ve made a gallant gentleman s show to the end until I come in a perfectly brutal way and try to upset it Tell me I m old enough to be your mother and you must know by this time that I m your friend have you any resources at all beyond She made ever so slight a motion of her hand toward the hidden pawn ticket No said Paul with his sure tact and swiftly working imagination I had just come to an end of them It s a silly story of losses and what not I needn t bother you with it I thought I would walk to London with the traditional half crown in my pocket he flashed a wistful smile and seek my fortune But I fell ill at your gates And now that you re restored to health you propose in the same debonair fashion to well to resume the search Of course said Paul all the fighting and aristocratic instincts returning Why not There were no tears in his eyes now and they looked with luminous fearlessness at Miss Winwood He drew a chair to the edge of the bearskin Won t you sit down Miss Winwood She accepted the seat He sat down too Before replying she played with her fan rather roughly more or less as a man might have played with it What do you think of doing Journalism said Paul He had indeed thought of it Have you any opening None he laughed But that s the oyster I m going to open Miss Winwood took a cigarette from a silver box near by Paul sprang to light it She inhaled in silence half a dozen puffs I m going to ask you an outrageous question she said at last In the first place I m a severely business woman and in the next I ve got an uncle and a brother with cross examining instincts and though I loathe them the instincts I mean I can t get away from them We re down on the bedrock of things you and I Will you tell me straight why you went away to day to to she hesitated to pawn your watch and chain instead of waiting till you got to London Paul threw out his arms in a wide gesture Why your servants She cast the just lighted cigarette into the fire rose and clapped her hands on his shoulders her face aflame Forgive me I knew it there are doubting Thomases everywhere and I m a woman who deals with facts so that I can use them to the confusion of enemies Now I have them Ser Federigo s watch and chain Nicht wahr Remember you who judge this sensible woman of forty three that she had fallen in love with Paul in the most unreprehensible way in the world and if a woman of that age cannot fall in love with a boy sweetly motherwise what is the good of her She longed to prove that her polyhedral crystal of a paragon radiated pure light from every one of his innumerable facets It was a matter of intense joy to turn him round and find each facet pure There was also much pity in her heart such as a woman might feel for a wounded bird which she had picked up and nursed in her bosom and healed Ursula was loath to let her bird fly forth into the bleak winter My brother and I have been talking about you he is your friend too she said resuming her seat How would it suit you to stay with us altogether Paul started bolt upright in his chair What do you mean he asked breathlessly for the heavens had opened with dazzling unexpectedness In some such position as confidential secretary at a decent salary of course We ve not been able to find a suitable man since mister Kinghorne left us in the spring He got into Parliament you know for Reddington at the by election and we ve been muddling along with honorary secretaries and typists I shouldn t suggest it to you she went on so as to give him time to think for he sat staring at her openmouthed bewildered his breath coming quickly I shouldn t suggest it to you if there were no chances for you in it You would be in the thick of public affairs and an ambitious man might find a path in them that would lead him anywhere I ve had the idea in my head she smiled for some time But I ve only spoken to my brother about it this afternoon he has been so busy you see and I intended to have another talk with him so as to crystallize things duties money and so forth before making you any proposal I was going to write to you with everything cut and dried But she hesitated delicately I m glad I didn t It s so much more simple and friendly to talk Now what do you say Paul rose and gripped his hands together and looked again into the fire What can I say I could only go on my knees to you and that That would be beautifully romantic and entirely absurd she laughed Anyhow it s settled Tomorrow we can discuss details She rose and put out her hand Good night Paul He bowed low My dearest lady said he in a low voice and went and held the door open for her to pass out Then he flung up his arms wildly and laughed aloud and strode about the room in exultation All he had hoped for and worked for was an exit of fantastic and barren glory After which the Deluge anything He had never dreamed of this sudden blaze of Fortune Now indeed did the Great Things to which he was born lie to his hand Queerly but surely Destiny was guiding him upward In every way Chance had worked for him His poverty had been a cloak of honour the thrice blessed pawn ticket a patent of nobility His kingdom lay before him its purple mountains looming through the mists of dawn And he would enter into it as the Awakener of England He stood thrilled The ambition was no longer the wild dream of yesterday From the heart of the great affairs in which he would have his being he could pluck his awakening instrument The world seemed suddenly to become real And in the midst of it was this wonderful beautiful dearest lady with her keen insight her delicate sympathy her warm humanity With some extravagance he consecrated himself to her service After a while he sat down soberly and took from his pocket the cornelian heart which his first goddess had given him twelve years ago What had become of her He did not even know her name But what happiness he thought to meet her in the plenitude of his greatness and show her the heart and say I owe it all to you To her alone of mortals would he reveal himself And then he thought of Barney Bill who had helped him on his way of Rowlatt good fellow who was dead and of Jane whom he had lost He wished he could write to Jane and tell her the wonderful news She would understand Well well It was time for bed He rose and switched off the lights and went to his room But as he walked through the great noiseless house he felt in spite of Fortune s bounty a loneliness of soul also irritation at having lost Jane What a letter he could have written to her He could not say the things with which his heart was bursting to anyone on earth but Jane Why had he lost Jane The prospective Awakener of England wanted Jane CHAPTER XI ONE morning Paul with a clump of papers in his hand entered his pleasant private room at Drane s Court stepped briskly to the long Cromwellian table placed in the window bay and sat down to his correspondence It was gusty outside as could be perceived by the shower of yellow beech leaves that slanted across the view but indoors a great fire flaming up the chimney a Turkey carpet fading into beauty rich eighteenth century mezzotints on the walls reposeful leather covered chairs and a comfortable bookcase gave an atmosphere of warmth and coziness Paul lit a cigarette and attacked a pile of unopened letters At last he came to an envelope thick and faintly scented bearing a crown on the flap He opened it and read DEAR mister SAVELLI Will you dine on Saturday and help me entertain an eminent Egyptologist I know nothing of Egypt save Shepheard s Hotel and that I m afraid wouldn t interest him Do come to my rescue Yours SOPHIE ZOBRASKA Paul leaned back in his chair twiddling the letter between his fingers and looked smilingly out on the grey autumn rack of clouds There was a pleasant and flattering intimacy in the invitation pleasant because it came from a pretty woman flattering because the woman was a princess widow of a younger son of a Royal Balkan house She lived at Chetwood Park on the other side of Morebury and was one of the great ones of those latitudes A real princess Paul s glance travelling back from the sky fell upon the brass date indicator on the table It marked the second of October On that day five years ago he had entered on his duties at Drane s Court He laughed softly Five years ago he was a homeless wanderer Now princesses were begging him to rescue them from Egyptologists With glorious sureness all his dreams were coming true Thus we see our Fortunate Youth at eight and twenty in the heyday of success If he had strutted about under Jane s admiring eyes like a peacock among daws he now walked serene a peacock among peacocks He wore the raiment frequented the clubs ate the dinners of the undeservingly rich and the deservingly great His charm and his self confidence which a genius of tact saved from self assertion carried him pleasantly through the social world his sympathetic intelligence dealt largely and strongly with the public affairs under his control He loved organizing persuading casting skilful nets His appeal for subscriptions was irresistible He had the magical gift of wringing a hundred pounds from a plutocrat with the air of conferring a graceful favour In aid of the Mission to Convert the Jews he could have fleeced a synagogue The societies and institutions in which the Colonel and Ursula Winwood were interested flourished amazingly beneath his touch The Girls Club in the Isle of Dogs long since abandoned in despair by the young Guardsman grew into a popular and sweetly mannered nunnery The Central London Home for the Indigent Blind which had been languishing for support in spite of Miss Winwood s efforts found itself now in a position to build a much needed wing There was also most wonderful and important thing of all the Young England League which was covering him with steadily increasing glory Of this much hereafter But it must be remembered Ursula complained that he left her nothing to do save attend dreary committee meetings and even for these Paul saved her all the trouble in hunting up information She was a mere figurehead Dearest lady Paul would say if you send me about my business you ll write me a character won t you saying that you re dismissing me for incorrigible efficiency You know perfectly well she would sigh that I would be a lost lone woman without you Whereat Paul would laugh his gay laugh At this period of his life he had not a care in the world The game of politics also fascinated him A year or so after he joined the Winwoods there was a General Election The Liberals desiring to drive the old Tory from his lair sent down a strong candidate to Morebury There was a fierce battle into which Paul threw himself heart and soul He discovered he could speak When he first found himself holding a couple of hundred villagers in the grip of his impassioned utterance he felt that the awakening of England had begun It was a delicious moment As a canvasser he performed prodigies of cajolery Extensive paper mills a hotbed of raging Socialism according to Colonel Winwood defaced in the Colonel s eyes the outskirts of the little town They re wrong uns to a man said the Colonel despondently Paul came back from among them with a notebook full of promises How did you manage it asked the Colonel I think I got on to the poetical side of politics said Paul What the deuce is that Paul smiled An appeal to the imagination said he When Colonel Winwood got in by an increased majority in spite of the wave of Liberalism that spread over the land he gave Paul a gold cigarette case and thenceforward admitted him into his political confidence So Paul became familiar with the Lobby of the House of Commons and with the subjects before the Committees on which Colonel Winwood sat and with the delicate arts of wire pulling and intrigue which appeared to him a monstrously fine diversion There was also the matter of Colonel Winwood s speeches which the methodical warrior wrote out laboriously beforehand and learned by heart They were sound weighty pronouncements to which the House listened with respect but they lacked the flashes which lit enthusiasm One day he threw the bundle of typescript across to Paul See what you think of that Paul saw and made daring pencilled amendments and took it to the Colonel It s all very funny said the latter tugging his drooping moustache but I can t say things like that in the House Why not asked Paul If they heard me make an epigram they would have a fit Our side wouldn t The Government might The Government ought to have fits all the time until it expires in convulsions But this is a mere dull agricultural question The Board of Agriculture have brought it in and it s such pernicious nonsense that I as a county gentleman have to speak against it But couldn t you stick in my little joke about the pigs asked Paul pleadingly What s that Colonel Winwood found the place in the script I say that the danger of swine fever arising from this clause in the Bill will affect every farmer in England And I say cried Paul eagerly pointing to his note if this clause becomes law swine fever will rage through the land like a demoniacal possession The myriad pigs of Great Britain possessed of the devils of Socialism will be turned into Gadarene swine hurtling down to destruction You can show how they hurtle like this He flickered his hands Do try it H m said Colonel Winwood Sorely against his will he tried it To his astonishment it was a success The House of Commons like mister Peter Magnus s friend is easily amused The exaggeration gave a cannon ball s weight to his sound argument The Government dropped the clause it was only a trivial part of a wide reaching measure the President of the Board of Agriculture saying gracefully that in the miracle he hoped to bring about he had unfortunately forgotten the effect it might have on the pigs There was renewed laughter but Colonel Winwood remained the hero of the half hour and received the ecstatic congratulations of unhumorous friends He might have defeated the Government altogether In the daily round of political life nothing is so remarkable as the lack of sense of proportion It was the Gadarene swine that did it they said And that said Colonel Winwood honestly was my young devil of a secretary Thenceforward the young wit and the fresh fancy of Paul played like a fountain over Colonel Winwood s speeches Look here young man said he one day I don t like it Sometimes I take your confounded suggestions because they happen to fit in but I m actually getting the reputation of a light political comedian and it won t do Whereupon Paul with his swift intuition saw that in the case of a proud earnest gentleman like Colonel Winwood the tempting emendations of typescript would not do In what Miss Winwood called his subtle Italian way he induced his patron to discuss the speeches before the process of composition These discussions involving the swift rapier play of intelligences Colonel Winwood enjoyed They stimulated him magically He sat down and wrote his speeches delightfully unconscious of what in them was Paul and what was himself and when he delivered them he was proud of the impression he had made upon the House And so as the years passed Paul gained influence not only in the little circle of Drane s Court and Portland Place but also in the outer world He was a young man of some note His name appeared occasionally in the newspapers both in connection with the Winwood charities and with the political machine of the Unionist party He was welcomed at London dinner tables and in country houses He was a young man who would go far For the rest he had learned to ride and shoot and not to make mistakes about the genealogical relationships of important families He had travelled about Europe sometimes with the Winwoods sometimes by himself He was a young man of cultivation and accomplishment On this fifth anniversary he sat gazing unseeingly at the autumn rack the Princess s letter in his hand and letting his thoughts wander down the years He marvelled how valiantly the stars in their courses had fought for him Even against recognition his life was charmed Once indeed he met at the house in Portland Place a painter to whom he had posed The painter looked at him keenly Surely we have met before We have said Paul with daring frankness I remember it gratefully But if you would forget it I should be still more grateful The painter shook hands with him and smiled You may be sure I haven t the least idea what you re talking about As for Theatreland the lower walks in the profession to which Paul had belonged do not cross the paths of high political society It lay behind him far and forgotten His position was secure Here and there an anxious mother may have been worried as to his precise antecedents but Paul was too astute to give mothers over much cause for anxiety He lived under the fascination of the Great Game When he came into his kingdom he could choose not before His destiny was drawing him nearer and nearer to it he thought with slow and irresistible force In a few years there would be Parliament office power the awaking from stupor of an England hypnotized by malign influences He saw himself at the table in the now familiar House of green benches thundering out an Empire s salvation If he thought more of the awakener than the awakening it was because he was the same little Paul Kegworthy to whom the cornelian heart had brought the Vision Splendid in the scullery of the Bludston slum The cornelian heart still lay in his waistcoat pocket at the end of his watch chain He also held a real princess s letter in his hand A tap at the door aroused him from his day dream There entered a self effacing young woman with pencil and notebook Are you ready for me sir Not quite Sit down for a minute Miss Smithers Or come up to the table if you don t mind and help me open these envelopes Paul you see was a great man who commanded the services of a shorthand typist To the mass of correspondence then opened and read he added that which he had brought in from Colonel and Miss Winwood From this he sorted the few letters which it would be necessary to answer in his own handwriting and laid them aside then taking the great bulk he planted himself on the hearthrug with his back to the fire and cigarette in mouth dictated to the self effacing young woman She took down his words with anxious humility for she looked upon him as a god sphered on Olympian heights and what socially insecure young woman of lower middle class England could do otherwise in the presence of a torturingly beautiful youth immaculately raimented who commanded in the great house with a smile more royal and debonair than that of the master thereof Member of Parliament though he was and Justice of the Peace and Lord of the Manor And Paul fresh from his retrospect looked at the girl s thin shoulders and sharp intent profile and wondered a little somewhat ironically He knew that she regarded him as a kind of god for reasons of caste Yet she was the daughter of a Morebury piano tuner of unblemished parentage for generations She had never known hunger and cold and the real sting of poverty Miss Winwood herself knew more of drunken squalor He saw himself a ragged and unwashed urchin his appalling breeches supported by one brace addressing her in familiar terms and he saw her transfigured air of lofty disgust whereupon he laughed aloud in the middle of a most unhumorous sentence much to Miss Smithers astonishment When he had finished his dictation he dismissed her and sat down to his writing After a while Miss Winwood came in The five years had treated her lightly A whitening of the hair about her brows which really enhanced the comeliness of her florid complexion a few more lines at corners of eyes and lips were the only evidences of the touch of Time s fingers As she entered Paul swung round from his writing chair and started to his feet Oh Paul I said the twentieth for the Disabled Soldiers and Sailors didn t I I made a mistake I m engaged that afternoon I don t think so dearest lady said Paul I am Then you ve told me nothing about it said Paul the infallible I know she said meekly It s all my fault I never told you I ve asked the Bishop of Frome to lunch and I can t turn him out at a quarter past two can I What date is there free Together they bent over the engagement book and after a little discussion the new date was fixed I m rather keen on dates to day said Paul pointing to the brass calendar Why It s exactly five years since I entered your dear service said Paul We ve worked you like a galley slave and so I love your saying dear service she replied gently Paul half sitting on the edge of the Cromwellian table in the bay of the window laughed I could say infinitely more dearest lady if I were to let myself go She sat on the arm of a great leathern chair Their respective attitudes signified a happy intimacy So long as you re contented my dear boy she said Contented Good heavens He waved a protesting hand You re ambitious Of course said he What would be the good of me if I wasn t One of these days you ll be wanting to leave the nest and what shall we say soar upwards Paul too acute to deny the truth of this prophecy said I probably shall But I ll be the rarissima avis to whom the abandoned nest will always be the prime object of his life s consideration Pretty said Miss Winwood It s true I m sure of it she said pleasantly Besides if you didn t leave the nest and make a name for yourself you wouldn t be able to carry on our work My brother and I you see are of the older generation you of the younger You re the youngest woman I know Paul declared I shan t be in a few years and my brother is a good deal older than I Well I can t get into Parliament right away said Paul For one thing I couldn t afford it We must find you a nice girl with plenty of money she said half in jest Oh please don t I should detest the sight of her By the way shall you want me on Saturday evening No unless it would be to take Miss Durning in to dinner Now Miss Durning being an elderly ugly heiress it pleased Miss Winwood to be quizzical He looked at her in mock reproof Dearest lady that you are I don t feel safe in your hands just now I shall dine with the Princess on Saturday An enigmatic smile flitted across Ursula Winwood s clear eyes What does she want you for To entertain an Egyptologist assured Paul He waved his hand toward the letter on the table There it is in black and white I suppose for the next few days you ll be cramming hard It would be the polite thing to do wouldn t it said Paul blandly Miss Winwood shook her head and went away and Paul happily resumed his work In very truth she was to him the dearest of ladies The Princess Zobraska was standing alone by the fireplace at the end of the long drawing room when Paul was announced on Saturday evening She was a distinguished looking woman in the late twenties brown haired fresh complexioned strongly and at the same time delicately featured Her dark blue eyes veiled by lashes smiled on him lazily as he approached and lazily too her left arm stretched out the palm of the hand downward and she did not move He kissed her knuckles in orthodox fashion It is very good of you to come mister Savelli she said in a sweetly foreign accent and leave your interesting company at Drane s Court Any company without you Princess is chaos said Paul Grand flatteur va said she C est que vous etes irresistible Princesse surlout dans ce costume la She touched his arm with an ostrich feather fan When it comes to massacring languages mister Savelli let me be the assassin I laid the tribute of my heart at your feet in the most irreproachable grammar said Paul But with the accent of John Bull That s the only thing of John Bull you have about you For the sake of my ears I must give you some lessons You ll find me such a pupil as never teacher had in the world before When shall we begin Aux Kalendes Grecques Ah que vous etes femme She put her hands to her ears Listen Que vous etes femme she said Que vous etes femme Paul repeated parrotwise Is that better A little I see the Greek Kalends have begun said he Mechant you have caught me in a trap said she And they both laughed From which entirely foolish conversation it may be gathered that between our Fortunate Youth and the Princess some genial sun had melted the icy barriers of formality He had known her for eighteen months ever since she had bought Chetwood Park and settled down as the great personage of the countryside He had met her many times both in London and in Morebury he had dined in state at her house he had shot her partridges he had danced with her he had sat out dances with her notably on one recent June night in a London garden where they lost themselves for an hour in the discussion of the relative parts that love played in a woman s life and in a man s The Princess was French ancien regime of the blood of the Coligny and she had married in the French practical way the Prince Zobraska in whose career the only satisfactory incident history has to relate is the mere fact of his early demise The details are less exhilarating The poor little Princess happily widowed at one and twenty had shivered the idea of love out of her system for some years Then as is the way of woman she regained her curiosities Great lady of enormous fortune she could have satisfied them had she so chosen with the large cynicism of a Catherine of Russia She could also had she so chosen have married one of a hundred sighing and decorous gentlemen but with none of them had she fallen ever so little in love and without love she determined to try no more experiments her determination however did not involve surrender of interest in the subject Hence the notable discussion on the June night Hence perhaps after a few other meetings of a formal character the prettily intimate invitation she had sent to Paul They were still laughing at the turn of the foolish conversation when the other guests began to enter the drawing room First came Edward Doon the Egyptologist a good looking man of forty having the air of a spruce don with a pretty young wife Lady Angela Doon then Count Lavretsky of the Russian Embassy and Countess Lavretsky Lord Bantry a young Irish peer with literary ambitions and a Mademoiselle de Cressy a convent intimate of the Princess and her paid companion completed the small party Dinner was served at a round table and Paul found himself between Lady Angela Doon whom he took in and the Countess Lavretsky Talk was general and amusing As Doon did not make and apparently did not expect anyone to make any reference to King Qa or Amenhotep or Rameses names vaguely floating in Paul s brain but talked in a sprightly way about the French stage and the beauty of Norwegian fiords Paul perceived that the Princess s alleged reason for her invitation was but a shallow pretext Doon did not need any entertainment at all Lady Angela however spoke of her dismay at the prospect of another winter in the desert and drew a graphic little sketch of the personal discomforts to which Egyptologists were subjected I always thought Egyptologists and suchlike learned folk were stuffy and snuffy with goggles and ragged old beards laughed Paul Your husband is a revelation Yes he s quite human isn t he she said with an affectionate glance across the table He s dead keen on his work but he realizes as many of his stuffy and snuffy confreres don t that there s a jolly vibrating fascinating modern world in which one lives I m glad to hear you say that about the modern world said Paul What is Lady Angela saying about the modern world asked the Princess separated from Paul s partner only by Count Lavretsky Singing paeans in praise of it said Paul What is there in it so much to rejoice at asked the diplomatist in a harsh voice He was a man prematurely old and looked at the world from beneath heavy lizard like eyelids Not only is it the best world we ve got but it s the best world we ve ever had cried Paul I don t know any historical world which would equal the modern and as for the prehistoric well Professor Doon can tell us As a sphere of amenable existence said Doon with a smile give me Chetwood Park and Piccadilly That is mere hedonism said Count Lavretsky You happen like us all here to command the creature comforts of modern wealthy conditions which I grant are exceedingly superior to those commanded by the great Emperors of ancient times But we are in a small minority And even if we were not is that all We have a finer appreciation of our individualities said the Princess We lead a wider intellectual life We are in instant touch practically with the thought of the habitable globe And with the emotive force of mankind said Paul What is that asked Lady Angela Why Paul after the first glance of courtesy at the speaker should exchange a quick glance with the Princess would be difficult to say It was instinctive as instinctive as the reciprocal flash of mutual understanding I think I know but tell us she said Paul challenged defined it as the swift wave of sympathy that surged over the earth A famine in India a devastating earthquake in Mexico a bid for freedom on the part of an oppressed population a deed of heroism at sea each was felt within practically a few moments emotionally in an English French or German village Our hearts were throbbing continuously at the end of telegraph wires And you call that pleasure asked Count Lavretsky It isn t hedonism at any rate said Paul I call it life said the Princess Don t you she turned to Doon I think what mister Savelli calls the emotive force of mankind helps to balance our own personal emotions said he Or isn t it rather a wear and tear on the nervous system laughed his wife It seems so to me said Count Lavretsky Perhaps being a Russian I am more primitive and envy a nobleman of the time of Pharaoh who never heard of devastations in Mexico did not feel his heart called upon to pulsate at anything beyond his own concerns But he in his wisdom at his little world was vanity and was depressed We moderns with our infinitely bigger world and our infinitely greater knowledge have no more wisdom than the Egyptian and we see that the world is all the more vanity and are all the more overwhelmed with despair But said Paul But cried the Princess Both laughed and paused Paul bowed with a slight gesture I am not overwhelmed with despair the Princess continued Neither am I said Paul I am keeping my end up wonderfully said Lady Angela I am in a nest of optimists Count Lavretsky groaned But was it not you Lady Angela who talked of wear and tear That was only to contradict my husband What is all this about asked the Countess Lavretsky who had been discussing opera with Lord Bantry and Mademoiselle de Cressy Doon scientifically crystallized the argument It held the octette while men servants in powder and gold laced livery offered poires Zobraska a subtle creation of the chef Lord Bantry envied the contemplative calm which unexciting circumstances allowed the literary ancient Mademoiselle de Cressy advanced the feminist view in favour of the modern world The talk became the light and dancing interplay of opinion and paradox common to thousands of twentieth century dinner tables All the same said Count Lavretsky they wear you out these emotive forces Nobody is young nowadays Youth is a lost art On the contrary cried Mademoiselle de Cressy in French Everybody is young to day This pulsation of the heart keeps you young It is the day of the young woman of forty five Count Lavretsky who was fifty nine twirled a grey moustache I am one of the few people in the world who do not regret their youth I do not regret mine with its immaturity its follies and subsequent headaches I would sooner be the scornful philosopher of sixty than the credulous lover of twenty He always talks like that said the Countess to Paul but when he met me first he was thirty five and she laughed and now voila for him there is no difference between twenty and sixty Expliquez moi ca It s very simple declared Paul In this century the thirties forties and fifties don t exist You re either twenty or sixty I hope I shall always be twenty said the Princess lightly Do you find your youth so precious then asked Count Lavretsky More than I ever did She laughed and again met Paul s eyes This time she flushed faintly as she held them for a fraction of a second He had time to catch a veiled soft gleam intimate and disquieting For some time he did not look again in her direction when he did he met in her eyes only the lazy smile with which she regarded all and sundry Later in the evening she said to him I m glad you opposed Lavretsky He makes me shiver He was born old and wrinkled He has never had a thrill in his life And if you don t have thrills when you re young you can t expect to have them when you re old said Paul He would ask what was the good of thrills You don t expect me to answer Princess We know because we re young They stood laughing in the joy of their full youth a splendid couple some distance away from the others ostensibly inspecting a luminous little Cima on the wall The Princess loved it as the bright jewel of her collection and Paul with his sense of beauty and knowledge of art loved it too Yet instead of talking of the picture they talked of Lavretsky who was looking at them sardonically from beneath his heavy eyelids CHAPTER XII A FEW days afterwards you might have seen Paul dashing through the quiet main street of Morebury in a high dog cart on his way to call on the Princess A less Fortunate Youth might have had to walk risking boots impolitely muddy or to hire a funereal cab from the local job master but Paul had only to give an order and the cart and showy chestnut were brought round to the front door of Drane s Court He loved to drive the showy chestnut whose manifold depravities were the terror of Miss Winwood s life Why didn t he take the cob It was so much safer Whereupon he would reply gaily that in the first place he found no amusement in driving woolly lambs and in the second that if he did not take some of the devil out of the chestnut it would become the flaming terror of the countryside So Paul spruce in hard felt hat and box cloth overcoat clattered joyously through the Morebury streets returning the salutations of the little notabilities of the town with the air of the owner not only of horse and cart but of half the hearts in the place He was proud of his popularity and it scarcely entered his head that he was not the proprietor of his equipage Besides he was going to call on the Princess He hoped that she would be alone not that he had anything particular to say to her or had any defined idea of love making but he was eight and twenty an age at which desire has not yet failed and there is not the sign of a burdensome grasshopper anywhere about But the Princess was not alone He found Mademoiselle de Cressy in charge of the tea table and the conversation Like many Frenchwomen she had a high pitched voice she also had definite opinions on matter of fact subjects Now when you have come to talk gossamer with an attractive and sympathetic woman it is irritating to have to discuss Tariff Reform and the position of the working classes in Germany with somebody else especially when the attractive and pretty woman does not give you in any way to understand that she would prefer gossamer to such arid topics The Princess was as gracious as you please She made him feel that he was welcome in her cosy boudoir but there was no further exchange of mutually understanding glances If a great lady entertaining a penniless young man can be demure then demure was the Princess Sophie Zobraska Paul who prided himself on his knowledge of feminine subtlety was at fault but who was he to appreciate the repressive influence of a practical minded convent friend quickly formative and loudly assertive of opinions on an impressionable lady awakening to curiosities He was just a dunderhead like any one of us just as much as the most eminent feminine psychologist alive which is saying a good deal So he drove away disappointed the sobriety of the chestnut s return trot through Morebury contrasting oddly with the dashing clatter of the former journey It was some time before he met the Princess again for an autumn session of Parliament required migration to Portland Place The Princess indeed came to London shortly afterwards to her great house in Berkeley Square but it was not till late November that he was fortunate enough to see her Then it was only a kiss of the hand and a hurried remark or two at a large dinner party at the Winwoods You see there are such forces as rank and precedence at London dinner parties to which even princesses and fortunate youths have to yield On this occasion as he bent over her hand he murmured May I say how beautiful you are to night Princess She wore a costume of silver and deep blue and the blue intensified the blue depths of her eyes I am delighted to please monsieur she said in French And that was their meeting On parting she said again in French When are you coming to see me fickle one Whenever you ask me I have called in vain You have a card for my reception next Tuesday I have replied that I do myself the honour of accepting the Princess s gracious invitation I don t like London do you she asked allowing a touch of wistfulness to inflect her voice It has its charms A row on the Serpentine for instance or a bicycle ride in Battersea Park How lovely it would be she said between laugh and sigh if only it could be kept out of the newspapers I see it from here under the Fashionable Intelligence The beautiful Princess Zobraska was observed in a boat on the ornamental water in Regent s Park with the well known tiens what are you politician say with the well known young politician mister Paul Savelli Quel scandale hein I must content myself with kissing your finger tips at your reception said Paul She smiled We will find a means she said At her reception an assemblage glittering with the diamonds and orders of the great ones of the earth she found only time to say Come to morrow at five I shall be alone Darkness descended on Paul as he replied Impossible Princess Colonel Winwood wants me at the House The next morning greatly daring he rang her up for a telephone stood on the Fortunate Youth s table in his private sitting room in Portland Place It is I Princess Paul Savelli What have you to say for yourself Paul Savelli I am at your feet Why can t you come to day He explained But tell Colonel Winwood that I want you the voice was imperious Would that be wise Princess Wise Yes Don t you see He waited for an answer There was blank electric current whirring faintly on his ear He thought she had rung off rung off not only this conversation but all converse in the future At last after the waiting of despair came the voice curiously meek Can you come Friday With joy and delight The words gushed out tempestuously Good At five o clock And leave your John Bull wisdom on the doorstep S

none	none	abruptly and Paul stood ruminating puzzlewise on the audacious behest On Friday he presented himself at her house in Berkeley Square He found her gracious but ironical in attitude very much on the defensive She received him in the Empire drawing room very stiff and stately in its appointments It had the charm and the intrinsic value of a museum it was as cosy as a room under present arrangements at Versailles The great wood fire alone redeemed it from artistic bleakness Tea was brought in by portentous powdered footmen in scarlet and gold She was very much the princess the princess in her state apartments a different personage from the pretty woman in a boudoir Paul sensitive as far as it is given man to be saw that if he had obeyed her and left his John Bull wisdom on the doorstep he would have regretted it Obviously she was punishing him perhaps herself perhaps both of them She kept a wary appraising eye on him as they talked their commonplaces Paul s attitude had the correctness of a young diplomatist paying a first formal call It was only when he rose to go that her glance softened She laughed a queer little laugh I hear that you are going to address a meeting in the North of London next week That is so said Paul but how can my unimportant engagements have come to the ears of Your Highness I read my newspapers like everybody else Did you not know that there were announcements Paul laughed I put them in myself You see he explained we want our Young England League to be as widely known as possible The more lambs we can get into the fold the better Perhaps if you asked me very prettily she said I might come and hear you speak Princess His olive cheek flushed with pleasure and his eyes sparkled It would be an undreamed of honour It is such things that angels do Eh bien je viendrai You ought to speak well Couldn t you persuade them to give the place a better name Hickney Heath It hurts the roof of one s mouth Tiens would it help the Young England League if you announced my name in the newspapers Dear Princess you overwhelm me But Now don t ask me if it is wise She smiled in mockery You print the names of other people who are supporting you mister John Felton M P who will take the chair Colonel Winwood M P and Miss Winwood the Dean of Halifax and Lady Harbury et cetera et cetera Why not poor Princess Sophie Zobraska You have a good memory Princess She regarded him lazily Sometimes When does the meeting begin At eight Oh I forget His face fell How can you manage it You ll have to dine at an unearthly hour What does it matter even if one doesn t dine in a good cause You are everything that is perfect said Paul fervently She dismissed a blissful youth The Princess Zobraska cared as much for the Young England League as for an Anti Nose Ring Society in Central Africa Would it help the Young England League indeed He laughed aloud on the lamp lit pavement of decorous Berkeley Square For what other man in the world would she dine at six and spend the evening in a stuffy hall in North London He felt fired to great achievement He would make her proud of him his Princess his own beautiful stately royal Princess The dream had come true He loved a Princess and she If she cared naught for him why was she cheerfully contemplating a six o clock dinner And why did she do a thousand other things which crowded on his memory Was he loved The thought thrilled him Here was no beautiful seductress of suspect title such as he had heard of during his sojourn in the Gotha Almanack world but the lineal descendant of a princely house the widow of a genuinely royal though deboshed personage Perhaps you may say that the hero of a fairy tale never thinks of the mere rank of his beloved princess If you do you are committing all sorts of fallacies in your premises For one thing who said that Paul was a hero For another who said this was a fairy tale For yet another I am not so sure that the swineherd is not impressed by the rank of his beloved You must remember the insistent lifelong dream of the ragged urchin You must also reflect that the heart of any high born youth in the land might well have been fluttered by signs of peculiar favour from Princess Sophie Zobraska Why then should Paul be blamed for walking on air instead of greasy pavement on the way from Berkeley Square to Portland Place Moreover as sanity returned to him his quick sense recognized in his Princess s offer to support him a lovely indiscretion Foreign ladies of high position must be chary of their public appearances Between the row boat on the Serpentine and the platform in the drill hall Hickney Heath the difference was but one of degree And for him alone was this indiscretion about to be committed His exultation was tempered by tender solicitude At dinner that evening he was dining alone with the Winwoods he said I ve persuaded the Princess to come to our meeting on Friday Isn t it good of her Very good replied Colonel Winwood But what interest can she take in the lower walks of English politics It isn t English politics said Paul It s world politics The Princess is an aristocrat and is tremendously keen on the Conservative principle She thinks our scheme for keeping the youth of the nation free from the taint of Socialism is magnificent H m said the Colonel And I thought Miss Winwood would be pleased if I inveigled Her Highness on to the platform said Paul Why of course it s a good thing assented the Colonel But how the deuce did you get her Yes how asked Miss Winwood with a smile in her straight blue eyes How does one get anything one wants in this world said Paul except by going at it hammer and tongs A little later when Paul opened the dining room for her to pass out she touched his shoulder affectionately and laughed Hammer and tongs to Sophie Zobraska Oh Paul aren t you a bit of a humbug Perhaps he was But he was ingenuous in his desire to shield his Princess s action from vain conjecture It were better that he should be supposed in vulgar phrase to have roped her in as he had roped in a hundred other celebrities in his time For there the matter ended On the other hand if he proclaimed the lady s spontaneous offer it might be subjected to heaven knew how many interpretations Paul owed much of his success in the world to such instinctive delicacies He worked far into the night composing his speech on England s greatness to the beautiful eyes of his French Princess The Young England League was his pet political interest It had been inaugurated some years before he joined the Winwoods Its objects were the training of the youth the future electorate of England in the doctrines of Imperialism Constitutionalism and sound civicism as understood by the intellectual Conservatives Its mechanical aims were to establish lodges throughout the country Every town and rural district should have its lodge in connection wherewith should be not only addresses on political and social subjects but also football and cricket clubs entertainments for both sexes such as dances whist drives excursions of archaeological and educational interest and lantern and later cinematographic lectures on the wide aspects of Imperial Britain Its appeal was to the young the recruit in the battle of life who in a year or two would qualify for a vote and except for blind passion and prejudice not know what the deuce to do with it The octogenarian Earl of Watford was President Colonel Winwood was one of a long list of Vice Presidents Miss Winwood was on the Council a General Hankin a fussy incompetent person past his prime was Honorary Secretary Paul worked with his employers for a year on the League thinking little of its effectiveness One day when they spoke despairingly of progress he said not in so many words but in effect Don t you see what s wrong This thing is run for young people and you ve got old fossils like Lord Watford and General Hankin running it Let me be Assistant Secretary to Hankin and I ll make things hum And thinking the words of the youth were wise they used their influence with the Council and Paul became Assistant Secretary and after a year or two things began to hum so disconcertingly that General Hankin resigned in order to take the Presidency of the Wellingtonian Defence Association and almost automatically Paul slipped into his place With the instinct of the man of affairs he persuaded the Council to change his title An Honorary Secretary is but a dilettante an amateur carrying no weight whereas an Organizing Secretary is a devil of a fellow professedly dynamic So Paul became Organizing Secretary of the Young England League and made things hum all the louder He put fresh life into local Committees and local Secretaries by a paternal interest in their doings making them feel the pulsations of the throbbing heart of headquarters If a local lodge was in need of speakers he exercised his arts of persuasion and sent them down in trainloads He visited personally as many lodges as his other work permitted In fact he was raising the League from a jejune experiment into a flourishing organization To his secret delight old Lord Watford resigned the chairmanship owing to the infirmities of old age and Lord Harbury a young and energetic peer whom Paul had recently driven into the ranks of the Vice Presidents was elected in his stead Paul felt the future of the League was assured With a real Member of Parliament to preside a real dean to propose the vote of thanks another Member of Parliament and two ex mayors of the borough to add silent dignity to the proceedings well known ladies including now a real Princess to grace the assembly this meeting of the Hickney Heath Lodge was the most important occasion on which Paul had appeared in public I hope you won t be nervous said Miss Winwood on the morning of the meeting I nervous He laughed What is there to be nervous about I ve had over twenty years experience of public speaking and I m always nervous when I get UP It s only because you persistently refuse to realize what a wonderful woman you are he said affectionately And you she teased are you always realizing what a wonderful man you are He cried with his sunny boldness Why not It s faith in oneself and one s destiny that gets things done The drill hall was full Party feeling ran high in those days at Hickney Heath for a Liberal had ousted a Unionist from a safe seat at the last General Election and the stalwarts of the defeated party thirsting for revenge supported the new movement If a child was not born a Conservative he should be made one That was the watchword of the League They were also prepared to welcome the new star that had arisen to guide the younger generation out of the darkness When therefore the Chairman mister John Felton M P who had held minor office in the last administration had concluded his opening remarks having sketched briefly the history of the League and introduced mister Paul Savelli in the usual eulogistic terms as their irresistible Organizing Secretary and Paul in his radiant young manhood sprang up before them the audience greeted him with enthusiastic applause They had expected as an audience does expect in an unknown speaker any one of the usual types of ordinary looking politicians perhaps bald perhaps grey headed perhaps pink and fat it did not matter but they did not expect the magnetic personality of this young man of astonishing beauty with his perfect features wavy black hair athletic build and laughing eyes who seemed the embodiment of youth and joy and purpose and victory Before he spoke a word he knew that he had them under his control and he felt the great thrill of it Physically he had the consciousness of a blaze of light of a bare barn of an ungalleried place of thickly set row upon row of faces and a vast confused flutter of beating hands The applause subsided He turned with his mister Chairman Your Highness Ladies and Gentlemen to the circle behind him caught Miss Winwood his dearest lady s smile caught and held for a hundredth part of a second the deep blue eyes of the Princess she wore a great hat with a grey feather and a chinchilla coat thrown open and looked the incarnation of all the beauty and all the desires of all his dreams and with a flash of gladness faced the audience and plunged into his speech It began with a denunciation of the Little Englander At that period one heard perhaps more of the Little Englander than one does nowadays which to some people s way of thinking is a pity The Little Englander according to Paul was a purblind creature with political vision ice bound by the economic condition of the labouring classes in Great Britain The Little Englander had no sense of patriotism The Little Englander had no sense of Empire He had no sense of India Australia Canada He had no sense of foreign nations jealousy of England s secular supremacy He had a distinct idea however of three nationalities those of Ireland Scotland and Wales The inhabitants of those three small nations took peculiar pains to hammer that idea into his head But of England he had no conception save as a mere geographical expression a little bit of red on a map of Europe a vague place where certain sections of the population clamoured for much pay and little work His dream was a parochial Utopia where the Irish peasant the Welsh farmer and the Scottish crofter should live in luxury and when these were satisfied the English operative should live in moderate comfort The Little Englander in his insensate altruism dreamed of these three nations entirely independent of England except in the trivial matter of financial support He wanted Australia Canada South Africa to sever their links from him and take up with America Germany Switzerland anybody so long as they did not interfere with his gigantic scheme for providing tramps in Cromarty with motor cars and dissolute Welsh shepherds with champagne As for India why not give it up to a benign native government which would depend upon the notorious brotherly love between Hindoo and Mussulman If Russia foolish unawakened Russia took possession of it what would it matter to the miner of Merthyr Tydvil As for England provided such a country existed she would be perfectly happy The rich would provide for the poor and what did anyone want further Paul took up the Little Englander in his arms and tossed him in the air threw him on the ground and jumped upon him He cast his mutilated fragments with rare picturesqueness upon a Guy Fawkes bonfire The audience applauded vociferously He waited with a gay smile for silence scanning them closely for the first time and suddenly the smile faded from his face In the very centre of the third row sat two people who did not applaud They were Barney Bill and Jane He looked at them fascinated There could be no mistake Barney Bill s cropped shoe brush hair was white as the driven snow but the wry bright eyed face was unchanged And Jane quietly and decently dressed her calm eyes fixed on him was Jane These two curiously detached themselves against the human background It was only the sudden stillness of the exhausted applause that brought him to consciousness of his environment that and a heaven sent fellow at the back of the audience who shouted Go on sonny Whereupon he plucked himself together with a swift toss of the head and laughed his gay laugh Of course I m going on if you will let me This is only the beginning of what I ve got to tell you of the Englishman who fouls the nest of England who fouls the nest of all that matters in the future history of mankind There was more applause It was the orator s appeal to the mass It set Paul back into the stream of his argument He forgot Barney Bill and Jane and went on with his speech pointedly addressing the young telling them what England was what England is what Englishmen if they are true to England shall be It was for the young those who came fresh to life with the glories of England fresh in their memories from Crecy to the Armada from the Armada to Waterloo to keep the banner of England flying over their topmost roofs It was a fighting enthusiastic hyperbolic speech glowing as did the young face of the speaker with the divine fire of youth It ended triumphantly He sat down to an ovation Smiles and handshakes and words of praise surrounded him on the platform Miss Winwood pressed his hand and said Well done The Princess regarded him with flushed cheeks and starry eyes It was only when silence fell on the opening words of the Dean of Halifax that he searched the rows in front for Barney Bill and Jane They were still there Impulsively he scribbled a few lines on a scrap of paper torn from his rough notes I must see you Wait outside the side entrance for me after the meeting is over Love to you both Paul A glance round showed him an attendant of the hall lurking at the back of the platform He slipped quietly from his seat by the Chairman s side and gave the man the paper with directions as to its destination Then he returned Just before the Dean ended he saw the note delivered Jane read it whispered its contents to Bill and seemed to nod acquiescence It was fitting that these two dear ghosts of the past should appear for the first time in his hour of triumph He longed to have speech with them The Dean of Halifax was brief the concluding ceremonies briefer The audience gave Paul a parting cheer and dispersed while Paul the hero of the evening received the congratulations of his friends Those are things that needed saying but we re too cautious to say them remarked the Chairman We ve got to be said Colonel Winwood The glory of irresponsibility smiled the Dean You don t often get this kind of audience Paul answered with a laugh A political infants school One has to treat things in broad splashes You almost persuade me to be an Englishwoman said the Princess Paul bowed But what more beautiful thing can there be than a Frenchwoman with England in her heart Je ne demande pas mieux And the Princess did not put her hands to her ears The group passed slowly from the platform through a sort of committee room at the back and reached the side entrance Here they lingered exchanging farewells The light streamed dimly through the door on the strip of pavement between two hedges of spectators and on the panelling and brass work of an automobile by the curb A chauffeur with rug on arm stepped forward and touched his cap as the Princess appeared and opened the door of the car Paul bare headed accompanied her across the pavement Half way she stopped for a second to adjust a slipping fur He aided her quickly and received a bright smile of thanks She entered the car held out her hand for his kiss Come and see me soon I ll write or telephone The car rolled away The Winwoods carriage drove up It was a fighting enthusiastic hyperbolic speech glowing with the divine fire of youth Can we give you a lift home Paul asked Miss Winwood No thanks dearest lady There are one or two little things I must do before I go Good night Good night Paul said Colonel Winwood shaking hands A thundering good speech CHAPTER XIII PAUL looked from side to side at the palely lit faces of the spectators trying to distinguish Barney Bill and Jane But he did not see them He was disappointed and depressed seized with a curious yearning for his own people Vehicle after vehicle drew up and carried away the remainder of the platform group and Paul was left in the doorway with the President and Honorary Secretary of the local lodge The little crowd began to melt away Suddenly his heart leaped and after a hasty good night to the two officials he sprang forward and to their astonishment gripped the hand of a bent and wizened old man Barney Bill This is good Where is Jane Close by said Bill The President and Honorary Secretary waved farewells and marched away Out of the gloom came Jane somewhat shyly He took both her hands and looked upon her and laughed My dear Jane What ages since we lost each other Seven years mister Savelli mister Savelli Rubbish Paul Begging your pardon said Barney Bill but I ve got a pal ere what I ve knowed long before you was born and he d like to tell yer how he enjoyed your speech A tall man lean and bearded and apparently very well dressed came forward This is my old pal Silas Finn said Bill Delighted to meet you mister Finn said Paul shaking hands I too said the man gravely Silas Finn s a Councillor of the Borough said Bill proudly You should have been on the platform said Paul I attended in my private capacity replied mister Finn He effaced himself Paul found himself laughing into Barney Bill s twinkling eyes Dear old Bill he cried clapping his old friend on the shoulder How are things going How s the caravan I ve looked out for it on so many country roads I m thinking of retiring said Bill I can only do a few summer months now and things isn t what they was And Jane He turned to her I m mister Finn s secretary Oh said Paul mister Finn then was an important person The drill hall attendant shut the door and save for the street lamps they were in gloom There was an embarrassed little silence Paul broke it by saying We must exchange addresses and fix up a meeting for a nice long talk If you would like to have a talk with your old friends now my house is at your disposal said mister Finn in a soft melancholy voice It is not far from here That s very kind of you but I couldn t trespass on your hospitality Gor bless you exclaimed Barney Bill Nothing of the kind Didn t I tell yer I ve knowed him since we was lads together And Jane lives there Paul laughed In that case You ll be most welcome said mister Finn This way He went ahead with Barney Bill whose queer side limp awoke poignant memories of the Bludston brickfield Paul followed with Jane And what have you been doing he asked Typewriting Then Bill came across mister Finn whom he hadn t seen for years and got me the position of secretary Otherwise I ve been doing nothing particular If you knew what a hunt I had years ago to find you he said and began to explain the set of foolish circumstances when they turned the corner of the drill hall and found a four wheeled cab waiting I had already engaged it for my friends and myself mister Finn explained Will you get in Jane and Paul and mister Finn entered the cab Barney Bill who liked air and for whom the raw November night was filled apparently with balmy zephyrs clambered in his crablike way next the driver They started What induced you to come to night Paul asked We saw the announcement in the newspapers replied Jane Barney Bill said the mister Paul Savelli could be no one else but you I said it couldn t Why he asked sharply There are heaps of people of the same name But you didn t think I was equal to it She laughed a short laugh That s just how you used to talk You haven t changed much I hope I haven t replied Paul earnestly And I don t think you ve changed either Very little has happened to change me said Jane The cab lumbered on through dull dimly lit residential roads Only by the swinging gleam of an occasional street lamp could Paul distinguish the faces of his companions I hope you re on our side mister Finn he said politely to his host who sat on the small back seat I don t disagree with much that you said to night But you are on the side of wealth and aristocracy I am on the side of the downtrodden and oppressed But so am I cried Paul The work of every day of my life tends to help them You re a Conservative and I m a Radical What do labels matter We re both attacking the same problem only from different angles Very likely mister Savelli but you ll pardon me if according to my political creed I regard your angle as an obtuse one Paul wondered greatly who he could be this grave intelligent friend of Barney Bill s who spoke with such dignity and courtesy In his speech was a trace of rough accent but his words were chosen with precision You think we glance off whereas your attack is more direct laughed Paul That is so I hope you don t mind my saying it You were the challenger I was But anyhow we re not going to be enemies God forbid said mister Finn Presently the cab stopped before a fairly large detached house standing back from the road A name which Paul could not decipher was painted on the top bar of the gate They trooped through and up some steps to the front door which mister Finn opened with his latchkey The first impression that Paul had on entering a wide vestibule was a blaze of gilt frames containing masses of bright fresh paint A parlour maid appeared and helped with hats and coats We are having a very simple supper mister Savelli Will you join us said mister Finn With the greatest pleasure said Paul The host threw open the dining room door on the right Jane and Paul entered were alone for a few moments during which Paul heard Barney Bill say in a hoarse whisper Let me have my hunk of bread and beef in the kitchen Silas You know as how I hates a fork and I likes to eat in my shirt sleeves Paul seized Jane by the arms and regarded her luminously He murmured Did you hear The dear old chap She raised clear calm eyes Aren t you shocked He shook her What do you take me for Jane was rebellious For what girls in my position generally call a toff You You re horrid said Paul The word s horrid not me You re away up above us Us seems to be very prosperous anyhow said Paul looking round him Jane watched him jealously and saw his face change The dining room spaciously proportioned was like the vestibule a mass of gilt frames and staring paint Not an inch of wall above the oak dado was visible Crude landscapes wooden portraits sea studies with waves of corrugated iron subject pictures of childishly sentimental appeal blinded the eyes It looked as if a kindergarten had been the selecting committee for an exhibition of the Royal Academy It looked also as if the kindergarten had replaced the hanging committee also It was a conglomerate massacre It was pictorial anarchy It was individualism baresark amok crazily frantic And an execrably vile nerve destroying individualism at that Paul released Jane who kept cool defiant eyes on him What do you think of it He smiled A bit disconcerting The whole house is like this It s so new said Paul He looked about him again The long table was plainly laid for three at the far end The fare consisted of a joint of cold beef a cold tart suggestive of apple a bit of Cheshire cheese and celery in a glass vase Of table decoration of any kind there was no sign A great walnut monstrosity meagrely equipped performed the functions of a sideboard The chairs ten straight backed and two easy by the fireplace of which one was armless were upholstered in saddlebag yellow and green In the bay of the red curtained window was a huge terra cotta bust of an ivy crowned and inane Austrian female There was a great fireplace in which a huge fire blazed cheerily and on the broad deep hearth stood little coloured plaster figures of stags of gnomes of rabbits one ear dropping the other ear cocked of galloping hounds unknown to the fancy scenting and pursuing an invisible foe She watched him as he scanned the room Who is mister Finn he asked in a low voice Many years ago he was Finn s Fried Fish Now he s Fish Palaces Limited They re all over London You can t help seeing them even from a motor car I ve seen them said Paul The argument outside the door having ended in a victory for the host he entered the room pushing Barney Bill gently in front of him For the first time Paul saw him in the full light He beheld a man sharply featured with hair and beard once raven black irregularly streaked with white there seemed to be no intermediary shades of grey and deep melancholy eyes There hung about him the atmosphere of infinite sorrowful patience that might mark a Polish patriot As the runner of a successful fried fish concern he was an incongruity As well thought Paul picture the late Cardinal Newman sharpening knife on steel outside a butcher s shop and crying buy buy in lusty invitation Then Paul noticed that he was oddly apparelled He wore the black frock coat suit of a Methodist preacher at the same time as the rainbow tie diamond tie pin heavy gold watch chain diamond ring and natty spats of a professional bookmaker The latter oddities however did not detract from the quiet mournful dignity of his face and manner Paul felt himself in the presence of an original personality The maid came in and laid a fourth place mister Finn waved Paul to a seat on his right Barney Bill to one next Paul Jane sat on his left I will ask a blessing said mister Finn He asked one for two minutes in the old fashioned Evangelical way bringing his guest into his address to the Almighty with an almost pathetic courtesy I am afraid mister Savelli said he when he sat down and began to carve the beef I have neither wine nor spirits to offer you I am a strict teetotaller and so is Miss Seddon But as I knew my old friend Simmons would be unhappy without his accustomed glass of beer That s me said Barney Bill nudging Paul with his elbow Simmons You never knowed that afore did yer Beg pardon guv nor for interrupting Well there s a jug of beer and that is all at this hour except water that I can put before you Paul declared that beer was delicious and peculiarly acceptable after public speaking and demonstrated his appreciation by draining the glass which the maid poured out You wanted that badly sonny said Barney Bill The next thing to drinking oneself is to see another chap what enjoys swallering it Bill said Jane reprovingly Barney Bill cocked his white poll across the table with the perkiness of a quaint bird Paul saw that the years had brought a striation of tiny red filaments to his weather beaten face and fixed her with his little glittering eyes Bill what You think I m urting his feelings He jerked a thumb towards his host I ain t He thinks good drink s bad because bad has come of it to him not that he ever took a drop too much mind yer but bad has come of it to him and I think good drink s good because nothing but good has come of it to me And we ve agreed to differ Ain t we Silas If every man were as moderate as you and I am sure as mister Savelli I should have nothing to say against it Why should I But the working man unhappily is not moderate I see said Paul You preach or advocate I think you preach total abstinence and so feel it your duty to abstain yourself That is so said mister Finn helping himself to mustard I don t wish to bore you with my concerns but I m a fairly large employer of labour Now I have found that by employing only pledged abstainers I get extraordinary results I exact a very high rate of insurance towards a fund I need not go into details to which I myself contribute a percentage a far higher rate than would be possible if they spent their earnings on drink I invest the whole lot in my business their stoppages from wages and my contributions I guarantee them three per cent I give them actually the dividends that accrue to the holders of ordinary stock in my company They also have the general advantages of insurance sickness burial maternity and so forth that they would get from an ordinary benefit society But that s enormous cried Paul with keen interest On the face of it it seems impossible It seems entirely uneconomic company operative trading is one thing private insurance another But how can you combine the two The whole secret lies in the marvellously increased efficiency of the employee He developed his point Paul listened attentively But said he when his host concluded isn t it rather risky Supposing for the sake of argument your business failed mister Finn held up the lean brown hand on which the diamond sparkled My business cannot fail Paul started The assertion had a strange solemnity Without impertinence said he why can t it fail Because God is guiding it said Silas Finn The fanatic spoke Paul regarded him with renewed interest The black hair streaked with white banging over the temples on the side away from the parting the queerly streaked beard the clear cut ascetic features the deep mournful eyes in whose depths glowed a soul on fire gave him the appearance of a mad but sanctified apostle Barney Bill who profoundly distrusted all professional drinkers of water such as mister Finn s employees ate his cold beef silently in the happy surmise that no one was paying the least attention to his misperformances with knife fork and fingers Jane looked steadily from Paul to Silas and from Silas to Paul Paul said How do you know God is guiding it At the back of his mind was an impulse of mirth there was a touch of humorous blasphemy in the conception of the Almighty as managing director of Fish Palaces Limited but the nominal earthly managing director saw not the slightest humour in the proposition Who is guiding you in your brilliant career he asked Paul threw out his hands in the once practised and now natural foreign gesture I m not an atheist Of course I believe in God and I thank Him for all His mercies Yes yes said his host That I shouldn t question But a successful man s thanks to God are most often merely conventional Don t think I wish to be offensive I only want to get at the root of things You are a young man eight and twenty How do you know that laughed Paul Oh your friends have told me You are young You have a brilliant position You have a brilliant future Were you born to it There was Jane on the opposite side of the table entirely uninterested in her food looking at him in her calm clear way She was so wholesome so sane in her young yet mature English lower class beauty She had broad brows Her mass of dark brown hair was rather too flawlessly arranged He felt a second s irritation at not catching any playfully straying strand She was still the Jane of his boyhood but a Jane developed a Jane from whom no secrets were hid a searching questioning and quietly disturbing Jane A man is born to his destiny whatever destiny may be said Paul That is Mohammedan fatalism said mister Finn unless one means by destiny the guiding hand of the Almighty Do you believe that you re under the peculiar care of God Do you mister Finn I have said so I ask you Do you In a general way yes said Paul In your particular sense no You question me frankly and I answer frankly You would not like me to answer otherwise Certainly not said his host Then Paul continued with a smile I must say that from my childhood I have been fired with a curious certainty that I would succeed in life Chance has helped me How far a divine hand has been specially responsible it isn t for me to conjecture But I know that if I hadn t believed in myself I shouldn t have had my small measure of success You believe in yourself Yes And I believe in making others believe in me That is strange very strange mister Finn fixed him with his deep sorrowful eyes You believe that you re predestined to a great position You believe that you have in you all that is needful to attain it That has carried you through Strange He put his hand to his temple elbow on table and still regarded Paul But there s God behind it all mister Savelli he said earnestly after a slight pause you are twenty eight I am fifty eight so I m more than old enough to be your father You ll forgive my taking up the attitude of the older man I have lived a life such as your friends on the platform to night honorable clean sweet people I ve nothing to say against them have no conception I am English of course London born My father was an Englishman but my mother was a Sicilian She used to go about with a barrel organ my father ran away with her I have that violent South in my blood and I ve lived nearly all my days in London I ve had to pay dearly for my blood The only compensation it has given me is a passion for art he waved his lean bediamonded hand towards the horrific walls That is external in a way mere money has enabled me to gratify my tastes but as I was saying I have lived a life of strange struggle material physical and he brought down his free hand with a bang on the table it is only by the grace of God and the never ceasing presence of Our Lord Jesus Christ by my side that that I am able to offer you my modest hospitality this evening Paul felt greatly drawn to the man He was beyond doubt sincere He wore the air of one who had lived fiercely who had suffered who had conquered but the air of one whose victory was barren who was looking into the void for the things unconquerable yet essential to salvation Paul made a little gesture of attention He could find no words to reply A man s deep profession of faith is unanswerable Ah said Barney Bill you ought to have come along o me Silas years ago in the old bus You mightn t have got all these bright pictures but you wouldn t have had these ere gloomy ideas I don t say as how I don t hold with Gawd he explained with uplifted forefinger and cocked head but if ever I thinks of Him I like to feel that He s in the wind or in the crickle crackle of the earth just near and friendly like but not a worrying of a chap listening for every cuss word as he uses to his old horse and measuring every half pint he pours down his dusty throat No That ain t my idea of Gawd But then I ain t got religion Still the same old pagan laughed Paul No not the same sonny said Barney Bill holding up his knife which supported a morsel of cheese Old Rheumaticky Got to live in a ouse when it rains me who never keered whether I was baked to a cinder or wet through I ain t a pagan no more I m a crock Jane smiled affectionately at the old man and her face was lit with rare sweetness when she smiled He really is just the same she said He hasn t changed much in forty years said mister Finn I was a good Conservative then as I am now said Bill That s one thing anyhow So was you Silas But you had Radical leanings Barney Bill s remark set the talk on political lines Paul learned that his host had sat for a year or more as a Progressive on the Hickney Heath Borough Council and aspired to a seat in Parliament The Kingdom of Heaven said he not unctuously or hypocritically but in his grave tone of conviction is not adequately represented in the House Paul pointed out that in the House of Lords one had the whole bench of Bishops I m not a member of the Established Church mister Savelli replied mister Finn I m a Dissenter a Free Zionist I ve heard him conduc the service said Barney Bill He built the Meeting House close by yer know I goes sometimes to try and get converted But I m too old and stiff in the j ints No longer a pagan but a crock sonny But I likes to listen to him Gorbli bless me it s a real bean feast that s what it is He talks straight from the shoulder he does just as you talked to night Lets em ave it bing bang in the eye Don t he Jane Bill means she explained with the shadow of a smile for Paul s benefit that mister Finn is an eloquent preacher D yer suppose he didn t understand what I meant he exclaimed setting down the beer glass which he was about to raise to his lips Him what I discovered reading Sir Walter Scott with the cover off when he was a nipper with no clothes on You understood sonny Of course I did He laughed gaily and turned to his host who had suffered Barney Bill s queer eulogy with melancholy indulgence One of these days I should like to come and hear you preach Any Sunday at ten and six You would be more than welcome The meal was over Barney Bill pulled a blackened clay pipe from his waistcoat pocket and a paper of tobacco I m a non smoker said mister Finn to Paul and I m sorry I ve nothing to offer you I see little company so I don t keep cigars in the house but if you would care to smoke he waved a courteous and inviting hand Paul whipped out his cigarette case It was of gold a present last Christmas from the Winwood fitting part of the equipment of a Fortunate Youth He opened it offered a cigarette to Barney Bill Garn said the old man I smokes terbakker and he filled his pipe with shag mister Finn rose from the table Will you excuse me mister Savelli if I leave you I get up early to attend to my business I must be at Billingsgate at half past five to buy my fish Besides I have been preventing your talk with our friends So pray don t go Good night mister Savelli As he shook hands Paul met the sorrowful liquid eyes fixed on him with strange earnestness I must thank you for your charming hospitality I hope you ll allow me to come and see you again My house is yours It was a phrase a phrase of Castilian politeness oddly out of place in the mouth of a Free Zionist purveyor of fried fish But it seemed to have more than a Castilian more than a Free Zionist significance He was still pondering over it when mister Finn having bidden Jane

none	none	good night disappeared Ah said Barney Bill lifting up the beer jug in order to refill his glass and checked whimsically by the fact of its emptiness Ah said he setting down the jug and limping round the table let us hear as how you ve been getting on sonny They drew their chairs about the great hearth in which the idiotic little Viennese plaster animals sported in movement eternally arrested and talked of the years that had passed Paul explained once more his loss of Jane and his fruitless efforts to find her We didn t know said Jane We thought that either you were dead or had forgotten us or had grown too big a man for us Axing your pardon said Barney Bill taking his blackened clay from his lips and holding it between his gnarled fingers you said so I didn t I always held that if he wasn t dead the time would come when as it was to night the three of us would be sitting round together I maintained he added solemnly after a puff or two that his heart was in the right place I m a broken down old crock no longer a pagan but I m right Ain t I sonny He thrust an arm into the ribs of Paul who was sitting between them Paul looked at Jane I think this proves it She returned his look steadily I own I was wrong But a woman only proves herself to be right by always insisting that she is wrong My dear Jane cried Paul Since when have you become so psychological Gorblime said Barney Bill what in thunder s that I know said Jane You to Paul were good enough to begin my education I ve tried since to go on with it It s nothing to do with edication said Barney Bill It s fac s Let s have fac s Jane and I have been tramping the same old high road but you ve been climbing mountains yer and yer gold cigarette cases Let s hear about it So Paul told his story and as he told it it seemed to him in its improbability more like a fairy tale than the sober happenings of real life You ve said nothing about the princess Jane remarked when he had ended The princess Yes Where does she come in The Princess Zobraska is a friend of my employers But you and she are great friends Jane persisted quietly That s obvious to anybody I was standing quite close when you helped her into the motor car I didn t see you I took care you didn t She looks charming Most princesses are charming when they ve no particular reason to be otherwise said Paul It is their metier their profession There was a little silence Jane cheek on hand looked thoughtfully into the fire Barney Bill knocked the ashes out of his pipe and thrust it in his pocket It s getting late sonny Paul looked at his watch It was past one o clock He jumped up I hope to goodness you haven t to begin work at half past five he said to Jane No At eight She rose as he stretched out his hand You don t know what it is to see you again Paul I can t tell you Some things are upsetting But I m glad Oh yes I m glad Paul dear Don t think I m not Her voice broke a little They were the first gentle words she had given him all the evening Paul smiled and kissed her hand as he had kissed that of the princess and still holding it said Don t I know you of old And if you suppose I haven t thought of you and felt the need of you you re very much mistaken Now I ve found you I m not going to let you go again She turned her head aside and looked down there was the slightest movement of her plump shoulders What s the good I can t do anything for you now and you can t do anything for me You re on the way to becoming a great man To me you re a great man already Don t you see My dear I was an embryonic Shelley Raphael Garrick and Napoleon when you first met me he said jestingly But then you didn t belong to their to their sphere Now you do Your friends are lords and ladies and and princesses My friends cried Paul are people with great true hearts like the Winwoods and the princess if you like and you and Barney Bill That s a sentiment as does you credit said the old man Great true hearts Now if you ain t satisfied my dear you re a damn criss cross female And yer ain t are yer She laughed and Paul laughed The little spell of intensity was broken There were pleasant leave takings I ll set you on your road a bit said Barney Bill I live in the neighbourhood Good bye Jane She went with them to the front door and stood in the gusty air watching them until they melted into the darkness CHAPTER XIV BETWEEN the young man of immaculate vesture of impeccable manners of undeniable culture of instinctive sympathy with the great world where great things are done of unerring tact of mythological beauty and charm of boundless ambition of resistless energy of incalculable promise in outer semblance and in avowed creed the fine flower of aristocratic England professing the divine right of the House of Lords and the utilitarian sanctity of the Church of England between Paul that is to say and the Radical progressive councillor of Hickney Heath the Free Zionist dissenter not even Congregationalist or Baptist or Wesleyan or any powerfully organized Non conformist whose conscience archbishops consult with astute patronage the purveyor of fried fish the man of crude uncultivated taste there should have been a gulf fixed as wide as the Pacific Ocean As a matter of fact whatever gulf lay between them was narrow enough to be bridged comfortably over by mutual esteem Paul took to visiting mister Finn Accustomed to the somewhat tired or conventional creeds of his political world he found refreshment in the man s intense faith He also found pathetic attraction in the man s efforts towards self expression mister Finn who lived a life of great loneliness scarcely a soul said Jane crossed his threshold from month s end to month s end seemed delighted to have a sympathetic visitor to whom he could display his painted treasures When he was among them the haunting pain vanished from his eyes as sometimes one has seen it vanish from those of an unhappy woman among her flowers He loved to take Paul through his collection and point out the beauties and claim his admiration He had converted a conservatory running along one side of the house into a picture gallery and this was filled with his masterpieces of pictorial villainy Here Paul was at first astonished at recognizing replicas of pictures which hung in other rooms mister Finn explained These said he are the originals Paul pondered over the dark saying for a moment or two until he came upon a half finished canvas on an easel It was the copy of a landscape on the wall He turned questioningly to his host The latter smiled I m a bit of an artist myself he said But as I ve never had time for lessons in painting I teach myself by copying good pictures It s a Saunders a name unknown to Paul and a very good example It s called Noontide The cow is particularly good isn t it But it s exceedingly difficult That fore shortening I can t get it quite right yet But I go on and on till I succeed The only way Paul acquiesced and asked him where he had picked up his Saunders Indeed where had he picked up all the others Not an exhibition in London would have admitted one of them This Saunders represented a wooden cow out of drawing lying in the shade of a conventional tree It was peculiarly bad I bought it direct from the artist replied mister Finn He s an unrecognized genius and now he s getting old poor fellow Years ago he offended the Royal Academy and they never forgot it He says they ve kept him under all his life I have a great many of his pictures He looked admiringly at the cow for a while and added I gave him four pounds ten for this one Paul could not forbear saying though his tone betrayed no irony A good price I think so replied mister Finn That s what he asked I could never haggle with an artist His work is of the spirit isn t it And Paul marvelled at the childlike simplicity of the man the son of the Sicilian woman who went about with a barrel organ who starting in the race on a level with Barney Bill had made a fortune in the exploitation of fried fish To disturb his faith in the genius of Saunders were a crime as base a crime as proving to a child the non existence of fairies For Paul saw that Silas Finn found in this land of artistic illusion a refuge from many things not only from the sordid cares of a large business but perhaps also from the fierce intensity of his religion from his driving and compelling deity Here God entered gently There was another reason which Paul scarcely confessed to himself for the pleasure he found in the older man s company The veil which he had thrown so adroitly over his past history which needed continuous adroitness to maintain was useless in this house Both Barney Bill and Jane had spoken of him freely Silas Finn knew of Bludston of his modeldom of his inglorious career on the stage He could talk openly once more without the never absent subconscious sense of reserve He was still in his own eyes the prince out of the fairy tale but Silas Finn and the two others alone of his friends shared the knowledge of the days when he herded swine Now a prince out of a fairy tale who has herded swine is a romantic figure Paul did not doubt that he was one Even Jane in spite of her direct common sense admitted it Barney Bill proclaimed it openly slapping him on the back and taking much credit to himself for helping the prince on the way to his kingdom And mister Finn even in the heat of political discussion or theological asseveration treated him with a curious and pathetic deference Meanwhile Paul pursued his own career of glory The occasional visits to Hickney Heath were after all but rare though distinct episodes in his busy life He had his parliamentary work for Colonel Winwood his work for Miss Winwood his work for the Young England League He had his social engagements He had the Princess Zobraska He also began to write in picturesque advocacy of his views for serious weekly and monthly publications Then Christmas came and he found himself at Drane s Court somewhat gasping for breath A large houseparty however including Lord Francis Ayres the chief Opposition Whip threatened to keep him busy The Princess drove over from Chetwood Park for dinner on Christmas Day He had to worship from afar for a long spell of the evening to worship with horrible jealousy Lord Francis Ayres a bachelor and a man of winning charm as men must be whose function it is to keep Members of Parliament good and pleased with themselves and sheeplike held the Princess captive in a remote corner with his honeyed tongue She looked at him seductively out of her great slumberous blue eyes even as she had looked on occasion at him Paul He hated Lord Francis set himself up against him as of old he had set himself up against Billy Goodge He was a better man than Frank Ayres Frank Ayres was only a popinjay Beneath the tails of his coat he snapped his fingers at Frank Ayres while he listened with his own agreeable smile to Mademoiselle de Cressy s devilled gossip He was very frigid and courtly when he bade the Princess good night at the door of her limousine Ah que vous etes bete she laughed He went to bed very angry She had told him to his face that he was a silly fool And so he was He thought of all the brilliantly dignified things he might have said if the relentless engine had not whirred her away down the drive But the next morning Lord Francis met him in the wintry garden and smiled and held out a winning hand Paul hid his hatred beneath the mask of courtesy They talked for a few moments of indifferent matters Then Frank Ayres suddenly said Have you ever thought of standing for Parliament Paul who had been sauntering between flowerless beds with his companion stood stock still The Chief Whip of a political party is a devil of a fellow To the aspiring young politician he is much more a devil of a fellow than the Prime Minister or any Secretary of State If a Chief Whip breathes the suggestion that a man might possibly stand for election as a Member of Parliament it means that at any suitable vacancy or at a general election he will with utter certainty have his chance as a candidate with the whole force of his party behind him It is part of the business of Chief Whips to find candidates Of course said Paul rather stupidly Eventually One of these days But soon Soon Paul s head reeled What did he mean by soon Well Lord Francis laughed not to morrow But pretty soon Look here Savelli I m going to speak frankly The party s in for a long period out of office That s obvious Look at the majority against us We want the young blood not the old hacks so that when we come in again we shall have a band of trained men in the heyday of their powers Of course I know it s my business to know what generally you have done for the Young England League but I missed your speech at Flickney Heath in the autumn You had an immense success hadn t you They seemed pleased with what I had to say replied Paul modestly When did you hear about it Last night The Winwoods are the dearest people in the world said Paul walking warily but they are prejudiced in my favour It wasn t the Winwoods The beautiful truth flashed upon Paul Then it was the Princess Zobraska The other laughed Never mind I know all about it It isn t often one has to listen to speeches at second hand The question is Would you care to stand when the time comes I should just think I would cried Paul boyishly All his jealous resentment had given place to exultation It was the Princess who had told Frank Ayres If she had been laying him under the spell of her seduction it was on his Paul s account She had had the splendid audacity to recite his speech to the Chief Whip Frank Ayres was suddenly transformed from a popinjay into an admirable fellow The Princess herself sat enthroned more adorable than ever The only difficulty said Paul is that I have to earn my living That might be arranged said Lord Francis So Paul as soon as he found an opportunity danced over to Chetwood Park and told his Princess all about it and called her a tutelary goddess and an angel and all manner of pretty names And the Princess who was alone poured for him her priceless Russian tea into egg shell China tea cups and fed him on English crumpets and in her French and feminine way gave him the outer fringe of her heart to play with a very dangerous game She had received him not as once before in the state drawing room but in the intimacy of her own boudoir a place all soft lights and cushions and tapestries and gleaming bits of sculpture After tea and crumpets had been consumed the dangerous game proceeded far enough for Paul to confess his unjust dislike of Frank Ayres Gros jaloux said the Princess That was why you said que vous etes bete said he Partly What were the other reasons Any woman has a thousand reasons for calling any man stupid Tell me some of them at any rate Well isn t it stupid of a man to try to quarrel with his best friend when he won t be seeing her again for three or four months You re not going away soon Next week Oh said Paul Yes I go to Paris then to my villa at Mont Boron I have the nostalgia of my own country you see Then to Venice at Easter Paul looked at her wistfully for life seemed suddenly very blank and dismal What shall I do all that time without my best friend You will probably find another and forget her She was lying back among cushions pink and terra cotta and a round black cushion framed her delicate head Paul said in a low voice bending forward Do you think you are a woman whom men forget Their eyes met The game had grown very perilous Men may remember the princess she replied but forget the woman If it weren t for the woman inside the princess what reason should I have for remembering he asked She fenced But as it is you don t see me very often I know But you are here to be seen not when I want you for that would be every hour of the day but at least in times of emergency You are here all the same in the atmosphere of my life And if I go abroad I shall no longer be in that atmosphere Did I not say you would forget She laughed Then quickly started forward and elbow on knee and chin on palm regarded him brightly We are talking like a couple of people out of Mademoiselle de Scudery she said before he had time to reply And we are in the twentieth century mon pauvre ami We must be sensible I know that you will miss me And I will miss you too Mais que voulez vous We have to obey the laws of the world we live in Need we asked Paul daringly Why need we We must I must go away to my own country You must stay in yours and work and fulfill your ambitions She paused I want you to be a great man she said with a strange tenderness in her voice With you by my side said he I feel I could conquer the earth As your good friend I shall always be by your side Vous voyez mon cher Paul she went on quickly in French I am not quite as people see me I am a woman who is lonely and not too happy who has had disillusions which have embittered her life You know my history It is public property But I am young And my heart is healed and it craves faith and tenderness and and friendship I have many to flatter me I am not too ugly Many men pay their court to me but they do not touch my heart None of them even interest me I don t know why And then I have my rank which imposes on me its obligations Sometimes I wish I were a little woman of nothing at all so that I could do as I like Mais enfin I do what I can You have come Paul Savelli with your youth and your faith and your genius and you pay your court to me like the others Yes it is true and as long as it was amusing I let it go on But now that you interest me it is different I want your success I want it with all my heart It is a little something in my life I confess it quelque chose de tres joli and I will not spoil it So let us be good friends frank and loyal without any Scudery She looked at him with eyes that had lost their languor a sweet woman s eyes a little moist very true And now she said will you be so kind as to put a log on the fire Paul rose and threw a log on the glowing embers and stood by her side He was deeply moved Never before had she so spoken Never before had she afforded a glimpse of the real woman Her phrases so natural so sincere in her own tongue and so caressive stirred the best in him The glamour passed from the royal lady only the sweet and beautiful woman remained I will be what you will my Princess he said At that moment he could not say more For the first time in his life he was mute in a woman s presence and the reason was that for the first time in his life love for a woman had gripped his heart She rose and smiled at him Bons amis francs et loyaux Francs et loyaux She gave him her hand in friendship but she gave him her eyes in love It is the foolish way of women May a frank and loyal friend write to you sometimes he asked Why yes And a frank and loyal friend will answer And when shall I see you again Did I not tell you she said moving to the bell for this was leave taking that I shall be in Venice at Easter Paul went out into the frosty air and the bright wintry stars shone down on him Often on such nights he had looked up wondering which was his star the star that guided his destiny But to night no such fancy crossed his mind He did not think of the stars He did not think of his destiny His mind and soul were drenched in thought of one woman It had come at last the great passion the infinite desire It had come in a moment wakened into quivering being by the caressive notes of the dear French voice mais je suis jeune et mon coeur est gueri et il lui manque affreusement de la foi de la tendresse de de adorable catch of emotion de l amitie Friendship indeed For amitie all but her lips said amour He walked beneath the wintry stars a man in a perfect dream Till then she had been but his Princess the exquisite lady whom it had amused to wander with him into the pays du tendre She had been as far above him as the now disregarded stars She had come down with a carnival domino over her sidereal raiment and had met him on carnival equality He beau masque He knowing her had fallen beneath her starry spell He was Paul Kegworthy Paul Savelli what you like Paul the adventurer Paul the man born to great things She was a beautiful woman bearing the title of Princess the title that had haunted his life since first the Vision Splendid dawned upon him as he lay on his stomach eavesdropping and heard the words of the divinely smelling goddess who had given him his talisman the cornelian heart To rank himself with princes had been the intense meaning of his life since ragged and fiercely imaginative childhood Odd circumstances had ranked him with Sophie Zobraska The mere romance of it had carried him off his feet She was a princess She was charming She frankly liked his society She seemed interested in his adventurous career She was romantic He too She was his Egeria He had worshipped her romantically in a mediaeval Italian way and she had accepted the homage It had all been deliciously artificial It had all been Mademoiselle de Scudery But to day the real woman casting off her carnival domino casting off too the sidereal raiment had spoken for the first time in simple womanhood and her betraying eyes had told things that they had told to no other man living or dead And all that was artificial all that was fantastic all that was glamour was stripped away from Paul in the instant of her self revelation He loved her as man loves woman He laughed aloud as his young feet struck the frozen road She knew and was not angry She in her wonder gave him leave to love her It was obvious that she loved him to love her Dear God He could go on loving her like this for the rest of his life What more did he want To the clean man of nine and twenty sufficient for the day is the beauty thereof An inspired youth took his place at the Winwoods dinner table that evening The elderly ugly heiress Miss Durning concerning whom Miss Winwood had with gentle malice twitted him some months before sat by his side He sang her songs of Araby and tales of far Cashmere places which in the commonplace way of travel he had never visited What really happened in the drawing room between the departure of the ladies and the entrance of the men no one knows But before the ladies went to bed Miss Winwood took Paul aside Paul dear she said you re never going to marry an old woman for money are you Good God no Dearest lady what do you mean His cry was so sincere that she laughed Nothing she said But you must mean something He threw out his hands Are you aware that you ve been flirting disgracefully with Lizzle Durning I said Paul clapping a hand to his shirt front You He smiled his sunny smile into the clear direct eyes of his dearest lady all the more dear because of the premature white of her hair I would flirt to night with Xantippe or Kerenhappuch or Queen Victoria said he Why He laughed and although none of the standing and lingering company had overheard them he gently led her to the curtained embrasure of the drawing room window This is perhaps the biggest day of my life I ve not had an opportunity of telling you This morning Frank Ayres offered me a seat in Parliament I m glad said Ursula Winwood but her eyes hardened And so Lizzie Durning He took both her elbows in his hands only a Fortunate Youth with his laughing charm would have dared to grip Ursula Winwood s elbows and cut her short Dearest lady said he to day there are but two women in the world for me You are one The other well it isn t Miss Durning She searched him through and through This afternoon Yes Paul She withdrew from his grasp In her voice was a touch of reproach Dearest lady said he I would die rather than marry a rich woman ugly or beautiful if I could not bring her something big in return something worth living for You ve dold me either too much or too little Am I not entitled to know how things stand You re entitled to know the innermost secrets of my heart he cried and he told thereof as far as his love for the Princess was concerned But my poor boy said Ursula tenderly how is it all going to end It s never going to end cried Paul Ursula Winwood smiled on him and sighed a little for she remembered the gallant young fellow who had been killed in the Soudan in eighteen eighty five CHAPTER XV IT would never end Why should it Could a Great Wonder be merely a transient thrill Absurd Dawn followed night day after day and the wonder had not faded It would never fade Letter followed letter each more precious than the last She began with Mon cher Paul Then Mon cher then sometimes Paul She set the tone of the frank and loyal friendship in a style very graceful very elusive a word of tenderness melting away in a laugh she took the friendship pulled it to pieces and reconstructed it in ideal form then she tied blue ribbon round its neck and showed him how beautiful it was She sat on the veranda of her villa and looked out on the moonlit Mediterranean and wanted to cry J avais envie de Pleurer because she was all alone having entertained at dinner a heap of dull and ugly people She had spent a day on the yacht of a Russian Grand Duke Il m a fait une cour effrenee Paul thirsted immediately for the blood of this Grand Duke who had dared to make violent love to her But when a few lines farther on he found that she had guessed his jealousy and laughed at it he laughed too Don t be afraid I have had enough of these people She wanted une ame sincere et candide and Paul laid the flattering unction to his own sincere and candid soul Then she spoke prettily of his career He was to be the flambeau eveilleur the awakening torch in the darkness before the daybreak But he musn t overwork His health was precious There was a blot and erasure in the sentence He took the letter to the light lover wise and looked at it through a magnifying glass and his pulses thrilled when it told him that she had originally written Votre sante m est precieuse and had scrabbled out the m Your health is precious to me That is what her heart had said Did lover ever have a dearer mistress He kissed the blot and the thick French ink coming off on his lips was nectar And he began his letters with My dear Princess then it was Dearest Princess then My Princess Then she rallied him on the matter It came to Mais enfin j ai un petit nom comme tout le monde In common with the rest of humanity she had a Christian name and she was accustomed to be called by it by her frank and loyal friends And they are so few Paul heard the delicate little sigh and saw the delicate rise and fall of the white bosom And again he fed on purple ink So he began his next letter with Dear Sophie But he could not pour the same emotion into Dear Sophie as he could into My Princess and My Sophie was a step beyond the bounds of frank and loyal friendship So it came to his apostrophizing her as Dear and scattering Sophies deliciously through the text And so the frank and loyal friendship went on its appointed course as every frank and loyal friendship between two young and ardent souls who love each other has proceeded since the beginning of a sophisticated world The first three months of that year were a period of enchantment He lived supremely The daily round of work was trivial play He rose at seven went to bed at two crowded the nineteen hours of wakefulness with glorious endeavour He went all over the country with his flambeau eveilleur awakening the Youth of England finding at last the great artistic gift the gods had given him the gift of oratory One day he reminded Jane of a talk long ago when he had fled from the studios You asked me how I was going to earn my living I said I was going to follow one of the Arts I remember said Jane regarding him full eyed You said you thought you were a poet but you might be a musician or painter Finally you decided you were an actor He laughed his gay laugh I was an infernally bad actor he acknowledged Then he explained his failure on the stage He was impatient of other people s inventions wanting to play not Hamlet or Tom or Dick or Romeo or Harry but himself Now he could play himself It was acting in a way Anyhow it was an Art so his boyish prophecy had come true He had been struggling from childhood for a means of self expression He had tried most of them save this Here he had found it He loved to play upon a crowd as if they were so many notes of a vast organ On this occasion Jane said And my means of self expression is to play on the keys of a typewriter Your time hasn t come he replied When you have found your means you will express yourself all the more greatly Which was ingenious on the part of Paul but ironically consoling to Jane One week end during the session he spent at the Marchioness of Chudley s place in Lancashire He drove in a luxurious automobile through the stately park which once he had traversed in the brakeful of urchins the raggedest of them all and his heart swelled with pardonable exultation He had passed through Bludston and he had caught a glimpse of what had once been his brickfield now the site of more rows of mean little houses and he had seen the grim factory chimneys still smoking smoking The little Buttons having grown up into big Buttons were toiling away their lives in those factories And Button himself the unspeakable Button Was he yet alive And missus Button who had been Polly Kegworthy and called herself his mother It was astonishing how seldom he thought of her He had run away a scarecrow boy in a gipsy van He came back a formative force in the land the lover of a princess the honoured guest of the great palace of the countryside He slipped his hand into his waistcoat pocket and felt the cornelian heart Yes in the great palace he found himself an honoured guest His name was known independently of his work for the Winwoods He was doing good service to his party The word had gone abroad perhaps Frank Ayres had kindly spoken it that he was the coming man Lady Chudley said I wonder if you remember what we talked about when I first met you Paul laughed for she did not refer to the first meeting of all I m afraid I was very young and fatuous said he It was years ago I hadn t grown up Never mind We talked about waking the country from its sleep And you gave me a phrase Lady Chudley the Awakener of England It stuck It crystallized all sorts of vague ambitions I ve never forgotten it for five consecutive minutes But how can you remember a casual act of graciousness to an unimportant boy No boy who dreams of England s greatness is unimportant she said You ve proved me to be right Your dreams are coming true see I don t forget I owe you far more than you could possibly imagine said Paul No no Don t Don t exaggerate A laughing phrase that s nothing It is something Even a great deal But it s not all said he What else is there You were one of the two or three he said earnestly thinking of the Bludston factory who opened new horizons for me I m a proud woman said Lady Chudley The next day Sunday old Lord Chudley dragged him into his own private den He had a very red battered clean shaven face and very red hair and side whiskers and he was a very honest gentleman believing implicitly in God and the King and the House of Lords and Foxes and the Dutch School of Painting and his responsibility as a great landowner toward the two or three thousand human beings with whom he had business relations Look here Savelli I ve looked into your League It s a damned good thing About the only thing that has been invented which can stem the tide of Socialism Catch em young That s the way But you want the sinews of war You get subscriptions but not enough I ve seen your last balance sheet You want a little army of what the devil shall we call em Big Englanders Paul suggested at a venture Good We want an army of em to devote their whole time to the work Open a special fund You and Ursula Winwood will know how to work it What Ursula Winwood doesn t know in this sort of business isn t worth knowing and here s something to head the list with And he handed Paul a cheque which after a dazed second or two he realized to be one for five thousand pounds That was the beginning of the financial prosperity and the real political importance of the Young England League Paul organized a great public dinner with the Leader of the Opposition in the chair and an amazing band of notables around the tables Speeches were made the Marquis of Chudley s patriotism extolled and subscription lists filled up and handed to a triumphant organizing secretary A powerful daily newspaper took up the cause and made strong appeal The Lodges made simultaneous efforts in their respective districts Money flowed into the League s coffers When Parliament rose for the Easter recess Paul the most tired yet the most blissful youth among the Fortunate flew straight to Venice where a happy eyed princess welcomed him She was living in a Palazzo on the Grand Canal lent to her that is the graceful Italian way of putting it by some Venetian friends and there with Mademoiselle de Cressy to keep off the importunate she received such acquaintance as floated from the ends of the earth through the enchanted city I have started by seeing as few people as I can she said That s all on account of you monsieur He pressed her hand I hope we don t see a single soul we know as long as I m here he declared His hope was gratified not completely but enough to remove grounds for lover s fretfulness He passed idyllic days in halcyon weather Often she would send her gondola to fetch him from the Grand Hotel where he was staying Now and then most graciously audacious of princesses she would come herself On such occasions he would sit awaiting her with beating heart juvenis fortunatus nimium on the narrow veranda of the hotel regardless of the domed white pile of Santa Maria della Salute opposite or the ceaseless life on the water or the sunshine or anything else in Venice his gaze fixed on the bend of the canal and then at last would appear the tall curved prow and then the white clad red sashed Giacomo bending to his oar and then the white tenda with the dear form beneath vaguely visible and then Felipe clad like Giacomo and bending too rhythmically with the foremost figure Slowly all too slowly the gondola would near the steps and beneath the tenda would smile the dearest face in the world and the cheeks would be delicately flushed and the eyes tender and somewhat shy And Paul would stand smiling too a conquering young figure with green Marienbad hat tilted with ever so tiny a shade of jauntiness the object of frankly admiring and curious glances from a lone woman or two on the veranda until the gondola was brought up to the wave washed steps and the hotel porter had fixed the bridge of plank Then with Giacomo supporting his elbow he would board the black craft and would creep under the tenda and sink on the low seat by her side with a sense of daring and delicious intimacy and the gondola would glide away into fairyland Let us be real tourists and do Venice thoroughly she had said I have never seen it properly But you ve been here many times before Yes But She hesitated Eh bien Je ne peux pas le dire Il faut deviner Will you forgive me if I guess right Our great Shakespeare says Love lends a precious seeing to the eye That that s very pretty said the Princess in French I love much your Shakespeare Whereupon Paul recognized her admission of the correctness of his conjecture and so with the precious vision they had borrowed they went about tourist wise to familiar churches and palaces and everything they saw was lit with exceeding loveliness And they saw the great pictures of the world and Paul with his expert knowledge pointed out beauties she had not dreamed of hitherto and told her tales of the painters and discoursed picturesquely on Venetian history and she marvelled at his insight and learning and thought him the most wonderful man that had ever dropped ready made from heaven And he in the flush of his new love was thrilled by her touch and the low tones of her voice when she plucked him by the sleeve and murmured Ah Paul regardez moi ca It is so beautiful one wants to weep with joy They spoke now half in French half in English and she no longer protested against his murderous accent which however he strove to improve Love must have lent its precious hearing too for she vowed she loved to hear him speak her language In the great Council Chamber of the Ducal Palace they looked at the seventy six portraits of the illustrious succession of Doges with the one tragic vacant space the missing portrait of Marino Faliero the Rienzi of Venice the man before his time It seizes one s heart doesn t it said the Princess with her impulsive touch on his sleeve All these men were kings sovereigns of a mighty nation And how like they are to one another in this essential quality one would say they were brothers of a great family Why yes he cried scanning the rows of severe and subtle faces It s true Illuminatingly true He slid up his wrist quickly so that his hand met hers he held it How swift your perception is And what is that quality that quality common to them all that quality of leadership Let us try to find it Unconsciously he gripped her hand and she returned his pressure and they stood as chance willed it alone free from circumambulant tourists in the vast chamber vivid with Paul Veronese s colour on wall and ceilings with Tintoretto and Bassano with the arrogant splendour of the battles and the pomp and circumstance of victorious armies of the proud and conquering republic and their eyes were drawn from all this painted and riotous wonder by the long arresting frieze of portraits of serene masterful and subtle faces The common factor that s what we want isn t it Yes she breathed And as they stood hand in hand the unspoken thought vibrating between them the memory came to him of a day long ago when he had stood with another woman a girl then before the photographs in the window of the London Stereoscopic Company in Regent Street and he had scanned faces of successful men He laughed he could not help it and drew his Princess closer to him Between the analogous then and the wonderful now how immense a difference As he laughed she looked swiftly up into his face I know why you laugh No my Princess Impossible Mais oui Tell me All these great princes she swept her little gloved hand toward the frieze What is their common factor Paul forgetful of his mirth looked round Indomitable will said he seriously Unconquerable ambition illimitable faith They all seem to be saying their creed I believe in myself almighty and in Venice under my control and in God who made us both and in the inferiority of the remnant of the habitable globe Or else In the beginning God created Venice Then He created the rest of the world Then He created Me Then He retired and left me to deal with the situation Or else I am an earthly Trinity I am myself I am Venice I am God It is magnificent she cried How you understand them How you understand the true aristocratic spirit They are all what you call leaders of men I did not expect an analysis so swift and so true But Paul her voice sank adorably all these men lack something something that you have And that is why I thought you laughed He smiled down on her Do you think I was measuring myself with these men Naturally Why should you not she asked proudly And what have I got that they lack Happiness said the Princess Paul was silent for a while as they moved slowly away to the balcony which overlooks the lagoon and San Giorgio Maggiore glowing warm in the sunshine and then he said Yet most of those men loved passionately in their time and were loved by beautiful women Their love was a thing of the passions not of the spirit You cannot see a woman that is to say happiness behind any of their faces He whispered Can you see a woman behind mine If you look like that she replied with a contented little laugh the whole world can see it And so their talk drifted far away from Doges just as their souls were drifting far from the Golden Calf of the Frank and Loyal Friendship which Sophie the Princess had set up How could they help it and in Venice of all places in the world If she had determined on maintaining the friendship calm and austere why in Minerva s name had she bidden him hither Sophie Zobraska passed for a woman of sense None knew better than she the perils of moonlit canals and the sensuous splash of water against a gondola and the sad and dreamy beauty which sets the lonely heart aching for love Why had she done it Some such questions must Mademoiselle de Cressy have asked for the Princess told him that Stephanie had lectured her severely for going about so much in public alone with a beau jeune homme But we don t always want Stephanie with us she argued and she is not sympathetic in Venice She likes restaurants and people Besides she is always with her friends at Danielli s so if it weren t for you I should be doing nothing all by myself in the lonely palazzo Forcement we go about together Which was all sophistical and nonsensical and she knew it for there was a mischievous little gleam in her eye as she spoke But none the less shutting her ears to the unsympathetic Stephanie did she continue to show herself alone in public with the beautiful youth She had thrown her crown over the windmills for a few happy days for a few happy days she was feeding her starved nature drinking in her fill of beauty and colour and the joy of life And the pair thus forcibly thrown together drifted through the narrow canals beneath the old crumbling palaces side by side and hand in hand while Giacomo and Felipe disregarded automata bent to their oars One afternoon one mellow and memorable afternoon they were returning from Murano Not a breath of wind ruffled the lagoon The islands in their spring verdure slumbered peacefully Far away the shipping in the bacino lay still like enchanted craft Only a steamer or two and here and there the black line of a gondola with its standing solitary rower broke the immobility of things And Venice russet and rose and grey brooded in the sunset a city of dreams They murmured words of wonder and regret Instinctively they drew near and their shoulders touched Their clasp of fingers tightened and their breath came quickly and for a long time they were silent Then at last he whispered her name in the old foolish and inevitable way And she turned her face to him and met his eyes and said Paul and her lips as she said it seemed to speak a kiss And all the earth was wrapped in glory too overwhelming for speech It was only when they entered the Grand Canal and drew up by the striped posts of the palazzo that she said I have those Roman people and the Heatherfields coming to dinner I wish I hadn t She sighed Would you care to come He smiled into her eyes No my Princess not to night I should do silly things To night I will go and talk to the moon To morrow when can I come Early As early as you like And Paul went away and talked to the moon and the next morning his heart tumultuous presented himself at the palazzo He was shown into the stiff Italian drawing room with its great Venetian glass chandelier its heavy picture hung walls its Empire furniture covered in yellow silk Presently the door opened and she entered girlish in blouse and skirt fresh as the morning Bon jour Paul I ve not had time to put on my hat but She did not end for he strode toward her and with a little laugh of triumph took her in his arms and kissed her And so what had to be came to pass CHAPTER XVI I LOVE you too much my Sophie to be called the Princess Zobraska s husband And I love you too much dear to wish to be called anything else than Paul Savelli s wife That was their position perfectly defined perfectly understood They had arrived at it after many arguments and kisses and lovers protestations Such as I am I am cried Paul A waif and stray an unknown figure coming out of the darkness I have nothing to give you but my love Are there titles or riches on earth of equal value But I must give you more The name Paul Savelli itself must be a title of honour It is becoming that said the Princess And we can wait a little Paul can t we We are so happy like this Ah she sighed I have never been so happy in my life Nor I said Paul And am I really the first The first Believe it or not as you like But it s a fact I ve told you my life s dream I never sank below it and that is why perhaps it has come true For once the assertion was not the eternal lie Paul came fresh hearted to his Princess I wish I were a young girl Paul You are a star turned woman The Star of my Destiny in which I always believed The great things will soon come They descended to more commonplace themes Until the great things came what should be their mutual attitude before Society Until I can claim you let it be our dear and beautiful secret said Paul I would not have it vulgarized by the chattering world for anything in life Then Paul proved himself to be a proud and delicate lover and when London with its season and its duties and its pleasures absorbed them he had his reward For it was sweet to see her in great assemblies shining like a queen and like a queen surrounded by homage and to know that he alone of mortals was enthroned in her heart It was sweet to meet her laughing glance dear fellow conspirator It was sweet every morning and night to have the intimate little talk through the telephone And it was sweetest of all to snatch a precious hour with her alone Of such vain and foolish things is made all that is most beautiful in life He took his dearest lady though Miss Winwood now disclaimed the title into his confidence So did the Princess It was very comforting to range Miss Winwood on their side and to feel themselves in close touch with her wisdom and sympathy And her sympathy manifested itself in practical ways those of the woman confidante of every love affair since the world began Why should the Princess Zobraska not interest herself in some of the philanthropic schemes of which the house in Portland Place was the headquarters There was one a Forlorn Widows Fund the presidency of which she would be willing to resign in favour of the Princess The work was trivial it consisted chiefly in consultation with mister Savelli and in signing letters The Princess threw her arms round her neck laughing and blushing and calling her delicieuse You see it was obvious that mister Savelli could not be consulted in his official capacity or official letters signed elsewhere than in official precincts I ll do what I can for the pair of you said Miss Winwood to Paul But it s the most delightfully mad and impossible thing I ve ever put my hand to Accepting the fact of their romance however she could not but approve Paul s attitude It was the proud attitude of the boy who nearly six years ago was going without a word penniless and debonair out of her house All the woman in her glowed over him I m not going to be called an adventurer he had declared I shall not submit Sophie to the indignity of trailing a despised husband after her I m not going to use her rank and wealth as a stepping stone to my ambitions Let me first attain an unassailable position I shall have owed it to you to myself to anybody you like but not to my marriage I shall be somebody The rest won t matter The marriage will then be a romantic affair and romantic affairs are not unpopular dans le monde ou l on s ennuie This declaration was all very well the former part all very noble the latter exhibiting a knowledge of the world rather shrewd for one so young But when would he be able to attain his unassailable position Some years hence Would Sophie Zobraska who was only a few months younger than he be content to sacrifice these splendid and irretrievable years of her youth Ursula Winwood looked into the immediate future and did not see it rosy The first step toward an unassailable position was flight from the nest This presupposed an income If the party had been in power it would not have been difficult to find him a post She worried herself exceedingly for in her sweet and unreprehensible way she was more than ever in love with Paul Meeting Frank Ayres one night at a large reception she sought his advice Do you mind a wrench he asked No Well then you and Colonel Winwood send him about his business and get another secretary Let Savelli give all his time to his Young England League Making him mug up material for Winwood s speeches and write letters to constituents about football clubs is using a razor to cut butter His League s the thing It can surely afford to pay him a decent salary If it can t I ll see to a guarantee The last thing we see my dear Frank she said after she had thanked him is that which is right under our noses The next day she went to Paul full of the scheme Had he ever thought of it He took her hands and smiled in his gay irresistible way Of course dearest lady he said frankly But I would have cut out my tongue sooner than suggest it I know that my dear boy And yet said he I can t bear the idea of tearing myself away from you It seems like black ingratitude It isn t You forget that James and I have our little ambitions too the ambition of a master for a favourite pupil If you were a failure we should both be bitterly disappointed Don t you see And as for leaving us why need you We should miss you horribly You ve never been quite our paid servant And now you re something like our son Tears started in the sweet lady s clear eyes Even if you did go to your own chambers I shouldn t let our new secretary have this room they were in what the household called the office really Paul s luxuriously furnished private sitting room which contained his own little treasures of books and pictures and bits of china and glass accumulated during the six years of easeful life He will have the print room which nobody uses from one year s end to another and which is far more convenient for the street door And the same at Drane s Court So when you no longer work for us my dear boy our home will be yours as long as you re content to stay just because we love you Her hand was on his shoulder and his head was bent God grant said he that I may be worthy of your love He looked up and met her eyes Her hand was still on his shoulder Then very simply he bent down and kissed her on the cheek He told his Princess all about it She listened with dewy eyes Ah Paul she said That precious seeing of love I never had it till you came I was blind I never knew that there were such beautiful souls as Ursula Winwood in the world Dear how I love you for saying that cried Paul But it s true That is why said he So the happiest young man in London worked and danced through the season knowing that the day of emancipation was at hand His transference from the Winwoods to the League was fixed for October one He made great plans for an extension of the League s activities dreamed of a palace for headquarters with the banner of saint George flying proudly over it an object lesson for the nation One day in July while he was waiting for Colonel Winwood in the lobby of the House of Commons Frank Ayres stopped in the middle of a busy rush and shook hands Been down to Hickney Heath again I would if I were you Rouse em up As the words of a Chief Whip are apt to be significant Paul closeted himself with the President of the Hickney Heath Lodge who called the Secretary of the local Conservative Association to the interview The result was that Paul was invited to speak at an anti Budget meeting convened by the Association He spoke and repeated his success The Conservative newspapers the next morning gave a resume of his speech His Sophie coming to sign letters in her presidential capacity brought him the cuttings a proceeding which he thought adorable The season ended triumphantly For a while he lost his Princess She went to Cowes then to stay with French relations in a chateau in the Dordogne Paul went off yachting with the Chudleys and returned for the shooting to Drane s Court In the middle of September the Winwoods new secretary arrived and received instruction in his duties Then came the Princess to Morebury Park Dearest she said in his arms I never want to leave you again France is no longer France for me since I have England in my heart You remember that My wonderful Princess He found her more woman more expansive more bewitchingly caressing Absence had but brought her nearer When she laid her head on his shoulder and murmured in the deep and subtle tones of her own language My Paul it seems such a waste of time to be apart it took all his pride and will to withstand the maddening temptation He vowed that the time would soon come when he could claim her and went away in feverish search for worlds to conquer Then came October and London once more Paul was dressing for dinner one evening when a reply paid telegram was brought to him If selected by local committee will you stand for Hickney Heath Ayres He sat on his bed white and trembling and stared at the simple question The man servant stood imperturbable silver tray in hand Seeing the reply paid form he waited for a few moments Is there an answer sir Paul nodded asked for a pencil and with a shaky hand wrote the reply Yes was all he said Then with reaction came the thrill of mighty exultation and throwing on his clothes he rushed to the telephone in his sitting room Who first to hear the wondrous news but his Princess That there was a vacancy in Hickney Heath he knew as all Great Britain knew for Ponting the Radical Member had died suddenly the day before But it had never entered his head that he could be chosen as a candidate Mais j y ai bien pense moi came the voice through the telephone Why did Lord Francis tell you to go to Hickney Heath last July How a woman leaps at things With all his ambition his astuteness his political intuition he had not seen the opportunity But it had come Verily the stars in their courses were fighting for him Other names he was aware were before the Committee of the Local Association perhaps a great name suggested by the Central Unionist Organization there was also that of the former Tory member who smarting under defeat at the General Election had taken but a lukewarm interest in the constituency and was now wandering in the Far East But Paul confident in his destiny did not doubt that he would be selected And then within the next fortnight for bye elections during a Parliamentary session are matters of sweeping swiftness would come the great battle the great decisive battle of his life and he would win He must win His kingdom was at stake the dream kingdom of his life into which he would enter with his loved and won Princess on his arm He poured splendid foolishness through the telephone into an enraptured ear The lack of a sense of proportion is a charge often brought against women but how often do men as they should thank God for it Here was Sophie Zobraska reared from childhood in the atmosphere of great affairs mixing daily with folk who guided the destiny of nations having two years before refused in marriage one of those who held the peace of Europe in his hands moved to tense excitement of heart and brain and soul by the news that an obscure young man might possibly be chosen to contest a London Borough for election to the British Parliament and thrillingly convinced that now was imminent the great momentous crisis in the history of mankind With a lack of the same sense of proportion equal in kind though perhaps not so passionate in degree did Miss Winwood receive the world shaking tidings She wept and thinking Paul a phoenix called Frank Ayres an angel Colonel Winwood tugged his long drooping moustache and said very little but he committed the astounding indiscretion of allowing his glass to be filled with champagne whereupon he lifted it and said Here s luck my dear boy and somewhat recklessly gulped down the gout compelling liquid And after dinner when Miss Winwood had left them together he lighted a long Corona instead of his usual stumpy Bock and discussed with Paul electioneering ways and means For the next day or two Paul lived in a whirl of telephones telegrams letters scurryings across London interviews brain racking questionings and reiterated declarations of political creed But his selection was a foregone conclusion His youth his absurd beauty his fire and eloquence his unswerving definiteness of aim his magic that had inspired so many with a belief in him and had made him the Fortunate Youth captivated the imagination of the essentially unimaginative Before a committee of wits and poets Paul perhaps would not have had a dog s chance But he appealed to the hard headed merchants and professional men who chose him very much as the hero of melodrama appeals to a pit and gallery audience He symbolized to them hope and force and predestined triumph One or two at first sniffed suspiciously at his lofty ideals but as there was no mistaking his political soundness they let the ideals pass as a natural and evanescent aroma So in his thirtieth year Paul was nominated as Unionist candidate for the Borough of Hickney Heath and he saw himself on the actual threshold of the great things to which he was born He wrote a little note to Jane telling her the news He also wrote to Barney Bill You dear old Tory did you ever dream that ragamuffin little Paul was going to represent you in Parliament Get out the dear old bus and paint it blue with Paul Savelli forever in gold letters and instead of chairs and mats hang it with literature telling what a wonderful fellow P S is And go through the streets of Hickney Heath with it and say if you like I knew him when he was a nipper that high And if you like to be mysterious and romantic you can say I Barney Bill gave him his first chance as you did my dear old friend and Paul s not the man to forget it Oh Barney it s too wonderful his heart went out to the old man If I get in I will tell you something that will knock you flat It will be the realization of all the silly rubbish I talked in the old brickfield at Bludston But dear old friend it was you and the open road that first set me on the patriotic lay and there s not a voter in Hickney Heath who can vote as you can for his own private and particular trained candidate Jane for reasons unconjectured did not reply But from Barney Bill who it must be remembered had leanings toward literature he received a postcard with the following inscription Paul Hif I can help you konker the Beastes of Effesus I will Bill And then began the furious existence of an electioneering campaign His side had a clear start of the Radicals who found some hitch in the choice of their candidate The Young England League leaped into practical enthusiasm over their champion Seldom has young candidate had so glad a welcome And behind him stood his Sophie an inspiring goddess It so happened that for a date a few days hence had been fixed the Annual General Meeting of the Forlorn Widows Fund when Report and Balance Sheet were presented to the society The control of this organization Paul had not allowed to pass into the alien hands of Townsend the Winwoods new secretary Had not his Princess for the most delicious reasons in the world been made President He scorned Ursula Winwood s suggestion that for this year he would allow Townsend to manage affairs What cried he leave my Princess in the lurch on her first appearance Never By telephone he arranged an hour for the next day when they could all consult together over this important matter But my dear boy said Miss Winwood your time is not your own Suppose you re detained at Hickney Heath The Conqueror he cried with a gay laugh belongs to the Detainers not the Detained She looked at him out of her clear eyes and shook an indulgent head I know said he meeting her glance shrewdly He has got to use his detaining faculty with discretion I ve made a study of the little ways of conquerors Ali Dearest lady he burst out suddenly in his impetuous way I m talking nonsense but I m so uncannily happy It does me good to look at you she said CHAPTER XVII PAUL leaned back in his leather writing chair smoking a cigarette and focussing the electioneering situation Beside a sheet of foolscap on which he had been jotting down notes lay in neat piles the typewritten Report of the Forlorn Widows Fund the account book and the banker s pass book He had sat up till three o clock in the morning preparing for his Princess Nothing now remained but the formal examined and found correct report of the auditors For the moment the Forlorn Widows stood leagues away from Paul s thoughts He had passed a strenuous day at Hickney Heath lunching in the committee room on sandwiches and whisky and soda obtained from the nearest tavern talking inventing dictating writing playing upon dull minds the flashes of his organizing genius His committee was held up for the while by a dark rift in the Radical camp They had not yet chosen their man Nothing was known save that a certain John Questerhayes K C an eminent Chancery barrister who had of late made himself conspicuous in the constituency had been turned down on the ground that he was not sufficiently progressive Now for comfort to the Radical the term Progressive licks the blessed word Mesopotamia into a cocked hat Under the Progressive s sad coloured cloak he need not wear the red tie of the socialist Apparently mister Questerhayes objected to the sad coloured cloak the mantle of Elijah M P the late member for Hickney Heath Wanted an Elisha seemed to be the cry of the Radical Committee Paul leaned back his elbows on the arms of his chair his finger tips together a cigarette between his lips lost in thought The early November twilight deepened in the room He was to address a meeting that night In order to get ready for his speech he had not allowed himself to be detained and had come home early His speech had been prepared but the Radical delay was a new factor of which he might take triumphant advantage Hence the pencil notes on the sheet of foolscap before him A man servant came in turned on the electric light pulled the curtains together and saw to the fire Tea s in the drawing room sir Bring me some here in a breakfast cup nothing to eat said Paul Even his dearest lady could not help him in his meditated attack on the enemy whom the Lord was delivering into his hands The man servant went away Presently Paul heard him reenter the room the door was at his back He threw out an impatient hand behind him Put it down anywhere Wilton I ll have it when I want it I beg pardon sir said the man coming forward but it s not the tea There s a gentleman and a lady and another person would like to see you I said that you were busy sir but He put the silver salver with its card in front of Paul Printed on the card was mister Silas Finn In pencil was written Miss Seddon mister William Simmons Paul looked at the card in some bewilderment What in the name of politics or friendship were they doing in Portland Place Not to receive them however was unthinkable Show them in said he Silas Finn Jane and Barney Bill It was odd He laughed and took out his watch Yes he could easily give them half an hour or so But why had they come He had found time to call once at the house in Hickney Heath since his return to town and then he had seen Jane and Silas Finn together and they had talked as far as he could remember of the Disestablishment of the Anglican Church and the elevating influence of landscape painting on the human soul Why had they come It could not be to offer their services during the election for Silas Finn in politics was a fanatical enemy The visit stirred a lively curiosity They entered mister Finn in his usual black with many coloured tie and diamond ring looking more mournfully grave than ever Jane wearing an expression half of anxiety and half of defiance Barney Bill very uncomfortable in his well preserved best suit very restless and nervous They gave the impression of a deputation coming to announce the death of a near relative Paul received them cordially But why in the world thought he were they all so solemn He pushed forward chairs I got your postcard Bill Thanks so much for it Bill grunted and embraced his hard felt hat I ought to have written to you said Jane but She felt restrained by her duty towards me said mister Finn I hope you did not think it was discourteous on her part My dear sir Paul laughed seating himself in his writing chair which he twisted away from the table Jane and I are too old friends for that In her heart I know she wishes me luck And I hope you do too mister Finn he added pleasantly although I know you re on the other side I m afraid my principles will not allow me to wish you luck in this election mister Savelli Well well said Paul It doesn t matter If you vote against me I ll not bear malice I am not going to vote against you mister Savelli said mister Finn looking at him with melancholy eyes I am going to stand against you Paul sprang forward in his chair Here was fantastic news indeed Stand against me You You re the Radical candidate Yes Paul laughed boyishly Why it s capital I m awfully glad I was asked this morning said mister Finn gravely I prayed God for guidance He answered and I felt it my duty to come to you at once with our two friends Barney Bill cocked his head on one side I did my best to persuade him not to sonny But why shouldn t he cried Paul courteously though why he should puzzled him exceedingly It s very good of you mister Finn I m sure your side he went on could not have chosen a better man You re well known in the constituency I am jolly lucky to have a man like you as an opponent mister Savelli said mister Finn it was precisely so that we should not be opponents that I have taken this unusual step I don t quite understand said Paul mister Finn wants you to retire in favour of some other Conservative candidate said Jane calmly Retire I retire Paul looked at her then at Barney Bill who nodded his white head then at mister Finn whose deep eyes met his with a curious tragical mournfulness The proposal took his breath away It was crazily preposterous But for their long faces he would have burst into laughter Why on earth do you want me to retire he asked good humouredly I will tell you said mister Finn Because you will have God against you Paul saw a gleam of light in the dark mystery of the visit You may believe it mister Finn but I don t I believe that my war cry God for England Savelli and Saint George is quite as acceptable to the Almighty as yours mister Finn stretched out two hands in earnest deprecation Forgive me if I say it but you don t know what you re talking about God has not revealed Himself to you He has to me When my fellow citizens asked me to stand as the Liberal candidate I thought it was because they knew me to be an upright man who had worked hard on their council an active apostle in the cause of religion temperance and the suppression of vice I thought I had merely deserved well in their opinion When I fell on my knees and prayed the glory of the Lord spread about me and I knew that they had been divinely inspired It was revealed to me that this was a Divine Call to represent the Truth in the Parliament of the nation I remember your saying when I first had the pleasure of meeting you Paul remarked with unwonted dryness that the Kingdom of Heaven was not adequately represented in the House of Commons I have not changed my opinion mister Savelli The hand of God has guided my business The hand of God is placing me in the House of Commons to work His will You cannot oppose God s purpose Paul Savelli and that is why I beg you not to stand against me You see he likes yer interjected Barney Bill with anxiety in his glittering eyes That s why he s a doing of it He says to hisself says he ere s a young chap what I likes with his first great chance in front of him with the eyes of the country sot on him now if I comes in and smashes him as I can t help myself from doing it ll be all u p with that young chap s glorious career But if I warns him in time then he can retire find an honourable retreat that s what he wants yer to have an honourable retreat Isn t that it Silas Those are the feelings by which I am actuated said mister Finn Paul stretched himself out in his chair his ankles crossed and surveyed his guests What do you think of it Jane said he not without a touch of irony She had been looking into the fire her face in profile Addressed she turned mister Finn has your interests very deep at heart she answered tonelessly Paul jumped to his feet and laughed his fresh laugh It was all so comic so incredible so mad Yet none of them appeared to see any humour in the situation There sat Jane and Barney Bill cowering under the influence of their crazy fishmongering apostle and there regarding him with a world of appeal in his sorrowful eyes sat the apostle himself bolt upright in his chair an odd figure with his streaked black and white hair ascetic face and Methodistico Tattersall raiment And they all seemed to expect him to obey this quaint person s fanatical whimsy It s very kind indeed of you mister Finn to consult my interests in this manner said he And I m most indebted to you for your consideration But as I said before I ve as much reason for believing God to be on my side as you have And I honestly believe I m going to win this election So I certainly won t withdraw I implore you to do so I will go on my knees and beseech you said mister Finn with hands clasped in front of him Paul looked round I m afraid Bill said he that this is getting rather painful It is painful It s more than painful It s horrible It s ghastly cried mister Finn in sudden shrill crescendo leaping to his feet In an instant the man s demeanour had changed The mournful apostle had become a wild vibrating creature with flashing eyes and fingers Easy now Silas Whoa Steady said Barney Bill Silas Finn advanced on Paul and clapped his hands on his shoulders and shouted hoarsely For the love of God don t thwart me in this You can t thwart me You daren t thwart me You daren t thwart God Paul disengaged himself impatiently The humour had passed from the situation The man was a lunatic a religious maniac Again he addressed Barney Bill As I can t convince mister Finn of the absurdity of his request I must ask you to do so for me Young man cried Silas quivering with passion do not speak to God s appointed in your vanity and your arrogance You you of all human beings Both Jane and Barney Bill closed round him Jane clutched his arm Come away Do come away Steady now Silas implored Barney Bill You see it s no use I told you so Come along Leave me alone shouted Finn casting them off What have I to do with you It is that young man there who defies God and me mister Finn said Paul very erect if I have hurt your feelings I am sorry But I fight this election That s final The choice no longer rests with me I m the instrument of my party I desire to be courteous in every way but you must see that it would be useless to prolong this discussion And he moved to the door Come away now for Heaven s sake Can t you realize it s no good said Jane white to the lips Silas Finn again cast her off and railed and raved at her I will not go away he cried in wild passion I will not allow my own son to raise an impious hand against the Almighty Lor lumme gasped Barney Bill dropping his hat He s done it There was a silence Silas Finn stood shaking in the middle of the room the sweat streaming down his forehead Paul turned at the door and walked slowly up to him Your son What do you mean Jane with wringing hands and tense uplifted face said in a queer cracked voice He promised us not to speak He has broken his promise You broke your sacred word said Barney Bill The man s face grew haggard His passion left him as suddenly as it had seized him He collapsed a piteous wreck looked wide of the three and threw out his hands helplessly I broke my promise May God forgive me That s neither here nor there said Paul standing over him You must answer my question What do you mean Barney Bill limped a step or two toward him and cleared his throat He s quite correct sonny Silas Kegworthy s your father right enough Kegworthy Yes Changed his name for business and other reasons He said Paul half dazed for the moment and pointing at Silas Finn His name is Kegworthy and he is my father Yes sonny Tain t my fault or Jane s He took his Bible oath he wouldn t tell yer We was afraid so we come with him Then queried Paul jerking a thumb toward Lancashire Polly Kegworthy Yes She was yer mother Paul set his teeth and drew a deep breath not of air but of a million sword points Jane watched him out of frightened eyes She alone with her all but life long knowledge of him and with her woman s intuition realized the death blow that he had received And when she saw him take it unflinching and stand proud and stern her heart leaped toward him though she knew that the woman in the great chased silver photograph frame on the mantelpiece the great and radiant lady the high and mighty and beautiful and unapproachable Princess was the woman he loved Paul touched his father on the wrist and motioned to a chair Please sit down You too please he waved a hand and himself resumed his seat in his writing chair He turned it so that he could rest his elbow on his table and his forehead in his palm You claim to be my father said he Barney Bill in whom I have implicit confidence confirms it He says that missus Button is my mother She has been dead these six years said Barney Bill Why didn t you tell me asked Paul I didn t think it would interest yer sonny replied Barney Bill in great distress Yer see we conspirated together for yer never to know nothing at all about all this Anyway she s dead and won t worry yer any more She was a bad mother to me She is a memory of terror I don t pretend to be grieved said Paul any more than I pretend to be overcome by filial emotion at the present moment But if you are my father I should be glad to know in fact I think I m entitled to know why you ve taken thirty years to reveal yourself and why a sudden fury swept him why you ve come now to play hell with my life It is the will of God said Silas Finn in deep dejection Paul snapped three or four fingers Bah he cried Talk sense Talk facts Leave God out of the question for a while It s blasphemy to connect Him with a sordid business like this Tell me about myself my parentage let me know where I am You re with three people as loves yer sonny said Barney Bill What passes in this room will never be known to another soul on earth That I swear said Silas Finn You can publish it broadcast in every newspaper in England said Paul I m making no bargains Good God I m asking for nothing but the truth What use I make of it is my affair You can do the three of you what you like Let the world know It doesn t matter It s I that matter my life and my conscience and my soul that matter Don t be too hard upon me Silas besought him very humbly Tell me about myself said Paul Silas Finn wiped his forehead with his handkerchief and covered his eyes with his hand That can only mean telling you about myself he said It s raking up a past which I had hoped with God s help to bury But I have sinned to night and it is my punishment to tell you And you have a right to know My father was a porter in Covent Garden Market My mother I ve already mentioned Yes the Sicilian and the barrel organ I remember said Paul with a shiver I had a hard boyhood But I rose a little above my class I educated myself more or less At last I became assistant in a fishmonger s shop Our friend Simmons here and I were boys together We fell in love with the same girl I married her Not long afterward she gave way to drink I found that in all kinds of ways I had mistaken her character I can t describe your own mother to you She had a violent temper So had I My life was a hell upon earth One day she goaded me beyond my endurance and I struck at her with a knife I meant at the bloodred instant to kill her But I didn t I nearly killed her I went to prison for three years When I came out she had vanished taking you with her In prison I found the Grace of God and I vowed it should be my guide through life As soon as I was free from police supervision I changed my name I believe it s a good old Devonshire name my father came from there the prison taint hung about it Then when I found I could extend a miserable little business I had got together I changed it again to suit my trade That s about all There was a spell of dead silence The shrunken man stricken with a sense of his sin of oath breaking had Spoken without change of attitude his hand over his eyes Paul too sat motionless and neither Jane nor Barney Bill spoke Presently Silas Finn continued For many years I tried to find my wife and son but it was not God s will I have lived with the stain of murder on my soul his voice sank and it has never been washed away Perhaps it will be in God s good time And I had condemned my son to a horrible existence for I knew my wife was not capable of bringing you up in the way of clean living I was right Simmons has since told me and I was crushed beneath the burden of my sins After a pause he raised a drawn face and went on to tell of his meeting the year before with Barney Bill of whom he had lost track when the prison doors had closed behind him It had been in one of his Fish Palaces where Bill was eating They recognized each other Barney Bill told his tale how he had run across Polly Kegworthy after a dozen years wandering how for love of his old friend he had taken Paul child of astonishing promise away from Bludston Do you remember sonny when I left you alone that night and went to the other side of the brickfield It was to think it out said Bill To think out my duty as a man Paul nodded He was listening with death in his heart The whole fantastic substructure of his life had been suddenly kicked away and his life was an inchoate ruin Gone was the glamour of romance in which since the day of the cornelian heart he had had his essential being Up to an hour ago he had never doubted his mysterious birth No real mother could have pursued an innocent child with Polly Kegworthy s implacable hatred His passionate repudiation of her had been a cardinal article of his faith On the other hand the prince and princess theory he had long ago consigned to the limbo of childish things but the romance of his birth the romance of his high destiny remained a vital part of his spiritual equipment His looks his talents his temperament his instincts his dreams had been irrefutable confirmations His mere honesty his mere integrity had been based on this fervent and unshakable creed And now it had gone No more romance No more glamour No more Vision Splendid now faded into the light of common and sordid day Outwardly listening his gay mobile face turned to iron he lived in a molten intensity of thought his acute brain swiftly coordinating the ironical scraps of history He was the son of Polly Kegworthy So far he was unclean but hitherto her blood had not manifested itself in him He was the son of this violent and pathetic fanatic this ex convict he had his eyes his refined face perhaps he inherited from him the artistic temperament he recalled grimly the daubs on the man s walls and his purblind gropings toward artistic self expression and all this the Southern handsomeness and Southern love of colour had come from his Sicilian grandmother the nameless drab with bright yellow handkerchief over swarthy brows turning the handle of a barrel organ in the London streets Instinct had been right in its promptings to assume an Italian name but the irony of it was of the quality that makes for humour in hell And his very Christian name Paul the exotic name which Polly Kegworthy would not have given to a brat of hers was but a natural one for a Silas to give his son a Silas born of generations of evangelical peasants His eyes rested on the photograph of his Princess She first of all was gone with the Vision An adventurer he had possibly been but an adventurer of romance carried high by his splendid faith and regarding his marriage with the Princess but as a crowning of his romantic destiny But now he beheld himself only as a base born impostor His Princess was gone from his life Death was in his heart He saw his familiar luxurious room as in a dream and Jane anxious eyed looking into the fire and Barney Bill a little way off clutching his hard felt hat against his body but his eyes were fixed on the strange many passioned unbalanced man who claimed to be nay who was his father When I first met you that night my heart went out to you he was saying It overflowed in thankfulness to God that He had delivered you out of the power of the Dog and in His inscrutable mercy had condoned that part of my sin as a father and had set you in high places With the fringe of his brain Paul recognized for the first time how he brought into ordinary talk the habits of speech acquired in addressing a Free Zionist congregation It was only the self restraint Silas continued taught me by bitter years of agony and a message from God that it was part of my punishment not to acknowledge you as my son And what I told you and what Jane told you about him said Barney Bill Remember that Silas I remember it it was these influences that kept me silent But we were drawn together Paul He bent forward in his chair You liked me In spite of all our differences of caste and creed you liked me Yes I was drawn to you said Paul and a strange unknown note in his voice caused Jane to glance at him swiftly You seemed to be a man of many sorrows and deep enthusiasms and I admit I was in close sympathy with you He paused not moving from his rigid attitude and then went on What you have told me of your sufferings and I know with awful knowledge the woman who was my mother has made me sympathize with you all the more But to express that sympathy in any way you must give me time I said you had played hell with my life It s true One of these days I may be able to explain Not now There s no time We re caught up in the wheels of an inexorable political machine I address my party in the constituency to night It was a cold intelligence that spoke and once more Jane flashed a half frightened glance at him What I shall say to them in view of all this I don t quite know I must have half an hour to think I know I oughtn t to interfere Paul said Jane but you mustn t blame mister Finn too much Although he differs from you in politics and so on he loves you and is proud of you as we all are and looks forward to your great career I know it only too well And now he has this deep conviction that he has a call from on High to ruin your career at the very beginning Do understand Paul that he feels himself in a very terrible position I do said mister Finn God knows that if it weren t for His command I should myself withdraw I appreciate your position perfectly replied Paul but that doesn t relieve me of my responsibilities Silas Finn rose and locked the fingers of both hands together and stood before Paul with appealing eyes My son after what I have said you are not going to stand against me Paul rose too A sudden craze of passion swept him My country has been my country for thirty years You have been my father for five minutes I stand by my country Silas Finn turned away and waved a haphazard hand And I must stand by my God Very well That brings us to our original argument Political foes Private friends Silas turned again and looked into the young man s eyes But father and son Paul All the more honourable There ll be no mud throwing The cleanest election of the century The elder man again covered his face with both hands and his black and white streaked hair fell over his fingers and the great diamond in his ring flashed oddly and he rocked his head for a while to and fro I had a call he wailed I had a call I had a call from God It was clear It was absolute But you don t understand these things His will must prevail It was terrible to think of crushing your career my only son s career I brought these two friends to help me persuade you not to oppose me I did my best Paul I promised them not to resort to the last argument But flesh is weak For the first time since you know the knife your mother I lost self control I shall have to answer for it to my God He stretched out his arms and looked haggardly at Paul But it is God s will It is God s will that I should voice His message to the Empire Paul Paul my beloved son you cannot flout Almighty God Your God doesn t happen to be my God said Paul once more suspicious and now hideously so of religious mania And possibly the real God is somebody else s God altogether Anyway England s the only God I ve got left and I m going to fight for her The door opened and Wilton the man servant appeared He looked round I beg your pardon sir Paul crossed the room What is it Her Highness sir he said in his well trained low voice and the Colonel and Miss Winwood I told them you were engaged But they ve been waiting for over half an hour sir Paul drew himself up Why did you not tell me before Her Highness is not to be kept waiting Present my respectful compliments to Her Highness and ask her and Colonel and Miss Winwood to have the kindness to come upstairs We had better go cried Jane in sudden fear No said he I want you all to stay CHAPTER XVIII IN the tense silence of the few moments of waiting Paul passed from the boy to whom the earth had been a fairyland to the man grappling with great realities In those few moments he lived through his past life and faced an adumbration of the future The door was thrown open and the Princess appeared smiling happy a black ostrich feather in her hat and a sable stole hanging loose from her shoulders a great and radiant lady Behind her came the Colonel and Ursula Winwood Paul bent over the Princess s outstretched hand A thousand pardons for keeping you waiting I did not know you had come I was engaged with my friends May I have the honour of presenting them Princess this is mister Silas Finn the managing director of Fish Palaces Limited These are two very dear friends Miss Seddon mister Simmons Miss Winwood Colonel Winwood may I He waved an introductory hand The Princess bowed then struck by their unsmiling faces and by Paul s strange manner turned to him quickly Qu est ce qu il y a Je vais vous le dire He pushed a chair She sat down Ursula Winwood sat in Paul s writing chair The others remained standing mister Finn called to inform me that he has been adopted as the Liberal candidate for Hickney Heath My felicitations said the Princess Silas bowed to her gravely and addressed Colonel Winwood We have been sir mister Savelli and I for some time on terms of personal friendship in the constituency I see I see replied the Colonel though he was somewhat puzzled Very polite and friendly I m sure mister Finn also urges me to withdraw my candidature said Paul The Princess gave a little incredulous laugh Ursula Winwood rose and with a quick protective step drew nearer Paul Colonel Winwood frowned Withdraw In Heaven s name why Silas Finn tugged at his black and white streaked beard and looked at his son Need we go into it again There are religious reasons which perhaps Madam Silas addressed the Princess you might misunderstand mister Savelli possibly thinks I am a fanatic I can t help it I have warned him That is enough Good bye mister Savelli He held out his hand but Paul did not take it You forget mister Finn that I asked you to stay He clutched the sides of his jacket till his knuckles grew white and he set his teeth mister Finn has another reason for wishing me not to oppose him That reason you need never give cried Silas in a loud voice and starting forward You know that I make no claims whatsoever I know that said Paul coldly but I am going to give it all the same He paused held up his hand and looked at the Princess mister Silas Finn happens to be my father Good God gasped the Colonel after a flash of silence The Princess caught a quick breath and sat erect in her chair Votre Pere Paul Yes Princess Until half an hour ago I did not know it Never in my life did I know that I had a father living My friends there can bear witness that what I say is true But Paul dear said Miss Winwood laying her kind fingers on his arm and searching his face you told us that your parents were dead and that they were Italians I lied replied Paul calmly But I honestly believed the woman who was my mother not to be my mother and I had never heard of my father I had to account for myself to you Your delicacy Miss Winwood enabled me to invent as little as possible But your name Savelli I took it when I went on the stage I had a few years obscure and unsuccessful struggle You will remember I came to you starving and penniless The Princess grew white and her delicate nostrils quivered Et monsieur votre pere she checked herself And your father what do you say he is Paul motioned to Silas to speak I Madam said the latter am a self made man and by the establishment of fried fish shops all over London and the great provincial towns have by the grace of God amassed a considerable fortune Fried fish said the Princess in a queer voice Silas looked at her out of his melancholy and unhumorous eyes Yes Madam I have also learned said Paul that my grandmother was a Sicilian who played a street organ Hence my Italian blood Jane standing by the door with Barney Bill most agonized of old men wholly nervous twisting with gnarled fingers the broken rim of his hard felt hat turned aside so that no one but Bill should see a sudden gush of tears For she had realized how drab and unimportant she was in the presence of the great and radiant lady also how the great and radiant lady was the God sent mate for Paul never so great a man as now when he was cutting out his heart for truth s sake I should like to tell you what my life has been continued Paul in the presence of those who know it already That s why I asked them to stay Until an hour ago I lived in dreams In my own fashion I was an honest man But now I ve got this knowledge of my origin the dreams are swept away and I stand naked to myself If I left you Miss Winwood and Colonel Winwood who have been so good to me and Her Highness who has deigned to honour me with her friendship in a moment s doubt as to my antecedents I should be an impostor No no my boy said Colonel Winwood who was standing with hands deep in trouser pockets and his head bent staring at the carpet No words like that in this house Besides why should we want to go into all this He had the Englishman s detestation of unpleasant explanations Ursula Winwood supported him Yes why she asked But it would be very interesting said the Princess slowly cutting her words Paul met her eyes which she had hardened and saw beneath them pain and anger and wounded pride and repulsion For a second he allowed an agonized appeal to flash through his He knew that he was deliberately killing the love in her heart He felt the monstrous cruelty of it A momentary doubt shook him Was he justified A short while ago she had entered the room her face alight with love now her face was as stern and cold as his own Had he the right to use the knife like this Then certainty came It had to be The swifter the better She of all human beings must no longer be deceived Before her at supreme cost he must stand clean It s not very interesting said he And it s soon told I was a ragged boy in a slum in a Lancashire town I slept on sacking in a scullery and very seldom had enough to eat The woman whom I didn t think was my mother ill treated me I gather now that she hated me because she hated my father She deserted him when I was a year old and disappeared she never spoke of him I don t know exactly how old I am I chose a birthday at random As a child I worked in a factory You know what child labour in factories was some years ago I might have been there still if my dear old friend there hadn t helped me when I was thirteen to run away He used to go through the country in a van selling mats and chairs He brought me to London and found me a lodging with Miss Seddon s mother So Miss Seddon and I were children together I became an artist s model When I grew too old for that to be a dignified occupation I went on the stage Then one day starving and delirious I stumbled through the gates of Drane s Court and fell at Miss Winwood s feet That s all Since we ve begun we may as well finish and get it over said Colonel Winwood still with bent head but looking at Paul from beneath his eyebrows When and how did you come across this gentleman who you say is your father Paul told the story in a few words And now that you have heard everything said he would you think me justified in withdrawing my candidature Certainly not said the Colonel You ve got your duty to the Party And you Miss Winwood Can you ask You have your duty to the country And you Princess She met his challenging eyes and rose in a stately fashion I am not equal to these complications of English politics mister Savelli she said She held herself very erect but her lips trembled and tears were very near her eyes She turned to Miss Winwood and held out her hand I am afraid we must postpone our discussion of the Forlorn Widows It is getting late Au revoir Colonel Winwood I will see you to your carriage On the threshold she turned included Paul in a vague bow to the company and passed through the door which Colonel Winwood held open Paul watched her until she disappeared disappeared haughtily out of his life taking his living heart with her leaving him with a stone very heavy very cold dead And he was smitten as with a great darkness He remained quite still for a few moments after the door had closed then with a sudden jerk he drew himself up mister Finn said he as I ve told you I address my first meeting to night I am going to make public the fact that I m your son Silas put his hand to his head and looked at him wildly No no he muttered hoarsely no I see no reason said Miss Winwood gently I see every reason said Paul I must live in the light now The truth or nothing Then obey your conscience Paul she answered But Silas came forward with his outstretched hands You can t do it You can t do it I tell you It s impossible Why He replied in an odd voice and with a glance at Miss Winwood I must tell you afterwards I will leave you she said mister Finn she shook hands with him I hope you re proud of your son And then she shook hands with Jane and Barney Bill I m glad to meet such old friends of Paul And to Paul as he held the door open she said her clear kind eyes full on him Remember we want men in England Thank God we ve got women said he with lips from which he could not keep a sudden quiver He closed the door and came up to his father standing on the hearthrug And now why shouldn t I speak Why shouldn t I be an honest man instead of an impostor Out of pity for me my son Pity Why what harm would it do you There s nothing dishonourable in father and son fighting an election He laughed without much mirth It s what some people would call sporting As for me personally I don t see why you should be ashamed of owning me My record is clean enough But mine isn t Paul said Silas mournfully For the first time Paul bowed his head I m sorry said he I forgot Then he raised it again But that s all over and buried in the past It may be unburied How Don t you see cried Jane Even I can If you spring your relationship upon the public it will create an enormous sensation it will set the place on fire with curiosity They ll dig up everything they can about you everything they can about him Oh Paul don t you see It s up agin a man sonny said Barney Bill limping towards them it s up agin a candidate you understand him not being a Fenian or a Irish patriot that he s been in gaol Penal servitude ain t a nice state of life to be reminded of sonny Whereas if you leaves things as they is nobody s going to ask no questions That s my point said Silas Finn Paul looked from one to the other darkly In a kind of dull fierce passion he had made up his mind to clear himself before the world to rend to tatters his garments of romance to snap his fingers at the stars and destiny and such like deluding toys to stand a young Ajax defying the thunderbolts Here came the first check If they found out as how he d done time they d find out for why said Bill cocking his head earnestly As Paul engaged in sombre thought made no reply Silas turned away his hands uplifted in supplication and prayed aloud He had sinned in giving way to his anger He prostrated himself before the divine vengeance If this was his apportioned punishment might God give him meekness and strength to bear it The tremulous crying voice the rapt fanatical face and the beseeching attitude struck a bizarre note in the comfortable and worldly room Supported on either side by Jane helpless and anxious and Barney Bill crooked wrinkled with his close cropped white hair and little liquid diamond eyes still nervously tearing his hat brim he looked almost grotesque To Paul he seemed less a man than a creation of another planet with unknown and incalculable instincts and impulses who had come to earth and with foolish hand had wiped out the meaning of existence Yet he felt no resentment but rather a weary pity for the stranger blundering through an unsympathetic world As soon as there came a pause in the prayer he said not ungently The Almighty is not going to use me as an instrument to punish you if I can help it I quite appreciate your point I ll say nothing Barney Bill jerked his thumb towards the chair where the Princess had been sitting She won t give it away Paul smiled sadly No old man She ll keep it to herself That marked the end of the interview Paul accompanied the three downstairs I meant to act for the best Paul said Silas piteously on parting Tell me that I haven t made you my enemy God forbid said Paul He went slowly up to his room again and threw himself in his writing chair His eye fell upon the notes on the sheet of foolscap The Radical candidate having been chosen they were no longer relevant to his speech He crumpled up the paper and threw it into the waste paper basket His speech He held his head in both hands A couple of hours hence he would be addressing a vast audience the centre of the hopes of thousands of his fellow countrymen The thought beat upon his brain He had had the common nightmare of standing with conductor s baton in front of a mighty orchestra and being paralyzed by sense of impotence No less a nightmare was his present position A couple of hours ago he was athrill with confidence and joy of battle But then he was a different man The morning stars the stars of his destiny sang together in the ever deepening glamour of the Vision Splendid He was entering into the lists of Camelot to fight for his Princess He was the Mysterious Knight parented in fairy far Avilion the Fortunate Youth the Awakener of England Now he was but a base born young man who had attained a high position by false pretences an ordinary adventurer with a glib tongue a self educated self seeking commonplace fellow At least so he saw himself in his Princess s eyes And he had meant that she should thus behold him No longer was he entering lists to fight for her For what hopeless purpose was he entering them To awaken England The awakener must have his heart full of dreams and visions and glamour and joy and throbbing life and in his heart there was death He drew out the little cornelian talisman at the end of his watch chain and looked at it bitterly It was but a mocking symbol of illusion He unhooked it and laid it on the table He would carry it about with him no longer He would throw it away Ursula Winwood quietly entered the room You must come down and have something to eat before the meeting Paul rose I don t want anything thank you Miss Winwood But James and I do So come and join us Are you coming to the meeting he asked in surprise Of course She lifted her eyebrows Why not After what you have heard All the more reason for us to go She smiled as she had smiled on that memorable evening six years ago when she had stood with the horrible pawn ticket in her hand James has to support the Party I have to support you James will do the same as I in a day or two Just give him time His mind doesn t work very quickly not as quickly as a woman s Come she said When we have a breathing space you can tell me all about it But in the meantime I m pretty sure I understand How can you he asked wearily You have other traditions I don t know about traditions but I don t give my love and take it away again I set rather too much value on it I understand because I love you Others with the same traditions can t understand I m not proposing to marry you she said bluntly That makes a difference It does said he meeting her eyes unflinchingly If you weren t a brave man I shouldn t say such a thing to you Anyhow I understand you re the last man in the world who should take me for a fool My God said Paul in a choky voice What can I do to thank you Win the election You are still my dearest lady my very very dearest lady said he Her shrewd eyes fell upon the cornelian heart She picked it up and held it out to him on her plump palm Why have you taken this off your watch chain It s a little false god said he It s the first thing yon asked for when you recovered from your illness You said you had kept it since you were a tiny boy See I remember You set great value on it then I believed in it said Paul And now you don t But a woman gave it to you Yes said Paul wondering in his masculine way how the deuce she knew that I was a brat of eleven Then keep it Put it on your chain again I m sure it s a true little god Take it back to please me As there was nothing from lapping up Eisel to killing a crocodile that Paul would not have done in the fulness of his wondering gratitude for his dearest lady he meekly attached the heart to his chain and put it in his pocket I must tell you said he that the lady she seemed a goddess to me then chose me as her champion in a race a race of urchins at a Sunday school treat and I didn t win But she gave me the cornelian heart as a prize But as my champion you will win said Miss Winwood My dear boy she said and her eyes grew very tender as she laid her hand on the young man s arm believe what an old woman is telling you is true Don t throw away any little shred of beauty you ve ever had in your life The beautiful things are really the true ones though they may seem to be illusions Without the trinket or what it stood for would you be here now I don t know replied Paul I might have taken a more honest road to get here We took you to ourselves as a bright human being Paul not for what you might or might not have been By the way what have you decided as regards making public the fact of your relationship My father for his own reasons has urged me not to do so Miss Winwood drew a long breath I m glad to hear it she said So Paul comforted by one woman s amazing loyalty went out that evening and addressed his great meeting But the roar of applause that welcomed him echoed through void spaces of his being He felt neither thrill nor fear The speech prepared by the Fortunate Youth was delivered by a stranger to it glowing and dancing eloquence The words came trippingly enough but the informing Spirit was gone Those in the audience familiar with the magic of his smile were disappointed The soundness of his policy satisfied the hard headed but he made no appeal to the imaginative If his speech did not fall flat it was not the clarion voice that his supporters had anticipated They whispered together with depressed headshakings Their man was not in form He was nervous What he said was right enough but his utterance lacked fire It carried conviction to those already convinced but it could make no proselytes Had they been mistaken in their choice Too young a man hadn t he bitten off a hunk greater than he could chew So the inner ring of local politicians An election audience however brings its own enthusiasms and it must be a very dull dog indeed who damps their ardour They cheered prodigiously when Paul sat down and a crowd of zealots waiting outside the building cheered him again as he drove off But Paul knew that he had been a failure He had delivered another man s speech To morrow and the day after and the day after that and ever afterwards if he held to the political game he would have to speak in his own new person What kind of a person would the new Paul be He drove back almost in silence with the Colonel and Miss Winwood vainly seeking to solve the problem The foundations of his life had been swept away His foot rested on nothing solid save his own manhood That no shock should break down He would fight He would win the election He set his lips in grim determination If life held no higher meaning it at least offered this immediate object for existence Besides he owed the most strenuous effort of his soul to the devoted and loyal woman whose face he saw dimly opposite Afterwards come what might The Truth at any rate Magna est veritas et praevalebit These were prave orts and valorous protestations But when their light supper was over and Colonel Winwood had retired Ursula Winwood lingered in the dining room her heart aching for the boy who looked so stern and haggard She came behind him and touched his hair Poor boy she murmured Then Paul he was very young barely thirty broke down as perhaps she meant that he should and elbows sprawling amid the disarray of the meal poured out all the desolation of his soul and for the first time cried out in anguish for the woman he had lost So as love lay a bleeding mortally pierced Ursula Winwood wept unaccustomed tears and with tender fingers strove to staunch the wound 
7594_81881_000002_000000	train-clean-360	CHAPTER XIX
none	none	 DAYS of strain followed days of a thousand engagements a thousand interviews a thousand journeyings a thousand speeches days in which he was reduced to an unresisting automaton mechanically uttering the same formulas days in which the irresistible force of the campaign swept him along without volition And day followed day and not a sign came from the Princess Zobraska either of condonation or resentment It was as though she had gathered her skirts around her and gone disdainfully out of his life for ever If speaking were to be done it was for her to speak 
7594_81881_000003_000004	train-clean-360	Paul could not plead 
7594_81881_000003_000005	train-clean-360	It was he who in a way had cast her off 
none	none	In effect he had issued the challenge I am a child of the gutter an adventurer masquerading under an historical name and you are a royal princess Will you marry me now She had given her answer by walking out of the room her proud head in the air 
7594_81881_000003_000008	train-clean-360	It was final as far as he was concerned 
7594_81881_000003_000009	train-clean-360	He could do nothing not even beg his dearest lady to plead for him 
none	none	Besides rumour had it that the Princess had cancelled her town engagements and gone to Morebury So he walked in cold and darkness uninspired and though he worked with feverish energy the heart and purpose of his life were gone 
7594_81881_000004_000000	train-clean-360	As in his first speech so in his campaign he failed 
7594_81881_000004_000001	train-clean-360	He had been chosen for his youth his joyousness his magnetism his radiant promise of great things to come 
7594_81881_000004_000002	train-clean-360	He went about the constituency an anxious haggard man working himself to death without being able to awaken a spark of emotion in the heart of anybody 
none	none	He lost ground daily 
7594_81881_000004_000004	train-clean-360	On the other hand Silas Finn with his enthusiasms and his aspect of an inspired prophet made alarming progress 
7594_81881_000004_000005	train-clean-360	He swept the multitude 
none	none	Paul Savelli the young man of the social moment had an army of helpers members of Parliament making speeches friends on the Unionist press writing flamboyant leaders fair ladies in automobiles hunting for voters through the slums of Hickney Heath Silas Finn had scarcely a personal friend 
7594_81881_000004_000008	train-clean-360	But hope reigned among his official supporters whereas depression began to descend over Paul s brilliant host 
7594_81881_000005_000000	train-clean-360	 They want stirring up a bit said the Conservative agent despondently 
none	none	I hear old Finn s meetings go with a bang 
7594_81881_000005_000002	train-clean-360	They nearly raised the roof off last night 
none	none	We want some roof raising on this side
7594_81881_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 I do my best said Paul coldly but the reproach cut deep 
none	none	He was a failure No nervous or intellectual effort could save him now though he spent himself to the last heartbeat He was the sport of a mocking Will o the Wisp which he had taken for Destiny 
7594_81881_000007_000000	train-clean-360	Once on coming out of his headquarters he met Silas who was walking up the street with two or three of his committee men 
none	none	In accordance with the ordinary amenities of English political life the two candidates shook hands and withdrew a pace or two aside to chat for a while 
7594_81881_000007_000002	train-clean-360	This was the first time they had come together since the afternoon of revelation and there was a moment of constraint during which Silas tugged at his streaked beard and looked with mournful wistfulness at his son 
none	none	I wish I were not your opponent Paul said he in a low voice so as not to be overheard That doesn t matter a bit Paul replied courteously
7594_81881_000009_000001	train-clean-360	 I see you re putting up an excellent fight 
7594_81881_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 It s the Lord s battle 
7594_81881_000010_000001	train-clean-360	If it weren t do you think I would not let you win 
7594_81881_000011_000000	train-clean-360	The same old cry 
7594_81881_000011_000001	train-clean-360	Through sheer repetition Paul began almost to believe in it 
none	none	He felt very weary 
7594_81881_000011_000003	train-clean-360	In his father s eyes he recognized with a pang the glow of a faith which he had lost 
none	none	Their likeness struck him and he saw himself his old self beneath the unquestioning though sorrowful eyes
7594_81881_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 That s the advantage of a belief in the Almighty s personal interest he answered with a touch of irony whatever happens one is not easily disillusioned 
7594_81881_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 That is true my son said Silas 
7594_81881_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 Jane is well Paul asked after an instant s pause breaking off the profitless discussion 
none	none	Very well And Barney Bill
7594_81881_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 He upbraids me bitterly for what I have said 
7594_81881_000018_000000	train-clean-360	Paul smiled at the curiously stilted phrase 
7594_81881_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 Tell him from me not to do it 
7594_81881_000019_000001	train-clean-360	My love to them both 
7594_81881_000020_000000	train-clean-360	They shook hands again and Paul drove off in the motor car that had been placed at his disposal during the election and Silas continued his sober walk with his committee men up the muddy street 
7594_81881_000020_000001	train-clean-360	Whereupon Paul conceived a sudden hatred for the car 
7594_81881_000020_000002	train-clean-360	It was but the final artistic touch to this comedy of mockery of which he had been the victim 
none	none	Perhaps God was on his father s side after all on the side of them who humbly walked and not of them who rode in proud chariots But his political creed his sociological convictions rose in protest How could the Almighty be in league with all that was subversive of social order all that was destructive to Imperial cohesion all that which inevitably tended to England s downfall 
7594_81881_000021_000000	train-clean-360	He turned suddenly to his companion the Conservative agent 
none	none	Do you think God has got common sense 
7594_81881_000023_000000	train-clean-360	The agent not being versed in speculations regarding the attributes of the Deity stared then disinclined to commit himself took refuge in platitude 
none	none	God moves in a mysterious way mister Savelli
7594_81881_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 That s rot said Paul 
7594_81881_000025_000001	train-clean-360	 If there s an Almighty He must move in a common sense way otherwise the whole of this planet would have busted up long ago 
none	none	Do you think it s common sense to support the present Government
7594_81881_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 Certainly not said the agent fervently 
7594_81881_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 Then if God supported it it wouldn t be common sense on His part 
7594_81881_000027_000001	train-clean-360	It would be merely mysterious 
none	none	I see what you re driving at said the agent
7594_81881_000028_000001	train-clean-360	 Our opponent undoubtedly has been making free with the name of the Almighty in his speeches 
7594_81881_000028_000002	train-clean-360	As a matter of fact he s rather crazy on the subject 
7594_81881_000028_000003	train-clean-360	I don t think it would be a bad move to make a special reference to it 
7594_81881_000028_000004	train-clean-360	It s all damned hypocrisy 
7594_81881_000028_000005	train-clean-360	There s a chap in the old French play what s his name 
none	none	Tartuffe That s it Well there you are That speech of his yesterday now why don t you take it and wring religiosity and hypocrisy and Tartuffism out of it You know how to do that sort of thing 
7594_81881_000030_000004	train-clean-360	You can score tremendously 
7594_81881_000030_000005	train-clean-360	I never thought of it before 
7594_81881_000030_000006	train-clean-360	By George you can get him in the neck if you like 
7594_81881_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 But I don t like said Paul 
none	none	I happen to know that mister Finn is sincere in his convictions But my dear sir what does his supposed sincerity matter in political contest
7594_81881_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 It s the difference between dirt and cleanliness said Paul Besides as I told you at the outset mister Finn and I are close personal friends and I have the highest regard for his character 
none	none	He has seen that his side has scrupulously refrained from personalities with regard to me and I insist on the same observance with regard to him With all due deference to you mister Savelli you were called only the day before yesterday the spoiled darling of Duchesses boudoirs
7594_81881_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 It wasn t with mister Finn s cognizance 
none	none	I ve found that out Well said the agent leaning back in the luxurious limousine I don t see why somebody without your cognizance shouldn t call mister Finn the spoiled minion of the Almighty s ante chamber 
7594_81881_000036_000001	train-clean-360	That s a devilish good catch phrase he added starting forward in the joy of his newborn epigram Devilish good 
7594_81881_000036_000002	train-clean-360	 The spoiled minion of the Almighty s ante chamber It ll become historical 
7594_81881_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 If it does said Paul it will be associated with the immediate retirement of the Conservative candidate 
none	none	Do you really mean that 
7594_81881_000039_000000	train-clean-360	It was Paul s turn to start forward 
7594_81881_000039_000001	train-clean-360	 My dear Wilson said he if you or anybody else thinks I m a man to talk through his hat I ll retire at once 
7594_81881_000039_000002	train-clean-360	I don t care a damn about myself 
7594_81881_000039_000003	train-clean-360	Not a little tuppenny damn What the devil does it matter to me whether I get into Parliament or not 
none	none	Nothing 
7594_81881_000039_000005	train-clean-360	Not a tuppenny damn 
7594_81881_000039_000006	train-clean-360	You can t understand 
7594_81881_000039_000007	train-clean-360	It s the party and the country 
7594_81881_000039_000008	train-clean-360	For myself personally the whole thing can go to blazes 
none	none	I m in earnest dead earnest he continued with a vehemence incomprehensible to Wilson If anybody doesn t think so I ll clear out at once he snapped his fingers
7594_81881_000039_000011	train-clean-360	 But while I m candidate everything I say I mean 
7594_81881_000039_000012	train-clean-360	I mean it intensely with all my soul 
none	none	And I say that if there s a single insulting reference to mister Finn during this election you ll be up against the wreck of your own political career 
7594_81881_000040_000000	train-clean-360	The agent watched the workings of his candidate s dark clear cut face He was very proud of his candidate and found it difficult to realize that there were presumably sane people who would not vote for him on sight 
7594_81881_000040_000001	train-clean-360	A lingering memory of grammar school days flashed on him when he told his wife later of the conversation and he likened Paul to a wrathful Apollo 
none	none	Anxious to appease the god he said humbly
7594_81881_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 It was the merest of suggestions mister Savelli 
7594_81881_000041_000001	train-clean-360	Heaven knows we don t want to descend to personalities and your retirement would be an unqualifiable disaster 
7594_81881_000041_000002	train-clean-360	But you ll pardon my mentioning it you began this discussion by asking me whether the Almighty had common sense 
7594_81881_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 Well has He or not 
7594_81881_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 Of course said Wilson 
none	none	Then we re going to win this election said Paul 
7594_81881_000045_000000	train-clean-360	If he could have met enthusiasm with enthusiasm all would have been well 
7594_81881_000045_000001	train-clean-360	The awakener of England could have captivated hearts by glowing pictures of a great and glorious future 
7594_81881_000045_000002	train-clean-360	It would have been a counter blaze to that lit by his opponent which flamed in all the effulgence of a reckless reformer s promise revealing a Utopia in which there would be no drunkenness no crime no poverty and in which the rich apparently would have to work very hard in order to support the poor in comfortable idleness 
7594_81881_000045_000003	train-clean-360	But beyond proving fallacies Paul could do nothing and even then has there ever been a mob since the world began susceptible to logical argument 
7594_81881_000045_000004	train-clean-360	So all through the wintry days of the campaign Silas Finn carried his fiery cross through the constituency winning frenzied adherents while Paul found it hard to rally the faithful round the drooping standard of saint George 
none	none	The days went on 
7594_81881_000046_000001	train-clean-360	Paul addressed his last meeting on the eve of the poll 
7594_81881_000046_000002	train-clean-360	By a supreme effort he regained some of his former fire and eloquence 
7594_81881_000046_000003	train-clean-360	He drove home exhausted and going straight to bed slept like a dog till morning 
7594_81881_000047_000000	train-clean-360	The servant who woke him brought a newspaper to the bedside 
7594_81881_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 Something to interest you sir 
7594_81881_000049_000000	train-clean-360	Paul looked at the headline indicated by the man 
7594_81881_000050_000000	train-clean-360	 Hickney Heath Election 
7594_81881_000050_000001	train-clean-360	Liberal Candidate s Confession 
none	none	Extraordinary Scene He glanced hurriedly down the column and read with amazement and stabbing pain the matter that was of interest The worst had happened the thing which during all his later life Silas Finn had feared 
7594_81881_000051_000002	train-clean-360	The spectre of the prison had risen up against him 
7594_81881_000052_000000	train-clean-360	Towards the end of Silas Finn s speech at his last great meeting a man sitting in the body of the hall near the platform got up and interrupted him 
7594_81881_000052_000001	train-clean-360	 What about your own past life 
none	none	What about your three years penal servitude All eyes were turned from the man a common looking evil man to the candidate who staggered as if he had been shot caught at the table behind him for support and stared in greyfaced terror 
7594_81881_000052_000003	train-clean-360	There was an angry tumult and the interrupter would have fared badly but for Silas Finn holding up his hand and imploring silence 
7594_81881_000053_000000	train-clean-360	 I challenge the candidate to deny said the man as soon as he could be heard that his real name is Silas Kegworthy and that he underwent three years penal servitude for murderously assaulting his wife 
7594_81881_000054_000000	train-clean-360	Then the candidate braced himself and said The bare facts are true But I have lived stainlessly in the fear of God and in the service of humanity for thirty years 
7594_81881_000054_000001	train-clean-360	I have sought absolution for a moment of mad anger under awful provocation in unremitting prayer and in trying to save the souls and raise the fortunes of my fellow men 
7594_81881_000054_000002	train-clean-360	Is that all you have against me 
7594_81881_000055_000000	train-clean-360	 That s all said the man 
7594_81881_000056_000000	train-clean-360	 It is for you electors of Hickney Heath to judge me 
7594_81881_000057_000000	train-clean-360	He sat down amid tumultuous cheers and the man who had interrupted him after some rough handling managed to make his escape 
7594_81881_000057_000001	train-clean-360	The chairman then put a vote of confidence in the candidate which was carried by acclamation and the meeting broke up 
7594_81881_000058_000000	train-clean-360	Such were the essential facts in the somewhat highly coloured newspaper story which Paul read in stupefied horror 
7594_81881_000058_000001	train-clean-360	He dressed quickly and went to his sitting room where he rang up his father s house on the telephone 
7594_81881_000058_000002	train-clean-360	Jane s voice met his ear 
7594_81881_000059_000000	train-clean-360	 It s Paul speaking he replied 
none	none	I ve just this moment read of last night I m shaken to my soul 
7594_81881_000059_000003	train-clean-360	How is my father 
7594_81881_000060_000000	train-clean-360	 He s greatly upset came the voice 
none	none	He didn t sleep all night and he s not at all well this morning 
7594_81881_000060_000002	train-clean-360	Oh it was a cruel cowardly blow 
none	none	Dastardly Do you know who it was
7594_81881_000062_000000	train-clean-360	 No Don t you 
none	none	I 
7594_81881_000063_000001	train-clean-360	Does either of you think that I 
7594_81881_000064_000000	train-clean-360	 No no came the voice now curiously tearful 
7594_81881_000064_000001	train-clean-360	 I didn t mean that 
7594_81881_000064_000002	train-clean-360	I forgot you ve not had time to find out 
none	none	Who does he think it was Some old fellow prisoner who had a grudge against him
7594_81881_000067_000000	train-clean-360	 Were you at the meeting 
none	none	Yes 
7594_81881_000068_000001	train-clean-360	Oh Paul it was splendid to see him face the audience 
7594_81881_000068_000002	train-clean-360	He spoke so simply and with such sorrowful dignity 
none	none	He had their sympathy at once 
7594_81881_000068_000004	train-clean-360	But it has broken him 
none	none	I m afraid he ll never be the same man again After all these years it s dreadful
7594_81881_000069_000000	train-clean-360	 It s all that s damnable 
7594_81881_000069_000001	train-clean-360	It s tragic 
none	none	Give him my love and tell him that words can t express my sorrow and indignation He rang off 
7594_81881_000070_000001	train-clean-360	Almost immediately Wilson was announced 
7594_81881_000070_000002	train-clean-360	He came into the room radiant 
7594_81881_000071_000000	train-clean-360	 You were right about the divine common sensicality said he 
none	none	The Lord has delivered our adversary into our hands with a vengeance 
7594_81881_000072_000000	train-clean-360	He was a chubby little man of forty with coarse black hair and scrubby moustache not of the type that readily appreciates the delicacies of a situation 
none	none	Paul conceived a sudden loathing for him
7594_81881_000073_000000	train-clean-360	 I would give anything for it not to have happened he said 
7594_81881_000074_000000	train-clean-360	Wilson opened his eyes 
none	none	Why It s our salvation 
7594_81881_000074_000003	train-clean-360	An ex convict it s enough to damn any candidate 
7594_81881_000074_000004	train-clean-360	But we want to make sure 
7594_81881_000074_000005	train-clean-360	Now I ve got an idea 
7594_81881_000075_000000	train-clean-360	Paul turned on him angrily 
7594_81881_000075_000001	train-clean-360	 I ll have no capital made out of it whatsoever 
7594_81881_000075_000002	train-clean-360	It s a foul thing to bring such an accusation up against a man who has lived a spotless life for thirty years 
none	none	Everything in me goes out in sympathy with him and I ll let it be known all through the constituency If you take it that way said Wilson there s no more to be done
7594_81881_000077_000000	train-clean-360	 There s nothing to be done except to find out who put up the man to make the announcement 
7594_81881_000078_000000	train-clean-360	 He did it on his own Wilson replied warmly 
7594_81881_000078_000001	train-clean-360	 None of our people would resort to a dirty trick like that 
none	none	And yet you want me to take advantage of it now it s done
7594_81881_000080_000000	train-clean-360	 That s quite a different matter 
7594_81881_000081_000000	train-clean-360	 I can t see much difference said Paul 
none	none	So Wilson seeing that his candidate was more unmanageable than ever presently departed and Paul sat down to breakfast 
7594_81881_000082_000001	train-clean-360	But he could not eat 
7594_81881_000082_000002	train-clean-360	He was both stricken with shame and moved to the depths by immense pity 
none	none	Far removed from him as Silas Finn was in mode of life and ideals he found much in common with his father 
7594_81881_000082_000004	train-clean-360	Each had made his way from the slum each had been guided by an inner light was Silas Finn s fantastic belief less of an ignis fatuus than his own each had sought to get away from a past each was a child of Ishmael each in his own way had lived romantically 
none	none	Whatever resentment against his father lingered in his heart now melted away 
7594_81881_000082_000006	train-clean-360	He was very near him 
7594_81881_000082_000007	train-clean-360	The shame of the prison struck him as it had struck the old man 
7594_81881_000082_000008	train-clean-360	He saw him bowed down under the blow and he clenched his hands in a torture of anger and indignation 
7594_81881_000082_000009	train-clean-360	And to crown all came the intolerable conviction in the formation of which Wilson s triumphant words had not been necessary that if he won the election it would be due to this public dishonouring of his own father 
7594_81881_000082_000010	train-clean-360	He walked about the room in despair and at last halted before the mantelpiece on which still stood the photograph of the Princess in its silver frame 
7594_81881_000082_000011	train-clean-360	Suddenly he remembered that he had not told her of this incident in his family history 
none	none	She too would be reading her newspaper this morning 
7594_81881_000082_000013	train-clean-360	He saw her proud lips curl 
none	none	The son of a gaol bird 
7594_81881_000082_000015	train-clean-360	He tore the photograph from its frame and threw it into the fire and watched it burn 
none	none	As the paper writhed under the heat the lips seemed to twist into sad reproach He turned away impatiently That romantic madness was over and done with 
7594_81881_000082_000019	train-clean-360	He had far sterner things to do than shriek his heart out over a woman in an alien star 
7594_81881_000082_000020	train-clean-360	He had his life to reconstruct in the darkness threatening and mocking but at last he had truth for a foundation on that he would build in defiance of the world 
7594_81881_000083_000000	train-clean-360	In the midst of these fine thoughts it occurred to him that he had hidden the prison episode in his father s career from the Winwoods as well as from the Princess 
none	none	His cheeks flushed it was one more strain on the loyalty of these dear devoted friends 
7594_81881_000083_000002	train-clean-360	He went downstairs and found the Colonel and Miss Winwood in the dining room 
7594_81881_000083_000003	train-clean-360	Their faces were grave 
7594_81881_000083_000004	train-clean-360	He came to them with outstretched arms a familiar gesture one doubtless inherited from his Sicilian ancestry 
none	none	You see what has happened I knew all the time 
7594_81881_000084_000002	train-clean-360	I didn t tell you 
7594_81881_000084_000003	train-clean-360	You must forgive me 
7594_81881_000085_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t blame you my boy said Colonel Winwood 
none	none	It was your father s secret 
7594_81881_000085_000002	train-clean-360	You had no right to tell us 
none	none	We re very grieved dear for both your sakes Ursula added James has taken the liberty of sending round a message of sympathy As ever these two had gone a point beyond his anticipation of their loyalty 
7594_81881_000087_000001	train-clean-360	He thanked them simply 
7594_81881_000088_000000	train-clean-360	 It s hateful said he to think I may win the election on account of this 
7594_81881_000088_000001	train-clean-360	It s loathsome He shuddered 
7594_81881_000089_000000	train-clean-360	 I quite agree with you said the Colonel 
7594_81881_000089_000001	train-clean-360	 But in politics one has often to put up with hateful things in order to serve one s country That s the sacrifice a high minded man is called upon to make 
7594_81881_000090_000000	train-clean-360	 Besides said Miss Winwood let us hope it won t affect votes 
7594_81881_000090_000001	train-clean-360	All the papers say that the vote of confidence was passed amid scenes of enthusiasm 
none	none	Paul smiled 
7594_81881_000091_000001	train-clean-360	They understood 
7594_81881_000091_000002	train-clean-360	A little while later they drove off with him to his committee room in the motor car gay with his colours 
none	none	There was still much to be done that day CHAPTER XX HICKNEY HEATH blazed with excitement It is not every day that a thrill runs through a dull London borough not even every election day For a London borough unlike a country town has very little corporate life of its own You cannot get up as much enthusiasm for Kilburn say as a social or historical entity as you can for Winchester or Canterbury You may perform civic duties if you are public spirited enough with business like zeal and if you are borough councillor you may be proud of the nice new public baths which you have been instrumental in presenting to the community But the ordinary man in the street no more cares for Kilburn than he does for Highgate He would move from one to the other without a pang For neither s glory would he shed a drop of his blood Only at election times does it occur to him that he is one of a special brotherhood isolated from the rest of London and even then he regards the constituency as a convention defining geographical limits for the momentary range of his political passions So that the day when an electric thrill ran through the whole of Hickney Heath was a rare one in its uninspiring annals The dramatic had happened touching the most sluggish imaginations The Liberal candidate for Parliament a respected Borough Councillor a notorious Evangelical preacher had publicly confessed himself an ex convict Every newspaper in London and for the matter of that every newspaper in Great Britain rang with the story and every man woman and child in Hickney Heath read feverishly every newspaper morning and evening they could lay their hands on Also every man woman and child in Hickney Heath asked his neighbour for further details All who could leave desk and shop or factory poured into the streets to learn the latest tidings Around the various polling stations the crowd was thickest Those electors who had been present at Silas Finn s meeting the night before told the story at first hand to eager groups Rumours of every sort spread through the mob The man who had put the famous question was an agent of the Tories It was a smart party move Silas Finn had all the time been leading a double life Depravities without number were laid to his charge Even now the police were inquiring into his connection with certain burglaries that had taken place in the neighbourhood And where was he that day Who had seen him He was at home drunk He had committed suicide Even if he hadn t and was elected he would not be allowed to take his seat in Parliament On the other hand those in whose Radical bosoms burned fierce hatred for the Tories spoke loud in condemnation of their cowardly tactics There was considerable free fighting in the ordinarily dismal and decorous streets of Hickney Heath Noisy acclamations hailed the automobiles carriages and waggonettes bringing voters of both parties to the polls Paul driving in his gaily decked car about the constituency shared all these demonstrations and heard these rumours The latter he denied and caused to be denied as far as lay in his power In the broad High Street thronged with folk and dissonant with tram cars and motor buses he came upon a quarrelsome crowd looking up at a window above a poulterer s shop from which hung something white like a strip of wall paper Approaching he perceived that it bore a crude drawing of a convict and Good old Dartmoor for legend White with anger he stopped the car leaped out on to the curb and pushing his way through the crowd entered the shop He seized one of the white coated assistants by the arm Show me the way to that first floor room he cried fiercely The assistant half dragged half leading and wholly astonished took him through the shop and pointed to the staircase Paul sprang up and dashed through the door into the room which appeared to be some business office Three or four young men who turned grinning from the window he thrust aside and plucking the offending strip from the drawing pins which secured it to the sill he tore it across and across You cads You brutes he shouted trampling on the fragments Can t you fight like Englishmen The young men realizing the identity of the wrathful apparition stared open mouthed turned red and said nothing Paul strode out looking very fierce and drove off in his car amid the cheers of the crowd to which he paid no notice It makes me sick he cried passionately to Wilson who was with him I hope to God he wins in spite of it What about the party asked Wilson Paul damned the party He was in the overwrought mood in which a man damns everything Quagmire and bramble and the derision of Olympus that was the end of his vanity of an existence Suppose he was elected what then He would be a failure the high gods in their mirth would see to that a puppet in Frank Ayres hands until the next general election when he would have ignominiously to retire Awakener of England indeed He could not even awaken Hickney Heath As he dashed through the streets in his triumphal car he hated Hickney Heath hated the wild hoorays of waggon loads of his supporters on their way to the polls hated the smug smiles of his committee men at polling stations He forgot that he did not hate England A little black disk an inch or two in diameter if cunningly focussed can obscure the sun in heaven from human eye There was England still behind the little black disk though Paul for the moment saw it not Wilson pulled his scrubby moustache and made no retort to Paul s anathema To him Paul was one of the fine flower of the Upper Classes to which lower middle class England still with considerable justification believes to be imbued with incomprehensible and unalterable principles of conduct The grand old name of gentleman still has its magic in this country and is by the way not without its influence in one or two mighty republics wherein the equality of man is very loudly proclaimed Wilson therefore gladly suffered Paul s lunatic Quixotry For himself he approved hugely of the cartoon If he could have had his way Hickney Heath would have flamed with poster reproductions of it But he had a dim appreciation of and a sneaking admiration for the aristocrat s point of view and being a practical man evaded a discussion on the ethics of the situation The situation was rendered more extraordinary because the Liberal candidate made no appearance in the constituency Paul inquired anxiously No one had seen him After lunch he drove alone to his father s house The parlour maid showed him into the hideously furnished and daub hung dining room The Viennese horrors of plaster stags gnomes and rabbits stared fatuously on the hearth No fire was in the grate Very soon Jane entered tidy almost matronly in buxom primness her hair as faultless as if it had come out of a convoluted mould her grave eyes full of light She gave him her capable hand It s like you to come Paul It s only decent My father hasn t shown up What s the matter with him It s a bit of a nervous breakdown she said looking at him steadily Nothing serious But the doctor I sent for him says he had better rest and his committee people thought it wiser for him not to show himself Can I see him Certainly not A look of alarm came into her face You re both too excited What would you say to him I d tell him what I feel about the whole matter Yes You would fling your arms about and he would talk about God and a precious lot of good it would do to anybody No thank you I m in charge of mister Finn s health It was the old Jane so familiar I wish said he with a smile I wish I had had your common sense to guide me all these years If you had you would now be a clerk in the City earning thirty shillings a week And perhaps a happier man Bosh my dear Paul she said shaking her head slowly Rot Rubbish I know you too well You adding up figures at thirty shillings a week with a common sense wife for I suppose you mean that mending your socks and rocking the cradle in a second floor back in Hickney Heath No my dear she paused for a second or two and her lips twitched oddly common sense would have been the death of you He laughed in spite of himself It was so true Common sense might have screwed him to a thirty shillings a week desk the fantastic had brought him to that very house a candidate for Parliament in a thousand guinea motor car On the other hand and his laughter faded from his eyes the fantastic in his life was dead Henceforward common sense would hold him in her cold and unstimulating clasp He said something of the sort to Jane Once more she ejaculated Rot rubbish and bosh and they quarrelled as they had done in their childhood You talk as if I didn t know you inside out my dear Paul she said in her clear unsmiling way Listen All men are donkeys aren t they For the sake of argument I agree Well there are two kinds of donkeys One kind is meek and mild and will go wherever it is driven The other in order to get along must always have a bunch of carrots dangling before its eyes That s you But confound it all he cried I ve lost my carrots can t you see I ll never have any carrots again That s the whole damned tragedy For the first time she smiled the smile of the woman wiser in certain subtle things than the man My dear she said carrots are cheap She paused for an instant and added Thank God Paul squeezed her arms affectionately and they moved apart He sighed They re the most precious things in the world said he The most precious things in the world are those which you can get for nothing said Jane You re a dear said he and a comfort Presently he left her and returned to his weary round of the constituency feeling of stouter heart with a greater faith in the decent ordering of mundane things A world containing such women as Jane and Ursula Winwood possessed elements of sanity Outside one of the polling stations he found Barney Bill holding forth excitedly to a knot of working men He ceased as the car drove up and cast back a broad proud smile at the candidate s warm greeting I got up the old bus so nice and proper with all your colours and posters and it would have been a spectacular Diorama for these ere poor people but you know for why I didn t bring it out to day don t you sonny I know dear old friend said Paul I adn t the cart to What were you speechifying about when I turned up Barney Bill jerked a backward thumb I was telling this pack of cowardly Radicals that though I ve been a Tory born and bred for sixty odd years and though I ve voted for you Silas Finn for all he was in prison while most of them were sucking wickedness and Radicalism out of Nature s founts is just as good a man as what you are They was saying yer see they was Radicals but on account of Silas being blown upon they was going to vote for you So I tells em I says mister Savelli would scorn your dirty votes If yer feel low and Radical vote Radical mister Savelli wants to play fair I know both of em I says both of em intimately And they begins to laugh as if I was talking through my hat Anyway they see now I know you sonny Paul laughed and clapped the loyal old man on the shoulder Then he turned to the silent but interested group Gentlemen said he I don t want to inquire on which side you are but you can take it from me that whatever my old friend mister Simmons says about mister Finn and myself is the absolute truth If you re on mister Finn s side in politics in God s name vote for him He s a noble high souled man and I m proud of his private friendship He drew Barney Bill apart You re the only Tory in the place who can try to persuade people not to vote for me I wish you would keep on doing it I ve been a doing of it ever since the polls opened this morning said Barney Bill Then he cocked his head on one side and his little eyes twinkled It s an upside down way of fighting an election to persuade people not to vote for you isn t it Everything is topsy turvy with me these days Paul replied so we ve just got to stand on our heads and make the best of it And he drove off in the gathering dusk Night found him in the great chamber of the Town Hall with his agent and members of his committee Present too were the Liberal Agent and the members of the Liberal Committee At one end of the room sat the Mayor of the Borough in robe and chain of office presiding over the proceedings The Returning Officer and his staff sat behind long tables on which were deposited the sealed ballot boxes brought in from the various polling stations and these were emptied and the votes were counted the voting papers for each candidate being done up in bundles of fifty Knots of committee men of both parties stood chatting in low voices In an ordinary election both candidates would have chatted together in ninety nine cases out of a hundred about golf and would have made an engagement to meet again in milder conflict that day week But here Paul was the only candidate to appear and he sat in a cane bottomed chair apart from the lounging politicians feeling curiously an interloper in this vast solemn and scantily filled hall He was very tired too tired in body mind and soul to join in the small talk of Wilson and his bodyguard Besides they all wore the air of anticipated victory and for that he held them in detestation He had detested them the whole day long The faces that yesterday had been long and anxious to day had been wreathed in smirks Wherever he had gone he had found promise of victory in his father s disgrace Passionately the young man fronting vital issues longed for his own defeat But for the ironical interposition of the high gods it might have been so different Any other candidate against him he himself buoyed up with his own old glorious faith his Princess dazzling meteor illuminating the murky streets dear God what would not have been the joy of battle during the past week what would not have been the intense thrill the living of a thousand lives in these few hours of suspense now so dull with dreariness and pain He sat apart his legs crossed a hand over his eyes Wilson and his men puzzled by his apparent apathy left him alone It is not much use addressing a mute and wooden idol no matter how physically prepossessing The counting went on slowly relentlessly and the bundles of fifty on each side grew in bulk and Paul s side bulked larger than Silas Finn s At last Wilson could stand it no longer He left the group with which he was talking and came to Paul We re far ahead already he cried excitedly I told you last night would do the trick Last night said Paul rising and stuffing his hands in his jacket pockets my opponent s supporters passed a vote of confidence in him in a scene of tumultuous enthusiasm Quite so replied Wilson A crowd is generous and easily swayed A theatrical audience of scalliwags and thieves will howl applause at the triumph of virtue and the downfall of the villain and each separate member will go out into the street and begin to practise villainy and say to hell with virtue If last night s meeting could have polled on the spot they would have been as one man To day they re scattered and each individual revises his excited opinion Your hard bitten Radical would sooner have a self made man than an aristocrat to represent him in Parliament but damn it all he d sooner have an aristocrat than an ex convict But who the devil told you I m an aristocrat cried Paul Wilson laughed Who wants to be told such an obvious thing Anyhow you ve only got to look and you ll see how the votes are piling up Paul looked and saw that Wilson spoke truly Then he reflected that Wilson and the others who had worked so strenuously for him had no part in his own personal depression They deserved a manifestation of interest also expressions of gratitude So Paul pulled himself together and went amongst them and was responsive to their prophecies of victory Then just as the last votes were being counted an official attendant came in with a letter for Paul It had been brought by messenger The writing on the envelope was Jane s He tore it open and read mister Finn is dying He has had a stroke The doctor says he can t live through the night Come as soon as you can JANE Outside the Town Hall the wide street was packed with people Men surged up to the hollow square of police guarding the approach to the flight of steps and the great entrance door Men swarmed about the electric standards above the heads of their fellows Men rose in a long tier with their backs to the shop fronts on the opposite side of the road In spite of the raw night the windows were open and the arc lights revealed a ghostly array of faces looking down on the mass below whose faces in their turn were lit up by the more yellow glare streaming from the doors and uncurtained windows of the Town Hall In the lobby behind the glass doors could be seen a few figures going and coming committee men journalists officials A fine rain began to fall but the crowd did not heed it The mackintosh capes of the policemen glistened It was an orderly crowd held together by tense excitement all eyes fixed on the silent illuminated building whence the news would come Across one window on the second floor was a large white patch blank and sphinx like At right angles to one end of the block ran the High Street and the tall blazing trams passed up and down and all eyes in the trams strained for a transient glimpse of the patch hoping that it would flare out into message Presently a man was seen to dash from the interior of the hall into the lobby casting words at the waiting figures who clamoured eagerly and disappeared within just as the man broke through the folding doors and appeared at the top of the steps beneath the portico The great crowd surged and groaned and the word was quickly passed from rank to rank Savelli Thirteen hundred and seventy majority And then there burst out wild cheers and the crowd broke into a myriad little waves like a choppy sea Men danced and shouted and clapped each other on the back and the tall facade of the street opposite the hall was a flutter Suddenly the white patch leaped into an illumination proclaiming the figures Savelli six thousand one hundred thirty five Finn four thousand seven hundred sixty five Again the wild cheering rose and then the great double windows in the centre of the first floor of the Town Hall were flung open and Paul surrounded by the mayor and officials appeared Paul gripped the iron hand rail and looked down upon the tumultuous scene his ears deafened by the roar his eyes dazed by the conflicting lights and the million swift reflections from moving faces and arms and hats and handkerchiefs The man is not born who can receive unmoved a frenzied public ovation A lump rose in his throat After all this delirium of joy was sincere He stood for the moment the idol of the populace For him this vast concourse of human beings had waited in rain and mud and now became a deafening seething welter of human passion He gripped the rail tighter and closed his eyes He heard as in a dream the voice of the mayor behind him Say a few words They won t hear you but that doesn t matter Then Paul drew himself up facing the whirling scene He sought in his pockets and suddenly shot up his hand holding a letter and awaited a lull in the uproar He was master of himself now He had indeed words to say deliberately prepared and he knew that if he could get a hearing he would say them as deliberately At last came comparative calm Gentlemen said he with a motion of the letter my opponent is dying He paused The words so unexpected so strangely different from the usual exordium seemed to pass from line to line through the crowd I am speaking in the presence of death said Paul and paused again And a hush spread like a long wave across the street and the thronged windows last of all grew still and silent I will ask you to hear me out for I have something very grave to say And his voice rang loud and clear Last night my opponent was forced to admit that nearly thirty years ago he suffered a term of penal servitude The shock after years of reparation of spotless life spent in the service of God and his fellow creatures has killed him I desire publicly to proclaim that I as his opponent had no share in the dastardly blow that has struck him down And I desire to proclaim the reason He is my own father I Paul Savelli am my opponent Silas Finn s son A great gasp and murmur rose from the wonder stricken throng but only momentarily for the spell of drama was on them Paul continued I will make public later on the reasons for our respective changes of name For the present it is enough to state the fact of our relationship and of our mutual affection and respect That I thank you for electing me goes without saying and I will do everything in my power to advance the great cause you have enabled me to represent I regret I cannot address you in another place to night as I had intended I must ask you of your kindness to let me go quietly where my duty and my heart call me to my father s death bed He bowed and waved a dignified gesture of farewell and turning into the hall met the assemblage of long astounded faces From outside came the dull rumbling of the dispersing crowd The mayor the first to break the silence murmured a platitude Paul thanked him gravely Then he went to Wilson Forgive me said he for all that has been amiss with me to day It has been a strain of a very peculiar kind I can well imagine it said Wilson You see I m not an aristocrat after all said Paul Wilson looked the young man in the face and saw the steel beneath the dark eyes and the Proud setting of the lips With a sudden impulse he wrung his hand I don t care a damn said he You are Paul said unsmiling I can face the music That s all He drew a note from his pocket Will you do me a final service Go round to the Conservative Club at once and tell the meeting what has happened and give this to Colonel Winwood With pleasure said Wilson Then Paul shook hands with all his fellow workers and thanked them in his courtly way and pleading for solitude went through the door of the great chamber and guided by an attendant reached the exit in a side street where his car awaited him A large concourse of people stood drawn up in line on each side of the street marshalled by policemen A familiar crooked figure limped from the shadow of the door holding a hard felt hat his white poll gleaming in the shaft of light God bless you sonny he said in a hoarse whisper Paul took the old man by the arm and drew him across the pavement to the car Get in said he Barney Bill hung back No sonny no It s not the first time we ve driven together Get in I want you So Barney Bill allowed himself to be thrust into the luxurious car and Paul followed And perhaps for the first time in the history of great elections the successful candidate drove away from the place where the poll was declared in dead silence attended only by the humblest of his constituents But every man in the throng bared his head CHAPTER XXI HE had the stroke in the night said Barney Bill suddenly Paul turned sharply on him Why wasn t I told Could you have cured him Of course not Could you have done him any good I ought to have been told You had enough of worries before you for one day sonny That was my business said Paul Jane and I being as it were responsible parties took the liberty so to speak of thinking it our business too Paul drummed impatiently on his knees Yer ain t angry are you sonny the old man asked plaintively No not angry with you and Jane certainly not I know you acted for the best out of love for me But you shouldn t have deceived me I thought it was a mere nervous breakdown the strain and shock You never said a word about it and Jane when I talked to her this morning never gave me to dream there was anything serious amiss So I say you two have deceived me But I m a telling of yer sonny Yes yes I know I don t reproach you But don t you see I m sick of lies Dead sick I ve been up to my neck in a bog of falsehood ever since I was a child and I m making a hell of a struggle to get on to solid ground The Truth for me now By God nothing but the Truth Barney Bill sitting forward hunched up on the seat of the car just as he used to sit on the footboard of his van twisted his head round I m not an eddicated person said he although if I hadn t done a bit of reading in my time I d have gone dotty all by my lones in the old bus but I ve come to one or two conclusions in my so to speak variegated career and one is that if you go on in that ere mad way for Truth in Parliament you ll be a bull in a china shop and they ll get sticks and dawgs to hustle you out Sir Robert Peel old Gladstone Dizzy the whole lot of the old Yuns was up against it They had to compromise It s compromise the old man dwelt lovingly as usual on the literary word it s compromise you must have in Parliament I ll see Parliament damned first cried Paul his nerves on edge You ll have to wait a long time sonny said Barney Bill wagging a sage head Parliament takes a lot of damning Anyhow said Paul not eager to continue the argument but unconsciously caught in the drift of Barney Bill s philosophy my private life isn t politics and there s not going to be another lie in my private life as long as I live The old man broke a short silence with a dry chuckle How it takes one back he said reflectively Lor lumme I can hear yer speaking now just in the same tone the night what yer run away with me Yer hadn t a seat to yer breeches then and now you ve a seat in Parliament He chuckled again at his joke But he gripped the young man s knee in his bony clasp you re just the same Paul sonny God bless yer and you ll come out straight all right Here we are The car drew up before Silas Finn s house They entered Jane summoned came down at once and met them in the dreadful dining room where a simple meal was spread I haven t heard she said I m in I m glad My father he asked curtly She looked at him wide eyed for a second or two as he stood his fur lined coat with astrachan collar thrown open his hand holding a soft felt hat on his hip his absurdly beautiful head thrown back to casual glance the Fortunate Youth of a month or two ago But to Jane s jealous eye he was not even the man she had seen that afternoon He looked many years older She confessed afterwards to surprise at not finding his hair grey at the temples thus manifesting her ordered sense of the harmonious She confessed too that she was frightened Jane who for any other reason than the mere saving of her own skin would have stolidly faced Hyrcanean tigers at the stern eyes beneath the contracted brows He was a different Paul altogether And here we have the divergence between the masculine and the feminine point of view Jane saw a new avatar Barney Bill the ragged urchin of the Bludston brick fields She shifted her glance to the old man He standing crookedly cocked his head and nodded He knows all about it Yes yes said Paul How is my father Jane threw out her hands in the Englishwoman s insignificant gesture He s unconscious has been for hours the nurse is up with him the end may come any moment I hid it from you till the last for your own sake Would you care to go upstairs She moved to the door Paul threw off his overcoat and followed by Barney Bill accompanied her On the landing they were met by the nurse It is all over she said I will go in for a moment said Paul I should like to be alone In a room hung like the rest of the house with gaudy pictures he stood for a short while looking at the marble face of the strange souled passionate being that had been his father The lids had closed for ever over the burning sorrowful eyes the mobile lips were for ever mute In his close sympathy with the man Paul knew what had struck him down It was not the blow of the nameless enemy but the stunning realization that he was not after all the irresistible nominee of the Almighty His great faith had not suffered for the rigid face was serene as though he had accepted this final chastisement and purification before entrance into the Eternal Kingdom but his high pride the mainspring of his fanatical life had been broken and the workings of the physical organism had been arrested In those few moments of intense feeling in the presence of death it was given to Paul to tread across the threshold of the mystery of his birth Here lay stiff and cold no base clay such as that of which Polly Kegworthy had been formed It had been the tenement of a spirit beautiful and swift No matter to what things he himself had been born he had put that foolishness behind him at all events his dream had come partly true His father had been one of the great ones one of the conquerors one of the high princes of men Multitudes of kings had not been so parented Outwardly a successful business man and a fanatical Dissenter there were thousands like Silas Finn But Paul knew his inner greatness the terrific struggle of his soul the warrings between fierce blood and iron will the fervent purpose the lofty aspirations and the unwavering conduct of his life of charity and sorrow He stretched out his hand and with his finger tips lightly touched the dead man s forehead I m proud to be your son he murmured Then the nurse came in and Paul went downstairs Barney Bill waylaid him in the hall and led him into the dining room Have a little food and drink sonny You look as if yer need it especially drink Ere He seized a decanter of whisky since Paul s first visit Silas had always kept it in the house for his son s comforting and would have filled the tumbler had not Paul restrained him He squirted in the soda Drink it down and you ll feel better Paul swallowed a great gulp Yes he agreed There are times when it does help a man Liquor is like a dawg said Bill Keep it in subjection so to speak and it s yer faithful friend Where s Jane Paul asked She s busy Half the borough seem to be calling or telephoning and even at that moment Paul could hear the maid tripping across the hall and opening the front door I ve told her what occurred She seemed half skeered She s had a dreadful day pore gal She has indeed said Paul He threw himself into a chair dead beat at the end of emotional strain and remained talking with the old man of he scarce knew what But these two Jane and the old man were linked to him by imperishable ties and he could not leave them yet awhile in the house of death Barney Bill stirred the fire which blazed up making the perky animals on the hearth cast faint and fantastic shadows It s funny how he loved those darned little beasts isn t it now I remember of him telling me as how they transported him into magic something or the other medi he had a word for it I dunno Mediaeval That s it sonny Mediaeval forests It means back of old times don t it King Arthur and his Round Table I done a bit of reading yer know The old man took out pouch and pipe That s what drew us together sonny our taste for literature Remember Can I ever forget said Paul Well he was like that too He had lots of po try in him not the stuff that rhymes yer know like The Psalm of Life and so forth but real po try I wish I could tell yer what I mean His face was puckered into a thousand wrinkles with the intellectual effort and his little diamond eyes gleamed He could take a trumpery common thing like that there mug faced lop eared hare and make it stand for the medi what you call it forest I ve said to him Come out with me on the old bus if you want green and loneliness and nature And he has said I recollect one talk in particular he said I d love to hear something about a pipe I m getting old sonny The Pipes of Pan Paul suggested The very words Lor lumme how did you guess it He paused his fingers holding the lighted match which went out before he could apply it to his tobacco Yus The Pipes of Pan I don t know what it means Anyway he said he d love to hear them in the real forest but duty kept him to bricks and mortar and so he had to hear them in imagination He said that all them footling little beasts were a listening to em and they told him all about it I remember he told me more about the woods than I know myself and I reckon I could teach his business to any gamekeeper or poacher in England I don t say as how he knew the difference between a stoat and a weasel he didn t A cock pheasant and a hen partridge would have been the same to him But the spirit of it the meaning of it he fair raised my hair off he knew it a darned sight better nor I And that s what I set out for to say sonny He had po try in him And all this he swept an all inclusive hand all this meant to him something that you and I can t tumble to sonny It meant something different to what it looked like ah and impatient at his impotence to express philosophic thought he cast another lighted match angrily into the fire Paul high product of modern culture sat in wonder at the common old fellow s clarity of vision Tears rolled down his cheek I know dear old Bill what you re trying to say Only one man has ever been able to say it A mad poet called Blake To see a world in a grain of sand And a heaven in a wild flower Hold infinity in the palm of your hand And eternity in an hour Barney Bill started forward in his chair and clapped his hand on the young man s knee By gum you ve got it That s what I was a driving at That s Silas I call to mind when he was a boy pretty dirty and ragged he was too as he used to lean over the parapet of Blackfriars Bridge and watch the current sort of swirling round the piers and he used to say as how he could hear what the river was saying I used to think him loony But it was po try sonny all the time The old man thus started on reminiscence continued somewhat garrulous and Paul sunk in the armchair by the fire listened indulgently waiting for Jane She meanwhile was occupied upstairs and in the library answering telephone messages and sending word out to callers by the maid For on the heels of Paul as Barney Bill had said many had come on errand of inquiry and condolence and all the news agencies and newspapers of London seemed to be on the telephone Some of the latter tried for speech with the newly elected candidate whom they understood to be in the house but Jane denied them firmly She had had some training as a politician s private secretary At last the clanging bell ceased ringing and the maid ceased running to and from the street door and the doctor had come and given his certificate and gone and Jane joined the pair in the dining room She brought in from the hall a tray of visiting cards and set it on the table I suppose it was kind of them all to come she said She sat down listlessly in a straight backed chair and then at a momentary end of her fine strength suddenly broke into tears and sobs and buried her head on her arms Paul rose bent over her and clasped her shoulders comfortingly Presently she turned and blindly sought his embrace He raised her to her feet and they stood as they had done years ago when boy and girl they had come to the parting of their ways She cried silently for a while and then she said miserably I ve only you left dear In this hour of spent effort and lassitude it was a queer physical comfort very pure and sweet to feel the close contact of her young strong body She too out of the wreck was all that he had left His clasp tightened and he murmured soothing words Oh my dear I am so tired she said giving herself up for her part also to the foolish solace of his arms I wish I could stay here always Paul He whispered Why not Indeed why not Instinct spoke His people were her people and her people his And she had proved herself a brave true woman Before him no longer gleamed the will o the wisp leading him a fantastic dance through life Before him lay only darkness Jane and he hand in hand could walk through it fearless and undismayed And her own great love shown unashamed in the abandonment of this moment of intense emotion made his pulses throb He whispered again Why not For answer she nestled closer If only you could love me a little little bit But I do said Paul hoarsely She shook her head and sobbed afresh and they stood in close embrace at the end of the room by the door regardless of the presence of the old man who sat his back to them smoking his pipe and looking with his birdlike crook of the neck meditatively into the fire No no said Jane at last It s silly of me Forgive me We mustn t talk of such things Neither of us is fit to and to night it s not becoming I have lost my father and you are only my brother Paul dear Barney Bill broke in suddenly and at the sound of his voice they moved apart Think over it sonny Don t go and do anything rash Don t you think it would be wise for Jane to marry me Ay for Jane Not for me It s only wise for a man to marry a woman what he loves said Barney Bill Well You said when we was a driving here as you are going to live for the Truth and nothing but the Truth I only mention it added the old man drily Jane recovered herself with a gulp in the throat and before Paul could answer said We too had a talk to day Paul Remember her voice quavered a little about carrots You were right in essence said Paul looking at her gravely But I should have my incentive I know my own mind My affection for you is of the deepest That is Truth I needn t tell you We could lead a happy and noble life together We belong to two different social classes Paul she said gently again sitting in the straight backed chair by the table We don t he replied I repudiated my claims to the other class this evening I was admitted into what is called high society partly because people took it for granted that I was a man of good birth Now that I ve publicly proclaimed that I m not and the newspapers will pretty soon find out all about me now I ll drop out of that same high society I shan t seek readmittance People will seek you You don t know the world said he It must be mean and horrid Oh no It s very just and honourable I shan t blame it a bit for not wanting me Why should I I don t belong to it But you do dear Paul she cried earnestly Even if you could get rid of your training and mode of thought you can t get rid of your essential self You ve always been an aristocrat and I ve always been a small shop keeper s daughter and shall continue to be one And I say Paul retorted that we ve both sprung from the people and are of the people You ve raised yourself above the small shop keeping class just as much as I have Don t let us have any sham humility about it Whatever happens you ll always associate with folk of good breeding and education You couldn t go back to Barn Street It would be idiotic for me to contemplate such a thing for my part But between Barn Street and Mayfair there s a refined and intellectual land where you and I can meet on equal ground and make our social position What do you say She did not look at him but fingered idly the cards on the tray To morrow you will think differently To night you re all on the strain And axing yer pardon sonny for chipping in said the old man holding up his pipe in his gnarled fingers you haven t told her as how you loves her not as how a young woman axed in marriage ought to be told I ve spoken the Truth dear old friend said Paul I ve got down to bed rock to night I have a deep and loyal affection for Jane I shan t waver in it all my life long I ll soon find my carrot as she calls it it will be England s greatness She is the woman that will help me on my path I ve finished with illusions for ever and ever Jane is the bravest and grandest of realities To night s work has taught me that For me Jane stands for the Truth Jane He turned to her but she had risen from her chair staring at a card which she held in her hand Her clear eyes met his for an instant as she threw the card on the table before him No dear For you that s the Truth He took it up and looked at it stupidly It bore a crown and the inscription The Princess Sophie Zobraska and a pencilled line in her handwriting With anxious inquiries He reeled as if someone had dealt him a heavy blow on the head He recovered to see Jane regarding him with her serene gravity Did you know about this he asked dully No I ve just seen the card I found it at the bottom of the pile How did it come Jane rang the bell I don t know If Annie s still up we can find out As it was at the bottom it must have been one of the first How could the news have travelled so fast said Paul The maid came in Questioned she said that just after Paul had gone upstairs and while Jane was at the telephone a chauffeur had presented the card He belonged to a great lighted limousine in which sat a lady in hat and dark veil According to her orders she had said that mister Finn was dead and the chauffeur had gone away and she had shut the door The maid was dismissed Paul stood on the hearthrug with bent brows his hands in his jacket pockets I can t understand it he said She must ha come straight from the Town Hall said Barney Bill But she wasn t there cried Paul Sonny said the old fellow if you re always dead sure of where a woman is and where a woman isn t you re a wiser man than Solomon with all his wives and other domestic afflictions Paul threw the card into the fire It doesn t matter where she was said he It was a very polite even a gracious act to send in her card on her way home But it makes no difference to what I was talking about What have I got to do with princesses They re out of my sphere So are Naiads and Dryads and Houris and Valkyrie and other fabulous ladies The Princess Zobraska has nothing to do with the question He made a step towards Jane and his hand on her shoulder looked at her in his new masterful way I come in the most solemn hour and in the crisis of my life to ask you to marry me My father whom I ve only learned to love and revere to night is lying dead upstairs To night I have cut away all bridges behind me I go into the unknown We ll have to fight but we ll fight together You have courage and I at least have that There s a seat in Parliament which I ll have to fight for afterwards like a dog for a bone and an official position which brings in enough bread and butter And there s a fortune remarked Barney Bill What do you mean Paul swung round sharply Yer father s fortune sonny Who do yer suppose he was a going to leave it to Omes for lost orses or Free Zionists I don t know as ow I oughter talk of it him not buried yet but I seed his will when he made it a month or two ago and barring certain legacies to Free Zionists and such like lunatic folk not to speak of Jane ere being left comfortably off you re the residuary legatee sonny with something like a hundred thousand pounds There s no talk of earning bread and butter sonny It never entered my head said Paul rather dazed I suppose a father would leave his money to his son I didn t realize it He passed his hand over his eyes So many things have happened to night Anyhow he said smiling queerly in his effort to still a whirling brain if there are no anxieties as to ways and means so much the better for Jane and me I am all the more justified in asking you to marry me Will you Before I answer you Paul dear she replied steadily you must answer me I ve known about the will just like Bill all the time She has that confirmed the old man So this isn t news to me dear and can t alter anything from me to you Why should it asked Paul But it makes my claim a little stronger Oh no she replied shaking her head It only only confuses issues Money has nothing to do with what I m going to ask you You said to night you were going to live for the Truth the real naked Truth Now Paul dear I want the real naked Truth Do you love that woman At her question she seemed to have grown from the common sense clear eyed Jane into a great and commanding presence She had drawn herself to her full height Her chin was in the air her generous bust thrown forward her figure imperious her eyes intense And Paul too drew himself up and looked at her in his new manhood And they stood thus for a while beloved enemies If you want the Truth yes I do love her said he Then how dare you ask me to be your wife Because the one is nonsensical and illusory and the other is real and practical She flashed out angrily Do you suppose I can live my woman s life on the real and practical What kind of woman do you take me for An Amelia a Patient Griselda a tabby cat Paul said You know very well I take you for one of the greatest hearted of women I ve already said it to night Do you think I m a greater hearted woman than she Wait I ve not finished she cried in a loud voice Your Princess you cut her heart into bits the other day when you proclaimed yourself a low born impostor She thought you a high born gentleman and you told her of the gutter up north and the fried fish shop and the Sicilian organ grinding woman She royalty you of the scum She left you This morning she learned worse She learned that you were the son of a convict What does she do She comes somehow I don t know how to Hickney Heath and hears you publicly give yourself away and she drives straight here with a message for you It s for you the message Who else She stood before Paul a flashing Jane unknown Would a woman who didn t love you come to this house to night She wouldn t Paul You know it Dear old Bill here who hasn t moved in royal circles knows it No my dear man she said regally I ve given you all my love everything that is in me since I was a child of thirteen You will always have it It s my great joy that you ll always have it But by God Paul I m not going to exchange it for anything less Can you give me the same You know I can t said Paul But I can give you that which would make our marriage a happy one I believe the experience of the world has shown it to be the securest basis She was on the point of breaking out but turned away with clenched hands and controlling herself faced him again You re an honourable and loyal man Paul and you re saying this to save your face I know that you would marry me I know that you would be faithful to me in thought and word and act I know that you would be good and kind and never give me a moment s cause for complaint But your heart would be with the other woman Whether she s out of your sphere or not what does it matter to me You love her and she loves you I know it I should always know it You d be living in hell and so should I I should prefer to remain in purgatory which after all is quite bearable I m used to it and I love you enough to wish to see you in paradise She turned away with a wide gesture and an upward inflexion of her voice Barney Bill refilled his pipe and fixed Paul with his twinkling diamond eyes It s a pity sonny a dodgasted pity We re up against the Truth old man the unashamed and naked truth said Paul with a sigh Jane caught Paul s fur lined coat and hat from the chair on which he had thrown it and came to him It s time for you to go and rest dear We re all of us exhausted She helped him on with the heavy coat and for farewell put both her hands on his shoulders You must forget a lot of things I ve said to night I can t help remembering them No dear Forget them She drew his face down and kissed him on the lips Then she led him out to the front door and accompanied him down the steps to the kerb where the car with its weary chauffeur was waiting The night had cleared and the stars shone bright in the sky She pointed to one haphazard Your star Paul Believe in it still He drove off She entered the house and flinging herself on the floor by Barney Bill buried her head on the old man s knees and sobbed her brave heart out CHAPTER XXII THE next morning amazement fluttered over a million breakfast tables and throbbed in a million railway carriages For all the fierceness of political passions parliamentary elections are but sombre occurrences to the general public Rarely are they attended by the picturesque the dramatic the tragic But already the dramatic had touched the election of Hickney Heath stimulating interest in the result Thousands usually apathetic as to political matters opened their newspapers to see how the ex convict candidate had fared They read with a gasp that he was dead that his successful opponent had proclaimed himself to be his son They had the dramatic value of cumulative effect If Paul had ever sought notoriety he had it now His name rang through the length and breadth of the land The early editions of the London afternoon papers swelled the chorus of amazed comment and conjecture Some had even routed out a fact or two Heaven knows whence concerning father and son According to party they meted out praise or blame Some unversed in the law declared the election invalid The point was discussed in a hundred clubs There was consternation in the social world The Duchesses boudoirs with which Paul had been taunted hummed with indignation They had entertained an adventurer unawares They had entrusted the sacred ark of their political hopes to a charlatan Their daughters had danced with the offspring of gaol and gutter He must be cast out from the midst of them So did those that were foolish furiously rage together and imagine many a vain thing The Winwoods came in for pity They had been villainously imposed upon And the Young England League to which they had all subscribed so handsomely where were its funds Was it safe to leave them at the disposal of so unprincipled a fellow Then germs of stories crept in from the studios and the stage and grew perversely in the overheated atmosphere Paul s reputation began to assume a pretty colour On the other hand there were those who while deploring the deception were impressed by the tragedy and by Paul s attitude He had his defenders Among the latter first sprang forward Lord Francis Ayres the Chief Whip officially bound to protect his own pet candidate He called early at the house in Portland Place a distressed and anxious man The door was besieged by reporters from newspapers vainly trying to gain entrance His arrival created a sensation At any rate there was a headline Opposition Whip calls on Savelli One or two attempted to interview him on the doorstep He excused himself courteously As yet he knew as much or as little as they The door opened The butler snatched him in hurriedly He asked to see the Winwoods He found them in the library Here s an awful mess said he throwing up his hands I thought I d have a word or two with you before I tackle Savelli Have you seen him this morning Oh yes Well what do you think about it I think said Ursula that the best thing I can do is to take him away with me for a rest as soon as possible He s at the end of his tether You seem to take it pretty calmly How do you expect us to take it my dear Frank she asked We always expected Paul to do the right thing when the time came and we consider that he has done it The Chief Whip smoothed a perplexed brow I don t quite follow Were you vulgarly speaking in the know all the time Sit down and I ll tell you So he sat down and Miss Winwood quietly told him all she knew about Paul and what had happened during the past few weeks while the Colonel sat by his desk and tugged his long moustache and here and there supplemented her narrative That s all very interesting Ayres remarked when she had finished and you two have acted like bricks I also see that he must have had a devil of a time of it But I ve got to look at things from an official point of view There s no question of invalidity is there asked Colonel Winwood No He was known as Paul Savelli nominated as Paul Savelli and elected as Paul Savelli by the electors of Hickney Heath So he ll sit as Paul Savelli That s all right But how is the House going to receive him when he is introduced How will it take him afterwards What use will he be to the party We only ran him because he seemed to be the most brilliant of the young outsiders We hoped great things of him Hasn t he smashed up himself socially Hasn t he smashed up his career at the very beginning All that is what I want to know So do I groaned Colonel Winwood I didn t have a wink of sleep last night I didn t either said Ursula but I don t think it will matter a row of pins to Paul in his career It will always be up against him said Ayres Because he has acted like a man It s the touch of Ruy Blas that I m afraid of You must remember that he wasn t aware of his relation to the dead man until the eve of the election But he was aware that he wasn t a descendant of a historical Italian family which everyone thought him to be I don t speak for myself said Ayres I m fond of the chap One can t help it He has the charm of the great gentleman confound him and it s all natural The cloven hoof has never appeared because I personally believe there s no cloven hoof The beggar was born well bred and as to performance well he has been a young meteor across the political sky Until this election Then he was a disappointment I frankly confess it I didn t know what he was playing at Now I do Poor chap I personally am sympathetic But what about the cold blooded other people who don t know what you ve told me To them he s the son of an ex convict a vendor of fried fish I put it brutally from their point of view who has been masquerading as a young saint George on horseback Will he ever be forgiven Officially have I any use for him You see I m responsible to the party Any party said Ursula would be a congregation of imbeciles who didn t do their best to develop the genius of Paul Savelli I m fond of Paul said Colonel Winwood in his tired way but I don t know that I would go as far as that It s only because you re a limited male my dear James I suppose Caesar was the only man who really crossed the Rubicon And the fuss he made about it Women jump across with the utmost certainty My dear Frank we re behind Paul whatever happens He has been fighting for his own hand ever since he was a child it is true But he has fought gallantly My dear Miss Winwood said Frank Ayres if there s a man to be envied it s the one who has you for his champion Anyone my dear Frank is to be envied she retorted who is championed by common sense All these fireworks illuminate nothing said Colonel Winwood I think we had better ask Paul to come down and see Frank Would you like to see him alone I had rather you stayed said Frank Ayres A message was sent to Paul and presently he appeared very pale and haggard Frank Ayres met him with outstretched hand spoke a courteous word of sympathy apologized for coming in the hour of tragic bereavement Paul thanked him with equal courtesy I was about to write to you Lord Francis he continued a sort of statement in explanation of what happened last night Our friends have told me all I think that you may have to say I shall still write it said Paul so that you can have it in black and white At present I ve given the press nothing Quite right said Frank Ayres For God s sake let us work together as far as the press is concerned That s one of the reasons why I ve forced myself upon you It s horrible my dear fellow to intrude at such a time I hate it as you can well imagine But it s my duty Of course it is said Paul There was a span of awkward silence Well said he with a wan smile we re facing not a political but a very unimportant party situation Don t suppose I haven t a sense of proportion I have What for me is the end of the world is the unruffled continuance of the cosmic scheme for the rest of mankind But there are relative things to consider You have to consider the party I m sort of fly blown Am I any use Let us talk straight Am I or am I not My dear chap said Frank Ayres with perplexed knitting of the brows I don t quite know what to say You yourself have invited me to talk straight Well Forgive me if I do There may be a suggestion in political quarters that you have won this election under false pretences Do you want me to resign my seat The two men looked deep into each other s eyes A Unionist in is a Liberal out said Frank Ayres and counts two on division That s one way of looking at it We want all we can get from the enemy On the other hand you d come in for a lot of criticism and hostility You d have to start not only from the beginning but with a handicap Are you strong enough to face it I m not going to run away from anything said Paul But I ll tell you what I m prepared to do I ll resign and fight the constituency again under my real name of Kegworthy provided of course the local people are willing to adopt me on the understanding however that the party support me or at least don t put forward another candidate I m not going to turn berserk That s a sporting offer at any rate But pardon me we re talking business where is the money for another election to come from My poor father s death makes me a wealthy man replied Paul Miss Winwood started forward in her chair My dear you never told us There were so many other things to talk about this morning he said gently but of course I would have told you later I only mention it now he turned to the Chief Whip in answer to your direct and very pertinent question Now between a political free lance adopting a parliamentary career in order to fight for his own hand as all Paul s supporters were frankly aware that he was doing and a wealthy independent and brilliant young politician lies a wide gulf The last man on earth in his private capacity to find his estimate of his friends influenced by their personal possessions was the fine aristocrat Lord Francis Ayres But he was a man of the world the very responsible head of the executive of a great political party As that executive head he was compelled to regard Paul from a different angle The millions of South Africa or the Middle West might vainly knock at his own front door till the crack of doom while Paul the penniless sauntered in an honoured guest But in his official room in the House of Commons more stern and worldly considerations had to prevail Of course I can t give you an answer now said he I ll have to discuss the whole matter with the powers that be But a seat s a seat and though I appreciate your Quixotic offer I don t see why we should risk it It s up to you to make good It s more in your own interest that I m speaking now Can you go through with it Paul with his unconquerable instinct for the dramatic hauled out the little cornelian heart at the end of his watch chain My dear fellow said he Do you see that It was given to me for failing to win a race at a Sunday school treat when I was a very little boy I didn t possess coat or stockings and my toes came out through the ends of my boots and in order to keep the thing safe I knotted it up in the tail of my shirt which waggled out of the seat of my breeches It was given to me by a beautiful lady who I remember smelled like all the perfumes of Araby She awakened my aesthetic sense by the divine and intoxicating odour that emanated from her Since then I have never met woman so so like a scented garden of all the innocences To me she was a goddess I overheard her prophesy things about me My life began from that moment I kept the cornelian heart all my life as a talisman It has brought me through all kinds of things Once I was going to throw it away and Miss Winwood would not let me I kept it somewhat against my will for I thought it was a lying talisman It had told me in the sweet scented lady s words that I was the son of a prince Give me half an hour to morrow or the day after he said seeing a puzzled look in Frank Ayres s face and I ll tell you a true psychological fairy tale the apologia pro vita mea I say anyhow that lately until last night I thought this little cornelian heart was a lying talisman Then I knew it didn t lie I was the son of a prince a prince of men although he had been in gaol and spent his days afterwards in running emotional Christianity and fried fish shops His name was Silas Mine is Paul Something significant about it isn t there Anyhow he balanced the heart in the palm of his hand this hasn t lied It has carried me through all my life When I thought it failed I found it at the purest truth of its prophecy It s not going to fail me now If it s right for me to take my seat I ll take it whether I make good politically or not is on the knees of the gods But you may take it from me that there s nothing in this wide world that I won t face or go through with if I ve set my mind to it So the child who had kicked Billy Goodge and taken the spolia opima of paper cocked hat and wooden sword spoke through the man As then in a queer way he found himself commanding a situation and as then commanding it rightfully through sheer personal force Again at a sign he would have broken the sword across his knee But the sign did not come Speaking quite unofficially said Frank Ayres I think if you feel like that you would be a fool to give up your seat Very well said Paul I thank you And now perhaps it would be wise to draw up that statement for the press if you can spare the time So Paul made a draft and Frank Ayres revised it and it was sent upstairs to be typed When the typescript came down Paul signed and dispatched it and gave the Chief Whip a duplicate Well said the latter shaking hands the best of good luck Whereupon he went home feeling that though there would be the deuce to pay Paul Savelli would find himself perfectly solvent and meeting the somewhat dubious Leader of the Opposition later in the day he said Anyhow this far too gentlemanly party has got someone picturesque at last to touch the popular imagination A new young Disraeli Why not The Leader made a faint gesture of philosophic doubt The mould is broken said he We ll see said Frank Ayres confidently Meanwhile Paul returned to his room and wrote a letter three words of which he had put on paper My dear Princess when the summons to meet the Chief Whip had come The unblotted ink had dried hard He took another sheet My dear Princess he began He held his head in his hand What could he say Ordinary courtesy demanded an acknowledgment of the Princess s message of inquiry But to write to her whom he had held close in his arms whose lips had clung maddeningly to his in terms of polite convention seemed impossible What had she meant by her message If she had gone scornfully out of his life she had gone and there was an end on t Her coming back could bear only one interpretation that of Jane s passionate statement In spite of all she loved him But now stripped and naked and at war with the world for all his desire he would have none of her love Not he At last he wrote PRINCESS A thousand grateful thanks for last night s gracious act the act of the very great lady that I have the privilege of knowing you to be PAUL SAVELLI He rang for a servant and ordered the note to be sent by hand and then went out to Hickney Heath to see to the burying of his dead On his return he found a familiar envelope with the crown on the flap awaiting him It contained but few words PAUL come and see me I will stay at home all day SOPHIE His pulses throbbed Her readiness to await his pleasure proved a humility of spirit rare in Princess Sophie Zobraska Her hands were held out towards him But he hardened his heart The fairy tale was over Nothing but realities lay before him The interview was perilous but he was not one to shirk danger He went out took a cab and drove to Berkeley Square She rose shyly as he entered and advanced to meet him He kissed her hand but when he sought to release it he found his held in her warm clasp Mon Dieu How ill you are looking she said and her lips quivered I m only tired You look so old Ah She moved away from him with a sigh Sit down I suppose you can guess why I ve asked you to come she continued after a pause But it is a little hard to say I want you to forgive me There is nothing to forgive said Paul Don t be ungenerous you know there is I left you to bear everything alone You were more than justified You found me an impostor You were wounded in everything you held sacred I wounded you deliberately You could do nothing else but go away Heaven forbid that I should have thought of blaming you I didn t I understood But it was I who did not understand she said looking at the rings on her fingers Yes You are right I was wounded like an animal I hid myself in the country and I hoped you would write which was foolish for I knew you wouldn t Then I felt that if I had loved you as I ought I should never have gone away I thought it best to kill your love outright said Paul She lay back on her cushions very fair very alluring very sad From where he sat he saw her face in its delicate profile and he had a mighty temptation to throw himself on his knees by her side I thought too you had killed it she said Still think so said Paul in a low voice She raised herself bent forward and he met the blue depths of her gaze And you Your love I never did anything to kill it But I did No you couldn t I shall love you to the hour of my death He saw the light leap into her eyes I only say it he added somewhat coldly because I will lie to you no longer But it s a matter that concerns me alone How you alone Am not I to be considered He rose and stood on the hearthrug facing her I consider you all the time said he Listen mon cher ami she said looking up at him Let us understand one another Is there anything about you your birth or your life that I still don t know I mean anything essential Nothing that matters said Paul Then let us speak once and for all soul to soul You and I are of those who can do it Eh bien I am a woman of old family princely rank and fortune you By my father s death said Paul for the second time that day I am a rich man We can leave out the question of fortune except that the money I inherit was made out of a fried fish shop business That business was conducted by my father on lines of peculiar idealism It will be my duty to carry on his work at least he inwardly and conscientiously repudiated the idea of buying fish at Billingsgate at five o clock in the morning as far as the maintenance of his principles is concerned Soit said the Princess we leave out the question of fortune You are then a man of humble birth and the rank you have gained for yourself I am a man of no name and of tarnished reputation Good God he blazed out suddenly losing control What is the good of torturing ourselves like this If I wouldn t marry you before until I had done something in the front of the world to make you proud of me what do you think I ll do now lying in the gutter for every one to kick me Would it be to the happiness of either of us for me to sneak through society behind your rank It would be the death of me and you would come to hate me as a mean hound You A mean hound Her voice broke and the tears welled up in her eyes You have done nothing for me to be proud of You You who did what you did last night Yes I was there I saw and heard Listen She rose to her feet and stood opposite to him her eyes all stars her figure trembling and her hands moving in her Frenchwoman s passionate gestures When I saw in the newspapers about your father my heart was wrung for you I knew what it meant I knew how you must suffer I came up straight to town I wanted to be near you I did not know how I did not want you to see me I called in my steward How can I see the election We talked a little He went and hired a room opposite the Town Hall I waited there in the darkness I thought it would last forever And then came the result and the crowd cheered and I thought I should choke I sobbed I sobbed I sobbed and then you came And I heard and then I held out my arms to you alone in the dark room like this and cried Paul Paul Woman conquered Madness surged through him and he flung his arms about her and they kissed long and passionately Whether you do me the honour of marrying me or not she said a while later flushed and triumphant our lives are joined together And Paul still shaken by the intoxication of her lips and hair and clinging pressure of her body looked at her intensely with the eyes of a man s longing But he said Nothing can alter what I said a few minutes ago not all the passion and love in the world You and I are not of the stuff thank God to cut ourselves adrift and bury ourselves in some romantic island and give up our lives to a dream We re young We re strong We both know that life is a different sort of thing altogether from that We re not of the sort that shirks its responsibilities We ve got to live in the world you and I and do the world s work Parfaitement mon bien aime She smiled at him serenely I would not bury myself with you in an Ionian island for more than two months in a year for anything on earth On my part it would be the unforgivable sin No woman has the right however much she loves him to ruin a man any more than a man has the right to ruin a woman But if you won t marry me I m perfectly willing to spend two months a year in an Ionian island with you and she looked at him very proud and fearless Paul took her by the shoulders and shook her more roughly than he realized Sophie don t tempt me to a madness that we should both regret She laughed wincing yet thrilled under the rude handling and freed herself But what more can a woman offer the man who loves her that is to say if he does love her I not love you He threw up his hands Dear God She waved him away and retreated a step or two still laughing as he advanced Then why won t you marry me You re afraid Yes he cried It s the only thing on this earth that I m afraid of Why The sneers First you d hate them Then you d hate and despise me She grew serious Calme toi my dearest Just consider things practically Who is going to sneer at a great man I the first replied Paul bitterly his self judgment warped by the new knowledge of the vanities and unsubstantialities on which his life had been founded I a great man indeed A very great man A brilliant man I knew long ago A brave man I have known in spite of my pride these last two or three awful weeks But last night I knew you were a great man a very great man Ah mon Paul La canaille whether it lives in Whitechapel or Park Lane what does it matter to us The riff raff unfortunately said Paul forms the general judgment of society The Princess drew herself up in all her aristocratic dignity My Paul well beloved said she you have still one or two things to learn People of greatness and rank march with their peers and they can spit upon the canaille There is canaille in your House of Lords upon which the day after to morrow you can spit and it will take off its coronet and thank you and now she said resuming her seat on the sofa among the cushions let us stop arguing If there is any more arguing to be done let us put it off to another occasion Let us dismiss the questions of marriage and Ionian islands altogether and let us talk pleasantly like dear friends who are reconciled And with the wit of the woman who loves and the subtlety of the woman of the world she took Paul in her delicate hands and held him before her smiling eyes and made him tell her of all the things she wanted to know And so Paul told her of all his life of Bludston of Barney Bill of the model days of the theatre of Jane of his father and he showed her the cornelian heart and expounded its significance and he talked of his dearest lady Miss Winwood and his work on the Young England League and his failure to grip in this disastrous election and he went back to the brickfield and his flight from the Life School and his obsessing dream of romantic parentage and the pawning of his watch at Drane s Court and in the full tide of it all a perturbed butler appeared at the door Can I speak a word to Your Highness She rose The butler spoke the word She burst out laughing My dear she cried it s past nine o clock The household is in a state of agitation about dinner We ll have it at once Wilkins The butler bowed and retired The Princess laughed again Of course you ll stay I left Stephanie at Morebury And Paul stayed to dinner and though observing the flimsy compact they dismissed the questions of Ionian islands and marriage they talked till midnight of matters exceedingly pleasant CHAPTER XXIII SO the lovers were reconciled although the question of marriage was farther off than ever and the Princess and Miss Winwood wept on each other s shoulders after the way of good women and Paul declared that he needed no rest and was eager to grapple with the world He had much to do First he buried his dead the Princess sending a great wreath and her carriage after having had a queer interview with Jane of which neither woman would afterwards speak a word but it was evident that they had parted on terms of mutual respect and admiration Then Paul went through the task of settling his father s affairs Jane having expressed a desire to take over the management of a certain department of the business he gladly entrusted it to her capable hands He gave her the house at Hickney Heath and Barney Bill took up his residence there as a kind of old watch dog Meanwhile introduced by Frank Ayres and Colonel Winwood he faced the ordeal of a chill reception by the House of Commons and took his seat After that the nine days wonder of the scandal came to an end the newspapers ceased talking of it and the general public forgot all about him He only had to reckon with his fellow members and with social forces His own house too he had to put in order He resigned his salary and position as Organizing Secretary of the Young England League but as Honorary Secretary he retained control To assure his position he applied for Royal Letters Patent and legalized his name of Savelli Finally he plunged into the affairs of Fish Palaces Limited and learned the many mysteries connected with that outwardly unromantic undertaking These are facts in Paul s career which his chronicler is bound to mention But on Paul s development they exercised but little influence He walked now with open eyes in a world of real things The path was difficult but he was strong Darkness lay ahead but he neither feared it nor dreamed dreams of brightness beyond The Vision Splendid had crystallized into an unconquerable purpose of which he felt the thrill Without Sophie Zobraska s love he would have walked on doggedly obstinately with set teeth He had proved himself fearless scornful of the world s verdict But he would have walked in wintry gloom with a young heart frozen dead Now his path was lit by warm sunshine and the burgeon of spring was in his heart He could laugh again in his old joyous way yet the laughter was no longer that of the boy but of the man who knew the place that laughter should hold in a man s life On the day when he as chairman had first presided over a meeting of the Board of Directors of Fish Palaces Limited he went to the Princess and said If I bring with me an ancient and fish like smell a kind of not of the newest Poor John send me about my business She bade him not talk foolishly I m talking sense said he I m going through with it I m in trade I know to the fraction of a penny how much fat ought to be used to a pound of hake and I m concentrating all my intellect on that fraction of a penny of fat Tu as raison she said N est ce pas It s funny isn t it I ve often told you I once thought myself the man born to be king My dreams have come true I am a king The fried fish king Sophie looked at him from beneath her long lashes And I am a princess We meet at last on equal terms Paul sprang forward impulsively and seized her hands Oh you dear wonderful woman Doesn t it matter to you that I m running fried fish shops I know why you re doing it she said I wouldn t have you do otherwise You are you Paul I should love to see you at it Do you wait at table and hand little dishes to coster mongers ancien regime en emigre She laughed deliciously Suddenly she paused regarded him wide eyed with a smile on her lips Tiens I have an idea But a wonderful ideal Why should I not be the fried fish queen Issue new shares I buy them all up We establish fish palaces all over the world But why not I am in trade already Only yesterday my homme d affaires sent me for signature a dirty piece of blue paper all covered with execrable writing and imitation red seals all the way down and when I signed it I saw I was interested in Messrs Jarrods Limited and was engaged in selling hams and petticoats and notepaper and furniture and butter and remark this and fish But raw fish Now what the difference is between selling raw fish and fried fish I do not know Moi je suis deja marchande de poissons voila She laughed and Paul laughed too They postponed however to an indefinite date consideration of the business proposal As Paul had foreseen Society manifested no eagerness to receive him Invitations no longer fell upon him in embarrassing showers Nor did he make any attempt to pass through the once familiar doors For one thing he was proud for another he was too busy When the Christmas recess came he took a holiday went off by himself to Algiers He returned bronzed and strong to the joy of his Sophie My dear said Miss Winwood one day to the curiously patient lady what is to come of it all You can t go on like this for ever and ever We don t intend to smiled the Princess Paul is born to great things He cannot help it It is his destiny I believe in Paul So do I replied Ursula But it s obvious that it will take him a good many years to achieve them You surely aren t going to wait until he s a Cabinet Minister The Princess lay back among her cushions and laughed Mais non It will all come in woman s good time Laissez moi faire He will soon begin to believe in himself again At last Paul s opportunity arrived The Whips had given him his chance to speak His luck attended him in so far that when his turn came he found a full House It was on a matter of no vital importance but he had prepared his speech carefully He stood up for the first time in that strangely nerve shaking assembly in which he had been received so coldly and in which he was still friendless and saw the beginning of the familiar exodus into the lobbies A sudden wave of anger swept through him and he tore the notes of his speech across and across and again he metaphorically kicked Billy Goodge He plunged into his speech forgetful of what he had written with a passion queerly hyperbolic in view of the subject At the arresting tones of his voice many of the withdrawing members stopped at the bar and listened then as he proceeded they gradually slipped back into their places Curiosity gave place to interest Paul had found his gift again and his anger soon lost itself completely in the joy of the artist The House is always generous to performance There was something novel in the spectacle of this young man who had come there under a cloud standing like a fearless young Hermes before them in the ring of his beautiful voice in the instinctive picturesqueness of phrase in the winning charm of his personality It was but a little point in a Government Bill that he had to deal with and he dealt with it shortly But he dealt with it in an unexpected dramatic way and he sat down amid comforting applause and circumambient smiles and nods The old government hand who rose to reply complimented him gracefully and proceeded of course to tear his argument to tatters Then an ill conditioned Socialist Member got up and blundering and unconscious agent of Destiny in a fast emptying House began a personal attack on Paul Whereupon there were cries of Shame and Sit down and the Speaker in caustic tones counselled relevancy and the sympathy of the House went out to the Fortunate Youth so that when he went soon afterwards into the outer lobby it was the dinner hour he found himself surrounded by encouraging friends He did not wait long among them for up in the Ladies Gallery was his Princess He tore up the stairs and met her outside Her face was pale with anger The brute she whispered The cowardly brute He snapped his fingers Canaille canaille He counts for nothing But I ve got them he cried exultingly holding out clenched fists By God darling I ve got them They ll listen to me now She looked at him and the sudden tears came Thank God she said I can hear you talk like that at last He escorted her down the stone stairs and through the lobby to her car and they were objects of many admiring eyes When they reached it she said with a humorous curl of the lip Veux tu m epouser maintenant Wait only wait said he These are only fireworks Very soon we ll get to the real thing We shall I promise you she replied enigmatically and she drove off One morning a fortnight later she rang him up You re coming to dine with me on Friday as usual aren t you Of course said he Why do you ask Just to make sure And yes also to tell you not to come till half past eight She rang off Paul thought no more of the matter Ever since he had taken his seat in the House he had dined with her alone every Friday evening It was their undisturbed hour of intimacy and gladness in the busy week Otherwise they rarely met for Paul was a pariah in her social world On the Friday in question his taxi drew up before an unusual looking house in Berkeley Square An awning projected from the front door and a strip of carpet ran across the pavement At the sound of the taxi the door opened and revealed the familiar figures of the Princess s footmen in their state livery He entered somewhat dazed Her Highness has a party he asked Yes sir A very large dinner party Paul passed his hand over his forehead What did it mean This is Friday isn t it Of course sir Paul grew angry It was a woman s trap to force him on society For a moment he struggled with the temptation to walk away after telling the servant that it was a mistake and that he had not been invited At once however came realization of social outrage He surrendered hat and coat and let himself be announced The noise of thirty voices struck his ear as he entered the great drawing room He was confusedly aware of a glitter of jewels and bare arms and shoulders and the black and white of men But radiant in the middle of the room stood his Princess with a tiara of diamonds on her head and beside her stood a youngish man whose face seemed oddly familiar Paul advanced kissed her hand She laughed gaily You are late Paul You said half past Princess I am here to the minute Je te dirai apres she said and the daring of the intimate speech took his breath away Your Royal Highness she turned to the young man beside her and then Paul suddenly recognized a prince of the blood royal of England may I present mister Savelli I m very pleased to meet you said the Prince graciously Your Young England League has interested me greatly We must have a talk about it one of these days if you can spare the time And I must congratulate you on your speech the other night You are far too kind sir said Paul They chatted for a minute or two Then the Princess said You ll take in the Countess of Danesborough I don t think you ve met her but you ll find she s an old friend Old friend echoed Paul She smiled and turned to a pretty and buxom woman of forty standing near My dear Lady Danesborough Here is mister Savelli whom you are so anxious to meet Paul bowed politely His head being full of his Princess he was vaguely puzzled as to the reasons for which Lady Danesborough desired his acquaintance You don t remember me she said He looked at her squarely for the first time then started back Good God he cried involuntarily Good God I ve been wanting to find you all my life I never knew your name But here s the proof And he whipped out the cornelian heart from his waistcoat pocket She took it in her hand examined it handed it back to him with a smile a very sweet and womanly smile with just the suspicion of mist veiling her eyes I know The Princess has told me But how did she find you out I mean as my first patroness She wrote to the vicar mister Merewether he is still at Bludston asking who his visitor was that year and what had become of her So she found out it was I I ve known her off and on ever since my marriage You were wonderfully good to me said Paul I must have been a funny little wretch You ve travelled far since then It was you that gave me my inspiration said he The announcement of dinner broke the thread of the talk Paul looked around him and saw that the room was filled with very great people indeed There were chiefs of his party and other exalted personages There was Lord Francis Ayres Also the Winwoods The procession was formed I ve often wondered about you said Lady Danesborough as they were walking down the wide staircase Several things happened to mark that day For one I had spilled a bottle of awful scent all over my dress and I was in a state of odoriferous misery Paul laughed boyishly The mystery of my life is solved at last He explained to her frank delight You ve not changed a bit said he And oh I can t tell you how good it is to meet you after all these years I m very very glad you feel so she said significantly More than glad I was wondering but our dear Princess was right It seems to me that the Princess has been playing conspirator said Paul They entered the great dining room very majestic with its long glittering table its service of plate its stately pictures its double row of powdered and liveried footmen and Paul learned to his amazement that in violation of protocols and tables of precedence his seat was on the right hand of the Princess Conspiracy again Hitherto at her parties he had occupied his proper place Never before had she publicly given him especial mark of her favour Do you think she s right in doing this he murmured to Lady Danesborough It seemed so natural that he should ask her as though she were fully aware of all his secrets I think so she smiled as though she too were in the conspiracy They halted at their places and there at the centre of the long table on the right of the young Prince stood the Princess with flushed face and shining eyes looking very beautiful and radiantly defiant Mechante Paul whispered as they sat down This is a trap Je le sais Tu est bien prise petite souris It pleased her to be gay She confessed unblushingly Her little mouse was well caught The little mouse grew rather stern and when the great company had settled down and the hum of talk arisen he deliberately scanned the table He met some friendly glances a Cabinet Minister nodded pleasantly He also met some that were hostile His Sophie had tried a dangerous experiment In Lady Danesborough the Maisie Shepherd of his urchindom whose name he had never known she had assured him a sympathetic and influential partner Also although he had tactfully not taken up that lady s remark he felt proud of his Princess s glorious certainty that he would have no false and contemptible shame in the encounter She had known that it would be a joy to him and it was The truest of the man was stirred They talked and laughed about the far off day Incidents flaming in his mind had faded from hers He recalled forgotten things Now and then she said Yes I know that The Princess has told me Evidently his Sophie was a conspirator of deepest dye And now you re the great Paul Savelli she said Great He laughed In what way Before this election you were a personage I ve never run across you because we ve been abroad so much you know my husband has a depraved taste for governing places but a year or two ago we were asked to the Chudleys and you were held out as an inducement Good Lord said Paul astonished And now of course you re the most discussed young man in London Is he damned or isn t he You know what I refer to Well am I he asked pleasantly I m glad to see you take it like that It s not the way of the little people Personally I ve stuck up for you not knowing in the least who you were I thought you did the big spacious thing It gave me a thrill when I read about it Your speech in the House has helped you a lot Altogether and now considering our early acquaintance I think I m justified in calling you the great Paul Savelli Then came the shifting of talk The Prince turned to his left hand neighbour Lady Danesborough to her right Paul and the Princess had their conventional opportunity for conversation She spoke in French daringly using the intimate tu but of all sorts of things books theatres picture shows Then tactfully she drew the Prince and his neighbour and Lady Danesborough into their circle and pulling the strings she at last brought Paul and the Prince into a discussion over the pictures of the Doges in the Ducal Palace in Venice The young Prince was gracious Paul encouraged to talk and stimulated by precious memories grew interesting The Princess managed to secure a set of listeners at the opposite side of the table Suddenly as if carrying on the theme she said in a deliberately loud voice compelling attention Your Royal Highness I am in a dilemma What is it She paused looked round and widened her circle For the past year I have been wanting mister Savelli to ask me to marry him and he obstinately refuses to do so Will you tell me sir what a poor woman is to do She addressed herself exclusively to the young Prince but her voice with its adorable French intonation rang high and clear Paul suddenly white and rigid clenched the hand of the Princess which happened to lie within immediate reach A wave of curiosity arresting talk spread swiftly down There was an uncanny dead silence broken only by a raucous voice proceeding from a very fat Lord of Appeal some distance away After my bath I always lie flat on my back and bring my knees up to my chin There was a convulsive shrill gasp of laughter which would have instantly developed into an hysterical roar had not the young Prince with quick tactful disregard of British convention sprung to his feet and with one hand holding champagne glass and the other uplifted commanded silence So did the stars in their courses still fight for Paul My lords ladies and gentlemen said the Prince I have the pleasure to announce the engagement of Her Highness the Princess Sophie Zobraska and mister Paul Savelli I ask you to drink to their health and wish them every happiness He bowed to the couple lifted his glass and standing swept a quick glance round the company and at the royal command the table rose dukes and duchesses and Cabinet Ministers the fine flowers of England and drank to Paul and his Princess Attrape she whispered as they got up together hand in hand And as they stood in their superb promise of fulfilment they conquered The Princess said Mais dis quelque chose toi And Paul met the flash in her eyes and he smiled Your Royal Highness my lords ladies and gentlemen said he while all the company were racking their brains to recall a precedent for such proceedings at a more than formal London dinner party the Princess and myself thank you from our hearts For me this might almost seem the end of the fairy tale of my life in which when I was eleven years old her ladyship the Countess of Danesborough he bowed to the Maisie of years ago whom I have not seen from that day to this played the part of Fairy Godmother She gave me a talisman then to help me in my way through the world I have it still He held up the cornelian heart It guided my steps to my dearest lady Miss Winwood in whose beloved service I lived so long It has brought me to the feet of my Fairy Princess But now the fairy tale is over I begin where the fairy tales end he laughed into his Sophie s eyes I begin in the certain promise of living happy ever afterwards In this supreme hour of his destiny there spoke the old essential Paul the believer in the Vision Splendid The instinctive appeal to the romantic ringing so true and so sincere awoke responsive chords in hearts which after all as is the simple way of hearts of men and women were very human He sat down a made man amid pleasant laughter and bowings and lifting of glasses the length of the long table Lady Danesborough said gently It was charming of you to bring me in But I shall be besieged with questions What on earth shall I tell them The truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth he replied What do the Princess and I care Later in the evening he managed to find himself alone for a moment with the Princess My wonderful Sophie what can I say to you She smiled victoriously Cry quits Confess that you have not the monopoly of the grand manner You have worked in your man s way I in my woman s way You took a great risk said he Her eyes softened adorably Non mon Paul cheri C etait tout arrange It was a certainty And then Paul s dearest lady came up and pressed both their hands I am so glad Oh so glad The tears started But it is something like a fairy tale isn t it Well as far as his chronicler can say at present that is the end of the Fortunate Youth But it is really only a beginning Although his party is still in opposition he is still young his sun is rising and he is rich in the glory thereof A worldful of great life lies before him and his Princess What limit can we set to their achievement Of course he was the Fortunate Youth Of that there is no gainsaying He had his beauty his charm his temperament his quick southern intelligence all his Sicilian heritage and a freakish chance had favoured him from the day that vagabond urchin he attended his first and only Sunday school treat But personal gifts and favouring chance are not everything in this world On the day before his wedding he had a long talk with Barney Bill Sonny said the old man scratching his white poll when yer used to talk about princes and princesses I used to larf larf fit to bust myself I never let yer seen me do it sonny for all the time you was so dead serious And now it has come true And d yer know why it s come true sonny He cocked his head on one side his little diamond eyes glittering and laid a hand on Paul s knee D yer know why Because yer believed in it I ain t had much religion not having so to speak much time for it also being an old crock of a pagan but I do remember as what Christ said about faith just a mustard seed of it moving mountains That s it sonny I ve observed lots of things going round in the old bus Most folks believe in nothing What s the good of em Move mountains They re paralytic in front of a dunghill I know what I m talking about bless yer Now you come along believing in yer igh born parents I larfed knowing as who yer parents were But you believed and I had to let you believe And you believed in your princes and princesses and your being born to great things And I couldn t sort of help believing in it too Paul laughed Things happen to have come out all right but God knows why He does said Barney Bill very seriously That s just what He does know He knows you had faith And you dear old man asked Paul what have you believed in My honesty sonny replied Barney Bill fixing him with his bright eyes Tain t much Tain t very ambitious like But I ve had my temptations I never drove a crooked bargain in my life Paul rose and walked a step or two You re a better man than I am Bill Barney Bill rose too rheumatically and laid both hands on the young man s shoulders Have you ever been false to what you really believed to be true Not essentially said Paul Then it s all right sonny said the old man very earnestly his bent ill clad figure his old face wizened by years of exposure to suns and frosts contrasting oddly with the young favourite of fortune It s all right Your father believed in one thing I believe in another You believe in something else But it doesn t matter a tuppenny damn what one believes in so long as it s worth believing in It s faith sonny that does it Faith and purpose You re right said Paul Faith and purpose I believed in yer from the very first when you were sitting down reading Sir Walter with the bead and tail off And I believed in yer when yer used to tell about being born to great things Paul laughed That was all childish rubbish said he Rubbish cried the old man his head more crooked his eyes more bright his gaunt old figure more twisted than ever Haven t yer got the great things yer believed yer were born to Ain t yer rich Ain t yer famous Ain t yer a Member of Parliament Ain t yer going to marry a Royal Princess Good God Almighty what more d yer want Nothing in the wide wide
