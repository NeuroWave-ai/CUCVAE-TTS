buttons and the cap turning to go inside again Victory He had lost the scent Who would look for Nancy Olden in the Bishop s carriage Now you know how early I got up yesterday to catch the train so s Tom and I could come in with the people and be naturally mingling with them And you remember the dance the night before I hadn t had more than three hours sleep and the snug warmth of that coach was just nuts to me after the freezing ride into town I didn t dare get out for fear of some other man in a cap and buttons somewhere on the lookout I knew they couldn t be on to my hiding place or they d have nabbed me before this After a bit I didn t want to get out I was so warm and comfortable and elegant O Tom you should have seen your Nance in that coat and in the Bishop s carriage First thing I knew I was dreaming you and I were being married and you had brass buttons all over you and I had the cloak all right but it was a wedding dress and the chinchilla was a wormy sort of orange blossoms and and I waked when the handle of the door turned and the Bishop got in Asleep That s what I d actually been asleep And what did I do now That s easy fell asleep again There wasn t anything else to do Not really asleep this time you know just just asleep enough to be wide awake to any chance there was in it The horses had started and the carriage was half way across the street before the Bishop noticed me He was a little Bishop not big and fat and well kept like the rig but short and lean with a little white beard and the softest eye and the softest heart and the softest head Just listen Lord bless me he exclaimed hurriedly putting on his spectacles and looking about bewildered I was slumbering sweetly in the corner but I could see between my lashes that he thought he d jumped into somebody else s carriage The sight of his book and his papers comforted him though and before he could make a resolution I let the jolting of the carriage as it crossed the car track throw me gently against him Daddy I murmured sleepily letting my head rest on his little prim shoulder That comforted him too Hush your laughing Tom Dorgan I mean calling him daddy seemed to kind of take the cuss off the situation My child he began very gently Oh daddy I exclaimed snuggling down close to him you kept me waiting so long I went to sleep I thought you d never come He put his arm about my shoulders in a fatherly way You know I found out later the Bishop never had had a daughter I guess he thought he had one now Such a simple dear old soul Just the same Tom Dorgan if he had been my father I d never be doing stunts with tipsy men s watches for you nor if I d had any father Now don t get mad Think of the Bishop with his gentle thin old arm about my shoulders holding me for just a second as though I was his daughter My think of it And me Nance Olden with that fat man s watch in my waist and some girl s beautiful long coat and hat on all covered with chinchilla There s some mistake my little girl he said shaking me gently to wake me up for I was going to sleep again he feared Oh I knew you were kept at the office I interrupted quickly I preferred to be farther from the station with that girl s red coat before I got out We ve missed our train anyway haven t we After this daddy dear let s not take this route If we d go straight through on the one road we wouldn t have this drive across town every time I was wondering before I fell asleep what in the world I d do in this big city if you didn t come He forgot to withdraw his arm so occupied was he by my predicament What would you do my child if you had had missed your your father Wasn t it clumsy of him He wanted to break it to me gently and this was the best he could do What would I do I gasped indignantly Why daddy imagine me alone and and without money Why why how can you There there he said patting me soothingly on the shoulder That baby of a Bishop The very thought of Nancy Olden out alone in the streets was too much for him He had put his free hand into his pocket and had just taken out a bill and was trying to plan a way to offer it to me and reveal the fact to poor modest little Nance Olden that he was not her own daddy when an awful thing happened We had got up street as far as the opera house when we were caught in the jam of carriages in front the last afternoon opera of the season was just over I was so busy thinking what would be my next move that I didn t notice much outside and I didn t want to move Tom not a bit Playing the Bishop s daughter in a trailing coat of red trimmed with chinchilla is just your Nancy s graft But the dear little Bishop gave a jump that almost knocked the roof off the carriage pulled his arm from behind me and dropped the ten dollar bill he held as though it burned him It fell in my lap I jammed it into my coat pocket Where is it now Just you wait Tom Dorgan and you ll find out I followed the Bishop s eyes His face was scarlet now Right next to our carriage mine and the Bishop s there was another not quite so fat and heavy and big but smart I tell you with the silver harness jangling and the horses arching their backs under their blue cloth jackets monogrammed in leather All the same I couldn t see anything to cause a loving father to let go his onliest daughter in such a hurry till the old lady inside bent forward again and gave us another look Her face told it then It was a big smooth face with accordion plaited chins Her hair was white and her nose was curved and the pearls in her big ears brought out every ugly spot on her face Her lips were thin and her neck hung with diamonds looked like a bed with bolsters and pillows piled high and her eyes oh Tom her eyes They were little and very gray and they bored their way straight through the windows hers and ours and hit the Bishop plumb in the face My if I could only have laughed The Bishop the dear prim little Bishop in his own carriage with his arm about a young woman in red and chinchilla offering her a bank note and missus Dowager Diamonds her eyes popping out of her head at the sight and she one of the lady pillars of his church oh Tom it took all of this to make that poor innocent next to me realize how he looked in her eyes But you see it was over in a minute The carriage wheels were unlocked and the blue coupe went whirling away and we in the plum cushioned carriage followed slowly I decided that I d had enough Now and here in the middle of all these carriages was a bully good time and place for me to get away I turned to the Bishop He was blushing like a boy I blushed too Yes I did Tom Dorgan but it was because I was bursting with laughter Oh dear I exclaimed in sudden dismay You re not my father No no my dear I I m not he stammered his face purple now with embarrassment I was just trying to tell you you poor little girl of your mistake and planning a way to help you when He made a gesture of despair toward the side where the coupe had been I covered my face with my hands and shrinking over into the corner I cried Let me out let me out You re not my father Oh let me out Why certainly child But I m old enough surely to be and I wish I wish I were You do The dignity and tenderness and courtesy in his voice sort of sobered me But all at once I remembered the face of missus Dowager Diamonds and I understood Oh because of her I said smiling and pointing to the side where the coupe had been My but it was a rotten bad move I ought to have been strapped for it Oh Tom Tom it takes more n a red coat with chinchilla to make a black hearted thing like me into the girl he thought I was He stiffened and sat up like a prim little school boy his soft eyes hurt like a dog s that s been wounded I won t tell you what I did then No I won t And you won t understand but just that minute I cared more for what he thought of me than whether I got to the Correction or anywhere else It made us friends in a minute and when he stopped the carriage to let me out my hand was still in his But I wouldn t go I d made up my mind to see him out of his part of the scrape and first thing you know we were driving up toward the Square if you please to missus Dowager Diamonds house He thought it was his scheme the poor lamb to put me in her charge till my lost daddy could send for me He d no more idea that I was steering him toward her that he was doing the only thing possible the only square thing by his reputation than he had that Nance Olden had been raised by the Cruelty and then flung herself away on the first handsome Irish boy she met That ll do Tom Girls if you could have seen missus Dowager Diamonds face when she came down the stairs the Bishop s card in her hand and into the gorgeous parlor it d have been as good as a front seat at the show She was mad and she was curious and she was amazed and she was disarmed for the very nerve of his bringing me to her staggered her so that she could hardly believe she d seen what she had My dear missus Ramsay he began confused a bit by his remembrance of how her face had looked fifteen minutes before I bring to you an unfortunate child who mistook my carriage for her father s this afternoon at the station She is a college girl a stranger in town and till her father claims her Oh the baby the baby She was stiffening like a rod before his very eyes How did his words explain his having his arm round the unfortunate child His conscience was so clean that the dear little man actually overlooked the fact that it wasn t my presence in the carriage but his conduct there that had excited missus Dowager Diamonds And didn t the story sound thin I tell you Tom when it comes to lying to a woman you ve got to think up something stronger than it takes to make a man believe in you if you happen to be female yourself I didn t wait for him to finish but waltzed right in I danced straight up to that side of beef with the diamonds still on it and flinging my arms about her turned a coy eye on the Bishop You said your wife was out of town daddy I cried gaily Have you got another wife besides mummy The poor Bishop Do you think he tumbled Not a bit not a bit He sat there gasping like a fish and missus Dowager Diamonds surprised by my sudden attack stood bolt upright about as pleasant to hug as as you are Tom when you re jealous The trouble with the Bishop s set is that it s deadly slow Now if I had really been the Bishop s daughter all right I ll go on Oh mummy I went on quickly You know how I said it Tom the way I told you after that last row that Dan Christensen wasn t near so good looking as you remember Oh mummy you don t know how good it feels to get home Out there at that awful college studying and studying and studying sometimes I thought I d lose my senses There s a girl out there now suffering from nervous prostration She worked so hard preparing for the mid years What s her name I can t think I can t think my head s so tired But it sounds like mine a lot like mine Once I think it was yesterday I thought it was mine and I made up my mind suddenly to come right home and bring it with me But it can t be mine can it It can t be my name she s got It can t be mummy say it can t say it can t Tom I ought to have gone on the stage I ll go yet when you re sent up some day Yes I will You ll be where you can t stop me I couldn t see the Bishop but the Dowager oh I d got her Not so bad an old body either if you only take her the right way First she was suspicious and then she was scared And then bit by bit the stiffness melted out of her her arms came up about me and there I was lying all comfy with the diamonds on her neck boring rosettes in my cheeks and she a sniffling over me and patting me and telling me not to get excited that it was all right and now I was home mummy would take care of me she would that she would She did She got me on to a lounge soft as as marshmallows and she piled one silk pillow after another behind my back Come dear let me help you off with your coat she cooed bending over me Oh mummy it s so cold Can t I please keep it on To let that coat off me was to give the whole thing away My rig underneath though good enough for your girl Tom on a holiday wasn t just what they wear in the Square And d ye know you ll say it s silly but I had a conviction that with that coat I should say good by to the nerve I d had since I got into the Bishop s carriage and from there into society I let her take the hat though and I could see by the way she handled it that it was all right the thing her kind you know Oh the girl I got it from had good taste all right I closed my eyes for a moment as I lay there and she stood stroking my hair She must have thought I d fallen asleep for she turned to the Bishop and holding out her hand she said softly My dear dear Bishop you are the best hearted the saintliest man on earth Because you are so beautifully clean souled yourself you must pardon me I am ashamed to say it but I shall have no rest till I do When I saw you in the carriage downtown with that poor demented child I thought for just a moment oh can you forgive me It shows what an evil mind I have But you who know so well what Edward is what my life has been with him will see how much reason I have to be suspicious of all men I shook I laughed so hard What a corker her Edward must be See Tom poor old missus Dowager up in the Square having the same devil s luck with her man as Molly Elliott down in the Alley has with hers I wonder if you re all alike No for there s the Bishop He had taken her hand sympathizingly forgivingly but his silence made me curious I knew he wouldn t let the old lady believe for a moment I was luny if once he could be sure himself that I wasn t You lie Tom Dorgan he wouldn t Well But the poor baby how could he expect to see through a game that had caught the Dowager herself Still I could hear him walking softly toward me and I felt him looking keenly down at me long before I opened my eyes When I did you should have seen him jump Guilty he felt I could see the blood rush up under his clear thin old skin soft as a baby s to find himself caught trying to spy out my secret I just looked big eyed up at him You know the way Molly s kid does when he wakes I looked a long long time as though I was puzzled Daddy I said slowly sitting up You you are my daddy ain t you Yes yes of course It was the Dowager who got between him and me hinting heavily at him with nods and frowns But the dear old fellow only got pinker in the effort to look a lie and not say it Still he looked relieved Evidently he thought I was luny all right but that I had lucid intervals I heard him whisper something like this to the Dowager just before the maid came in with tea for me Yes Tom Dorgan tea for Nancy Olden off a silver salver out of a cup like a painted eggshell My but that almost floored me I was afraid I d give myself dead away with all those little jars and jugs So I said I wasn t hungry though Lord knows I hadn t had anything to eat since early morning But the Dowager sent the maid away and took the tray herself operating all the jugs and pots for me and then tried to feed me the tea She was about as handy as Molly s little sister is with the baby but I allowed myself to be coaxed and drank it down Tea Tom Dorgan Ever taste tea If you knew how to behave yourself in polite society I d give you a card to my friend the Dowager up in the Square How to get away That was the thing that worried me I d just made up my mind to have a lucid interval when cr creak the front door opened and in walked Tom you re mighty cute so cute you ll land us both behind bars some day but you can t guess who came in on our little family party Yes oh yes you ve met him Well the old duffer whose watch was ticking inside my waist that very minute Yes sir the same red faced big necked fellow we d spied getting full at the little station in the country Only he was a bit mellower than when you grabbed his chain Well he was Edward I almost dropped the cup when I saw him The Dowager took it from me saying There dear don t be nervous It s only only She got lost It couldn t be my daddy the Bishop was that But it was her husband so who could it be Evening Bishop Hello Henrietta back so soon from the opera roared Edward in a big husky voice He d had more since we saw him but he walked straight as the Bishop himself and he s a dear little ramrod Ah his eyes lit up at sight of me ah Miss Miss of course I ve met the young lady Henrietta but hang me if I haven t forgotten her name Miss Miss Murieson lied the old lady glibly A a relative Why mummy I said reproachfully There there It s only a joke Isn t it a joke Edward she demanded laughing uneasily Joke he repeated with a hearty bellow of laughter Best kind of a joke I call it to find so pretty a girl right in your own house eh Bishop Why does he call my father Bishop mummy I couldn t help it The fun of hearing the Dowager lie and knowing the Bishop beside himself with the pain of deception was too much for me I could see she didn t dare trust her Edward with my sad story Ho ho The Bishop that s good No my dear Miss Murieson if this lady s your mother why I must be at least I ought to be your father As such I m going to have all the privileges of a parent bless me if I m not I don t suppose he d have done it if he d been sober but there s no telling when you remember the reputation the Dowager had given him But he d got no further than to put his arm around me when both the Bishop and the Dowager flew to the rescue My but they were shocked I couldn t help wondering what they d have done if Edward had happened to see the Bishop in the same sort of tableau earlier in the afternoon But I got a lucid interval just then and distracted their attention I stood for a moment my head bent as though I was thinking deeply I think I ll go now I said at length I I don t understand exactly how I got here I went on looking from the Bishop to the Dowager and back again or how I happened to miss my father I m ever so much obliged to you and if you will give me my hat I ll take the next train back to college You ll do nothing of the sort said the Dowager promptly My dear you re a sweet girl that s been studying too hard You must go to my room and rest And stay for dinner Don t you care Sometimes I don t know how I get here myself Edward winked jovially Well I did While the Dowager s back was turned I gave him the littlest one in return for his It made him drunker than ever I think said the Bishop grimly with a significant glance at the Dowager as he turned just then and saw the old cock ogling me the young lady is wiser than we I ll take her to the station The station Ugh Not Nance Olden with the red coat still on Impossible my dear Bishop interrupted the Dowager She can t be permitted to go back on the train alone Why Miss Miss Murieson I ll see you back all the way to the college door Not at all not at all Charmed First we ll have dinner or first I ll telephone out there and tell em you re with us so that if there s any rule or anything of that sort The telephone This wretched Edward with half his wits gave me more trouble than the Bishop and the Dowager put together She jumped at the idea and left the room only to come back again to whisper to me What name my dear What name what name I repeated blankly What name indeed I wonder how Nance Olden would have done Don t hurry dear don t perplex yourself she whispered anxiously noting my bewilderment There s plenty of time and it makes no difference not a particle really I put my hand to my head I can t think I can t think There s one girl has nervous prostration and her name s got mixed with mine and I can t Hush hush Never mind You shall come and lie down in my room You ll stay with us to night anyway and we ll have a doctor in Bishop That s right assented the Bishop I ll go get him myself You you re not going I cried in dismay It was real I hated to see him go Nonsense phone It was Edward who went himself to telephone for the doctor and I saw my time getting short But the Bishop had to go anyway He looked out at his horses shivering in front of the house and the sight hurried him My child he said taking my hand just let missus Ramsay take care of you to night Don t bother about anything but just rest I ll see you in the morning he went on noticing that I kind of clung to him Well I did Can t you remember what I said to you in the carriage that I wished you were my daughter I wish you were indeed I do and that I could take you home with me and keep you child Then to night if when you pray will you pray for me as if I was your own daughter Tom Dorgan you think no prayers but a priest s are any good you bigoted snickering Catholic I tell you if some day I cut loose from you and start in over again it ll be the Bishop s prayers that ll do it The Dowager and I passed Edward in the ball He gave me a look behind her back and I gave him one to match it Just practice you know Tom A girl can never know when she ll want to be expert in these things She made me lie down on a couch while she turned the lamp low and then left me alone in a big palace of a bedroom filled with things And I wanted everything I saw If I could I d have lifted everything in sight But every minute brought that doctor nearer Soon as I could be really sure she was gone I got up and hurrying to the long French windows that opened on the great stone piazza I unfastened them quietly and inch by inch I pushed them open There within ten feet of me stood Edward No escape that way He saw me and was tiptoeing heavily toward me when I heard the door click behind me and in walked the Dowager back again I flew to her I thought I heard some one out there I said It frightened me so that I got up to look Nobody could be out there could they She walked to the window and put her head out Her lips tightened grimly No nobody could be out there she said breathing hard but you might get nervous just thinking there might be We ll go to a room upstairs And go we did in spite of all I could plead about feeling well enough now to go alone and all the rest of it How was I to get out of a second or third story window I began to think about the Correction again as I followed her upstairs and after she d left me I just sat waiting for the doctor to come and send me there I didn t much care till I remembered the Bishop I could almost see his face as it would look when he d be called to testify against me and I d be standing in that railed in prisoner s pen in the middle of the court room where Dan Christensen stood when they tried him No I couldn t bear that not without a fight anyway It was for the Bishop I d got into this part of the scrape I d get out of it so s he shouldn t know how bad a thing a girl can be While I lay thinking it over the same maid that had brought me the tea came in She was an ugly thin little thing If she s a sample of the maids in that house the lot of them would take the kink out of your pretty hair Thomas J Dorgan Esquire late of the House of Refuge and soon of Moyamensing Don t throw things People in my set mine and the Dowager s don t She had been sent to help me undress she said and make me comfortable The doctor lived just around the corner and would be in in a minute Phew She wasn t very promising but she was my only chance I took her I really don t need any help thank you Nora I said chipper as a sparrow and remembering the name the Dowager had called her by Aunt Henrietta is too fussy don t you think Oh of course you won t say a word against her She told me the other day that she d never had a maid so sensible and quick witted too as her Nora Do you know I ve a mind to play a joke on the doctor when he comes You ll help me won t you Oh I know you will Suddenly I remembered the Bishop s bill I took it out of my pocket Yep Tom that s where it went I had to choose between giving that skinny maid the biggest tip she ever got in her life or Nance Olden to the Correction You needn t swear Tom Dorgan I fancy if I d got there you d got worse No you bully you know I wouldn t tell but the police sort of know how to pair our kind In her cap and apron I let the doctor in and myself out And I don t regret a thing up there in the Square except that lovely red coat with the high collar and the hat with the fur on it I d give Tom get me a coat like that and I ll marry you for life No there s one thing I could do better if it was to be done over again I could make that dear little old Bishop wish harder I d been his daughter What am I mooning about Oh nothing There s the watch Edward s watch Take it II Yes empty handed Tom Dorgan And I can t honestly say I didn t have the chance but if my hands are empty my head is full Listen There s a girl I know with short brown hair a turned up nose and gray eyes rather far apart You know her too Well she can t help that But this girl oh she makes such a pretty boy And the ladies at the hotel over in Brooklyn they just dote on her when she s not only a boy but a bell boy Her name may be Nancy when she s in petticoats but in trousers she s Nathaniel in short Nat Now Nat in blue and buttons with his nails kept better than most boys with his curly hair parted in the middle and with a gentle tang to his voice that makes him almost girlish who would suspect Nat of having a stolen pass key in his pocket and a pretty fair knowledge of the contents of almost every top bureau drawer in the hotel Not missus Sarah Kingdon a widow just arrived from Philadelphia and desperately gone on young mister George Moriway also fresh from Philadelphia and desperately gone on missus Kingdon s money The tips that lady gave the bad boy Nat I knew I couldn t make you believe it any other way that s why I passed em on to you Tommy boy The hotel woman you know girls is a hotel woman because she isn t fit to be anything else She s lazy and selfish and little and she s shifted all her legitimate cares on to the proprietor s shoulders She actually you can understand and share my indignation can t you Tom as you ve shared other things she even gives over her black tin box full of valuables to the hotel clerk to put in the safe the coward But her vanity ah there s where we get her such speculators as you and myself She s got to outshine the woman who sits at the next table and so she borrows her diamonds from the clerk wears em like the peacock she is and trembles till they re back in the safe again In the meantime she locks them up in the tin box which she puts in her top bureau drawer hides the key forgets where she hid it and O Tom after searching for it for hours and making herself sick with anxiety she ties up her head in a wet handkerchief with vinegar on it and rings the bell for the bell boy He comes As I said he s a prompt gentle little bell boy slight looks rather young for his job but that very youth and innocence of his make him such a fellow to trust Nat says missus Kingdon tearfully pressing half a dollar into the nice lad s hand I I ve lost something and I want you to to help me find it Yes m says Nat He s the soul of politeness It must be here it must be in this room says the lady getting wild with the terror of losing I m sure positive that I went straight to the shoe bag and slipped it in there And now I can t find it and I must have it before I go out this afternoon for for a very special reason My daughter Evelyn will be home to morrow and why don t you look for it What is it ma am I told you once My key a little flat key that locks a box I ve got she finishes distrustfully Have you looked in the shoe bag ma am Why of course I have you little stupid I want you to hunt other places where I can t easily get There are other places I might have put it but I m positive it was in the shoe bag Well I looked for that key Where Where not I looked under the rubbish in the waste paper basket missus Kingdon often fooled thieves by dropping it there I pulled up the corner of the carpet and looked there it was loose it had often been used for a hiding place I looked in Miss Evelyn s boot and in her ribbon box I emptied missus Kingdon s full powder box I climbed ladders and felt along cornices I looked through the pockets of missus Kingdon s gowns a clever bell boy it takes to find a woman s pocket but even the real masculine ones among em are half feminine they ve had so much to do with women I rummaged through her writing desk and in searching a gold cornered pad found a note from Moriway hidden under the corner I hid it again carefully in my coat pocket A love letter from Moriway to a woman twenty years older than himself tain t a bad lay Tom Dorgan but you needn t try it At first she watched every move I made but later as her headache grew worse she got desperate So then I put my hand down into the shoe bag and found the key where it had slipped under a fold of cloth Do you suppose that woman was grateful She snatched it from me I knew it was there I told you it was there If you d had any sense you d have looked there first The boys in this hotel are so stupid That s all ma am She nodded She was fitting the key into the black box she d taken from the top drawer Nat had got to the outside door when he heard her come shrieking after him Nat Nat come back My diamonds they re not here I know I put them back last night I m positive I could swear to it I can see myself putting them in the chamois bag and O my God where can they be This time they re gone Nat could have told her but what s the use He felt she d only lose em again if she had em So he let them lie snug in his trousers pocket where he had put the chamois bag when his eyes lit on it under the corner of the carpet He might have passed it over to her then but you see Tom she hadn t told him to look for a bag it was a key she wanted Bell boys are so stupid This time she followed his every step He could not put his hand on the smallest thing without rousing her suspicion If he hesitated she scolded If he hurried she fumed Most unjust I call it because he had no thought of stealing just then Come she said at last we ll go down and report it at the desk Hadn t I better wait here ma am and look again She looked sharply at him No you d better do just as I tell you So down we went And we met mister Moriway there She d telephoned him The chambermaid was called the housekeeper the electrical engineer who d been fixing bells that morning and as I said a bell boy named Nat who told how he d just come on duty when missus Kingdon s bell rang found her key and returned it to her and was out of the room when she unlocked the box That was all he knew Is he telling the truth Moriway asked missus Kingdon Ye es I guess he is but where are the diamonds We must have them you know to day George she whispered And then she turned and went upstairs leaving Moriway to do the rest There s only one thing to do Major he said to the proprietor Search em all and then Search me It s an outrage cried the housekeeper Search me if ye loike growled McCarthy resentfully Oi wasn t there but a minute the lady herself can tell ye that Katie the chambermaid flushed painfully and there were indignant tears in her eyes which I ll tell you in confidence made a girl named Nancy uncomfortable But the boy Nat knowing that bell boys have no rights said nothing But he thought He thought Tom Dorgan a lot of things and a long way ahead The peppery old Major marched us all off to his private office Not much girls it hadn t come For suddenly the annunciator rang out Out of the corner of his eye Nat looked at the bell boy s bench It was empty There was to be a ball that night and the bells were going it over all the place Number Twenty one shouted the clerk at the desk But Number Twenty one didn t budge His heart was beating like a hammer and the ting ng ng of that bell calling him rang in his head like a song Number Twenty one yelled the clerk Oh he s got a devil of a temper has that clerk Some day Tom when you love me very much go up to the hotel and break his face for me You boy confound you can t you hear he shouted That time he caught the Major s ear the one that wasn t deaf He looked from Powers black face to the bench and then to me And all the time the bell kept ringing like mad Git he said to the boy And come back in a hurry Number Twenty one got but leisurely It wouldn t do for a bell boy to hurry particularly when he had such good cause Oh girls those stone stairs the servants stairs at the saint James They re fierce I tell you Mag scrubbing the floors at the Cruelty ain t so bad But this time I was jolly glad bell boys weren t allowed in the elevator For there were those diamonds in my pants pocket and I must get rid of em before I got down to the office again So I climbed those stairs and every step I took my eye was searching for a hiding place I could have pitched the little bag out of a window but Nancy Olden wasn t throwing diamonds to the birds any more than Mag here is likely to cut off the braids of red hair we used to play horse with when we drove her about the Cruelty yard One flight No chance Another Everything bare as stone and soap could keep it The third flight my knees began to tremble and not with climbing The call came from this floor But I ran up a fourth just on the chance and there in a corner was a fire hatchet strapped to the wall Behind that hatchet missus Kingdon s diamonds might lie snug till evening I put the ends of my fingers first in the little crack to make sure the little bag wouldn t drop to the floor and then dived into my pocket and And there behind me stealthily coming up the last turn of the stairs was mister George Moriway Don t you hate a soft walking man Mag That cute fellow was cuter than the old Major himself and had followed me every inch of the way There s something loose with this hatchet sir I said innocently looking down at him Oh there is What an observing little fellow you are Never mind the hatchet just tell me what number you were sent to answer Number I repeated as though I couldn t see why he wanted to know Why four hundred thirty one Not much my boy three hundred thirty one Scuse me sir ain t you mistaken He looked at me for full a minute I stared him straight in the eye A nasty eye he s got black and bloodshot and cold and full of suspicion But it wavered a bit at the end I may be he said slowly but not about the number Just you turn around and get down to three hundred thirty one All right sir Thank you very much It might have got me in trouble The ladies are so particular about having the bells answered quick I guess you ll get in trouble all right he said and stood watching from where he stood he could watch me every inch of the way till I got to three hundred thirty one at the end of the hall missus Kingdon s door And the goods still on me Tom mind that My but missus Kingdon was wrathy when she saw me Why did they send you she cried Why did you keep me waiting so long I want a chambermaid I ve rung a dozen times The whole place is crazy about that old ball to night and no one can get decent attention Can t I do what you want ma am I just yearned to get inside that door No she snapped I don t want a boy to fasten my dress in the back We often do ma am I said softly You do Well Yes m I breathed again Well it s indecent Go down and send me a maid She was just closing the door in my face and Moriway waiting for me to watch me down again missus Kingdon Well what do you want I want to tell you that when I get down to the office they ll search me She looked at me amazed And and there s something in my pocket I you wouldn t like them to find What in the world my diamonds You did take them you little wretch She caught hold of my coat But Lordy I didn t want to get away a little bit I let her pull me in and then I backed up against the door and shut it Diamonds Oh no ma am I hope I m not a thief But but it was something you dropped this I fished Moriway s letter out of my pocket and handed it to her The poor old lady Being a bell boy you know just how old ladies really are This one at evening after her face had been massaged for an hour and the manicure girl and the hair dresser had gone wasn t so bad But to day with the marks of the morning s tears on her agitated face with the blood pounding up to her temples where the hair was thin and gray Tom Dorgan if I m a vain old fool like that when I m three times as old as I am just tie a stone around my neck and take me down and drop me into the nearest water won t you You abominable little wretch she sobbed I suppose you ve told everybody in the office How could I ma am How could you She looked up the tears on her flabby flushed cheek I didn t know myself I can t read writing It was thin but she wanted to believe it She could have taken me in her arms she was so happy There there she patted my shoulder and gave me a dollar bill I was a bit hasty Nat It s only a a little business matter that mister Moriway s attending to for me We we ll finish it up this afternoon I shouldn t like Miss Kingdon to know of it because because I never like to worry her about business you know So don t mention it when she comes to morrow No m Shall I fasten your dress I simply had to stay in that room till I could get rid of those diamonds With a faded old blush the nicest thing about her I d ever seen she turned her back It s dark to day ma am I coaxed Would you mind coming nearer the window No she wouldn t mind She backed up to the corner like a gentle little lamb While I hooked with one hand I dropped the little bag where the carpet was still turned up and with the toe of my shoe spread it flat again You re real handy for a boy she said pleased Thank you ma am I answered pleased myself Moriway was still watching me of course when I came out but I ran downstairs he following close and when the Major got hold of me I pulled my pockets inside out like a little man Moriway was there at the time I knew he wasn t convinced But he couldn t watch a bell boy all day long and the moment I was sure his eyes were off me I was ready to get those diamonds back again But not a call came all that afternoon from the west side of the house except the call of those pretty precious things snug under the carpet calling calling to me to come and get them and drop bell boying for good At last I couldn t stand it any longer There s only one thing to do when your chance won t come to you that is to go to it At about four o clock I lit out climbed to the second story and there Mag I always was the luckiest girl at the Cruelty wasn t I Well there was suite two hundred thirty one all torn up plumbers and painters in there and nothing in the world to prevent a boy s skinning through when no one was watching out of the window and up the fire escape Just outside of missus Kingdon s window I lay still a minute I had seen her and Moriway go out together she all gay with finery he carrying her bag The lace curtains in three hundred thirty one were blowing in the breeze Cautiously I parted them and looked in Everything was lovely From where I lay I reached down and turned back the flap of the carpet It was too easy Those darling diamonds seemed just to leap up into my hand In a moment I had them tucked away in my pants pocket Then down the fire escape and out through two hundred thirty one where I told the painter I d been to get a toy the boy in four hundred forty one had dropped out of the window But he paid no attention to me No one did though I felt those diamonds shining like an X ray through my very body I got downstairs and was actually outside the door almost in the street and off to you when a girl called me Here boy carry this case she said Do you know who it was Oh yes you do a dear old friend of mine from Philadelphia a young lady whose taste well all right I ll tell you it was the girl with the red coat and the hat with the chinchilla fur How did they look Oh fairly well on a blonde But to my taste the last girl I d seen in the coat and hat was handsomer Well I carried her suit case and followed her back into the hotel I didn t want to a bit though that coat still wonder how she got it back She sailed up the hall and into the elevator and I had to follow We got of at the third story and she brought me right to the door of three hundred thirty one And then I knew this must be Evelyn missus Kingdon s out Miss She didn t expect you till to morrow Did she tell you that Too bad she isn t at home She said she d be kept busy all day to day with a business matter and that I d better not get here till to morrow But I Wanted to get here in time for the wedding I suggested softly You should have seen her jump Wedding Not missus Kingdon and mister Moriway She turned white Has that man followed her here Quick tell me Has she actually married him No not yet It s for five o clock at the church on the corner How do you know She turned on me suddenly suspicious Well I do know And I m the only person in the house that does I don t believe you She took out her key and opened the door and I followed her in with the suit case But before I could get it set down on the floor she had swooped on a letter that was lying in the middle of the table had torn it open and then with a cry had come whirling toward me Where is this church Come help me to get to it before five and I ll oh you shall have anything in the world you want She flew out into the hall I after her And first thing you know we were down in the street around the corner and there in front of the church was a carriage with Moriway just helping missus Kingdon out Mother At that cry the old lady s knees seemed to crumble under her Her poor old painted face looked out ghastly and ashamed from her wedding finery But Evelyn in her red coat flew to her and took her in her arms as though she was a child And like a child missus Kingdon sobbed and made excuses and begged to be forgiven I looked at Moriway It was all the pay I wanted particularly as I had those little diamonds You re just in time Miss Kingdon he said uneasily to make your mother happy by your presence at her wedding I m just in time mister Moriway to see that my mother s not made unhappy by your presence Evelyn missus Kingdon remonstrated Come Sarah Moriway offered his arm The bride shook her head To morrow she said feebly Moriway breathed a swear Miss Kingdon laughed I ve come to take care of you you silly little mother dear It won t be to morrow mister Moriway No not to morrow next week sighed missus Kingdon In fact mother s changed her mind mister Moriway She thinks it ungenerous to accept such a sacrifice from a man who might be her son don t you mother Well perhaps George She looked up from her daughter s shoulder she was crying all over that precious red coat of mine and her eyes lit on me Oh you wicked boy you told a lie she gasped You did read my letter I laughed laughed out loud it was such a bully thing to watch Moriway s face But that was an unlucky laugh of mine it turned his wrath on me He made a dive toward me I ducked and ran Oh how I ran But if he hadn t slipped on the curb he d have had me As he fell though he let out a yell Stop thief stop thief Thief Thief Thief May you never hear it Mag behind you when you ve somebody else s diamonds in your pocket It sounds it sounds the way the bay of the hounds must sound to the hare It seems to fly along with the air at the same time to be behind you at your side even in front of you I heard it bellowed in a dozen different voices and every now and then I could hear Moriway as I pelted on that brassy cruel bellow of his that made my heart sick And then all at once I heard a policeman s whistle That whistle was like a signal I saw the gates of the Correction open before me I saw your Nance Tom in a neat striped dress and she was behind bars bars bars There were bars everywhere before me In fact I felt them against my very hands for in my mad race I had shot up a blind alley a street that ended in a garden behind an iron fence I grabbed the diamonds to throw them from me but I couldn t I just couldn t I jumped the fence where the gate was low and with that whistle flying shrill and shriller after me I ran to the house I might have jumped from the frying pan Of course I might But it was all fire to me To be caught at the end is at least no worse than to be caught at the beginning Anyhow it was my one chance and I took it as unhesitatingly as a rat takes a leap into a trap to escape a terrier Only only it was my luck that the trap wasn t set The room was empty I pushed open a glass door and fell over an open trunk that stood beside it It bruised my knee and tore my hand but oh it was nuts to me For it was a woman s trunk filled with women s things A skirt A blessed skirt And not a striped one I threw off the bell boy s jacket and I got into that dear dress so quick it made my head swim The jacket was a bit tight but I didn t button it and I d just got a stiff little hat perched on my head when I heard the tramp of men on the sidewalk and in the dusk saw the cop s buttons at the gate Caught Not much Not yet I threw open the glass doors and walked out into the garden Miss Omar I wonder if it would be Miss Omar You bet I didn t take time to see who it was talking before I answered Of course I was Miss Omar I was Miss Anybody that had a right to wear skirts and be inside those blessed gates Ah h I fancied you might be I ve been expecting you It was a lazy low voice with a laugh in it and it came from a wheeled chair where a young man lay Sallow he was and slim and long and helpless you could see that by his white hanging hands But his voice it was what a woman s voice would be if she were a man It made you perk up and pretend to be somewhere near its level It fitted his soft black clothes and his fine clean face It meant silks and velvets and Oh all right Tommy Dorgan if you re going to get jealous of a voice Excuse me mister Latimer The cop came in as he spoke Moriway following the rest of the hounds hung about There s a thieving bell boy from the hotel that s somewhere in your grounds Can I come in and get him In 
1212_14653_000022_000001	train-clean-360	here Sergeant 
none	none	Aren t you mistaken No mister Moriway here saw him jump the gate not five minutes since Strange and I here all the time I may have dozed of though Certainly certainly Look for the little rascal What s he stolen Diamonds Tut tut Enterprising isn t he Miss Omar won t you kindly reach the bell yonder no on the table that s it and ring for some one to take the officer about I rang Do you know what happened An electric light strung on the tree above the table shone out and there I stood under it with Moriway s eyes full upon me Great he began Just ring again mister Latimer s voice came soft as silk My fingers trembled so the bell clattered out of them and fell jangling to the ground But it rang And the light above me went out like magic I fell back into a garden chair I beg your pardon mister was Moriway the name I must have interrupted you but my eyes are troubling me this evening and I can t bear the light Miss Omar I thought the housekeeper had instructed you one ring means lights two mean I want Burnett Here he comes Burnett take Sergeant Mulhill through the place He s looking for a thief You will accompany the Sergeant mister Moriway Thank you no If you don t mind I ll wait out here That meant me I moved toward the gate Not at all Have a seat Miss Omar sit down won t you I sat down Miss Omar reads to me mister Moriway I m an invalid as you see dependent on the good offices of my man I find a woman s voice a soothing change It must be Particularly if the voice is pleasing Miss Omar I didn t quite catch the name He waited But Miss Omar had nothing to say that minute Yes that s the name You ve got it all right said Latimer An uncommon name isn t it I don t think I ever heard it before Do you know Miss Omar as I heard your voice just before we got to the gate it sounded singularly boyish to me mister Latimer does not find it so do you I said as sweet as sweet as I could coax How sweet s that Tom Dorgan Not at all A little laugh came from Latimer as though he was enjoying a joke all by himself But Moriway jumped with satisfaction He knew the voice all right Have you a brother may I ask He leaned over and looked keenly at me I am an orphan I said sadly with no relatives A pitiful position sneered Moriway You look so much like a boy I know that Do you really think so So awfully polite was Latimer to such a rat as Moriway Why Well wait I can t agree with you Do you know I find Miss Omar very feminine Of course short hair Her hair is short then Typhoid I murmured Too bad Moriway sneered Yes I snapped I thought it was at the time My hair was very heavy and long and I had a chance to sit in a window at Troyon s where they were advertising a hair tonic and Rotten Of course it was I d no business to gabble and just because you and your new job Mag came to my mind at that minute there I went putting my foot in it Moriway laughed I didn t like the sound of his laugh Your reader is versatile mister Latimer he said Yes Latimer smoothed the soft silk rug that lay over him Poverty and that sort of versatility are often bedfellows eh Tell me mister Moriway these lost diamonds are yours No They belong to a a friend of mine missus Kingdon Oh the old lady who was married this afternoon to a young fortune hunter I couldn t resist it Moriway jumped out of his seat She was not married he stuttered She Changed her mind How sensible of her Did she find out what a crook the fellow was What was his name Morrison No Middleway I have heard it May I ask Miss Omar I didn t have to see his face his voice told how mad with rage he was how you come to be acquainted with a matter that only the contracting parties could possibly know of Why they can t have kept it very secret the old lady and the young rascal who was after her money for you see we both knew of it and I wasn t the bride and you certainly weren t the groom were you An exclamation burst from him mister Latimer he stormed may I see you a moment alone Phew That meant me But I got up just the same Just keep your seat Miss Omar Oh that silken voice of Latimer s mister Moriway I have absolutely no acquaintance with you I never saw you till to night I can t imagine what you may have to say to me that my secretary Miss Omar acts in that capacity may not hear I want to say burst from Moriway that she looks the image of the boy Nat who stole missus Kingdon s diamonds that the voice is exactly the same that But you have said it mister Moriway quite successfully intimated it I assure you She knows of my of missus Kingdon s marriage that that boy Nat found out about And you yourself also as Miss Omar mentioned Myself Damn it I m Moriway the man she was going to marry Why shouldn t I Ah h Latimer s shoulders shook with a gentle laugh Well mister Moriway gentlemen don t swear in my garden Particularly when ladies are present Shall we say good evening Here comes Mulhill now Nothing Sergeant Too bad the rogue escaped but you ll catch him They may get away from you but they never stay long do they Good evening good evening mister Moriway They tramped on and out Moriway s very back showing his rage He whispered something to the Sergeant who turned to look at me but shook his head and the gate clanged after them A long sigh escaped me Warm isn t it Latimer leaned forward Now would you mind ringing again Miss Omar I bent and groped for the bell and rang it twice How quick you are to learn he said But I really wanted the light this time Just light up Burnett he called to the man who had come out on the porch The electric bulb flashed out again just over my head Latimer turned and looked at me When I couldn t bear it any longer I looked defiantly up at him Pardon he said smiling nice teeth he has and clear eyes I was just looking for that boyish resemblance mister Moriway spoke of I hold to my first opinion you re very feminine Miss Omar Will you read to me now if you please He pointed to a big open book on the table beside his couch I think if you don t mind mister Latimer I ll begin the reading to morrow I got up to go I was through with that garden now But I do mind Silken voice Not a bit of it I turned on him so furious I thought I didn t care what came of it when over by the great gate post I saw a man crouching Moriway I sat down again and pulled the book farther toward the light We didn t learn much poetry at the Cruelty did we Mag But I know some now just the same When I began to read I heard only one word Moriway Moriway Moriway But I must have forgotten him after a time and the dark garden with the light on only one spot and the roses smelling and Latimer lying perfectly still his face turned toward me for I was reading listen I bet I can remember that part of it if I say it slow Oh Thou who Man of baser Earth didst make And ev n with Paradise devise the Snake For all the sin wherewith the Face of Man Is blacken d Man s forgiveness give and take when all at once mister Latimer put his hand on the book I looked up with a start The shadow by the gate was gone Yon rising Moon that looks for us again How oft hereafter will she wax and wane How oft hereafter rising look for us Through this same Garden and for ONE in vain Latimer was saying it without the book and with a queer smile that made me feel I hadn t quite caught on Thank you that will do he went on That is enough Miss He stopped I waited He did not say Omar I looked him square in the eye and then I had enough But what in the devil did you make believe for I asked He smiled If ever you come to lie on your back day and night year in and year out and know that never in your life will it be any different you may take pleasure in a bit of excitement and and learn to pity the under dog who in this case happened to be a boy that leaped over the gate as though his heart was in his mouth Just as you would admire the nerve of the young lady that came out of the house a few minutes after in your housekeeper s Sunday gown Yes grin Torn Dorgan You won t grin long I put down the book and got up to go Good night then and thank you mister Latimer Good night Oh Miss He didn t say Omar there is a favor you might do me Sure I wondered what it could be Those diamonds I ve got to have them you know to send them back to their owner I don t mind helping a a person who helps himself to other people s things but I can t let him get away with his plunder without being that kind of person myself So Why didn t I lie Because there are some people you don t lie to Tom Dorgan Don t talk to me you bully I m savage enough To have rings and pins and ear rings a whole bagful of diamonds and to haul em out of your pocket and lay em on the table there before him I wonder he said slowly as he put them away in his own pocket what a man like me could do for a girl like you Reform her I snarled Show her how to get diamonds honestly Say Tom let s go in for bigger game III Oh Mag Mag for heaven s sake let me talk to you No don t say anything You must let me tell you No don t call the other girls I can t bear to tell this to anybody but you You know how I kicked when Tom hit on Latimer s as the place we were to scuttle And the harder I kicked the stubborner he got till he swore he d do the job without me if I wouldn t come along Well this is the rest of it The house you know stands at the end of the street If you could walk through the garden with the iron fence you d come right down the bluff on to the docks and out into East River Tom and I came up to it from the docks last night It was dark and wet you remember The mud was thick on my trousers Nance Olden s a boy every time when it comes to doing business We ll blow it all in Tom I said as we climbed We ll spend a week at the Waldorf and then Tom Dorgan we ll go to Paris I want a red coat and hat with chinchilla like that dear one I lost and a low neck satin gown and a silk petticoat with lace and a chain with rhinestones and Just wait Sis till you get out of this And keep still I can t I m so fidgety I must talk or I ll shriek Well you ll shut up just the same Do you hear me I shut up but my teeth chattered so that Tom stopped at the gate Look here Nance are you going to flunk Say it now yes or no That made me mad Tom Dorgan I said I ll bet your own teeth chattered the first time you went in for a thing like this I m all right You ll squeal before I do That s more like Here s the gate It s locked Come Nance With a good strong swing he boosted me over handed me the bag of tools and sprang over himself He looked kind o handsome and fine my Tom as he lit square and light on his feet beside me And because he did I put my arm in his and gave it a squeeze Oh Mag it was so funny going through Latimer s garden There was the garden table where I had sat reading and thinking he took me for Miss Omar There was the bench where that beast Moriway sat sneering at me The wheeled chair was gone And it was so late everything looked asleep But something was left behind that made me think I heard Latimer s slow silken voice and made me feel cheap turned inside out like an empty pocket a dirty ragged pocket with a seam in it You ll stay here Nancy and watch Tom whispered You ll whistle once if a cop comes inside the gate but not before he s inside the gate Don t whistle too soon mind that nor too loud I ll hear ye all right And I ll whistle just once if anything happens Then you run hear me Run like the devil Tommy Well what Nothing all right I wanted to say good by but you know Tom Mag were you ever where you oughtn t to be at midnight alone No I know you weren t Twas your ugly little face and your hair that saved you the red hair we used to guy so at the Cruelty I can see you now a freckle faced thin little devil with the tangled hair to the very edge of your ragged skirt yanked in that first day to the Cruelty when the neighbors complained your crying wouldn t let em sleep nights The old woman had just locked you in there hadn t she to starve when she lit out Mothers are queer ain t they when they are queer I never remember mine Yes I ll go on I stood it all right for a time out there alone in the night But I never was one to wait patiently I can t wait it isn t in me But there I had to stand and just God just wait If I hadn t waited so hard at the very first I wouldn t a given out so soon But I stood so still and listened so terribly hard that the trees began to whisper and the bushes to crack and creep I heard things in my head and ears that weren t sounding anywhere else And all of a sudden tramp tramp tramp I heard the cop s footsteps He stopped over there by the swinging electric light above the gate I crouched down behind the iron bench And my coat caught a twig on a bush and its crack ck was like a yell I thought I d die I thought I d scream I thought I d run I thought I d faint But I didn t for there asleep on a rug that some one had forgotten to take in was the house cat I gave her a quick slap and she flew out and across the path like a flash The cop watched her his hand on the gate and passed on Mag Monahan if Tom had come out that minute without a bean and gone home with me I d been so relieved I d never have tried again But he didn t come Nothing happened Nights and nights and nights went by and the stillness began to sound again My throat went choking mad I began to shiver and I reached for the rug the cat had lain on Funny how some things strike you This was Latimer s rug I had noticed it that evening a warm soft mottled green that looked like silk and fur mixed I could see the way his long white hands looked on it and as I touched it I could hear his voice Oh Thou who Man of baser Earth didst make And ev n with Paradise devise the Snake For all the Sin wherewith the Face of Man Is blacken d Man s forgiveness give and take Ever hear a man like that say a thing like that No Well it s it s different It s as if the river had spoken or a tree it s so it s so different That saved me that verse that I remembered I said it over and over and over again to myself I fitted it to the ferry whistles on the bay to the cop s steps as they passed again to the roar of the L train and the jangling of the surface cars And right in the middle of it every drop of blood in my body seemed to leak out of me and then come rushing back to my head I heard Tom s whistle Oh it s easy to say run and I really meant it when I promised Tom But you see I hadn t heard that whistle then When it came it changed everything It set the devil in me loose I felt as if the world was tearing something of mine away from me Stand for it Not Nance Olden I did run but it was toward the house That whistle may have meant Go To me it yelled Come I got in through the window Tom had left open The place was still quiet Nobody inside had heard that whistle so far as I could tell I crept along the carpets were thick and soft and silky as the rug I d had my hands buried in to keep em warm Along a long hall and through a great room whose walls were thick with books I was making for a light I could see at the back of the house That s where Tom Dorgan must be and where I must be to find out to know With my hands out in front of me I hurried but softly and just as I had reached the portieres below which the light streamed my arms closed about a thing cold as marble naked I thought it was a dead body upright there and with a cry I pitched forward through the curtains into the lighted room Nance you devil You recognize it Yep it was Tom Big Tom Dorgan at the foot of Latimer s bed his hands above his head and Latimer s gun aimed right at his heart Think of the pluck of that cripple will you His eyes turned on me for just a second and then fixed themselves again on Tom But his voice went straight at me all right You are something of a thankless devil I must admit Miss Omar he said I didn t say anything You don t say things in answer to things like that You feel em Ashamed What do I care for a man with a voice like that But you should have heard how Tom s growl sounded after it Why the hell didn t you light out I couldn t Tom I just couldn t I sobbed There seems invariably to be a misunderstanding of signals where Miss Omar is concerned Also a disposition to use strong language in the lady s presence Don t you young man Don t you call me Miss Omar I blazed stamping my foot He laughed a contemptuous laugh I could have killed him then I hated him so At least I thought I could but just then Tom sent a spark out of the corner of his eye to me that meant it meant You know Mag what it would have meant to Latimer if I had done what Tom s eye said I thought at first I had done it it passed through my mind so quick the sweet words I d say the move I d make the quick knocking up of the pistol and then It was that that sight of Tom big Tom Dorgan with rage in his heart and death in his hand leaping on that cripple s body it made me sick I stood there gasping stood a moment too long For the curtains were pushed aside and Burnett Latimer s servant and the cop came in Tom didn t fight he s no fool to waste himself But I well never mind about me I caught a glimpse of a crazy white face on a boy s body in the great glass opposite and heard my own voice break into something I d never heard before Tom stood at last with the handcuffs on It s your own fault you damned little chump he said to me as they went out You lie Mag Monahan he s no such thing He may be a hard man to live with but he s mine my Tom my Tom What Latimer Well do you know it s funny about him He d told the cop that I d peached peached on Tom So they went off without me Why That s what he said himself when we were alone In order to insure for myself another of your most interesting visits I suppose Miss not Omar All right Tell me can I do nothing for you Aren t you sick of this sort of life Get Tom out of jail He shook his head I m too good a friend of yours to do you such a turn I don t want any friend that isn t Tom s He threw the pistol from him and pulled himself up till he sat looking at me In heaven s name what can you see in a fellow like that What s that to you I turned to go To me Things of that sort are nothing of course to me me that luckless Pot He marr d in making But tell me can a girl like you tell the truth What made you hesitate when that fellow told you with his eyes to murder me How did you know How The glass See over yonder I could watch every expression on both your faces What was it what was it child that made you oh if you owe me a single heart beat of gratitude tell me the truth You ve said it yourself What That line we read the other night about the luckless Pot His face went gray and he fell back on his pillows The strenuous life we d been leading him Tom and I was too much for him I guess Do you know I really felt sorry I d said it But he is a cripple Did he expect me to say he was big and strong and dashing like Tom I left him there and got out and away But do you know what I saw Mag beside his bed just as Burnett came to put me out My old blue coat with the buttons the bell boy s coat I d left in the housekeeper s room when I borrowed her Sunday rig The coat was hanging over a chair and right by it on a table was that big book with a picture covering every page still open at that verse about Through this same Garden and for ONE in vain IV No no no No more whining from Nance Olden Listen to what I ve got to tell you Mag listen You know where I was coming from yesterday when I passed Troyon s window and grinned up at you sitting there framed in bottles of hair tonic with all that red wig of yours streaming about you Yep from that little rat eyed lawyer s office I was glum as mud I felt as though Tom and myself were both flies caught by the leg he by the law and I by the lawyer in a sticky mess and the more we flapped our wings and struggled and pulled the more we hurt and tore ourselves and the sooner we d have to give it up Oh that wizen faced little lawyer that lives on the Tom Dorgans and the Nance Oldens who don t know which way to turn to get the money He looks at me out of his red little eyes and measures in dollars what I d do for Tom And then he sets his price a notch higher than that When I passed the big department store next to Troyon s I was thinking of this and I turned in there just aching for some of the boodle that flaunts itself in a poor girl s face when she s desperate from every silk and satin rag from every lace and jewel in the place The funny part of it is that I didn t want it for myself but for Tom Pon my soul Mag though I would have filled my arms with everything I saw I wouldn t have put on one thing of all the duds just hiked off to soak em and pay the lawyer I might have been as old and ugly and rich as the yellow skinned woman opposite me who was turning over laces on the middle counter for all these things meant to me with Tom in jail I was thinking this as I looked at her when all at once I saw You know it takes a pretty quick touch sharp eyes and good nerve to get away with the goods in a big shop like that Or it takes something altogether different It was the different way she did it She took up the piece of lace it was a big collar fine like a cobweb picture in threads you can guess what it must have been worth if that old sinner Mother Douty gave me fifteen dollars for it She took it up in a quick eager way as though she d found just what she wanted Then she took out a lace sample from her gold linked purse and held them both up close to her blinky little eyes looking at it through a gold lorgnette with emeralds in the handle pulling it and feeling it with the air of one who knows a fine thing when she sees it and just what makes it fine Then she rustled off to the door to examine it closely in the light and Mag Monahan she walked right out with it At least she d got beyond the inner doors when I tapped her on the shoulder I beg pardon madam My best style Mag She pulled herself up haughtily and blinked at me She was a little thin mummy of a woman just wrapped away in silks and velvets but on the inside of that nervous little old body of hers there must have been some spring of good material that wasn t all unwound yet She stood blinking at me without a word That lace You haven t paid for it I said Her short sighted eyes fell from my face to the collar she held in her hand Her yellow face grew ghastly Oh mercy You you don t I am a detective for the store and But Sh We don t like any noise made about these things and you yourself wouldn t enjoy Do you know who I am young woman She fumbled in her satchel and passed a card to me Glory be Guess Mag Oh you d never guess you dear old Mag Besides you haven t got the acquaintance in high society that Nance Olden can boast missus MILLS D VAN WAGENEN Oh Mag Shame on you not to know the name even of the Bishop of the great state of yes the lean short little Bishop with a little white beard and the softest eye and the softest heart and my very own Bishop Nancy Olden s Bishop And this was his wife Tut tut Mag Of course not A bishop s wife may be a kleptomaniac it s only Cruelty girls that really steal from stores I ve met the Bishop missus Van Wagenen I didn t say how she wouldn t appreciate that story And he was once very kind to me But he would be the first to tell me to do my duty now I ll do it as quietly as I can for his sake But you must come with me or I must arrest She put up a shaking hand Dear little old guy Don t don t say it It s all a mistake which can be rectified in a moment I ve been trying to match this piece of lace for years I got it at Malta when when Mills and I on our honeymoon When I saw it there on the counter I was so delighted I never thought I intended taking it to the light to be sure the pattern was the same my eyesight is so wretched and when you spoke to me it was the first inkling I had that I had really taken it without paying You certainly understand she pleaded in agitation I have no need to steal you must know that oh that I wouldn t that I couldn t If you will just let me pay you Here now Mag Monahan don t you get to sneering She was straight right on the level all right You couldn t listen to that cracked little voice of hers a minute without being sure of it I was just about to permit her graciously to pay me the money for my friend the dear Bishop s sake of course when a big floor walker happened to catch sight of us If you ll come with me missus Van Wagenen to a dressing room I ll arrange your collar for you I said very loud And then in a whisper Of course I understand but the thing may look different to other people And that big floor walker there gets a commission from the newspapers every time he tells them She gave a squawk for all the world like a dried up little hen scuttling out of a yellow dog s way and we took the elevator to the second floor The minute I closed the door of the little fitting room she held out the lace to me I have changed my mind she said and shall give you the lace back I will not keep it I can not I can not bear the sight of it It terrifies me and shocks me I can take no pleasure in it Besides besides it will be discipline for me to do without it now that I have found it after all these years Every day I shall look at the place in my collection which it would have occupied and I shall say to myself Maria Van Wagenen take warning See to what terrible straits a worldly passion may bring one what unconscious greed may do I shall give the money to Mills for charity and I will never never fill that place in my collection What good will that do I asked puzzled while I folded the collar up into a very small package You mean that I ought to submit to the exposure that I deserve the lesson and the punishment not for stealing but for being absorbed in worldly things Perhaps you are right It certainly shows that you have at some time been under Mills spiritual care my dear I wonder if he would insist whether I ought yes I suppose he would Oh A saleswoman s head was thrust in the door Excuse me she said I thought the room was empty We ve just finished trying on I said sweetly Don t go The Bishop s wife turned to her her little fluttering hands held out appealingly And do not misunderstand me The thing may seem wrong in your eyes as this young woman says but if you will listen patiently to my explanations I am sure you will see that it was a mere eager over sight the fault of absent mindedness hardly the sin of covetousness and surely not a crime I am making this confession The tender conscience of the dear blameless little soul She was actually giving herself away Worse she was giving me away too But I couldn t stand that I saw the saleswoman s puzzled face she was a tall woman with a big bust big hips and the big head all right and she wore her long train black rig for all the world like a Cruelty girl who had stolen the matron s skirt to play lady in I got behind little missus Bishop and looking out over her head I tapped my forehead significantly The saleswoman tumbled That was all right But so did the Bishop s wife for she turned and caught me at it You shall not save me from myself and what I deserve she cried I am perfectly sane and you know it and you are doing me no favor in trying to create the contrary impression I demand an An interview with the manager I interrupted I m sure missus Van Wagenen can see the manager Just go with the lady missus Van Wagenen and I ll follow with the goods She did it meek as a lamb talking all the time but never beginning at the beginning luckily for me So that I had time to slip from one dressing room to the next with the lace up my sleeve out to the elevator and down into the street D ye know what heaven must be Mag A place where you always get away with the swag and where it s always just the minute after you ve made a killing Cocky Well I should say I was I was drunk enough with success to take big chances And just while I was wishing for something really big to tackle it came along in the shape of that big floor walker He was without a hat and his eyes looked fifty ways at once But you ve got to look fifty one if you want to catch Nance Olden I ran up the stairs of the first flat house and rang the bell And as I sailed up in the elevator I saw the big floor walker hurry past he d lost the scent The boy let me off at the top floor and after the elevator had gone down I walked up to the roof It was fine way up there so still and high with the lights coming out down in the town And I took out my pretty lace collar and put it around my neck wishing I could keep it and wishing that I had at least a glass to see myself in it just once when my eye caught the window of the next house It would do for a mirror all right for the dark green shade was down But at sight of the shade blowing in the wind I forgot all about the collar It s this way Mag when they press you too far and that little rat of a lawyer had got me most to the wall I looked at the window measuring the little climb it would be for me to get to it the house next door was just one story higher than the one where I was so its top story was on a level with the roof nearly where I stood And I made up my mind to get what would let Tom off easy or break into jail myself And so I didn t care much what I might fall into through that window And perhaps because I didn t care I slipped into a dark hall and not a thing stirred not a footstep creaked I felt like the Princess Princess Nancy Olden come to wake the Sleeping Beauty some dude it d be that would have curly hair like Tom Dorgan s and would wear clothes like my friend Latimer s over in Brooklyn Can you see me there standing on one leg like a stork ready to lie or to fly at the first sound Well the first sound didn t come Neither did the second In fact none of em came unless I made em myself Softly as Molly goes when the baby s just dropped off to sleep I walked toward an open door It was a parlor smelly with tobacco and with lots of papers and books around And nary a he beauty nor any other kind I tried the door of a room next to it A bedroom But no Beauty Silly Don t you tumble yet It was a bachelor s apartment and the Bachelor Beauty was out and Princess Nancy had the place all to herself I suppose I really ought to have left my card or he wouldn t know who had waked him but I hadn t intended to go calling when I left home So I thought I d look for one of his as a souvenir and anything else of his I could make use of There were shirts I d liked for Tom dandy colored ones and suits with checks in em and without But I wanted something easy and small and flat made of crackly printed yellow or green paper with numbers on it How did I know he had anything like that Why Mag Mag Monahan one would think you belonged to the Bishop s set you re so simple I had to turn on the electric light after a bit it got so dark And I don t like light in other people s houses when they re not at home and neither am I But there was nothing in the bedroom except some pearl studs I got those and then went back to the parlor The desk caught my eye Oh Mag it had the loveliest pictures on it pictures of swell actresses and dancers It was mahogany with lots of little drawers and two curvy side boxes I pulled open all the drawers They were full of papers all right but they were printed cut from newspapers and all about theaters You can t feed things like this Nance to that shark of a lawyer I said to myself pushing the box on the side impatiently And then I giggled outright Why Just cause I had pushed that side box till it swung aside on hinges I didn t know about and there in a little secret nest was a pile of those same crisp crinkly paper things I d been looking for twenty forty sixty one hundred ten one hundred sixty two hundred ten two hundred sixty three hundred ten Three hundred and ten dollars Mag Monahan Three hundred and ten and Nance Olden Glory be I whispered Glory be damned I heard behind me I turned The bills just leaked out of my hand on to the floor The Bachelor Beauty had come home Mag and nabbed the poor Princess instead of her catching him napping He wasn t a beauty either a big stout fellow with a black mustache His hand on my shoulder held me tight but the look in his eyes behind his glasses held me tighter I threw out my arms over the desk and hid my face Caught Nancy Olden with her hands dripping and not a lie in her smart mouth He picked up the bills I had dropped counted them and put them in his pocket Then he unhooked a telephone and lifted the stand from his desk Hello Spring three thousand one hundred please Hello Chief s office This is Obermuller Standard Theater I want an officer to take charge of a thief I ve caught in my apartments here at the Bronsonia Yes right on the corner Hold him till you come Well rather He put down the phone I pulled the pearl studs out of my pocket You might as well take these too I said So thoughtful of you seeing that you d be searched But I ll take em anyway You intended them for Him You didn t get anything else I shook my head as I lay there Hum It was half a laugh and half a sneer I hated him for it as he sat leaning back on the back legs of his chair his thumbs in his arm holes I felt his eyes those smart keen eyes burning into my miserable head I thought of the lawyer and the deal he d give poor Tom and all at once You d have sniffled yourself Mag Monahan There I was caught The cop d be after me in five minutes With Tom jugged and me in stripes it wasn t very jolly and I lost my nerve Ashamed huh he said lightly I nodded I was ashamed Pity you didn t get ashamed before you broke in here What the devil was there to be ashamed of The sting in his voice had cured me I never was a weeper I sat up my face blazing and stared at him He d got me to hand over to the cop but he hadn t got me to sneer at I saw by the look he gave me that he hadn t really seen me till then Well he answered what the devil is there to be ashamed of now Of being caught that s what Oh He tilted back again on his chair and laughed softly Then you re not ashamed of your profession Are you of yours Well there s a slight difference Not much whatever it may be It s your graft it s everybody s to take all he can get and keep out of jail That s mine too But you see I keep out of jail I see you re not there yet Oh I think you needn t worry about that I ll keep out thank you imprisonment for debt don t go nowadays Debt I m a theatrical manager my girl and I m not on the inside which is another way of saying that a man who can t swim has fallen overboard And when you do go down A little less exultation my dear or I might suppose you d be glad when I do Well when you know yourself going down for the last time do you mean to tell me you won t grasp at a straw like like this I nodded toward the open window and the desk with all its papers tumbling out Not much He shook his head and bit the end of a cigar with sharp white teeth It s a fool graft I m self respecting And I don t admire fools He lit his cigar and puffed a minute taking out his watch to look at it as cold bloodedly as though we were waiting he and I to go to supper together Oh how I hated him Honesty isn t the best policy he went on it s the only one The vain fool that gets it into his head or shall I say her head No Well no offense I assure you his head then that he s smarter than a world full of experience ought to be put in jail for his own protection he s too big a jay to be left out of doors For five thousand years more or less the world has been putting people like him behind bars where they can t make asses of themselves Yet each year and every day and every hour a new ninny is born who fancies he s cleverer than all his predecessors put together Talk about suckers Why they re giants of intellect compared to the mentally lop sided that five thousand years of experience can t teach When the criminal clown s turn comes he hops skips and jumps into the ring with the old old gag He thinks it s new because he himself is so fresh and green Here I am again he yells the fellow that ll do you up Others have tried it They re dead in jail or under jail yards But me just watch me We do and after a little we put him with his mates and a keeper in a barred kindergarten where fools that can t learn little moral cripples of both sexes my dear belong Bah He puffed out the smoke throwing his head back in a cloud toward the ceiling I sprang from my seat and faced him I was tingling all through I didn t care a rap what became of me for just that minute I forgot about Tom I prayed that the cop wouldn t come for a minute yet but only that I might answer him You re mighty smart ain t you You can sit back here and sneer at me can t you And feel so big and smart and triumphant What ve you done but catch a girl at her first bungling job It makes you feel awfully cocky don t it What a big man am I Bah I blew the smoke up toward the ceiling from my mouth with just that satisfied gall that he had had or rather I pretended to He let down the front legs of his chair and began to stare at me And you don t know it all mister Manager not you Your clown criminal don t jump into the ring because he s so full of fun he can t stay out He goes in for the same reason the real clown does because he gets hungry and thirsty and sleepy and tired like other men and he s got to fill his stomach and cover his back and get a place to sleep And it s because your kind gets too much that my kind gets so little it has to piece it out with this sort of thing No you don t know it quite all There s a girl named Nancy Olden that could tell you a lot smart as you are She could show you the inside of the Cruelty where she was put so young she never knew that children had mothers and fathers till a red haired girl named Mag Monahan told her and then she was mighty glad she hadn t any She thought that all little girls were bloodless and dirty and all little boys were filthy and had black purple marks where their fathers had tried to gouge out their eyes She thought all women were like the matron who came with a visitor up to the bare room where we played without toys the new dirty newly bruised ones of us and the old clean healing ones of us and said Here chicks is a lady who s come to see you Tell her how happy you are here Then Mag s freckled little face her finger in her mouth looked up like this She was always afraid it might be her mother come for her And the crippled boy jerked himself this way I used to mimic him and he d laugh with the rest of them over the bare floor He always hoped for a penny Sometimes he even got it And the boy with the gouged eye he would hold his pants up like this He had just come in and there was nothing to fit him And he d put his other hand over his bad eye and blink up at her like this And the littlest boy oh ha ha ha you ought have seen that littlest boy He was in skirts an old dress they d given me to wear the first day I came there were no pants small enough for him He d back up into the corner and hide his face like this and peep over his shoulder he had a squint that way that made his face so funny See it makes you laugh yourself But his body my God it was blue with welts And me I d put the baby down that d been left on the door steps of the Cruelty and I d waltz up to the lady the nice patronizing rich lady with her handkerchief to her nose and her lorgnette to her eyes see like this I knew just what graft would work her I knew what she wanted there I d learned So I d make her a curtsy like this and in the piousest sing song I d There was a heavy step out in the hall it was the policeman I d forgot while I was talking I was back back in the empty garret at the top of the Cruelty I could smell the smell of the poor the dirty weak sick poor I could taste the porridge in the thick little bowls like those in the bear story Molly tells her kid I could hear the stifled sobs that wise poor children give quiet ones so they ll not be beaten again I could feel the night when strange deserted tortured babies lie for the first time each in his small white cot the new ones waking the old with their cries in a nightmare of what had happened before they got to the Cruelty I could see the world barred over as I saw it first through the Cruelty s barred windows and as I must see it again now that You see you don t know it quite all yet mister Manager I spat it out at him and then walked to the cop my hands ready for the bracelets But there s one thing I do know He s a big fellow but quick on his feet and in a minute he was up and between me and the cop And there isn t a theatrical man in all America that knows it quicker than Fred Obermuller that can detect it sooner and develop it better And you ve got it girl you ve got it Officer take this for your trouble I couldn t hold the fellow after all Never mind which way he went I ll call up the office and explain He shut the door after the cop and came back to me I had fallen into a chair My knees were weak and I was trembling all over Have you seen the playlet Charity at the Vaudeville he roared at me I shook my head Well it s a scene in a foundling asylum Here s a pass Go up now and see it If you hurry you ll get there just in time for that act Then if you come to me at the office in the morning at ten I ll give you a chance as one of the Charity girls Do you want it God Mag Do I want it V Do you remember Lady Patronesses Day at the Cruelty Mag Remember how the place smelt of cleaning ammonia on the bare floors Remember the black dresses we all wore and the white aprons with the little bibs and the oily sweetness of the matron and how our faces shone and tingled from the soap and the rubbing Remember it all Well who d a thought then that Nance Olden ever would make use of it on the level too Drop the Cruelty and tell you about the stage Why it s bare boards back there bare as the Cruelty but oh there s something that you don t see but you feel it something magic that makes you want to pinch yourself to be sure you re awake I go round there just doped with it my face if you could see it must look like Molly s kid s when she is telling him fairy stories I love it Mag I love it And what do I do That s what I was trying to tell you about the Cruelty for It s in a little act that was made for Lady Gray that there are four Charity girls on the stage and I m one of em Lady Gray Why Mag how can you ever hope to get on if you don t know who s who How can you expect me to associate with you if you re so ignorant Yes a real Lady as real as the wife of a Lord can be Lord Harold Gray s a sure enough Lord and she s his wife but but a chippy just the same that s what she is in spite of the Gray emeralds and that great Gray rose diamond she wears on the tiniest chain around her scraggy neck Do you know Mag Monahan that this Lady Harold Gray was just a chorus girl and a sweet chorus it must have been if she sang there when she nabbed Lord Harold You d better keep your eye on Nancy Olden or first thing you know she ll marry the Czar of Russia or Tom Dorgan poor fellow when he gets out Well just the same Mag if that white faced scrawny little creature can be a Lady a girl with ten times her brains and at least half a dozen times her good looks oh we re not shy on the stage Mag about throwing bouquets at ourselves Can she act Don t be silly Mag Can t you see that Obermuller s just hiring her title and playing it in big letters on the bills for all it s worth She acts the Lady Patroness come to look at us Charity girls She comes on though looking like a fairy princess Her dress is just blazing with diamonds There s the Lady s coronet in her hair Her thin little arms are banded with gold and diamonds and on her neck O Mag Mag that rose diamond is the color of rose leaves in a fountain s jet through which the sun is shining It s long long as my thumb I swear it is Mag nearly and it blazes oh it blazes Well it blazes dollars into Obermuller s box all right for the Gray jewels are advertised in the bill with this one at the head of the list the star of them all You see it s this way Lord Harold Gray s bankrupt He s poor as as Nance Olden Isn t that funny But he s got the family jewels all right to have as long as he lives Nary a one can he sell though for after his death they go to the next Lord Gray So he makes em make a living for him and as they can t go on and exhibit themselves Lady Gray sports em and draws down two hundred dollars a week Yep two hundred But do you know it isn t the two hundred dollars a week that makes me envy her till I m sick it s that rose diamond If you could only see it Mag you d sympathize with me and understand why my fingers just itched for it the first night I saw her come on Pon my soul Mag the sight of it blazing on her neck dazzled me so that it shut out all the staring audience that first night and I even forgot to have stage fright What s doped you Olden Obermuller asked when the curtain went down and we all hurried to the wings I was in the black dress with the white bibbed apron and I looked up at him still dazed by the shine of that diamond and my longing for it You d almost kill with your own hands for a diamond like that Mag Doped Why what didn t I do I asked him That s just it he said looking at me curiously but I could feel his disappointment in me You didn t do anything not a blasted thing more than you were told to do The world s full of supers that can do that For just a minute I forgot the diamond Then it s a mistake You were wrong and and I can t be an actress He threw back his head before he answered puffing a mouthful of smoke up at the ceiling as he did the night he caught me The gesture itself seemed to remind him of what had made him think in the first place he could make an actress of me For he laughed down at me and I saw he remembered Well he said we ll wait and see I was mistaken though sure enough about one thing that night I looked up at him You re a darn sight prettier than I thought you were The gold brick you sold me isn t all He put out his hand to touch my chin I side stepped and he turned laughing to the stage But he called after me Is a beauty success going to content you Olden Well we ll wait and see I drawled back at him in his own throaty bass Oh I was drunk Mag drunk with thinking about that diamond I didn t care even to please Obermuller I just wanted the feel of that diamond in my hand I wanted it lying on my own neck the lovely cool shining rosy thing It s like the sunrise Mag that beauty stone It s just a tiny pool of water blushing It s How to get it How to get away with it On what we d get for that diamond Tom and I when his time is up could live for all our lives and whoop it up besides We could live in Paris where great grafters live and grafting pays where if you ve got wit and fifty thousand dollars and happen to be a darn sight prettier you can just spin the world around your little finger But do you know even then I couldn t bear to think of selling the pretty thing It hurt me to think of anybody having it but just Nance Olden But I hadn t got it yet Gray has a dressing room to herself And on her table which is a big box open end down just where the three sided big mirror can multiply the jewels and make you want em three times as bad her big russia leather silver mounted box lies open while she s dressing and undressing Other times it s locked tight and his Lordship himself has it tight in his own right hand or his Lordship s man Topham has it just as tight How to get that diamond There was a hard nut for Nance Olden s sharp teeth to crack I only wanted that never say I m greedy Mag Gray could keep all the rest of the things the pigeon in rubies and pearls the tiara all in diamonds the chain of pearls and the blazing rings and the waist trimming all of emeralds and diamond stars But that diamond that huge rose diamond I couldn t I just couldn t let her have it And yet I didn t know the first step to take toward getting it till Beryl Blackburn helped me out She s one of the Charities like me a tall bleached blonde with a pretty pale face and gold gray eyes And if you d believe her there s not a man in the audience afternoon or evening that isn t dead gone on her Guess who s my latest she said to me this afternoon while we four Charities stood in the wings waiting Topham old Topham It all got clear to me then in a minute Topham nothing I sneered Beryl Big head Topham thinks of only one thing Milady s jewel box Don t you fool yourself Oh does he Miss Well just to prove it he let me try on the rose diamond last night There It s easy to say so but I don t see the proof He d lose his job so quick it d make his head spin if he did it Not if he did but if they knew he did You ll not tell Not me Why would I I don t believe it and I wouldn t expect anybody else to I don t believe you could get Topham to budge from his chair in Gray s dressing room if you d What ll you bet I ll bet you the biggest box of chocolate creams at Huyler s Done I ll send for him to night just before Gray and her Lord come and you see How ll I see Where ll I be Well you be waiting in the little hall right of Gray s dressing room at seven thirty to night and you might as well bring the creams with you Catch on Mag At seven thirty in the evening I was waiting but not in the little hall of Gray s dressing room I hadn t gone home at all after the afternoon performance you know we play at three and again at eight thirty I had just hidden me away till the rest were gone and as soon as the coast was clear I got into Gray s dressing room pushed aside the chintz curtains of the big box that makes her dressing table and waited Lord how the hours dragged I hadn t had anything to eat since lunch and it got darker and darker in there and hot and close and cramped I put in the time much as I could thinking of Tom The very first thing I d do after cashing in would be to get up to Sing Sing to see him I m crazy to see him I d tell him the news and see if he couldn t bribe a guard or plan some scheme with me to get out soon Afraid me What of If they found me under that box I d just give em the Beryl story about the bet How do you know they wouldn t believe it Oh I don t care you ve got to take chances Mag Monahan if you go in for big things And this was big huge Do you know how much that diamond s worth And do you know how to spend fifty thousand I spent it all there in the box every penny of it When I got tired spending money I dozed a bit and in my dream spent it over again And then I waked and tried to fancy new ways of getting rid of it but my head ached and my back ached and my whole body was so strained and cramped that I was on the point of giving it all up when that blessed old Topham came in He set the big box down with a bang that nearly cracked my head He turned on the lights and stood whistling Tommy Atkins And then suddenly there came a soft call Topham Topham I leaned back and bit my fingers till I knew I wouldn t shriek The Englishman listened a minute Then the call came again and Topham creaked to the door and out In a twinkling I was out too you bet Mag He hadn t opened the box at all There it stood in the middle of the space framed by the three glasses I pulled at the lid Locked I could have screamed with rage But the sound of his step outside the door sobered me He was coming back In a frantic hurry I turned toward the window which I had unlocked when I came in four hours ago But I hadn t time to make it I heard the old fellow s hand on the door and I tumbled back into the box in such a rush that the curtains were still waving when he came in Slowly he began to place the jewels one by one in the order her Ladyship puts them on We Charity girls had often watched him from the door he never let one of us put a foot inside He was method and order itself He never changed the order in which he lifted the glittering things out nor the places he put them back in I put my hand up against the top of the box tracing the spot where each piece would be lying Think Mag just half an inch between me and quarter of a million Oh I was sore as I lay there And I wasn t so cock sure either that I d get out of it straight I tried the Beryl story lots of ways on myself but somehow every time I fancied myself telling it to Obermuller it got tangled up and lay dumb and heavy inside of me But at least it would be better to appear of my own will before the old Englishman than be discovered by Lord Gray and his Lady I had my fingers on the curtains and in another second I d been out when Miss Beryl Blackburn s compliments mister Topham and would you step to the door as there s something most important she wants to tell you Oh I loved every syllable that call boy spoke There was a giggle behind his voice too old Topham was the butt of every joke The first call which had fooled me must have been from some giddy girl who wanted to guy the old fellow She had fooled me all right But this this one was the real article There was a pause Topham must be looking about to be sure things were safe Then he creaked to the door and shut it carefully behind him It only took a minute but in that minute in that minute Mag I had the rose diamond clutched safe in my fingers I was on the top of the big trunk and out of the window Oh the feel of that beautiful thing in my hand I d a loved it if it hadn t been worth a penny but as it was I adored it I slipped the chain under my collar and the diamond slid down my neck and I felt its kiss on my skin I flew down the black corridor bumping into scenery and nearly tripping two stage carpenters I heard Ginger the call boy ahead of me and dodged behind some properties just in time He went whistling past and I got to the stage door I pulled it open tenderly cautiously and turned to shut it after me And And something held it open in spite of me No no Mag it wasn t a man It was a memory It rose up there and hit me right over the heart the memory of Nancy Olden s happiness the first time she d come in this very door feeling that she actually had a right to use a stage entrance feeling that she belonged she Nancy to this wonderland of the stage You must never tell Tom Mag promise He wouldn t see He couldn t understand I couldn t make him know what I felt any more than I d dare tell him what I did I shut the door But not behind me I shut it on the street and Mag I shut for ever another door too the old door that opens out on Crooked Street With my hand on my heart that was beating as though it would burst I flew back again through the black corridor through the wings and out to Obermuller s office With both my hands I ripped open the neck of my dress and pulling the chain with that great diamond hanging to it I broke it with a tug and threw the whole thing down on the desk in front of him For God s sake I yelled Don t make it so easy for me to steal I don t know what happened for a minute I could see his face change half a dozen ways in as many seconds He took it up in his fingers at last It swung there at the end of the slender little broken chain like a great drop of shining water blushing and sparkling and trembling His hands trembled too and he looked up at last from the diamond to my face It s worth at least fifty thousand you know valued at that I didn t answer He got up and came over to where I had thrown myself on a bench What s the matter Olden Don t I pay you enough I want to see Tom I begged It s so long since he He s up at at in the country Sing Sing I nodded You poor little devil That finished me I m not used to being pitied I sobbed and sobbed as though some dam had broken inside of me You see Mag I knew in that minute that I d been afraid deathly afraid of Fred Obermuller s face when it s scornful and sarcastic and of his voice when it cuts the flesh of self conceit off your very bones And the contrast well it was too much for me But something came quick to sober me It was Gray She stormed in followed by Lord Harold and Topham and half the company The diamond the rose diamond she shrieked It s gone And the carpenters say that new girl Olden came flying from the direction of my dressing room I ll hold you responsible Hush sh Obermuller lifted his hands and nodded over toward me Olden she squealed Grab her Topham I ll bet she stole that diamond and she can t have got rid of it yet Topham jumped toward me but Obermuller stopped him You d win only half your bet my Lady Obermuller said softly She did get hold of the Gray rose worth fifty thousand dollars in spite of all your precautions The world seemed to fall away from me I looked up at him I couldn t believe he d go back on me And she brought it straight to me as I had asked her to and promised to raise her salary if she d win out For I knew that unless I proved to you it could be stolen you d never agree to hire a detective to watch those things which will get us all into trouble some day Here Scoot out o this It s nearly time for your number He passed the diamond over to her and they all left the office So did I but he held out his hand as I passed It goes that about a raise for you Olden Now earn it Isn t he white Mag white clean through that big fellow Obermuller VI I got into the train Mag the happiest girl in all the country I d a big basket of things for Tom I was got up in my Sunday best for I wanted to make a hit with some fellow with a key up there who d make things soft and easy for my Tommy I had so much to tell him I knew just how I d take off every member of the company to amuse him I had memorized every joke I d heard since I d got behind the curtain not very hard for me things always had a way of sticking in my mind I knew the newest songs in town and the choruses of all the old ones I could show him the latest tricks with cards I d got those at first hand from Professor Haughwout You know how great Tom is on tricks I could explain the disappearing woman mystery and the mirror cabinet I knew the clog dance that Dewitt and Daniels do I had pictures of the trained seals the great elephant act Mademoiselle Picotte doing her great tight rope dance and the Brothers Borodini in their pyramid tumbling Yes it was a whole vaudeville show with refreshments between the acts that I was taking up to Tom Dorgan I don t care much for a lot of that truck funny isn t it how you get to turn up your nose at the things you d have given a finger for once upon a time But Tom oh I d got everything pat for him my big handsome Tom Dorgan in stripes with his curls all shaved off ugh I d got just so far in my thoughts sitting there in the train when I gave a shiver I thought for a minute it was at the idea of my Tom with one of those bare round convict heads on him that look like fat skeleton faces But it wasn t It was Guess Mag Moriway Both of us thought the same thing of each other for the first second that our eyes met I could see that He thought I was caught at last And I thought he d been sharp once too often And Mag it would be hard to say which of us would have been happier if it had been the truth Oh to meet Moriway bound sure enough for Sing Sing He got up and came over to me smiling wickedly He took the seat behind me and leaning forward said softly Is Miss Omar engaged to read to some invalid up at Sing Sing And for how long a term I should say engagement I d got through shivering by then I was ready for him I turned and looked at him in that very polite distant sort o way Gray uses in her act when the Charity superintendent speaks to her It s the only decent thing she does chances are that that s how Lord Gray s mother looks at her You know my sister mister mister I asked humbly He looked at me perplexed for just a second Sister be hanged he said at last I know you Nat and I m glad to my finger tips that you ve got it in the neck in spite of all your smartness You re altogether wrong sir I said very stately but hurt a bit you know I ve often been taken for my sister but gentlemen usually apologize when I explain to them It s hard enough to have a sister who I looked up at him tearfully with my chin a wabble with sorrow He grinned Liars should have good memories he sneered Miss Omar said she was an orphan you remember and had not a relative in the world Did she say that Did Nora say that I exclaimed piteously Oh what a little liar she is I suppose she thought it made her more interesting to be so alone more appealing to kind hearted gentlemen like yourself I hope she wasn t ungrateful to you too as she was to that kind mister Latimer before he found her out And she had such a good position there too I wanted to look at him oh I wanted to But it was my role to sit there with downcast eyes just the picture of holy grief I was the good one the good shocked sister and though I wasn t a bit afraid of anything he could do to me or any game he could put up I yearned to make him believe me just because he was so suspicious so wickedly smart so sure he was on But his very silence sort of told me he almost believed or that he was laying a trap Will you tell me he said how you your sister got Latimer to lie for her mister Latimer lie Oh you don t know him He expected a lady to read to him that very evening He had never seen her and when Nora walked into the garden After getting a skirt somewhere Yes the housekeeper s it happened to be her evening out why he just naturally supposed Nora was Miss Omar Ah then her name isn t Omar What might it be I d rather not tell if you don t mind But when Latimer found out she had the diamonds he did find out She confessed to him Nora s not really so bad a girl as Very interesting But it doesn t happen to be Latimer s version And you say Latimer wouldn t lie I got pale but the paleness was on the inside of me Think I was going to flinch before a chump like Moriway even if I had walked straight into his trap It isn t I exclaimed No Latimer s note to missus Kingdon said the diamonds were found in the bell boy s jacket the thief had left behind him Well It only shows what a bad habit lying is Nora must have fibbed to me for the pure pleasure of fibbing I ll never dare to trust her again Do you believe then that she didn t have anything to do with the hotel robbery I do hope so It s one less sin on her wicked head It s hard having such a girl in the family Oh wasn t I grieved He looked me straight in the eye I looked at him I was unutterably sad about that tough sister of mine and I vow I looked holy then though I never did before and may never again Well I only saw her in the twilight he said slowly watching my face all the time You two sisters are certainly miraculously alike The train was slowing down and I got up with my basket I stood right before him my full face turned toward him Are we I asked simply Don t you think it s more the expression than anything else and the voice Nora s really much fairer than I am Good by He watched me as I went out I felt his eyes on the back of my jacket and I was tempted to turn at the door and make a face at him But I knew something better and safer than that I waited till the train was just pulling out and then standing below his window I motioned to him to raise it He did I thought you were going to get out here I called Are you sure you don t belong in Sing Sing mister Moriway I can see his face yet Mag and every time I think of it it makes me nearly die of laughing He had actually been fooled another time It was worth the trip up there to make a guy of him once more And whether it was or not Mag it was all I got after all For would you believe Tom Dorgan would turn out such a sorehead He s kicked up such a row ever since he got there that it s the dark cell for him and solitary confinement Think of it for Tom I begged I bluffed I cried I coaxed but many s the Nance Olden that has played her game against the rules of Sing Sing and lost They wouldn t even let me leave the things for him or give him a message from me And back to the station I had to carry the basket and all the schemes I had to make old Tom Dorgan grin All the way back I had him in my mind He s a tiger Tom when he s roused I could see him shut up there by himself with not a soul to talk to with not a human eye to look into with not a thing on earth to do Tom who s action itself He never was much of a thinker and I never saw him read even a newspaper What would he do to kill the time Can t you see him there at bay back on his haunches cursing and cursed alone in the everlasting black silence I saw nothing else Wherever I turned my eyes that terrible picture was before me And always it was just on the verge of becoming something else something worse He could throttle the world with his bare hands if it had but one neck in the mood he must be in now It was when I couldn t bear it a moment longer that I set my mind to find something else to think of I found it Mag Do you know what it was It was just three words of Obermuller s Earn it now After all Miss Monahan this graft of honesty they all preach so much about hasn t anything mysterious in it All it is is putting your wits to work according to the rules of the game and not against them I was driven to it the thought of big Tom crouching for a spring in the dark cell up yonder sent me whirling out into the thinking place like the picture of the soul in the big book at Latimer s I read out of And first thing you know pon honor Mag it was as much fun planning how to earn it now as any lifting I ever schemed It s getting the best of people that always charmed me and here was a way to fool em according to law So busy I was making it all up that the train pulled into the station before I knew it I gave a last thought to that poor old hyena of a Tom and then put him out of my mind I had other fish to fry Straight down to Mother Douty I went with my basket A fool girl mother on her way up to Sing Sing lost her basket and Nance Olden found it it ought to be worth a good deal She grinned You couldn t make old Douty believe that the Lord himself wouldn t steal if He got a chance And she knows the chances that come butting up against Nancy Olden Why did I lie to her Not for practice I assure you She d have beaten me down to the last cent if she thought it was mine but she always thinks there ll be a find for her in something that s stolen So I let her think I d stolen it in the railway station and we came to terms With what she gave me I bought a wig Mag I want you some day when you can get off to come and see that wig I shouldn t wonder but you d recognize it It s red of very coarse hair but a wonderful color and so long it yes it might be your own Mag Monahan it s so much like it I went to the theater and got my Charity rig took it home and sat for hours there just looking at em both When evening came I was ready to earn it now You see Obermuller had given me the whole day to be away and neither Gray nor the other three Charities expected me back I had to do it on the sly you sassy Mag Yes it was partly because I love to cheat but more because I was bound to have my chance once whether anybody else enjoyed it or not I came to the theater in my Charity rig and the wig It looked as if I d slept in it and it came down to the draggled hem of the skirt All the way there I walked like you Mag Once when a newsboy grinned at me and shouted Carrots I grinned back your own old Cruelty grin Mag I vow I felt so much like you as you used to be that when I lurched out on the stage at last stumbling over my shoe laces and trying to push the hair out of my eyes you d have sworn it was little Mag Monahan I making her debut in the Cruelty room Oh Mag Mag you darling Mag Did you ever hear a whole house a great big theater full of a peevish vaudeville audience just rise at you give one roar of laughter they hadn t expected at all to give and then settle down to giggle at every move you made Girl alive I just had em They couldn t take their eyes off me If I squirmed they howled If I stood on one foot scratching the torn leg of my stocking with the other you know Mag they yelled If I grinned they just roared Oh Mag can t you see Don t you understand I was It The center of the stage I carried round with me it was just Nancy Olden And for ten minutes Nancy had nothing to do but to play with em Pon my life Mag it s just like stealing the old graft exactly it s so fascinating so busy and risky except that they play the game with you and pay you and love you to fool em When the curtain fell it was different Grays followed by the Charities all clean and spick and span and not in it not even on the edge of it stormed up to Obermuller standing at the wings I ll quit the show here and now she squawked It s a shame a beastly shame How dare you play me such a trick Fred Obermuller I never was treated so in my life to have that dirty little wretch come tumbling on like that without even so much as your telling me you d made up all this new business for her It s indecent anyway Why I lost my cue There was a gap for a full minute The whole act was such a ghastly failure that I That you d better go out now and make your prettiest bow Gray Phew Listen to the house roar That s what I call applause Go on now She went Me I didn t say a word I looked at Obermuller and and I just did like this Yes winked Mag Monahan I was so crazily happy I had to didn t I But do you know what he did Do you know what he did Well I suppose I am screaming and the Troyons will put me out but he just winked back And then Gray came trailing back into the wings and the shrieking and thumping and whistling out in front just went on and on and on and on Um I just listened and loved it every thump of it And I stood there like a demure little kitten or more like Mag Monahan after she d had a good licking and was good and quiet And I never so much as budged till Obermuller said Well Nance you have earned it The gall of you But it only proves that Fred Obermuller never yet bought a gold brick Only let me in on your racket next time There go on take it It s yours Oh to have Fred Obermuller say things like that to you He gave me a bit of a push Twas just a love pat I stumbled out on to the stage VII And that s why Marguerite de Monahan I want you to buy in with the madam here Let em keep on calling it Troyon s as much as they want but you re to be a partner on the money I ll give you If this fairy story lasts it ll be your own Mag a sort of commission you get on my take off of you But if anything happens to the world if it should go crazy or get sane and not love Nancy Olden any more why here ll be a place for me too Does it look that way Divil a bit you croaker It looks it looks listen and I ll tell you how it looks It looks as though Gray and the great Gray rose diamond and the three Charities had all become a bit of background for Nance Olden to play upon It looks as though the audience likes the sound of my voice as much almost as I do myself anyway as much as it does the sight of me It looks as though the press if you please had discovered a new stage star for down comes a little reporter to interview me me Nancy Olden Think of that Mag I receive him all in my Charity rig and in Obermuller s office and he asks me silly questions and I tell him a lot of nonsense but some truths too about the Cruelty Fancy he didn t know what the Cruelty was S P C C he calls it And all the time we talked a long haired German artist he had brought with him was sketching Nance Olden in different poses Isn t that the limit What d ye think Tom Dorgan d say to see half a page of Nancy Olden in the X Ray Wouldn t his eyes pop Poor old Tom No danger they won t let him have the papers My old Tommy What is it Mag Oh what was I saying Yes yes how it looks Well it looks as though the Trust yes the big and mighty T T short for Theatrical Trust you innocent had heard of that same Nance Olden you read about in the papers For one night last week when I d just come of and the house was yelling and shouting behind me Obermuller meets me in the wings and trots me of to his private office What for I asked him on the way You ll find out in a minute Come on I pulled up my stocking and followed You know I wear it in that act without a garter and it s always coming down the way yours used to Mag Even when it doesn t come down I pull it up I m so in the habit of doing it A little bit of a man bald headed with a dyspeptic little black mustache turned down at the corners watched me come in He grinned at my make up and then at me Clever little girl he says through his nose How much do you stick Obermuller for Clever little man say I bold as brass and through my own nose none of your business Hi you Olden roared Obermuller as though I d run away and he was trying to get the bit from between my teeth Answer the gentleman prettily Don t you know a representative of the mighty T T when you see him Can t you see the Syndicate aureole about his noble brow This gentleman Nance is the great and only Max Tausig He humbleth the exalted and uplifteth the lowly or if there s more money in it he gives to him that hath and steals from him that hasn t but would mighty well like to have He has no conscience no bowels no heart But he has got tin and nerve and power to beat the band In short and for all practical purposes for one in your profession Nancy Olden he s just God Down on your knees and lick his boots Trust gods wear boots patent leathers and thank him for permitting it you lucky baggage I looked at the little man the angry red was just fading from the top of his cocoanut shaped bald head You always were a fool Obermuller he said cordially And you were always over fond of your low comedian jokes If you hadn t been so smart with your tongue you d had more friends and not so many enemies in In the heavenly Syndicate eh Well I have lived without You have lived but But where do I expect to go when I die Good theatrical managers Nance when they die as individuals go to Heaven they get into the Trust After that they just touch buttons the Trust does the rest Bad ones the kickers the Fred Obermullers go to a place where salaries cease from troubling and royalties are at rest It s a slow place where where in short there s nothing doing And only one thing s done the kicker It s that place mister Tausig thinks I m bound for And it s that place he s come to rescue you from from sheer goodness of heart and a wary eye for all there s in it Cinch him Olden for all the traffic will bear I looked from one to the other Obermuller big and savage underneath all his gay talk I knew him well enough to see that the little man his mouth turned down at the corners and a sneer in his eye for the fellow that wasn t clever enough to get in with the push You must not give the young woman the big head Obermuller Her own is big enough I ll bet as it is I ain t prepared to make any startling offer to a little girl that s just barely got her nose above the wall The slightest shake might knock her off altogether or she mightn t have strength enough in herself to hold on But we ll give her a chance And because of what it may lead to if she works hard because of the opportunities we can give her there ain t so much in it in a money way as you might imagine Obermuller didn t say anything His own lips and his own eyes sneered now and he winked openly at me which made the little man hot Blast it he twanged I mean it If you ve got any notion through my coming down to your dirty little joint that we ve set our hearts on having the girl just get busy thinking something else She may be worth something to you measured up against the dubs you ve got but to us To you it s not so much your not having her as my having her that Exactly It ain t our policy to leave any doubtful cards in the enemy s hands He can have the bad ones He couldn t get the good ones And the doubtful ones like this girl Olden Well that s just where you re mistaken Obermuller thrust his hands deep in his pockets and put out that square chin of his like the fighter he is This girl Olden is anything but doubtful She s a big card right now if she could be well handled And the time isn t so far off when if you get her you people will be Just how much is your interest in her worth the little man sneered Obermuller glared at him and in the pause I murmured demurely Only a six year contract Mag you should have seen em jump both of em the little man with vexation the big one with surprise A contract Me Nance Olden Why Mag you innocent of course I hadn t Managers don t give six year contracts to girl burglars who ve never set foot on the stage When the little man was gone Obermuller cornered me What s your game Olden he cried You re too deep for me I throw up my hands Come what ve you got in that smart little head of yours Are you holding out for higher stakes Do you expect him to buy that great six year contract and divvy the proceeds with me Because he will when once they get their eye on you they ll have you and to turn up your nose at their offer if in just the way to make them itch for you But how the deuce did you find it out And where do you get your nerve from anyway A little beggar like you to refuse an offer from the T T and sit hatching your schemes on your little old steen dollars a week It ll have to be twice steen now I suppose All right just as you say I laughed But why aren t you in the Trust Fred Obermuller Why aren t you in society Nance Um well because society s prejudiced against lifting but the Trust isn t Do you know that s a great graft mister Obermuller lifting wholesale Why don t you get in Because a Trust is a lot of sailors on a raft who keep their places by kicking off the drowning hands that clutch at it Can you fancy a fellow like Tausig stooping down to help me tenderly on board to divide the pickings No but I can fancy you grappling with him till he d be glad to take you on rather than be pulled off himself You d be in with the push would you Olden if you were managing he asked with a grin I d be at the top wherever that was Then why the deuce didn t you jump at Tausig s offer Were you really crafty enough I am artiste Monsieur Obermuller I gutturaled like Mademoiselle Picotte who dances on the wire I moost have about me those who arre who arre congeniale You monkey he laughed Then when Tausig comes to buy your contract We ll tell him to go to thunder He laughed Say Mag that big fellow is like a boy when he s pleased I guess that s what makes it such fun to please him And I who admired your business sagacity in holding off Nance he said I thought you admired my take off of Mademoiselle Picotte Well Well why don t you make use of it Take me round to the theaters and let me mimic all the swell actors and actresses I ve got more chance with you than with that Trust gang They wouldn t give me room to do my own stunt they d make me fit into theirs But you But me You think you can wind me round your finger Not yet He chuckled I thought I had him going I saw Nance Olden spending her evenings at the big Broadway theaters when just at that minute Ginger the call boy burst in with a note Say Mag I wouldn t like to get that man Obermuller hopping mad at me and Nancy Olden s no coward either But the way he gritted his teeth at that note and the devil in his eyes when he lifted them from it made me wonder how I d ever dared be facetious with him I got up to go He d forgotten me but he looked up then That was a great suggestion of yours Olden to put Lord Gray on to act himself great His voice shook he was so angry Well I snapped I wasn t going to let him see that a big man raging could bluff Nance Olden What did he mean Why just this there was Lord Harold Gray the real Lord behind the scenes bringing the Lady who was really only a chorus girl to the show in his automobile helping her dress like a maid holding her box of jewels as he tagged after her like a big Newfoundland smoking his one cigarette solemnly and admiringly while she was on the stage poking after her like a tame bear He s a funny fellow that Lord Harold He s a Tom Dorgan with the brains and the graft and and the brute too Mag washed out of him a Tom Dorgan that s been kept dressed in swagger clothes all his life and living at top notch a big clean handsome stupid good natured overgrown boy Yes I m coming to it When I d seen him go tagging after her chippy Ladyship behind the scenes long enough I told Obermuller one day that it was absurd to send the mock Lady out on the boards and keep the live Lord hidden behind He jumped at the idea and they rigged up a little act for the two the Lord and the Lady Gray was furious when she heard of it their making use of her Lord in such a way but Lord Harold just swallowed his big Adam s apple with a gulp or two and said Pon honor it s a blawsted scheme you know but I m jolly sure I d make a bleddy ass of myself I cawn t act you know The ninny You know he thinks Gray really can But Obermuller explained to him that he needn t act just be himself out behind the wings and lo Lord Harold was chawmed And Gray Why she gave in at last pretended to anyway sliding out of the Charity sketch and rehearsing the thing with him and all that And and do you know what she did Mag Nance Olden may be pretty mean but she wouldn t do a trick like that She waited till ten minutes before time for the thing to be put on and then threw a fit She s so ill her delicate Ladyship So ill she just can t go on this evening Wonder how long she thinks such an excuse will keep Lord Harold off when I want him on growled Obermuller throwing her note over to me He d have liked to throw it at me if it d been heavy enough to hurt he was so thumping mad You see there it was on the program THE CLEVER SKETCH ENTITLED THEATRICAL ARISTOCRACY The Duke of Portmanteau Lord Harold Gray The Duchess Lady Gray The celebrated Gray jewels including the great Rose Diamond will be worn by Lady Gray in this number No wonder Obermuller was raging I looked at him You don t like to tackle a fellow like that when he s dancing hot And yet you ache to help him and yes yourself Lord Harold s here yet and the jewels I asked He gave a short nod He was thinking But so was I Then all he wants is a Lady That s all he said sarcastically Well what s the matter with me He gasped There s nothing the matter with your nerve Olden Thank you so much It was the way Gray says it when she tries to have an English accent Dress me up Fred Obermuller in Gray s new silk gown and the Gray jewels and you d never I d never set eyes on you again You d never know if you were in the audience that it wasn t Gray herself I can take her off to the life and if the prompter ll stand by He looked at me for a full minute Try it Olden he said I did I flew to Gray s dressing room She d gone home deathly ill of course They gave me the best seamstress in the place She let out the waist a bit and pulled over the lace to cover it I got into that mass of silk and lace oh silk on silk and Nance Olden inside Beryl Blackburn did my hair and Grace Weston put on my slippers Topham himself hung me with those gorgeous shining diamonds and pearls and emeralds till I felt like an idol loaded with booty There were so many standing round me rigging me up that I didn t get a glimpse of the mirror till the second before Ginger called me But in that second in that second Mag Monahan I saw a fairy with blazing cheeks and shining eyes with a diamond coronet in her brown hair puffed high and pearls on her bare neck and arms and emeralds over the waist and rubies and pearls on her fingers and sprays of diamonds like frost on the lace of her skirt and diamond buckles on her very slippers and the rose diamond like a sun outshining all the rest and and Mag it was me How did it go Well wouldn t it make you think you were a Lady sure enough if you couldn t move without that lace train billowing after you without being dazzled with diamond shine without a truly Lord tagging after you He kept his head Lord Harold did even if it is a mutton head That helped me at first He was so cold so stupid so slow so good tempered so just himself And after the first plunge I tell you Mag Monahan there s one thing that s stronger than wine to a woman it s being beautiful Oh And I was beautiful I knew it before I got that quick hush with the full applause after it And because I was beautiful I got saucy and then calm and then I caught Fred Obermuller s voice he had taken the book from the prompter and stood there himself and after that it was easy sailing He was there yet when the act was over and I trailed out followed by my Lord He let the prompt book fall from his hands and reached them both out to me I flirted my jeweled fan at him and swept him a courtesy Cool No I wasn t Not a bit of it He was daffy with the sight of me in all that glory and I knew it Nance he whispered you wonderful girl if I didn t know about that little thief up at the Bronsonia I d I d marry you alive just for the fun of piling pretty things on you The deuce you would I sailed past him with Topham and my Lord in my wake They didn t leave me till they d stripped me clean I felt like a Christmas tree the day after But somehow I didn t care VIII Is that you Mag Well it s about time you came home to look after me Fine chaperon you make Miss Monahan Why didn t I tell you the very day we took this flat what a chaperon was and that you d have to be mine Imagine Nancy Olden without a chaperon Shocking No tisn t late Sit down Maggie there and let me get the stool and talk to you Think of us two Cruelty girls both of us two mangy kittens deserted by the old cats in a city s alleys and left mewing with cold and hunger and dirt out in the wet think of us two in our own flat Mag I say it makes me proud of us There are times when I look at every stick of furniture we own and I try to pretend to it all that I m used to a decent roof over my head and a dining room kitchen parlor bedroom and bath Oh and I forgot the telephone the other tenant left here till its lease is up But at other times I stand here in the middle of it and cry out to it in my heart Look at me Nancy Olden a householder a rent payer the head of the family even if it s only a family of two and the other one Mag Look at me with my name in the directory a paying milk bills and meat bills and bread bills Look at me with a place of my own where nobody s right s greater than my own where no one has a right but me and Mag a place where where there s nothing to hide from the police There s the rub Mag as Hamlet says I went to see it the other night so that I could take off the Ophelia she used to be a good mimic herself before she tried to be a leading lady It spoils you this sense of safeness that goes with the honesty graft You lose the quickness of the hunter and the nerve of the hunted And worse you lose your taste for the old risky life You grow proud and fat and you love every stick in the dear quiet little place that s your home your own home You love it so that you d be ashamed to sneak round where it could see you you who d always walked upright before it with the step of the mistress with nothing in the world to be ashamed of nothing to prevent your staring each honest dish pan in the face And Mag you try if you re me to fit Tom Dorgan in here Tom Dorgan in stripes and savage sulks still all these months kept away from the world even the world behind bars Maggie don t you wish Tom was a ventriloquist or or an acrobat or but this isn t what I had to tell you Do you know what a society entertainer is Miss Monahan No Well look at me Yes I m one Miss Nance Olden whose services are worth fifty dollars a night at least they were one night Ginger brought me the note that made me a society entertainer It was from a missus Paul B Gates who had been charmed by your clever impersonations Miss Olden and write to know if you have the leisure to entertain some friends at my house on Thursday of this week Had I the leisure well rather I showed the note to Gray just to make her jealous Oh yes she goes on all right in the act with Lord Harold every night Catch her letting me wear those things of hers twice Well she just turned up her nose Of course you won t accept she said Of course I will Oh I only thought you d feel as I should about appearing before a lot of snobs who ll treat you like a servant and Who ll do nothing of the sort and who ll pay you well for it put in Obermuller He had come up and was reading the note I had handed to him You just say yes Nance he went on after Gray had bounced of to her dressing room It isn t such a bad graft and and this is just between us two mind that little beggar Tausig has begun his tricks since you turned his offer down They can make things hot for me and if they do it won t be so bad for you to go in for this sort of thing unless you go over to the Trust I shook my head Well this thing will be an ad for you besides if the papers can be got to notice it They re coy with their notices confound them since Tausig let them know that big Trust ads don t appear in the same papers that boom anti Trust shows How long are you going to stand it mister O Just as long as I can t help myself not a minute longer There ought to be a way some way Yes there ought but there isn t They ve got things down to a fine point and the fellow they don t fear has got to fear them I ll put your number early to night so that you can get off by nine Good luck Nance At nine then behold Nancy Olden in her white muslin dress long sleeved and high necked and just to her shoe tops with a big white muslin sash around her waist Oh she s no baby is Nance but she looks like one in this rig with her short hair or rather like a school girl which makes the stunts she does in mimicking the corkers of the profession all the more surprising We re just a little party said missus Paul Gates coming into the bedroom where I was taking of my wraps And I m so glad you could come for my principal guest mister Latimer is an invalid who used to love the theaters but hasn t been to one since his attack many years ago I count on your giving him in a way a condensed history in action of what is going on on the stage I told her I would But I didn t just know what I was saying Think of Latimer there Maggie and think of our last meeting It made me tremble Not that I fancied for a moment he d betray me The man that helps you twice don t hurt you the third time No it wasn t that it was only that I longed to do well well before him so that And then I found myself in an alcove off the parlors separated from them by heavy curtains It was such a pretty little red bower Right behind me was the red of the Turkish drapery of a cozy corner and just as I took my place under the great chandelier the servants pulled the curtains apart and the lights went out in the parlors In that minute I got it Mag yes stage fright Got it bad I suppose it was coming to me but Lordy I hadn t ever known before what it was I could see the black of the men s clothes in the long parlors in front of me and the white of the women s necks and arms There were soft ends of talk trailing after the first silence and everything was so strange that I seemed to hear two men s voices which sounded familiar Latimer s silken voice and another a heavy coarse bass that was the last to be quieted I fancied that when that last voice should stop I could begin but all at once my mind seemed to turn a somersault and instead of looking out upon them I seemed to be looking in on myself to see a white faced little girl in a white dress standing alone under a blaze of light in a glare of red gazing fearfully at this queer new audience Fail Me Not Nancy Maggie I just took me by the shoulders Nancy Olden you little thief I cried to me inside of me How dare you I d rather you d steal the silver on this woman s dressing table than cheat her out of what she expects and what s coming to her Nance really didn t dare So she began The first one was bad I gave em Duse s Francesca You ve never heard the wailing music in that woman s voice when she says There is no escape Smaragdi You have said it The shadow is a glass to me and God Lets me be lost I gave them Duse just to show them how swell I was myself which shows what a ninny I was The thing the world loves is the opposite of what it is The pat pat pat of their gloves came in to me when I got through They were too polite to hiss But it wasn t necessary I was hissing myself Inside of me there was a long nasty hiss ss ss I couldn t bear it I couldn t bear to be a failure with Latimer listening though out there in that queer half light I couldn t see him at all but could only make out the couch where I knew he must be lying I just jumped into something else to retrieve myself I can do Carter s Du Barry to the Queen s taste Maggie That rotten voice of hers like Mother Douty s but stronger and surer that rocky old face pretending to look young and beautiful inside that talented red hair of hers that whining Denny Denny she squawks out every other minute Oh I can do Du Barry all right They thought I could too those black and white shadows out there on the other side of the velvet curtains But I cared less for what they thought than for the fact that I had drowned that sputtering hiss ss ss inside of me and that Latimer was among them I gave them Warfield then I was always good at taking off the sheenies in the alley behind the Cruelty remember I gave them that little pinch nosed Maude Adams and dry corking little missus Fiske and Henry Miller when he smooths down his white breeches lovingly and sings Sally in our Alley and strutting old Mansfield and Say isn t it funny Mag that I ve seen em all and know all they can do They ve been my college education that crowd Not a bad one either when you come to think of what I wanted from it They pulled the curtains down at the end and I went back to the bedroom I had my hat and jacket on when missus Gates and some of the younger ladies came to see me there but I caught no glimpse of Latimer You d think wouldn t you that he d have made an opportunity to say just one nice word to me in that easy soft voice of his I tried to believe that perhaps he hadn t really seen me lying down as he must have been or that he hadn t recognized me but I knew that I couldn t make myself believe that and the lack of just that word from him spoiled all my satisfaction with myself and I walked out with missus Gates through the hall and past the dining room feeling as hurt as though I d deserved that a man like Latimer should notice me The dining room was all lighted but empty the colored shaded candlesticks glowing down on the cut glass and silver on delicate china and flowers The ladies and gentlemen hadn t come out to supper yet at least only one was there He was standing with his back to me before the sideboard pouring out a glass of something from a decanter He turned at the rustle of my starched skirt and as I passed the door he saw me I saw him too and hurried away Yes I knew him Just you wait I got home here earlier than I d expected and I d just got off my hat and jacket and put away that snug little check when there came a ring at the bell I thought it was you Mag that you d forgotten your key I was so sure of it that I pulled the door open wide with a flourish and And admitted Edward Yes Edward husband of the Dowager The same red faced big necked old fellow husky voiced with whisky now just as he was before He must have been keeping it up steadily ever since the day out in the country when Tom lifted his watch It ll take more than one lost watch to cure Edward I followed you home Miss Murieson he said grabbing me by the hand and pushing the door closed behind him Or is it Miss Murieson Which is your stage name and which your real one And have you really learned to remember it For my part any old name will smell as sweet now that I m close to the rose I jerked my hand away from him I didn t ask you to call I said haughty as the Dowager herself was when first I saw her in her gorgeous parlor the Bishop s card in her hand No I noticed that he roared jovially You skinned out the front door the moment you saw me All that was left to me was to skin after Why Why He slapped his leg as though he d heard the best joke in the world To renew our acquaintance of course To ask you if you wouldn t like me to buy you a red coat and hat like the one you left behind you that day over in Philadelphia when you cut your visit so short To insist upon my privilege of relationship To call that wink you gave me in the hall that day you little devil Now don t look at me like that I say let s be friends won t you Not for a red coat trimmed with chinchilla I cried He got between me and the door Prices gone up he inquired pleasantly Who s bulling the stock Never you mind so long as his name isn t Ramsay But why shouldn t his name be Ramsay he cooed Just because it isn t I m expecting a friend Hadn t you better go home to missus Dowager Diamonds Bully Is that what you call her No I ll stay and meet your friend Better not Oh I m not afraid Does he know as much about you as I do More About your weakness for other girls coats Yes You do know it all don t you And yet you care for me Maggie Monahan I retreated before him into the dining room What in the world to do to get rid of him I think you d better go home mister Ramsay I said again decidedly If you don t I ll have to call the janitor to put you out Call sweetheart He ll put you out with me for I ll tell him a thing or two about you and we ll go and find a better place than this Stock can t be quoted so high after all if this is the best prospectus your friend can put up Why don t you call I looked at him I was thinking Well he demanded I ve changed my mind Oh Mag Mag did you ever see the man ugly as a cannibal he may be and old as the cannibal s great grandfather that couldn t be persuaded he was a lady killer 
1212_14653_000021_000000	train-clean-360	His manner changed 
none	none	altogether He plumped down on the lounge and patted the place beside him invitingly giving me a wink that was deadly But missus Dowager I exclaimed coquettishly Oh that s all right little one She hasn t even missed me yet When she s playing Bridge she forgets even to be jealous Playing Bridge I murmured sweetly way off in Philadelphia while you you naughty man Oh he loved that Not so naughty as as I d like to be he bellowed heavily witty And she isn t way off in Philadelphia either She s just round the corner at missus Gates and what s the matter Nothing nothing Did she recognize me Oh that s what scared you is it She didn t recognize you Neither did I till I got that second glimpse of you with your hat and jacket on But even if she had ho ho ho I say do you know you couldn t convince the Bishop and Henrietta if you d talk till doomsday that that red coat and hat we advertised weren t taken by a little girl that was daffy Fact I swear it They admit you took the coat you little witch but it was when you were out of your mind of course of course The very fact that she left the coat behind her and took nothing else from the house shows a mind diseased insisted Henrietta Of course of course And her coming for no reason at all to your house adds the Bishop Say what was the reason Maggie I ll tell you a hard thing it isn t when people think worse of you than you are but better that you feel most uncomfortable I got pale and sick inside of me at the thought of my poor little Bishop I loved him for believing me straight and I ve been dying of curiosity to know what was in your wise little head that day he went on Oh it was wise all right that wink you gave me was perfectly sane there was method in that madness of yours I will tell you mister Ramsay I said sweetly at supper Supper Yes the supper you re going to get for me His bellowing laughter filled the place Maggie our little flat and our few things don t go well with sounds like that Oh you re all alike you women he roared All right supper it is Where shall we go Rector s I pouted It s so much more cozy right here I said I ll telephone There s Brophy s just round the corner and they send in the loveliest things Oh they do Well tell em to begin sending I thought he d follow me out in the hall to the phone but he was having some trouble in pulling out his purse to count out his money I suppose I got Central and asked for the number Oh yes I knew it all right I had called up that same number once already to day Brophy s Why Maggie Monahan you ought to know there s no Brophy s At least none that I ever heard about With my hand over the mouthpiece so that nobody heard but Edward I ordered a supper fit for a king or a chorus girl What didn t I order Champagne broiled lobster crab meat stuffed pimentoes kirschkaffee everything I d ever heard Beryl Blackburn tell about Say say interrupted Edward coming out after me That s enough of that stuff Tell him to send in a Scotch and soda and what For at that moment the connection was made and I cut in sweetly with missus Edward Ramsay just a minute Mag you should have seen the man s face It was red it was white it was furious it was frightened I put my hand a moment over the mouthpiece and turned on him then I ve got her on the phone at missus Gates house Shall I tell your wife where you are Edward Just a moment missus Ramsay hold the wire some one wants to speak with you You little devil His voice was thick with rage Yes you called me that some time ago but not in that tone Quick now the door or Waiting missus Ramsay He moved toward the door How ll I know you won t tell her when I m gone he growled Merely by my saying that I won t I answered curtly You re in no position to dictate terms I am But I could without leaving the phone latch the chain on the door behind him leaving it half open So he must have heard the rest Yes missus Ramsay waiting I croaked like the driest kind of hello girl I was mistaken It was a message left to be delivered to you not some one wanting to speak with you Who am I Why this is Central Here is the message Will be with you in half an hour Signed Edward Yes that s right Thank you Good night I hung up gave the door a touch that shut it in his face and went back into the dining room to throw open the windows The place smelled of alcohol the moral atmosphere left behind by that bad old man sickened me I leaned out and looked at the stars and tried to think of something sweet and wholesome and strengthening Ah Nance I cried to myself with a sob I had pretended to take it lightly enough when he was here but now if you had heard of a girl who like yourself this evening unexpectedly met two men she had known and the good man ignored her and the bad one followed her oh Nancy what sort of girl would you think she was at heart What sort of hope could you imagine her treasuring for her own future And what sort of significance would you attach to And just then the bell rang again This time I was sure it was you And O Maggie I ran to the door eager for the touch of your hand and the look in your eyes I was afraid to be alone with my own thoughts I was afraid of the conclusion to which they were leading me Maggie if ever a girl needed comfort and encouragement and heartening I did then And I got it dear For there was a man at the door with a great basket of azaleas pale pink earth stars they are the sweet innocent things and a letter for me Here it is Let me read it to you My dear Miss Omar Once on a time there was a Luckless Pot marred in the making that had the luck to be of service to a Pipkin It was a saucy Pipkin though a very winning one and it had all the health and strength the poor Pot lacked physically Morally morally that young Pipkin was in a most unwholesome condition Already its fair smooth surface was scratched and fouled It was unmindful of the treasure of good it contained and its responsibility to keep that good intact And it seemed destined to crash itself to pieces among pots of baser metal What the Luckless Pot did was little being ignorant of the art by which diamonds may be attained easily and honestly but it gave the little Pipkin a chance What the Pipkin did with that chance the Pot learned to night with such pleasure and satisfaction as made it impossible for him not to share it with her So while he sent Burnett out to the conservatory to cut azaleas he wrote her a note to try to convey to her what he felt when in that nicely polished neatly decorated and self respecting Vessel on exhibition in missus Gates red room he recognized the poor little Pipkin of other days The Pot as you know was a sort of stranded bit of clay that had never filled the use for which pots are created He had little human to interest him The fate of the Pipkin therefore he had often pondered on and in spite of improbabilities had had faith in a certain quality of brave sincerity the little thing showed a quality that shone through acquired faults like a star in a murky sky This justification of his faith in the Pipkin may seem a small matter to make so much of And yet the Pot that sleeps not well o nights as is the case with damaged pots will take to bed with him to night a pretty pleasant thought due just to this But do not think the Pot an idealist If he were he might have been tempted to mistake the Pipkin for a statelier more pretentious Vessel a Vase say all graceful curves and embossed sides but shallow perhaps possibly lacking breadth No the Pipkin is a pipkin made of common clay even though it has the uncommon sweetness and strength to overcome the tendencies of clay and fashioned for those common uses of life deprivation of which to anything that comes from the Potter s hands is the most enduring the most uncommon sorrow O pretty little Pipkin thank the Potter who made you as you are as you will be a thing that can cheer and stay men s souls by ministering to the human needs of them For you be sure the Potter s a good fellow and twill all be well For the Pot he sails shortly or rather he is to be carted abroad by some optimistic friends whose hopes he does not share to a celebrated repair shop for damaged pots Whether he shall return patched and mended into temporary semblance of a useful Vessel whether he shall continue to be merely the same old Luckless Pot or whether he shall return at all O Pipkin does not matter much But it has been well that before we two behind the veil had passed we met again and you left me such a fragrant memory LATIMER O Maggie Maggie some day I hope to see that man and tell him how sorely the Pipkin needed the Pot s letter IX It s all come so quick Maggie and it was over so soon that I hardly remember the beginning Nobody on earth could have expected it less than I when I came off in the afternoon I don t know what I was thinking of as I came into my dressing room that used to be Gray s the sight of him seemed to cut me off from myself as with a knife but it wasn t of him It may have been that I was chuckling to myself at the thought of Nancy Olden with a dressing room all to herself I can t ever quite get used to that you know though I sail around there with all the airs of the leading lady Sometimes I see a twinkle in Fred Obermuller s eye when I catch him watching me and goodness knows he s been glum enough of late but it wasn t Yes I m going to tell you but it s rattled me a bit Maggie I m so so sorry and a little oh just a little little bit glad I d slammed the door behind me the old place is out of repair and the door won t shut except with a bang and I had just squatted down on the floor to unbutton my high shoes when I noticed the chintz curtains in front of the high dressing box waver They must have moved just like that when I was behind them months it seems years ago But you see Topham had never served an apprenticeship behind curtains so he didn t suspect Lordy Nancy I laughed to myself some one thinks you ve got a rose diamond and And at that moment he parted the curtains and came out Yes Tom Tom Dorgan My heart came beating up to my throat and then just as I thought I should choke it slid down to my boots sickening me I didn t say a word I sat there my foot in my lap staring at him Oh Maggie girl it isn t good to get your first glimpse after all these months of the man you love crouched like a big bull in a small space poking his close cropped black head out like a turtle that s not sure something won t be thrown at it and then dragging his big bulk out and standing over you He used to be trim Tom and taut but in those shapeless things the old trousers the dirty white shirt and the vest too big for him Well he said why don t you say something Tom s voice Mag do you remember the merry Irish boy s voice with its chuckles like a brook gurgling as it runs No tisn t the same voice It s it s changed Maggie It s heavy and and coarse and brutal That s what it is It sounds like like the knout like Nance what in hell s I think I m frightened Tom Oh the ladyfied airs of her Ain t you going to faint Miss Olden I got up No no Sit down Tom Tell me about it How how did you get here He went to the door opened it a bit and looked out cautiously Mag Mag it hurt me that Why do you suppose You re sure nobody ll come in he asked I turned the key in the lock forgetting that it didn t really lock Oh yes I m sure I said Why Why You have got slow Just because I didn t say good by to them fellows up at the Pen and Oh You ve escaped That s what First jail break in fifteen years What d ye think of your Tommy old girl eh Ain t he the gamest Ain t you proud of him My God Mag Proud of him He didn t know he couldn t see himself He shut in like a wild beast couldn t see what this year has done for him Oh the change the change in him My boy Tommy with the gay gallus manner and the pretty jolly brogue and the laughing mouth under his brown mustache And this man his face is old Mag old oh and hard and and tough cheap and tough There s something in his eyes now and about his shaven mouth oh Maggie Maggie Look here Nance He caught me by the shoulders knocking up my chin so that he could look down squarely at me What s your graft What s it to be between us What ve ye been doing all this time Out with it I want to know I shook myself free and faced him I ve been Tom Dorgan I ve been to hear the greatest actors and actresses in the world say and do the finest things in the world I ve watched princesses and kings even if they re only stage ones I ve read a new book every night a great picture book in which the pictures move and speak that s the stage Tom Dorgan Much of it wasn t true but a girl who s been brought up by the Cruelty doesn t have to be told what s true and what s false I ve met these people and lived with them as one does who thinks the same thoughts and feels what others feel I know the world now Tom Dorgan the real world of men and women not the little world of crooks nor yet the littler one of fairy stories I ve got a glimpse too of that other world where all the scheming and lying and cheating is changed as if by magic into something that deceives all right but doesn t hurt It s the world of art and artists Tom Dorgan where people paint their lies or write them or act them where they lift money all right from men s pockets but lift their souls and their lives too away from the things that trouble and bore and and degrade You needn t sneer it s made a different Nance out of me Tom Dorgan And oh but I m sorry for the pert little beggar we both knew that lied and stole and hid and ran and skulked She was like a poor little ignorant traveler in a great country where she d sized up the world from the few fool crooks she was thrown in with She Aw cut it Tom does doesn t it mean anything to you Can t it mean lots to both of us now that Cut it I tell you Think I killed one guard and beat the other till I d broke every bone in his body to come here and listen to such guff You ve been having a high old time eh and you never give a thought to me up there I might a rotted in that black hole for all you d care you Don t I did Tom I did I was shivering at the name but I couldn t bear his thinking that way of me I went up once but they wouldn t let me see you I wrote you but they sent back the letters Mag went up too but had to come back And that time I brought you My voice trailed off In that minute I saw myself on the way up to Sing Sing with the basket and all my hopes and all my schemes for amusing him And this is what I d have seen if they d let me in this big gruff murdering beast Oh yes yes beast is what he is and it didn t make him look it less that he believed me and and began to think of me in a different way I thought you wouldn t go back on a feller Nance That s why I come straight to you It was my game to have you hide me for a day or two till you could make a strike somewhere and we d light out together How re ye fixed Pretty smart eh You look it my girl you look My eye Nance you look good enough to eat and I m hungry for you Maggie if I d had to die for it I couldn t have moved then You d think a man would know when the woman he s holding in his arms is fainting sick at the touch of him A woman would It wasn t my Tom that I d known that I d worked with and played with and It was a great brute whose mouth who had no eyes no ears no senses but ah He laughed when I broke away from him at last He laughed And I knew then I d have to tell him straight in words Tom I gasped you can have all I ve got and it s plenty to get you out of the way But but you can t have me any more That s done Oh the beast in his face It must have looked like that when the guard got his last glimpse of it You re kiddin me he growled I shook my head Then he ripped it out Said the worst he could and ended with a curse The blood boiled in me The old Nance never stood that she used to sneer at other women who did Get out of here I cried Go go Tom Dorgan I ll send every cent I ve got to you to Mother Douty s within two hours but don t you dare Don t YOU dare you she devil Just make up your mind to drop these newfangled airs and mighty quick I tell you you ll come with me cause I need you and I want you and I want you now And I ll keep you when once I get you again We ll hang together No more o this one sided lay out for me where you get all the soft and it s me for the hard You belong to me Yes you do Just think back a bit Nance Olden and remember the kind of customer I am If you ve forgot just let me remind you that what I know would put you behind bars my lady and it shall I swear if I ve got to go to the Chair for it Tom It was Tom talking that way to me I couldn t bear it I made a rush for the door He got there too and catching me by the shoulder he lifted his fist But it never fell Mag I think I could kill a man who struck me But just as I shut my eyes and shivered away from him while I waited for the blow a knock came at the door and Fred Obermuller walked in Eh Oh Excuse me I didn t know there was anybody else Nance your face is ghastly What s up he said sharply He looked from me to Tom Tom standing off there ready to spring on him to dart past him to fly out of the window ready for anything only waiting to know what the thing was to be My senses came back to me then The sight of Obermuller with those keen quick eyes behind his glasses his strong square chin and the whole poise of his head and body that makes men wait to hear what he has to say the knowledge that that man was my friend mine Nancy Olden s lifted me out of the mud I d sunk back in and put my feet again on a level with his Tom I said slowly mister Obermuller is a friend of mine No listen What we ve been talking about is settled Don t bring it up again It doesn t interest him and it can t change me I swear to you it can t nothing can I m going to ask mister Obermuller to help you without telling him just what the scrape is and and I m going to be sure that he ll do it just because he Because you ve taken up with him have you Tom shouted savagely Because she s your Tom I cried Tom oh yes now I remember Obermuller got between us as he spoke Your friend up in the country that you went to see and couldn t Not a very good looker your friend Nance But farming I suppose mister Tom plays the deuce with one s looks And another thing it does it makes a man forget sometimes just how to behave in town I ll be charmed mister Tom to oblige a friend of Miss Olden s but I must insist that he does not talk like a farmer He was quite close to Tom when he finished and Tom was glaring up at him And Mag I didn t know which one I was most afraid for Don t you look at me that way Mag Monahan and don t you dare to guess anything If you think growled Tom that I m going to let you get off with the girl you re mighty Now I ve told you not to say that The reason I ll do the thing she s going to ask of me if it s what I think it is is because this girl s a plucky little creature with a soul big enough to lift her out of the muck you probably helped her into It s because she s got brains talent and a heart It s because well it s because I feel like it and she deserves a friend You don t know what she is It was a snarl from Tom You don t Oh yes I do you cur I know what she was too And I even know what she will be but that doesn t concern you The hell it don t Obermuller turned his back on him I was dumb and still Tom Dorgan had struck me after all What is it you want me to do Nance Obermuller asked Get him away on a steamer quick I murmured I couldn t look him in the face without asking why or what his name is He turned to Tom Well I won t go not without her Because you re so fond of her eh So fond your first thought on quitting the country was to come here to get her in trouble If you ve been traced Ah You wouldn t like that eh sneered Tom Would you Well I ve had my share of it And she ain t Still I Just what would it be worth to you to have me out of the way Oh Tom Tom I cried But Obermuller got in front of me It would be worth exactly one dollar and seventy five cents I think it will amount to about that for cab hire I guess the cars aren t any too safe for you or it might be less It may amount to something more before I get you shipped before the mast on the first foreign bound boat But what s more important he added bringing his fist down with a mighty thump on the table you have just ten seconds to make up your mind At the end of that time I ll ring for the police I went down to the boat to see it sail Mag at seven this morning No not to say good by to him He didn t know I was there It was to say good by to my old Tommy the one I loved Truly I did love him Mag though he never cared for me No he didn t Men don t pull down the women they love I know that now If Tom Dorgan had ever cared for me he wouldn t have made a thief of me If he d cared the last place on earth he d have come to when he knew the detectives would be on his track would have been just the first place he made for If he d cared he But it s done Mag It s all over Cheap that s what he is this Tom Dorgan Cheaply bad a cheap bully cheap brained Remember my wishing he d have been a ventriloquist Why that man that tried to sell me to Obermuller hasn t sense enough to be a good scene shifter Oh The firm of Dorgan Olden is dissolved Mag The retiring partner has gone into the theatrical business As for Dorgan the real one poor fellow jolly handsome big Tom Dorgan he died Yes he died Maggie and was buried up there in the prison graveyard A hard lot for a boy but it s not the worst thing that can happen to him He might become a man such a man as that fellow that sailed away before the mast this morning X There I was seated in a box all alone Miss Nancy Olden by courtesy of the management come to listen to the leading lady sing coon songs that I might add her to my collection of take offs She s a fat leading lady very fair and nearly fifty I guess But she s got a rollicking husky voice in her fat throat that s sung the dollars down deep into her pockets They say she s planted them deeper still in the foundations of apartment houses and that now she s the richest roly poly on the Rialto Do you know Maggie darlin what I was saying to myself there in the box while I watched the stage and waited for Obermuller He said he d drop in later perhaps Nance I said I kind of fancy that apartment sort of idea myself They tell you Nancy that when you ve got the artistic temperament that that s all you ll ever have But there s a chance one in a hundred for a body to get that temperament mixed with a business instinct It doesn t often happen But when it does the result is dollars It may be Nance I shrewdly suspect it is a fact that you ve got that marvelous mixture Your early successes Miss Olden in another profession that I needn t name would encourage the idea that you re not all heart and no head I think Nance I shall have you mimic the artists during working hours and the business men when you re at play I fancy apartment houses They appeal to me We ll call one The Nancy and another Olden Hall and another What ll I call the third apartment house mister O I asked aloud as I heard the rings on the portiere behind me click He didn t answer Without turning my head I repeated the question And yet suddenly before he could have answered I knew something was wrong I turned And in that moment a man took the seat beside me and another stood facing me with his back against the portieres Miss Olden the man beside me asked Yes Nance Olden the mimic who entertains at private houses I nodded You you were at missus Paul Gates just a week ago and you gave your specialties there Yes yes what is it you want He was a little man but very muscular I could note the play of his muscles even in the slight motion he made as he turned his body so as to get between me and the audience while he leaned toward me watching me intently with his small quick blue eyes We don t want to make any scene here he said very low We want to do it up as quietly as we can There might be some mistake you know and then you d be sorry So should we I hope you ll be reasonable and it ll be all the better for you because What are you talk what I looked from him to the other fellow behind us He leaned a bit farther forward then and pulling his coat partly open he showed me a detective s badge And the other man quickly did the same I sat back in my chair The fat star on the stage with her big mouth and big baby face was doing a cake walk up and down close to the footlights yelling the chorus of her song I ll never mimic that song Mag although I can see her and hear it as plain as though I d listened and watched her all my life But there s no fun in it for me I hate the very bars the orchestra plays before she begins to sing I can t bear even to think of the words The whole of it is full of horrible things it smells of the jail it looks like stripes it You re not going to faint asked the man moving closer to me Me I never fainted in my life Where is he now Tom Dorgan Tom Dorgan Yes I was sure I saw him sail but of course I was mistaken He has sent you after me has he I can hardly believe it of Tom even even yet I don t know anything that connects you with Dorgan If he was in with you on this you d better remember before you say anything more that it ll all be used against you The curtain had gone down and gone up again I was watching the star She has such a boyish way of nodding her head instead of bowing after she waddles out to the center and every time she wipes her lips with her lace handkerchief as though she d just taken one of the cocktails she makes in the play with all the skill of a bartender I found myself doing the same thing wiping my lips with that very same gesture as though I had a fat bare forearm like a rolling pin when all at once the thought came to me You needn t bother Nancy It s all up You won t have any use for it all Just what is the charge I asked turning to the man beside me Stealing a purse containing three hundred dollars from missus Paul Gates house on the night of April twenty seventh What It was Obermuller He had pushed the curtains aside the crashing of the orchestra had prevented our hearing the clatter of the rings He had pushed by the man standing there had come in and he had heard Nance he cried I don t believe a word of it He turned in his quick way to the men What are your orders To take her to her flat and search it Obermuller came over to me then and took my hand for a minute It s a pity they don t know about the Gray rose diamond he whispered helping me on with my jacket They d see how silly this little three hundred dollar business is Brace up Nance Olden Oh Mag Mag to hear a man like that talk to you as though you were his kind when you have the feel of the coarse prison stripes between your dry shaking fingers and the close prison smell is already poisoning your nostrils I don t see my voice shook how you can believe in me Don t you he laughed That s easy You ve got brains Nance and the most imbecile thing you could do just now when your foot is already on the ladder would be just this to get off in order to pick up a trinket out of the mud when there s a fortune up at the top waiting for you Clever people don t do asinine things And other clever people know that they don t You re clever but so am I in my weak small way Come along little girl He pulled my hand in his arm and we walked out followed by the two men Oh no It was all very quiet and looked just like a little theater party that had an early supper engagement Obermuller nodded to the manager out in the deserted lobby who stopped us and asked me what I thought of the star You ll think me mad Mag Those fellows with the badges were sure I was but Obermuller s eyes only twinkled and the manager s grin grew broad when catching up the end of my skirt and cake walking up and down I sang under my breath that coon song that was trailing over and over through my head Bravo bravo whispered the manager hoarsely clapping his hands softly I gave one of those quick funny boyish nods the star inside affects and wiped my lips with my handkerchief That brought down my house Even the biggest fellow with the badge giggled recognizingly and then put his hand quickly in front of his mouth and tried to look severe and official The color had come back to Obermuller s face it was worth dancing for that Be patient Mag let me tell it my way There wasn t room in the coupe waiting out in front for more than two So Obermuller couldn t come in it But he put me in Mag dear dear Mag he put me in as if I was a lady not like Gray a real one A thing like that counts when two detectives are watching It counted afterward in the way they treated me The big man climbed up on the seat with the driver The blue eyed fellow got in and sat beside me closing the door I ll be out there almost as soon as you are Obermuller said standing a moment beside the lowered window You good fellow I said and then trying to laugh I ll do as much for you some day He shook his fist laughingly at me and I waved my hand as we drove of You know Miss there may be some mistake about this said the man next to me and Yes there may be In fact there is I m sure I ll be very glad if it is a mistake They do happen though not often You spoke of Dorgan Did I Yes Tom Dorgan who busted out of Sing Sing the other day Surely you re mistaken I said smiling right into his blue eyes The Tom Dorgan I mentioned is a sleight of hand performer at the Vaudeville Ever see him N no Clever fellow You ought to Perhaps you don t recognize him under that name On the bills he s Professor Haughwout Stage people have so many names you know Yes so have some other people I laughed and he grinned back at me Now that s mean of you I said I never had but one It was all I needed It flashed through me then what a thing like this might do to a name You know Mag every bit of recognition an actress steals from the world is so much capital It isn t like the old graft when you had to begin new every time you took up a piece of work And your name the name the world knows and its knowing it makes it worth having like everything that name is the sum of every scheme you ve planned of every time you ve got away with the goods of every laugh you ve lifted of every bit of cleverness you ve thought out and embodied of everything that s in you of everything you are But I didn t dare think long of this I turned to him Tell me about this charge I said Where was the purse Whose was it And why haven t they missed it till after a week They missed it all right that night but missus Gates wanted it kept quiet till the servants had been shadowed and it was positively proved that they hadn t got away with it And then she thought of me And then she thought of you I wonder why Because you were the only person in that room except missus Gates the lady who lost the purse missus Ramsay and eh N nothing missus Ramsay you said Yes Not missus Edward Ramsay of Philadelphia Oh you know the name Oh yes I know it It was printed you know in gold lettering on the inside flap and I don t know Well it was and it contained three hundred dollars missus Ramsay says She had slipped it under the fold of the spread at the top of the bed in the room where you took off your things in missus Gates presence and put them on again when no one else was there And you mean to tell me that this is all I raged at him that every bit of evidence you have to warrant your treating an innocent girl like You didn t behave like a very innocent girl if you ll remember he said dryly when I first came into the box In fact if that fellow hadn t just come in then I believe you d a confessed the whole job Tain t too late he added I didn t answer I put my head back against the cushions and closed my eyes I could feel the scrutiny of his blue eyes on my naked face your face is so unprotected with the eyes closed like a fort whose battery is withdrawn But I was tired it tires you when you care A year ago Mag this sort of thing the 
1212_14653_000044_000000	train-clean-360	risk 
none	none	the nearness to danger the chances one way or the other would have intoxicated me I used to feel as though I was dancing on a volcano and daring it to explode The more twistings and turnings there were to the labyrinth the greater glory it was to get out Maggie darlin you have before you a mournful spectacle the degeneration of Nancy Olden It isn t that she s lost courage It s only that she used to be able to think of only one thing and now What do you suppose it is Mag If you know don t you dare to tell me When we got to the flat Obermuller was already there At the door I pulled out my key and opened it with a flourish Won t you come in gentlemen and spend the evening I asked They followed me in First to the parlor The two fellows threw off their coats and searched that through and through not a drawer did they miss not a bit of furniture did they fail to move Obermuller and I sat there guying them as they pried about in their shirt sleeves That Trust business has taken the life out of him of late All their tricks all their squeezings their cheatings their bossing and bragging and bullying have got on to his nerves till he looks like a chained bear getting a drubbing And he swears that they re in a conspiracy to freeze him and a few others like him out he believes there s actually a paper in existence that would prove it But this affair of the purse seemed to excite him till he behaved like a bad school boy And I Well Nance Olden was never far behind at the Cruelty when there was anything going on We trailed after them and when they d finished with the bedrooms yours and mine I asked the big fellow to come into the kitchen with mister O and me while the blue eyed detective tackled the dining room and I d get up a lunch for us all Mag you should have seen Fred Obermuller with a big apron on him dressing the salad while I was making sandwiches The Cruelty taught me how to cook even if it did teach me other things You wouldn t have believed that the Trust had got him by the throat and was choking the last breath out of him You wouldn t have believed that our salaries hadn t been paid for three weeks that our houses were dwindling every night that I was thinking about it all there in the back of my head trying to see a way out of it you know if there is such an agreement as Obermuller swears there is it s against the law while we rattled on the two of us like a couple of children on a picnic when I heard a crash behind me The salad bowl had slipped from Obermuller s fingers He stood with his back turned to me his eyes fixed upon that searching detective But he wasn t searching any more Mag He was standing still as a pointer that s scented game He had moved the lounge out from the wall and there on the floor spread open where it had fallen lay a handsome elephant skin purse with gold corners From where I stood Mag I could read the plain gold lettering on the dark leather I didn t have to move It was plain enough quite plain missus EDWARD RAMSAY Hush hush Mag if you take on so how can I tell you the rest Obermuller got in front of me as I started to walk into the dining room I don t know what his idea was I don t suppose he does exactly if it wasn t to spare me the sight of that damned thing Oh how I hated it that purse I hated it as if it had been something alive that could be glad of what it had done I wished it was alive that I could tear and rend it and stamp on it and throw it in a fire and drag it out again with burned and bleeding nails to tear it again and again I wanted to fall on it and hide it to push it far far away out of sight to stamp it down down into the very bottom of the earth where it could feel the hell it was making for me But I only stood there stupidly looking at it having pushed past Obermuller as though I never wanted to see anything else And then I heard that blue eyed fellow s words Well he said pulling on his coat as though he d done a good day s work I guess you d just better come along with me XI Don t you think you d better get out of this I asked Obermuller as he came into the station a few minutes after I got there No I do Because Because it won t do you any good to have your name mixed up with a thing like this But it might do you some good I didn t answer for a minute after that I sat in my chair my eyes bent on the floor I counted the cracks between the chair and the floor of the office where the Chief was busy with another case I counted them six times back and forth till my eyes were clear and my voice was steady You re awfully good I said looking up at him as he stood by me You re the best fellow I ever knew I didn t know men could be so good to women But you d better go please It ll be bad enough when the papers get hold of this without having them lump you in with a bad lot like me He put his hand on my shoulder and gave it a quick little shake Don t say that about yourself You re not a bad lot But you saw the purse Yes I saw it But it hasn t proved anything to me but this you re innocent Nance or you re crazy If it s the first I want to stand by you little girl If it s the second good God I ve got to stand by you harder than ever Can you see me sitting there Mag in the bright bare little room with its electric lights still in my white dress and big white hat my pretty jacket fallen on the floor beside me I could feel the sharp blue eyes of that detective Morris feeding on my miserable face But I could feel too a warmth like wine poured into me from that big fellow s voice I put my hand up to him and he took it If I m innocent and can prove it Fred Obermuller I ll get even with you for for this Do you want to do something for me now Do I Well if you want to help me don t sit there looking like the criminal ghost of the girl I know The blood rushed to my face Nance Olden a sniveling coward Me showing the white feather me whimpering like a whipped puppy me Nance Olden You know I smiled up at him I never did enjoy getting caught Hush But that s better Tell me now A buzzer sounded The blue eyed detective got up and came over to me Chief s ready he said This way They stopped Obermuller at the door But he pushed past them I want to say just a word to you Chief he said You remember me I m Obermuller of the Vaudeville If you ll send those fellows out and let me speak to you just a moment I ll leave you alone with Miss Olden The Chief nodded to the blue eyed detective and he and the other fellow went out and shut the door behind them I want simply to call your attention to the absurdity and unreasonableness of this thing Obermuller said leaning up against the Chief s desk while he threw out his left hand with that big open gesture of his and to ask you to bear in mind no matter what appearances may be that Miss Olden is the most talented girl on the stage to day that in a very short time she will be at the top that just now she is not suffering for lack of money that she s not a high roller but a determined hard working little grind and that if she did feel like taking a plunge she knows that she could get all she wants from me even Even if you can t pay salaries when they re due Obermuller The Chief grinned under his white mustache Even though the Trust is pushing me to the wall going to such lengths that they re liable criminally as well as civilly if I could only get my hands on proof of their rascality It s true I can t pay salaries always when they re due but I can still raise a few hundred to help a friend And Miss Olden is a friend of mine If you can prove that she took this money you prove only that she s gone mad but you don t All right Obermuller You re not the lawyer for the defense That ll come later if it does come I ll be glad to bear in mind all you ve said and much that you haven t Thank you Good night I ll wait for you Nance outside I m going to ask you a lot of questions Miss Olden the old Chief said when we were alone Sit here please Morris tells me you ve got more nerve than any woman that s ever come before me so I needn t bother to reassure you You don t look like a girl that s easily frightened I have heard how you danced in the lobby of the Manhattan how you guyed him at your flat and were getting lunch and having a regular picnic of a time when When he found that purse Exactly Now why did you do all that Why Because I felt like it I felt gay and excited and Not dreaming that that purse was sure to be found Not dreaming that there was such a purse in existence except from the detective s say so and never fancying for an instant that it would be found in my flat Hm He looked at me from under his heavy wrinkled old lids You don t get nice eyes from looking on the nasty things in this world Mag Why I cried what kind of a girl could cut up like that when she was on the very edge of discovery A very smart girl an actress a good one a clever thief who s used to bluffing Of course he added softly you won t misunderstand me I m simply suggesting the different kinds of girl that could have done what you did But if you don t mind I ll do the questioning Nance Olden he turned suddenly on me his manner changed and threatening what has become of that three hundred dollars mister Chief you know just as much about that as I do I threw up my head and looked him full in the face It was over now all the shivering and trembling and fearing Nance Olden s not a coward when she s fighting for her freedom and fighting alone without any sympathizing friend to weaken her He returned the look with interest I may know more he said insinuatingly Possibly I shrugged my shoulders No it wasn t put on There never yet was a man who bullied me that didn t rouse the fighter in me I swore to myself that this old thief catcher shouldn t rattle me Doesn t it occur to you that under the circumstances a full confession might be the very best thing for you I shouldn t wonder if these people would be inclined to be lenient with you if you d return the money Doesn t it occur It might occur to me if I had anything to confess about this purse How long since you ve seen missus Edward Ramsay He rushed the question at me I jumped How do you know I ve ever seen her I do know you have I don t believe you Thank you neither do I believe you which is more to the point Come answer the question how long is it since you have seen the lady I looked at him And then I looked at my glove and slowly pulled the fingers inside out and then then I giggled Suddenly it came to me that silly little insane dodge of mine in the Bishop s carriage that day the girl who had lost her name and the use all that affair might be to me if ever I ll tell you if you ll let me think a minute I said sweetly It it must be all of fifteen months Ah You see I did know that you ve met the lady If you re wise you ll draw deductions as to other things I know that you don t think I do And where did you see her In her own home Called there he sneered alone No I said very gently I went there to the best of my recollection with the Bishop yes it was the Bishop Bishop Van Wagenen Indeed I could see that he didn t believe a word I was saying which made me happily eager to tell him more Yes we drove up to the Square one afternoon in the Bishop s carriage the fat plum colored one you know We had tea there at least I did I was to have spent the night but That s enough of that I chuckled Yes Mag Monahan I was enjoying myself I was having a run for my money even if it was the last run I was to have So it s fifteen months since you ve seen missus Ramsay eh Yes He turned on me with a roar And yet it s only a week since you saw her at missus Gates Oh no No Take care That night at missus Gates it was dark you know in the front room I didn t see missus Ramsay that night I didn t know she was there at all till Till Till later I was told Who told you Her husband He threw down his pencil Look here this is no lark young woman and you needn t trouble yourself to weave any more fairy tales mister Ramsay is in a he s very ill His own wife hasn t seen him since that night so you see you re lying uselessly Really So Edward didn t go back to missus Gates that night Tut tut After his telephone message too Now assuming your innocence of the theft Miss Olden what is your theory how do you account for the presence of that purse in your flat Now you ve hit the part of it that really puzzles me How do you account for it what is your theory He got to his feet pushing his chair back sharply My theory if you want to know it is that you stole the purse that your friend Obermuller believes you did that you got away with the three hundred or hid it away and And what a stupid thief I must be then to leave the empty purse under my lounge How do you know it was empty he demanded sharply You said so Well you gave me to understand that it was then What difference does it make It would be a still stupider thief who d leave a full purse instead of an empty one under his own lounge Yes and you re not stupid Miss Olden Thank you I m sorry I can t say as much for you I couldn t help it He was such a stupid The idea of telling me that Fred Obermuller believed me guilty The idea of thinking me such a fool as to believe that Such men as that make criminals They re so fat witted you positively ache they so tempt you to pull the wool over their eyes O Mag if the Lord had only made men cleverer there d be fewer Nancy Oldens The Chief blew a blast at his speaking tube that made his purple cheeks seem about to burst My shoulders shook as I watched him he was so wrathy And I was still laughing when I followed the detective out into the waiting room where Obermuller was pacing the floor At the sight of my smiling face he came rushing to me Nance he cried Orders are Morris came in a bellow from the Chief at his door that no further communication be allowed between the prisoner and Phew All the pertness leaked out of me Oh Mag I don t like that word It stings it binds it cuts I don t know what I looked like then I wasn t thinking of me I was watching Obermuller s face It seemed to grow old and thin and haggard before my eyes as the blood drained out of it He turned with an exclamation to the Chief and And just then there came a long ring at the telephone Why did I stand there O Mag when you re on your way to the place I was bound for when you know that before you ll set foot in this same bright little room again the hounds in half a dozen cities will have scratched clean every hiding place you ve had when your every act will be known and and oh then you wait Mag you wait for anything anything in the world even a telephone call that may only be bringing in another wretch like yourself bound like yourself for the Tombs The Chief himself went to answer it Yes what he growled Well tell Long Distance to get busy What s that saint Francis that s the jag ward isn t it Who is it Who Ramsay I caught Obermuller s hand I don t hear you the Chief roared Oh yes Yes we ve got the thief but the money no we haven t got the money The deuce you say Took it yourself Out of your wife s purse yes Yes But we ve got the What Don t remember where you Steady Nance whispered Obermuller grabbing my other hand I tried to stand steady but everything swayed and I couldn t hear the rest of what the Chief was saying though all my life seemed condensed into a listening But I did hear when he jammed the receiver on the hook and faced us Well they ve got the money Ramsay took the purse himself thinking it wasn t safe there under the spread where any servant might be tempted who chanced to uncover it You ll admit the thing looked shady The reason missus Ramsay didn t know of it is because the old man s just come to his senses in a hospital and been notified that the purse was missing I want to apologize to you Chief I mumbled For thinking me stupid Oh we were both No for thinking me not stupid I am stupid stupid stupid The old fellow I told you about mister O and the way I telephoned him out of the flat that night it was Ramsay I nodded and then crumbled to the floor It was then that they sent for you Mag Why didn t I tell it straight at the first you dear old Mag Because I didn t know the straight of it then myself I was so heavy witted I never once thought of Edward He must have taken the bills out of the purse and then crammed them in his pocket while he was waiting there on the lounge and I was pretending to telephone and But it s best as it is oh so best Think Mag Two people who knew her who knew her mind believed in Nancy Olden in spite of appearances Obermuller while we were in the thick of it and you you dear girl while I was telling you of it XII When Obermuller sent for me I thought he wanted to see me about that play he s writing in which I m to star when the pigs begin to fly Funniest thing in the world about that man Mag He knows he can t get bookings for any play on earth that if he did they d be canceled and any old excuse thrown at him as soon as Tausig heard of it and could put on the screws He knows that there isn t an unwatched hole in theatrical America through which he can crawl and pull me and the play in after him And yet he just can t let go working on it He loves it Mag he loves it as Molly loved that child of hers that kept her nursing it all the years of its life and left her feeling that the world had been robbed of everything there was for a woman to do when it died Obermuller has told me all the plot In fact he s worked it out on me I know it as it is as he wanted it to be and as it s going to be He tells me he s built it up about me that it will fit me as never a comedy fitted a player yet and that we ll make such a hit the play and I together that And then he remembers that there s no chance not the ghost of one and he falls to swearing at the Trust Don t you think mister O I said as he began again when I came into his office that it might be as well to quit cursing the Syndicate till you ve got something new to say or something different to rail about It seems to me a man s likely to get daffy if he keeps harping on Oh I ve got it all right Nance be sure of that I ve got something different to say of them and something new to swear about They ve done me up that s all Just as they ve fixed Iringer and Gaffney and Howison Tell me He threw out his arms and then let them fall to his side Oh it s easy he cried so easy that I never thought of it They ve just bought the Vaudeville out of hand and served notice on me that when my lease expires next month they ll not be able to renew it unfortunately That s all No not quite In order to kill all hope of a new plan in me they ve just let it get to be understood that any man or woman that works for Obermuller needn t come round to them at any future time Phew A blacklist Not anything so tangible It s just a hint you know but it works all right It works like What are you going to do what can you do Shoot Tausig or myself or both of us Nonsense Yes of course it s nonsense or rather it s only what I d like to do But that s not the question Never mind about me It s what are you going to do He looked straight at me waiting But I didn t answer I was thinking You don t realize Nance what those fellows are capable of When Gaffney told me before he gave up and went West that there was a genuine signed conspiracy among them to crush out us independents I laughed at him It s a dream Gaffney I said Forget it It s no dream as you ll find out when your turn comes in time he shouted It s a fact and what s more Iringer once taxed Tausig to his face with it told him he knew there was such a document in existence signed by the great Tausig himself by Heffelfinger of the Pacific circuit by Dixon of Chicago and Weinstock of New Orleans binding themselves to force us fellows to the wall and specifying the per cent of profit each one of em should get on any increase of business to blacklist every man and woman that worked for us to buy up our debts and even bring false attachments when Now weren t there enough real debts to satisfy em They re hard to please if you haven t creditors enough to suit em He looked grim but he didn t speak I don t believe it anyway mister O and tisn t good for you to keep thinking about just one thing You ll land where Iringer did if you don t look out How did he know about it anyway There was a leak in Tausig s office Iringer used to be in with them and he had it from a clerk who but never mind that It s the blacklisting I m talking about now Gray s just been in to see me to let me know that she quits at the end of the season And his Lordship too of course You re not burdened with a contract Nance Perhaps you d better think it over seriously for a day or two and decide if it wouldn t be best I don t have to I interrupted then Nance he cried jumping up as though he d been relieved of half his troubles I don t have to think it over I went on slowly not looking at the hand he held out to me It doesn t take long to know that when you re between the devil and the deep sea you d better try the devil rather than be forced out into the wet What you don t mean I knew he was looking at me incredulously but I just wouldn t meet his eye My staying with you will do you no good was hurrying now to get it over with and it would do me a lot of harm I think you re right mister Obermuller I d better just go over to where it s warm They ll be glad to get me and and to tell the truth I ll be glad to get in with the Syndicate even if I can t make as good terms as I might have by selling that contract which like the famous conspiracy you re half mad about never existed He sat down on the edge of the desk I caught one glimpse of his face It was black that was enough for me I turned to go Ah but it did Miss Olden it did he sneered I won t believe it on the word of a man that s been in the lunatic asylum ever since he lost his theater Perhaps you ll believe it on mine I jumped On yours Didn t that little bully when he lost his temper that day at the Van Twiller when we had our last fight didn t he pull a paper out of his box and shake it in my face and But you could have them arrested for conspiracy and And the proof of it could be destroyed and then but I can t see how this interests you No no I said thoughtfully I only happened to lump it in with the contract we haven t you and I And as there s no contract why there s no need of my waiting till the end of the season Do you mean to say you d you d If twere done twere better it d be done quickly I said Macbethically He looked at me Sitting there on his desk his clenched fist on his knee he looked for a moment as though he was about to fly at me Then all of a sudden he slipped into his chair leaned back and laughed It wasn t a pleasant laugh Mag No wait Let me tell you the rest You are so shrewd Olden so awfully shrewd Your eye is so everlastingly out for the main chance and you re still so young that I predict a a great future for you I might even suggest that by cultivating Tausig personally You needn t No you re right I needn t You can discount any suggestion I might make You just want to be the first to go over eh To get there before Gray does to get all there is in it for the first rebel that lays down his arms not to come in late when submission is stale and cheap Don t worry about terms you poor little babe in the woods Don t His own words seemed to choke him Don t you think I began a bit unsteadily I think oh what a fool I ve been That stiffened me Of course you have I said cordially It s silly to fight the push isn t it It s only the cranks that get cocky and think they can upset the fellows on top The thing to do is to find out which is the stronger if you re a better man than the other fellow down him If he s the champion enlist under him But be in it What s the use of being a kicker all your life You only let some one else come in for the soft things while you stay outside and gnaw your finger nails and plot and plan and starve You spend your life hoping to live to morrow while the Tausigs are living high to day The thing to do is to be humble if you can t be arrogant If they ve got you in the door don t curse but placate them Think of Gaffney herding sheep out in Nevada of Iringer in the asylum of Howison Admirable admirable he interrupted sarcastically The only fault I have to find with your harangue is that you ve misconceived my meaning entirely But I needn t enlighten you Good morning Miss Olden good by He turned to his desk and pulled out some papers I knew he wasn t so desperately absorbed in them as he pretended to be Won t you shake hands I asked and wish me luck He put down his pen His face was white and hard but as he looked at me it gradually softened I suppose I suppose I am a bit unreasonable just this minute he said slowly I m hard hit and and I don t just know the way out Still I haven t any right to to expect more of you than there is in you you poor little thing It s not your fault but mine that I ve expected Oh for God s sake Nance go and leave me alone I had to take that with me to the Van Twiller and it wasn t pleasant But Tausig received me with open arms Got tired of staying out in the cold eh he grinned I m tired of vaudeville I answered Can t you give me a chance in a comedy Hm Ambitious ain t you Obermuller has a play all ready for me written for me He d star me fast enough if he had the chance But he ll never get the chance Oh I don t know But I do He s on the toboggan that s where they all get my dear when they get big headed enough to fight us But Obermuller s not like the others He s not so easy And he is so clever why the plot of that comedy is the bulliest thing You ve read it you remember it Oh I know it by heart my part of it You see he wouldn t keep away from me while he was thinking of it He kept consulting me about everything in it In a way we worked over it together The little man looked at me slowly closing one eye It is a habit of his when he s going to do something particularly nasty Then in a way as you say it is part yours Hardly Imagine Nance Olden writing a line of a play Still you collaborated that s the word I say my dear if I could read that comedy and it was half what you say it is I might I don t promise mind but I might let you have the part that was written for you and put the thing on Has he drilled you any eh He was the best stage manager we ever had before he got the notion of managing for himself and ruining himself Well he s all that yet Of course he has told me and we agreed how the thing should be done As he d write you know he d read the thing over to me and I Fine fine A reading from that fool Obermuller would be enough to open the eyes of a clever woman I d like to read that comedy yes But Obermuller would never But Olden might What Dictate the plot to my secretary Mason in there he nodded his head back toward the inner room She could give him the plot and as much of her own part in full as she could remember You know Mason Used to be a newspaper man Smart fellow that when he s sober He could piece out the holes yes I looked at him The little beast sat there slowly closing one eye and opening it again He looked like an unhealthy little frog with his bald head his thin lipped mouth that laughed while the wrinkles rayed away from his cold sneering eyes that had no smile in them I I wouldn t like to make an enemy of a man like Obermuller mister Tausig Bah Ain t I told you he s on the toboggan But you never can tell with a man like that Suppose he got into that combine with Heffelfinger and Dixon and Weinstock What re you talking about Well it s what I ve heard But Heffelfinger and Dixon and Weinstock are all in with us who told you that fairy story Obermuller himself The little fellow laughed His is a creaky almost silent little laugh if a spider could laugh he d laugh that way They re fooling him a bunch or two Never you mind Obermuller He s a dead one Oh he said that you thought they were in with you but that nothing but a written agreement would hold men like that And that you hadn t got Smart fellow that Obermuller He d have been a good man to have in the business if it hadn t been for those independent ideas he s got He s right it takes So there is an agreement I shouted in spite of myself as I leaned forward He sat back in his chair or rather he let it swallow him again What business is that of yours Stick to the business on hand Get to work on that play with Mason inside If it s good and we decide to put it on we ll pay you five hundred dollars down in addition to your salary If it s rot you ll have your salary weekly all the time you re at it just the same as if you were working till I can place you In the meantime keep your ears and eyes open and watch things and your mouth shut I ll speak to Mason and he ll be ready for you to morrow morning Come round in the morning there s nobody about then and we want to keep this thing dark till it s done Obermuller mustn t get any idea what we re up to He don t love you no for shaking him He s furious wouldn t even say good by I m done for with him anyway I guess But what could I do Nothing my dear nothing You re a smart little girl he chuckled Ta ta XIII Just what I d been hoping for I don t know but I knew that my chance had come that morning For a week I had been talking Obermuller s comedy to Mason the secretary In the evenings I stood about in the wings and watched the Van Twiller company in Brambles There was one fat role in it that I just ached for but I lost all that ache and found another when I overheard two of the women talking about Obermuller and me one night He found her and made her one of em said just dug her out of the ground See what he s done for her taught her every blessed thing she knows wrote her mimicking monologues for her gave her her chance and and now Well Tausig don t pay salaries for nothing and she gets hers as regularly as I draw mine What more I don t know But she hasn t set foot on the stage yet under Tausig and they say Obermuller I didn t get the rest of it so I don t know what they say about Obermuller I only know what they ve said to him about me Tisn t hard to make men believe those things But I had to stand it What could I do I couldn t tell Fred Obermuller that I was making over his play soul and as much body as I could remember to Tausig s secretary He d have found that harder to believe than the other thing It hasn t been a very happy week for me I can tell you Maggie But I forgot it all every shiver and ache of it when I came into the office that morning as usual and found Mason alone Not altogether alone he had his bottle And he had had it and others of the same family all the night before The poor drunken wretch hadn t been home at all He was worse than he d been that morning three days before when I had stood facing him and talking to him while with my hands behind my back I was taking a wax impression of the lock of the desk and he as unconscious of it all as Tausig himself The last page I had dictated the day before which he d been transcribing from his notes lay in front of him the gas was still burning directly above him and a shade he wore over his weak eyes had been knocked awry as his poor old bald head went bumping down on the type writer before him The thing that favored me was Tausig s distrust of everybody connected with him He hates his partners only a bit less than he hates the men outside the Trust The bigger and richer the Syndicate grows the more power and prosperity it has the more he begrudges them their share of it the more he wants it all for himself He is madly suspicious of his clerks and hires others to watch them to spy upon them He is continually moving his valuables from place to place partly because he trusts no man partly because he s so deathly afraid his right hand will find out what his left is doing He is a full partner of Braun and Lowenthal with mental reservations He has no confidence in either of them Half his schemes he keeps from them the other half he tells them part of He s for ever afraid that the Syndicate of which he s the head will fall to pieces and become another Syndicate of which he won t be head It all makes him an unhappy restless little beast but it helped me to day If it d been any question of safe combinations and tangled things like that the game would have been all up for Nancy O But in his official safe Tausig keeps only such papers as he wants Braun and Lowenthal to see And in his private desk in his private office he keeps I stole past Mason sleeping with his forehead on the type writer keys he ll be lettered like the obelisk when he wakes up and crept into the next room to see just what Tausig keeps in that private desk of his Oh yes it was locked But hadn t I been carrying the key to it every minute for the last forty eight hours There must be a mine of stuff in that desk of Tausig s Mag The touch of every paper in it is slimy with some dirty trick some bad secret some mean action It s a pity that I hadn t time to go through em all it would have been interesting but under a bundle of women s letters which that old fox keeps for no good reason I ll bet I lit on a paper that made my heart go bumping like a cart over cobbles Yes there it was just as Obermuller had vowed it was with Tausig s cramped little signature followed by Heffelfinger s Dixon s and Weinstock s a scheme to crush the business life out of men by the cleverest up to date Trust deviltry a thing that our Uncle Sammy just won t stand for And neither will Nancy Olden Miss Monahan She grabbed that precious paper with a gasp of delight and closed the desk But she bungled a bit there for Mason lifted his head and blinked dazedly at her for a moment recognized her and shook his head No work to day he said No I know I ll just look over what we ve done mister Mason she answered cheerfully His poor head went down again with a bob and she caught up the type written sheets of Obermuller s play She waited a minute longer half because she wanted to make sure Mason was asleep again before she tore the sheets across and crammed them down into the waste basket half because she pitied the old fellow and was sorry to take advantage of his condition But she knew a cure for this last sorry a way she d help him later and when she danced out into the hall she was the very happiest burglar in a world chock full of opportunities Oh she was in such a twitter as she did it All that old delight in doing somebody else up a vague somebody whose meannesses she didn t know was as nothing to the joy of doing Tausig up She was dancing on a volcano again that incorrigible Nance Oh but such a volcano Maggie It atoned for a year of days when there was nothing doing no excitement no risk nothing to keep a girl interested and alive And Maggie darlin it was a wonderful volcano that ones that last one for it worked both ways It paid up for what I haven t done this past year and what I ll never do again in the years to come It made up to me for all I ve missed and all I m going to miss It was a reward of demerit for not being respectable and a preventive of further sins Oh it was such a volcano as never was It was a drink and a blue ribbon in one It was a bang up end and a bully beginning It was It was Tausig coming in as I was going out Suddenly I realized that but I was in such a mad whirl of excitement that I almost ran over the little fellow before I could stop myself Phew What a whirlwind you are he cried Where are you going Oh good morning mister Tausig I said sweetly I never dreamed you d be down so early in the morning What re you doing with the paper he demanded suspiciously My eye followed his I could have beaten Nancy Olden in that minute for not having sense enough to hide that precious agreement instead of carrying it rolled up in her hand Just taking it home to go over it I said carelessly trying to pass him But he barred my way Where s Mason he asked Poor Mason I said He s he s asleep Drunk again I nodded How to get away That settles his hash Out he goes to day It seems to me you re in a deuce of a hurry he added as I tried to get out again Come in I want to talk something over with you Not this morning I said saucily I wanted to cry I ve got an engagement to lunch and I want to go over this stuff for Mason before one Hm An engagement Who with now My chin shot up in the air He laughed that cold noiseless little laugh of his But suppose I want you to come to lunch with me Oh thank you mister Tausig But how could I break my engagement with With Braun How did you guess it I laughed There s no keeping anything from you He was immensely satisfied with his little self I know him that old rascal he said slowly I say Olden just do break that engagement with Braun I oughtn t really But do eh Finish your work here and we ll go off together us two at twelve thirty and leave him cooling his heels here when he comes He rubbed his hands gleefully But I m not dressed You ll do for me But not for me Listen let me hurry home now and I ll throw Braun over and be back here to meet you at twelve thirty He pursed up his thin little lips and shook his head But I slipped past him in that minute and got out into the street At twelve thirty I called back as I hurried off I got around the corner in a jiffy Oh I could hardly walk Mag I wanted to fly and dance and skip I wanted to kick up my heels as the children were doing in the Square while the organ ground out Ain t It a Shame I actually did a step or two with them to their delight and the first thing I knew I felt a bit of a hand in mine like a cool pink snowflake and Oh a baby Mag A girl baby more than a year old and less than two years young too little to talk too big not to walk facing the world with a winning smile and jabbering things in her soft little lingo knowing that every woman she meets will understand I did all right She was saying to me as she kicked out her soft heelless little boot Nancy Olden I choose you Nancy Olden I love you Nancy Olden I dare you not to love me Nancy Olden I defy you not to laugh back at me Where in the world she dropped from heaven knows The organ grinder picked up the shafts of his wagon and trundled it away The piccaninnies melted like magic But that gay little flirt about a year and a half old just held on to my finger and gabbled poetry I didn t realize just then that she was a lost strayed or stolen I expected every moment some nurse or conceited mamma to appear and drag her away from me And I looked down at her oh she was just a little bunch of soft stuff her face was a giggling dimple framed in a big round hat halo that had fallen from her chicken blond head and her white dress with the blue ribbons at the shoulders was just a little bit dirty I like em a little bit dirty Why Perhaps because I can imagine having a little coquette of my own a bit dirty like that and can t just see Nance Olden with a spick and span clean baby all feathers and lace like a bored little grown up You re a mouse I gurgled down at her You re a sweetheart You re a And suddenly I heard a cry and rush behind me It was a false alarm just a long legged girl of twelve rushing round the corner followed by a lot of others It hadn t been meant for me of course but in the second when I had remembered that precious paper and Tausig s rage when he should miss it I had pulled my hand away from that bit baby s and started to run The poor little tot There isn t any reason in the world for the fancies they take any more than for our own eh Mag Why should she have been attracted to me just because I was so undignified as to dance with the piccaninnies But do you know what that little thing did She thought I was playing with her She gave a crow of delight and came bowling after me That finished me I stooped and picked her up in my arms throwing her up in the air to hear her crow and feel her come down again Mouse I said we ll just have a little trip together The nurse that d lose you deserves to worry till you re found The mother that s lucky enough to own you will be benefited hereafter by a sharp scare on your account just now Come on sweetheart Oh the feel of a baby in your arms Mag It makes the Cruelty seem a perfectly unreal thing a thing one should be unutterably ashamed of imagining of accusing human nature of a thing only an irredeemably vile thing could imagine Just the weight of that little body riding like a bonny boat at anchor on your arm just the cocky little way it sits up chirping and confident just the light touch of a bit of a hand on your collar just that is enough to push down brick walls to destroy pictures of bruised and maimed children that endure after the injuries are healed to scatter records that even I I Nancy Olden can t believe and believe too that other women have carried their babies as I did some other woman s baby across the Square On the other side I set her down I didn t want to I was greedy of every moment that I had her But I wanted to get some change ready before climbing up the steps to the L station She clutched my dress as we stood there a minute in a perfectly irresistible way I know now why men marry baby women it s to feel that delicious helpless clutch of weak fingers the clutch of dependence of trust of appeal I looked down at her with that same silly adoration I ve seen on Molly s face for her poor lacking twisted boy At least I did in the beginning But gradually the expression of my face must have changed for all at once I discovered what had been done to me My purse was gone Yes Maggie Monahan clean gone My pocket had been as neatly picked as I myself well never mind as what I threw back my head and laughed aloud Nance Olden the great doer up had been done up so cleverly so surely so prettily that she hadn t had an inkling of it I wished I could get a glimpse of the clever girl that did it A girl of course it was Do you think any boy s fingers could do a job like that and me not even know But I didn t stop to wish very long Here was I with the thing I valued most in the world still clutched in my hand and not a nickel to my name to get me the paper and the baby on our way It was the baby of course that decided me You can t be very enterprising when you re carrying a pink lump of sweetness that s all a smile at the moment but may get all a tear the next It s you for the nearest police station you young tough I said squeezing her I can t take you home now and show you to Mag But she giggled and gurgled back at me the abandoned thing as though the police station was just the properest place for a young lady of her years It was not so very near either that station My arm ached when I got there from carrying her but my heart ached too to leave her I told the matron how and where the little thing had picked me up At first she wouldn t leave me but the fickle little thing a glass of milk transferred all her smiles and wiles to the matron Then we both went over her clothes to find a name or an initial or a laundry mark But we found nothing The matron offered me a glass of milk too but I was in a hurry to be gone She was a nice matron so nice that I was just about to ask her for the loan of car fare when When I heard a voice Maggie in the office adjoining I knew that voice all right and I knew that I had to make a decision quick I did I threw the whole thing into the lap of Fate And when I opened the door and faced him I was smiling Oh yes it was Tausig XIV He started as though he couldn t believe his eyes when he saw me The Lord hath delivered mine enemy into my hand shone in his evil little face Why mister Tausig I cried before he could get his breath How odd to meet you here Did you find a baby too Did I find He glared at me I find you that s enough Now But the luncheon was to be at twelve thirty I laughed And I haven t changed my dress yet You ll change it all right for something not so becoming if you don t shell out that paper Paper
1212_14653_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes paper 
none	none	Look here if you give it back to me this minute now I ll not prosecute you for for For the sake of my reputation I suggested softly Yes He looked doubtfully at me mistrusting the amiable deference of my manner That would be awfully good of you I murmured He did not answer but watched me as though he wasn t sure which way I d jump the next moment I wonder what could induce you to be so forgiving I went on musingly What sort of paper is this you miss It must be valuable Yes it s valuable all right Come on now Quit your fooling and get down to business 
1212_14653_000015_000003	train-clean-360	I m going to have that paper 
none	none	Do you know mister Tausig I said impulsively if I were you and anybody had stolen a valuable paper from me I d have him arrested I would I should not care a rap what the public exposure did to his reputation so long so long I grinned right up at him so long as it didn t hurt me myself in the eyes of the law Mad Oh he was hopping A German swear word burst from him I don t know what it meant but I can imagine
1212_14653_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 Look here I give you one more chance he squeaked if you don t 
none	none	What ll you do I was sure I had him I was sure from the very whisper in which he had spoken that the last thing in the world he wanted was to have that agreement made public by my arrest But I tripped up on one thing I didn t know there was a middle way for a man with money His manner changed Nance Olden he said aloud now I charge you with stealing a valuable private paper of mine from my desk Here Sergeant I hadn t particularly noticed the Sergeant standing at the other door with his back to us But from the way he came at Tausig s call I knew he d had a private talk with him and I knew he d found the middle way This girl s taken a paper of mine I want her searched Tausig cried Do you mean I said that you ll sign your name to such a charge against me He didn t answer He had pulled the Sergeant down and was whispering in his ear 
1212_14653_000026_000002	train-clean-360	I knew what that meant 
none	none	It meant a special pull and a special way of doing things and You ll do well my girl to give up mister Tausig s property to him the Sergeant said stiffly But what have I got that belongs to him I demanded He grinned and shrugged his big shoulders We ve a way of finding out you know here Give it up or But what does he say I ve taken What charge is there against me Have you the right to search any woman who walks in here And what in the world would I want a paper of Tausig s for You won t give it up then He tapped a bell A woman came in I had a bad minute there but it didn t last it wasn t the matron I d brought the baby to You ll take this girl into the other room and search her thoroughly The thing we re looking for The Sergeant turned to Tausig
1212_14653_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 A small paper he said eagerly 
none	none	A a contract just a single sheet of legal cap paper it was type written and signed by myself and some other gentlemen and folded twice 
1212_14653_000036_000000	train-clean-360	The woman looked at me 
none	none	She was a bit hard mouthed with iron gray hair but her eyes looked as though they d seen a lot and learned not to flinch though they still felt like it 
1212_14653_000036_000002	train-clean-360	I knew that kind of look I d seen it at the Cruelty 
none	none	What an unpleasant job this of yours is I said to her smiling up at her for all the world as that tike of a baby had smiled at me and watching her melt just as I had I ll not make it a bit harder This thing s all a mistake Which way I ll come back mister Tausig to receive your apology but you can hardly expect me to go to lunch after this He growled a wrathful resenting mouthful But he looked a bit puzzled just the same He looked more puzzled yet even bewildered when we came back into the main office a quarter of an hour later the woman and I and she reported that no paper of any kind had she found Me Oh I was sweet amiability personified with the woman and with the Sergeant who began to back water furiously But with Tausig What You don t mean to say you re not on Mag Oh dear dear it s well you had that beautiful wig of red hair that puts even Carter s in the shade for you d never have been a success in in other businesses I might name Bamboozled the woman Not a bit of it you can t deceive women with mouths and eyes like that It was just that I d had a flash of genius in the minute I heard Tausig s voice and in spite of my being so sure he wouldn t have me arrested I d Guess Mag guess There was only one way The baby of course In the moment I had it wasn t long I d stooped down pretending to kiss that cherub good by and in a jiffy I d pinned that precious paper with a safety pin to the baby s under petticoat preferring that risk to Risk I should say it was And now it was up to Nance to make good While Tausig insisted and explained and expostulated and at last walked out with the Sergeant giving me a queer last look that was half cursing half placating I stood chatting sweetly with the woman who had searched me I didn t know just how far I might go with her She knew the paper wasn t on me and I could see she was disposed to believe I was as nice as she d have liked me to be But she d had a lot of experience and she knew as most women do even without experience that if there s not always fire where there is smoke it s because somebody s been clever enough and quick enough to cover the blaze Well good by I said putting out my hand
1212_14653_000047_000001	train-clean-360	 It s been disagreeable but I m obliged to you for why where s my purse 
none	none	We must have left it And I turned to go back into the room where I d undressed You didn t have any The words came clear and cold and positive Her tone was like an icicle down my back I didn t have any I exclaimed Why I certainly You certainly had no purse for I should have seen it and searched it if you had Now what do you think of a woman like that Nancy Olden I said to myself more in sorrow than in anger you ve met your match right here When a woman knows a fact and states it with such quiet conviction without the least unnecessary emphasis and not a superfluous word ware that woman There s only one game to play to let you hang round here a bit longer and find out what s become of the baby Play it 
1212_14653_000054_000000	train-clean-360	I looked at her with respect it was both real and feigned 
none	none	Of course you must be right I said humbly I know you wouldn t be likely to make a mistake but just to convince me do you mind letting me go back to look Not at all she said placidly If I go with you there s no reason why you should not look Oh Mag it was hard lines looking Why Why because the place was so bare and so small There were so few things to move and it took such a short time in spite of all I could do and pretend to do that I was in despair You must be right I said at length looking woefully up at her Yes I knew I was she said steadily
1212_14653_000060_000000	train-clean-360	 I must have lost it 
none	none	Yes There was no hope there I turned to go I ll lend you a nickel to get home if you ll leave me your address she said after a moment 
1212_14653_000064_000000	train-clean-360	Oh that admirable woman 
none	none	She ought to be ruling empires instead of searching thieves Look at the balance of her Mag My best acting hadn t shaken her She hadn t that fatal curiosity to understand motives that wrecks so many who deal with we ll call them the temporarily un straight She was satisfied just not to let me get ahead of her in the least particular But she wasn t mean and she would lend me a nickel not an emotionally extravagant ten cent piece but just a nickel on the chance that I was what I seemed to be Oh I did admire her but I d have been more enthusiastic about it if I could have seen my way clear to the baby and the paper I took the nickel and thanked her but effusiveness left her unmoved A wholesome blue gowned rock with a neat full bibbed white apron that s what she was 
1212_14653_000067_000000	train-clean-360	And still I lingered 
none	none	Fancy Nance Olden just heartbroken at being compelled to leave a police station 
1212_14653_000068_000000	train-clean-360	But there was nothing for it 
none	none	Go I had to My head was a whirl with schemes coming forward with suggestions and being dismissed as unsuitable my thoughts were flying about at such a dizzy rate while I stood there in the doorway the woman s patient hand on the knob and her watchful eyes on me that I actually Mag I actually didn t hear the matron s voice the first time she spoke The second time though I turned so happy I could not keep the tremor out of my voice I thought you had gone long ago she said 
1212_14653_000072_000000	train-clean-360	Oh we were friends we two 
none	none	We d chummed over a baby which for women is like what taking a drink together is for men The admirable dragon in the blue dress didn t waver a bit because her superior spoke pleasantly to me She only watched and listened Which puts you in a difficult position when your name s Nance Olden you have to tell the truth I ve been detained I said with dignity against my wish But that s all over I m going now Good by I nodded and caught up my skirt Oh I paused just as the admirable dragon was closing the door on me Is the baby asleep I wonder if I might see her once more My heart was beating like an engine gone mad in spite of my careless tone and there was a buzzing in my ears that deafened me But I managed to stand still and listen and then to walk off as though it didn t matter in the least to me while her words came smashing the hope out of me We ve sent her with an officer back to the neighborhood where you found her He ll find out where she belongs no doubt Good day XV Ah me Maggie the miserable Nance that went away from that station To have had your future in your grasp like that one of the Fates with the string and then to have it snatched from you by an impish breeze and blown away goodness knows where I don t know just which way I turned after I left that station I didn t care where I went Nothing I could think of gave me any comfort I tried to fancy myself coming home to you I tried to see myself going down to tell the whole thing to Obermuller But I couldn t do that There was only one thing I wanted to say to Fred Obermuller and that thing I couldn t say now But Nance Olden s not the girl to go round long like a molting hen There was only one chance in a hundred and that was the one I took of course Back to the Square where you found the baby Nance I cried to myself There s the chance that that admirable dragon has had her suspicions aroused by your connection with the baby which she hadn t known before and has already dutifully notified the Sergeant There s the chance that the baby is home by now and the paper found by her mother will be turned over to her papa and then it s good by to your scheme There s the chance that But in the heart of me I didn t believe in any chance but one the chance that I d find that blessed baby and get my fingers just once more on that precious paper I blew in the A D s nickel on a cross town car and got back to the little Square There was another organ grinder there grinding out coon songs to which other piccaninnies danced But nary a little white bundle of fluff caught hold of my hand I walked that Square till my feet were sore It was hot My throat was parched I was hungry My head ached I was hopeless And yet I just couldn t give it up I had asked so many children and nurse maids whether they d heard of the baby lost that morning and brought back by an officer that they began to look at me as though I was not quite right in my mind The maids grabbed the children if they started to come near me and the children stared at me with big round eyes as though they d been told I was an ogre who might eat them I was hungry enough to The little fruit stand at the entrance had a fascination for me I found myself there time and again till I got afraid I might actually try to get of with a peach or a bunch of grapes That thought haunted me Fancy Nance Olden starved and blundering into the cheapest and most easily detected species of thieving I suppose great generals in their hour of defeat imagine themselves doing the feeblest foolishest things As I sat there on the bench gazing before me I saw the whole thing Nancy Olden after all her bragging her skirmishing her hairbreadth scapes and successes arrested in broad daylight and before witnesses for having stolen a cool wet bunch of grapes worth a nickel for her hot dry hungering throat I saw the policeman that d do it he looked like that Sergeant Mulhill I met way way back in Latimer s garden I saw the officer that d receive me he had blue eyes like the detective that came for me to the Manhattan I saw the woman jailer oh she was the A D all right who d receive me without the slightest emotion show me to a cell and lock the door as calm as little triumphant or affected as though I hadn t once outwitted that cleverest of creatures and outwitted myself in forestalling her I saw Mag guess what I saw No truly what I really saw It made me jump to my feet and grab it with a squeal I saw my own purse lying on the gravel almost at my feet near the little fruit stand that had tempted me Blank empty it was stripped clean not a penny left in it not a paper not a stamp not even my key Just the same I was glad to have it It linked me in a way to the place The clever little girl that had stolen it had been here in this park on this very spot The thought of that cute young Nance Olden distracted my mind a minute from my worry and oh Maggie darlin I was worrying so I walked up to the fruit stand with the purse in my hand The old fellow who kept it looked up with an inviting smile Lord knows he needn t have encouraged me to buy if I d had a penny I want to ask you I said if you remember selling a lot of good things to a little girl who had a purse this this morning I showed it to him and he turned it over in his crippled old hands It was full then or fuller anyway I suggested You wouldn t want to get her into trouble that little girl he asked cautiously I laughed Not I I myself I was going to say well you can imagine what I was going to say and that I didn t say it or anything like it Well there she is Kitty Wilson over yonder he said I gasped it was so unexpected And I turned to look There on one of the benches sat Kitty Wilson If I hadn t been blind as a bat and full of trouble oh it thickens your wits does trouble and blinds your eyes and muffles your ears I d have suspected something at the mere sight of her For there sat Kitty Wilson enthroned a hatless lank little creature about twelve and near her clustered thick as ants around a lump of sugar was a crowd of children black and white boys and girls For Kitty that deplorable Kitty had money to burn or what was even more effective at her age she had goodies to give away Her lap was full of spoils She had a sample of every good thing the fruit stand offered Her cheeks and lips were smeary with candy Her dress was stained with fruit The crumbs of cake lingered still on her chin and apron And Kitty I love a generous thief was treating the gang It helped itself from her abundant lap it munched and gobbled and asked for more It was a riot of a high old time Even the birds were hopping about as near as they dared picking up the crumbs and the squirrels had peanuts to throw to the birds And all on Nancy Olden s money I laughed till I shook It was good to laugh Nancy Olden isn t accustomed to a long dose of the doleful and it doesn t agree with her I strolled over to where my guests were banqueting You see Mag that s where I shouldn t rank with the A D I m too inquisitive I want to know how the other fellow in the case feels and thinks It isn t enough for me to see him act Kitty I said somehow a twelve year old makes you feel more of a grown up than a twelve months old does I hope you re having a good time Kitty Wilson but haven t you lost something She was chewing at the end of a long string of black candy shoe strings all right the stuff looks like and she was eating just because she didn t want to stop Goodness knows she was full enough Her jaws stopped though suddenly as she looked from the empty purse in my outstretched hand to me and took me in Oh I know that pause intimately It says Wait a minute till I get my breath and I ll know how much you know and just what lie to tell you But she changed her mind when she saw my face You know Mag if there s a thing that s fixed in your memory it s the face of the body you ve done up The respectables have their rogues gallery but we that is the light fingered brigade have got a fools gallery to correspond to it In which of em is my picture Now Margaret that s mean You know my portrait hangs in both I looked down on the little beggar that had painted me for the second salon and lo in a flash she was on her feet the lapful of good things tumbled to the ground and Kitty was off I was bitterly disappointed in that girl Mag I was altogether mistaken in my diagnosis of her Hers is only a physical cleverness a talented dexterity She had no resource in time of danger but her legs And legs will not carry a grafter half so far as a good quick tongue and a steady head She halted at a safe distance and glared back at me Her hostility excited the crowd of children her push against me and the braver ones jeered the things Kitty only looked while the thrifty ones stooped and gathered up the spoil Tell her I wouldn t harm her I said to one of her lieutenants She says she won t hurt ye Kit the child screamed She dassent yelled back Kitty the valiant She knows I d peach on her about the kid Kid What kid I cried all a fire The kid ye swiped this mornin Yah I told the cop what brought her back how ye took her jest as I Kitty I cried You treasure And with all my might I ran after her Silly Of course it was I might have known what the short skirts above those thin legs meant I couldn t come within fifty feet of her I halted panting and she paused too dancing tantalizingly half a block away What to do I wished I had another purse to bestow on that sad Kitty but I had nothing absolutely nothing except all at once I remembered it that little pin you gave me for Christmas Mag I took it off and turned to appeal to the nearest one of the flying body guard that had accompanied us You run on to her and tell her that if she ll show me the house where that baby lives I ll give her this pin He sped on ahead and parleyed with Kit and while they talked I held aloft the little pin so that Kit might see the price She hesitated so long that I feared she d slip through my hands but a sudden rival voice piping out I ll show ye the house Missus was too much for her So with Kit at a safe distance in advance to guard against treachery and a large and enthusiastic following I crossed the street turned a corner walked down one block and half up another and halted before a three story brownstone I flew up the stairs leaving my escort behind and rang the bell It wasn t so terribly swagger a place which relieved me some I want to see the lady whose baby was lost this morning I said to the maid that opened the door Yes m Who ll I tell her Who That stumped me Not Nance Olden late of the Vaudeville later of the Van Twiller and latest of the police station No not Nance Olden not Tell her please I said firmly that I m Miss Murieson of the X Ray and that the city editor has sent me here to see her That did it Hooray for the power of the press She showed me into a long parlor and I sat down and waited It was cool and quiet and softly pretty in that long parlor The shades were down the piano was open the chairs were low and softly cushioned I leaned back and closed my eyes exhausted And suddenly Mag I felt something that was a cross between a rose leaf and a snowflake touch my hand If it wasn t that delectable baby I caught her and lifted her to my lap and hugged the chuckling thing as though that was what I came for Then in a moment I remembered the paper and lifted her little white slip It was gone Mag The under petticoat hadn t a sign of the paper I d pinned to it My head whirled in that minute I suppose I was faint with the heat with hunger and fatigue and worry but I felt myself slipping out of things when I heard the rustling of skirts and there before me stood the mother of my baby The little wretch She deserted me and flew to that pretty mother of hers in her long cool white trailing things and sat in her arms and mocked at me It was easy enough to begin talking I told her a tale about being a newspaper woman out on a story how I d run across the baby and all the rest of it I must ask your pardon I finished up for disturbing you but two things sent me here one to know if the baby got home safe and the other I gulped to ask about a paper with some notes that I d pinned to her skirt She shook her head It was in that very minute that I noticed the baby s ribbons were pink they had been blue in the morning Of course I suggested you ve had her clothes changed and Why yes of course said baby s mother The first thing I did when I got hold of her was to strip her and put her in a tub the second was to discharge that gossiping nurse for letting her out of her sight And the soiled things she had on the dress with the blue ribbons I ll find out she said She rang for the maid and gave her an order Was it a valuable paper she asked Not very I stammered My tongue was thick with hope and dread Just my notes you know but I do need them I couldn t carry the baby easily so I pinned them on her skirt thinking thinking The maid came in and dumped a little heap of white before me I fell on my knees Oh yes I prayed all right but I searched too And there it was What I said to that woman I don t know even now I flew out through the hall and down the steps and And there Kitty Wilson corralled me Say where s that stick pin she cried Here here you darling I said pressing it into her hand And Kitty whenever you feel like swiping another purse just don t do it It doesn t pay Just you come down to the Vaudeville and ask for Nance Olden some day and I ll tell you why Gee said Kitty impressed Shall shall I call ye a hansom lady Should she The blessed inspiration of her I got into the wagon and we drove down street to the Vaudeville I burst in past the stage doorkeeper amazed to see me and rushed into Fred Obermuller s office There I cried throwing that awful paper on the desk before him Now cinch em Fred Obermuller as they cinched you It ll be the holiest blackmail that ever oh and will you pay for the hansom XVI I don t remember much about the first part of the lunch I was so hungry I wanted to eat everything in sight and so happy that I couldn t eat a thing But mister O kept piling the things on my plate and each time I began to talk he d say Not now wait till you re rested and not quite so famished I laughed Do I eat as though I was starved You you look tired Nance Well I said slowly it s been a hard week It s been hard for me too harder I think than for you It wasn t fair to me to let me think what I did and say what I did I m so sorry Nance and ashamed So ashamed You might have told me And have you put your foot down on the whole thing not much He laughed He s got such a boyish laugh in spite of his chin and his eye glasses and the bigness of him He filled my glass for me and helped me again to the salad Oh Mag it s such fun to be a woman and have a man wait on you like that It s such fun to be hungry and to sit down to a jolly little table just big enough for two with carnations nodding in the tall slim vase with a fat soft footed quick handed waiter dancing behind you and something tempting in every dish your eye falls on It s a gay happy easy world Maggie darlin I vow I can t find a dark corner in it not to day None but the swellest place in town was good enough Obermuller had said for us to celebrate in The waiters looked queerly at us when we came in me in my dusty shoes and mussed hair and old rig and mister O in his working togs But do you suppose we cared He was smoking and I was pretending to eat fruit when at last I got fairly launched on my story He listened to it all with never a word of interruption Sometimes I thought he was so interested that he couldn t bear to miss a word I said And then again I fancied he wasn t listening at all to me only watching me and listening to something inside of himself Can you see him Mag sitting opposite me there at the pretty little table off in a private room by ourselves He looked so big and strong and masterful with his eyes half closed watching me that I hugged myself with delight to think that I I Nancy Olden had done something for him he couldn t do for himself It made me so proud so tipsily vain that as I leaned forward eagerly talking I felt that same intoxicating happiness I get on the stage when the audience is all with me and the two of us myself and the many handed good natured other fellow over on the other side of the footlights go careering off on a jaunt of fun and fancy like two good playmates He was silent a minute when I got through Then he laid his cigar aside and stretched out his hand to me And the reason Nance the reason for it all I looked up at him I d never heard him speak like that The reason I repeated Yes the reason He had caught my hand Why to down that tiger Trust and beat Tausig He laughed And that was all Nonsense Nance Olden there was another reason There are other tiger trusts Are you going to set up as a lady errant and right all syndicate wrongs No there was another a bigger reason Nance I m going to tell it to you what I pulled my hand from his but not before that fat waiter who d come in without our noticing had got something to grin about Beg pardon sir he said This message must be for you sir It s marked immediate and no one else Obermuller took it and tore it open He smiled the oddest smile as he read it and he threw back his head and laughed a full hearty bellow when he got to the end Read it Nance he said passing it over to me They sent it on from the office I read it mister Fred W Obermuller Manager Vaudeville Theater New York City N Y Dear Obermuller I have just learned from your little protegee Nance Olden of a comedy you ve written From what Miss Olden tells me of the plot and situations of And the Greatest of These your title s great I judge the thing to be something altogether out of the common and my secretary and reader mister Mason agrees with me that properly interpreted and perhaps touched up here and there the comedy ought to make a hit Would Miss Olden take the leading role I wonder Can t you drop in this evening and talk the matter over There s an opening for a fellow like you with us that s just developed within the past few days and this is strictly confidential I have succeeded in convincing Braun and Lowenthal that their enmity is a foolish personal matter which business men shouldn t let stand in the way of business After all just what is there between you and them A mere trifle a misunderstanding that half an hour s talk over a bottle of wine with a good cigar would drive away If you re the man I take you for you ll drop in this evening at the Van Twiller and bury the hatchet They re good fellows those two and smart men even if they are stubborn as sin Counting on seeing you to night my dear fellow I am most cordially I M TAUSIG I dropped the letter and looked over at Obermuller Miss Olden he said severely coming over to my side of the table have you the heart to harm a generous soul like that He he s very prompt isn t he and most And then we laughed together You notice the letter was marked personal Obermuller said He was still standing beside me No was it I got up too and began to pull on my gloves but my fingers shook so I couldn t do a thing with them Oh yes it was That s why I showed it to you Nance Nance don t you see that there s only one way out of this There s only one woman in the world that would do this for me and that I could take it from I clasped my hands helplessly Oh what could I do Maggie with him there and his arms ready for me I I should think you d be afraid I whispered I didn t dare look at him He caught me to him then Afraid you wouldn t care for an old fellow like me he laughed Yes that s the only fear I had But I lost it Nancy Nancy Obermuller when you flung that paper down before me That s quite two hours ago haven t I waited long enough Oh Mag Mag how can I tell him Do you think he knows that I am going to be good good that I can be as good for a good man who loves me as I was bad for a bad man I loved XVII PHILADELPHIA January twenty seven Maggie dear I m writing to you just before dinner while I wait for Fred He s down at the box office looking up advance sales I tell you Maggie Monahan we re strictly in it we Obermullers That Broadway hit of mine has preceded me here and we ve got the town I suspect in advance But I m not writing to tell you this I ve got something more interesting to tell you my dear old Cruelty chum I want you to pretend to yourself that you see me Mag as I came out of the big Chestnut Street store this afternoon my arms full of bundles I must have on that long coat to my heels of dark warm red silk lined with the long incurving back sweep and high chinchilla collar that Fred ordered made for me the very day we were married I must be wearing that jolly little red cloth toque caught up on the side with some of the fur Oh yes I knew I was more than a year behind the times when I got them but a successful actress wears what she pleases and the rest of the world wears what pleases her too Besides fashions don t mean so much to you when your husband tells you how becoming but this has nothing to do with the Bishop Yes the Bishop Mag I had just said Nance Olden To myself I still speak to me as Nancy Olden it s good for me Mag keeps me humble and for ever grateful that I m so happy Nance you ll never be able to carry all these things and lift your buful train too And there s never a hansom round when it s snowing and And then I caught sight of the carriage Yes Maggie the same fat low comfortable elegant sober carriage wide and well kept with rubber tired wheels And the two heavy horses fat and elegant and sober too and wide and well kept I knew whose it was the minute my eyes lighted on it and I couldn t I just couldn t resist it The man on the box still wide and well kept was wide awake this time I nodded to him as I slipped in and closed the door after me I ll wait for the Bishop I said with a red coated assurance that left him no alternative but to accept the situation respectfully Oh dear dear It was soft and warm inside as it had been that long long ago day The seat was wide and roomy The cushions had been done over I resented that but though a different material they were a still darker plum And instead of Quo Vadis the Bishop had been reading Resurrection I took it up and glanced over it as I sat there but you know Mag the heavy weight plays never appealed to me I don t go in for the tragic perhaps I saw too much of the real thing when I was little At any rate it seemed dull to me and I put it aside and sat there absent mindedly dreaming of a little girl thief that I knew once when when the handle of the door turned and the Bishop got in and we were off Oh the little Bishop the contrast between him and the fat pompous rig caught me He seemed littler and leaner than ever his little white beard scantier his soft eye kindlier and his soft heart God bless my soul he exclaimed jumping almost out of his neat little boots while he looked sharply over his spectacles What did he see Just a red coated ghost dreaming in the corner of his carriage It made him doubt his eyes his sanity I don t know what he d have done if that warm red ghost hadn t got tired of dreaming and laughed outright Daddy I murmured sleepily Oh that little ramrod of a bishop The blood rushed up under his clear thin baby like skin and he sat up straight and solemn and awful awful as such a tiny bishop could be I fear Miss you have made a mistake he said primly I looked at him steadily You know I haven t I said gently That took some of the starch out of him but he eyed me suspiciously Why don t you ask me where I got the coat Bishop Van Wagenen I said leaning over to him He started I suppose he d just that moment remembered my leaving it behind that day at missus Ramsay s Lord bless me he cried anxiously You haven t you haven t again No I haven t Ah Maggie dear it was worth a lot to me to be able to say that no to him It was given to me Guess who gave it to me He shook his head My husband Maggie Monahan he didn t even blink Perhaps in the Bishop s set husbands are not uncommon or very likely they don t know what a husband like Fred Obermuller means I congratulate you my child or or did it were you Why I d never seen Fred Obermuller then I cried Can t you tell a difference Bishop I pleaded Don t I look like a an imposing married woman now Don t I seem a bit oh just a bit nicer His eyes twinkled as he bent to look more closely at me You look you look my little girl exactly like the pretty big eyed wheedling voiced child I wished to have for my own daughter I caught his hand in both of mine Now that s like my own own Bishop I cried Mag Mag he was blushing like a boy a prim rather scared little school boy that somehow yet oh I knew he must feel kindly to me I felt so fond of him You see Bishop Van Wagenen I began softly I never had a father and Bless me But you told me that day you had mistaken me for for him The baby I had forgotten what that old Edward told me that this trusting soul actually still believed all I d told him What was I to do I tell you Mag it s no light thing to get accustomed to telling the truth You never know where it ll lead you Here was I just a clever little lie or two and the dear old Bishop would be happy and contented again But no that fatal habit that I ve acquired of telling the truth to Fred and you mastered me and I fell You know Bishop I said shutting my eyes and speaking fast to get it over as I imagine you must Mag when you confess to Father Phelan that was all a a little farce comedy the whole business all of it every last word of it A comedy I opened my eyes to laugh at him he was so bewildered I mean a a fib in fact many of them I I was just it was long ago and I had to make you believe His soft old eyes looked at me unbelieving You don t mean to say you deliberately lied Now that was what I did mean just what I did mean but not in that tone of voice But what could I do I just looked at him and nodded Oh Maggie I felt so little and so nasty I haven t felt like that since I left the Cruelty And I m not nasty Maggie and I m Fred Obermuller s wife and And that put a backbone in me again Fred Obermuller s wife just won t let anybody think worse of her than she can help from sheer love and pride in that big clever husband of hers Now look here Bishop Van Wagenen I broke out if I were the abandoned little wretch your eyes accuse me of being I wouldn t be in your carriage confessing to you this blessed minute when it d be so much easier not to Surely surely in your experience you must have met girls that go wrong and then go right for ever and ever Amen And I m very right now But but it has been hard for me at times And at those times ah you must know how sincerely I mean it at those times I used to try to recall the sound of your voice when you said you d like to take me home with you and keep me If I had been your daughter you d have had a heart full of loving care for me And yet if I had been and had known that benevolent fatherhood I should need it less so much less than I did the day I begged a prayer from you But it s all right now You don t know do you I m Nance Olden That made him sit up and stare I tell you Even the Bishop had heard of Nancy Olden But suddenly unaccountably there came a queer sad look over his face and his eyes wouldn t meet mine I looked at him puzzled Tell me what it is I said You evidently forget that you have already told me you are the wife of mister mister Ober Obermuller Oh that s all right I laughed aloud I was so relieved Of course I am and he s my manager and my playwright and my secretary and my my dear dear boy There I wasn t laughing at the end of it I never can laugh when I try to tell what Fred is to me But funny that won him There there he said patting me on the shoulder Forgive me my dear I am indeed glad to know that you are living happily I have often thought of you Oh have you Yes I have even told missus Van Wagenen about you and how I was attracted to you and believed ahem Oh oh have you I gave a wriggle as I remembered that Maltese lace Maria wanted and that I ugh But luckily he didn t notice He had taken my hand and was looking at me over his spectacles in his dear fatherly old way Tell me now my dear is there anything that an old clergyman can do for you I have an engagement near here and we may not meet again I can t hope to find you in my carriage many more times You are happy you are living worthily child Pardon me but the stage Oh the gentle courtesy of his manner I loved his solicitude Father hungry girls like us Maggie know how to value a thing like that You know I said slowly the thing that keeps a woman straight and a man faithful is not a matter of bricks and mortar nor ways of thinking nor habits of living It s something finer and stronger than these It s the magic taboo of her love for him and his for her that makes them sacred With that to guard them why Yes yes he patted my hand softly Still the old see the dangers of an environment that a young and impulsive woman like you my dear might be blind to Your associates My associates Oh you ve heard about Beryl Blackburn Well she s she s just Beryl you know She wasn t made to live any different Some people steal and some drink and some gamble and some Well Beryl belongs to the last class She doesn t pretend to be better than she is And just between you and me Bishop I ve more respect for a girl of that kind than for Grace Weston whose husband is my leading man you know Why she pulls the wool over his eyes and makes him the laughing stock of the company I can t stand her any more than I can Marie Avon who s never without two strings All at once I stopped But wasn t it like me to spoil it all by bubbling over I tell you Maggie too much truth isn t good for the Bishop s set they don t know how to digest it I was afraid that I d lost him for he spoke with a stately little primness as the carriage just then came to a stop I had been so interested talking that I hadn t noticed where we were driving Ah here we are he said I must ask you to excuse me Miss ah missus that is there s a public meeting of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children this afternoon that I must attend Good by then Oh are you bound for the Cruelty too I asked Why so am I And yes yes that s the Cruelty The Cruelty stands just where it did Mag when you and I first saw it most things do in Philadelphia you know There s the same prim official straight up and downness about the brick front The steps don t look so steep now and the building s not so high perhaps because of a skyscraper or two that ve gone up since But it chills your blood Maggie darlin just as it always did to think what it stands for Not man s inhumanity to man but women s cruelty to children Maggie think of it if you can as though this were the first time you d heard of such a thing Would you believe it I waked from that to find myself marching up the stairs behind the Bishop s rigid little back Oh it was stiff and uncompromising Beryl Blackburn did that for me Poor pretty pagan Beryl My coming with the Bishop we seemed to come together anyway made the people think he d brought me so I must be just all right I had the man bring in the toys I d got out in the carriage and I handed them over to the matron saying They re for the children I want them to have them all and now please to do whatever they want with them There ll always be others I m going to send them right along if you ll let me so that those who leave can take something of their very own with them something that never belonged to anybody else but just themselves you understand It s terrible don t you know to be a deserted child or a tortured child or a crippled child and have nothing to do but sit up in that bare clean little room upstairs with a lot of other strangelings and just think on the cruelty that s brought you here and the cruelty you may get into when you leave here If I d had a doll if Mag had only had a set of dishes or a little tin kitchen if the boy with the gouged eye could have had a set of tools oh can t you understand I became conscious then that the matron a new one Mag ours is gone was staring at me and that the people stood around listening as though I d gone mad Who came to my rescue Why the Bishop like the manly little fellow he is He forgave me even Beryl in that moment It s Nance Olden ladies he said with a dignified little wave of his hand that served for an introduction She begins her Philadelphia engagement to night in And the Greatest of These Oh I m used to it now Maggie but I do like it All the lady swells buzzed about me and there Nance stood preening herself and crowing softly till till from among the bunch of millinery one of them stepped up to me She had a big smooth face with plenty of chins Her hair was white and her nose was curved and she rustled in silk and It was missus Dowager Diamonds alias Henrietta alias missus Edward Ramsay Clever My how clever she exclaimed as though the sob in my voice that I couldn t control had been a bit of acting She was feeling for her glasses When she got them and hooked them on her nose and got a good look at me why she just dropped them with a smash upon the desk I looked for a minute from her to the Bishop I remember you very well missus Ramsay I hope you haven t forgotten me I ve often wanted to thank you for your kindness I said slowly while she as slowly recovered I think you ll be glad to know that I am thoroughly well cured Shall I tell missus Ramsay how Bishop I put it square up to him And he met it like the little man he is perhaps too my bit of charity to the Cruelty children had pleased him I don t think it will be necessary Miss Olden he said gently I can do that for you at some future time And I could have hugged him but I didn t dare We had tea there in the Board rooms Oh Mag remember how we used to peep into those awful imposing Board rooms Remember how strange and resentful you felt like a poor little red haired nigger up at the block when you were brought in there to be shown to the woman who d called to adopt you It was all so strange that I had to keep talking to keep from dreaming I was talking away to the matron and the Bishop about the play room I m going to fit up out of that bare little place upstairs Perhaps the same child doesn t stay there very long but there ll always be children to fill it more s the cruel pity Then the Bishop and I climbed up there to see it and plan about it But I couldn t really see it Mag nor the poor white faced wise eyed little waifs that have succeeded us for the tears in my eyes and the ache at my heart and the queer trick the place has of being peopled with you and me and the boy with the gouged eye and the cripple and the rest He put his gentle thin old arm about my shoulders for a moment when he saw what was the matter with me Oh he understands my Bishop And then we turned to go downstairs Oh I want I want to do something for them I cried I want to do something that counts that s got a heart in it that knows You knew didn t you it was true what I said downstairs I was I am a Cruelty girl Help me to help others like me My dear he said very stately and sweet I ll be proud to be your assistant You ve a kind true heart and And just at that minute as I was preceding him down the narrow steps a girl in a red coat trimmed with chinchilla and in a red toque with some of the same fur blocked our way as she was coming up We looked at each other You ve seen two peacocks spread their tails and strut as they pass each other Well the peacock coming up wasn t in it with the one going down Her coat wasn t so fine nor so heavy nor so newly smartly cut Her toque wasn t so big nor so saucy and the fur on it not to mention that the descending peacock was a brunette and well Mag I had my day Miss Evelyn Kingdon paid me back in that minute for all the envy I ve spent on that pretty rig of hers She didn t recognize me of course even though the two red coats were so near as she stopped to let me pass that they kissed like sisters ere they parted But Mag Nancy Olden never got haughty that there wasn t a fall waiting for her Back of Miss Kingdon stood missus Kingdon still missus Kingdon thanks to Nance Olden and behind her at the foot of the steps was a frail little old fashioned bundle of black satin and old lace I lost my breath when the Bishop hailed his wife Maria he said some men say their wives first names all the years of their lives as they said them on their wedding day I want you to meet Miss Olden Nance Olden the comedian She s the girl I wanted for my daughter you ll remember it s more than a year ago now since I began to talk about her I held my breath while I waited for her answer But her poor short sighted eyes rested on my hot face without a sign It s an old joke among us she said pleasantly about the Bishop s daughter We stood there and chatted and the Bishop turned away to speak to missus Kingdon Then I seized my chance I ve heard missus Van Wagenen I said softly and oh as nicely as I could of your fondness for lace We are going abroad in the spring my husband and I to Malta among other places Can t I get you a piece there as a souvenir of the Bishop s kindness to me Her little lace mittened parchment like hands clasped and unclasped with an almost childish eagerness Oh thank you thank you very much but if you would give the same sum to charity I will I laughed She couldn t guess how glad I was to do this thing And I ll spend just as much on your lace and be so happy if you ll accept it I promised Henrietta a box for to night Maggie and one to missus Kingdon The Dowager told me she d love to come though her husband is out of town unfortunately she said But you ll come with me won t you Bishop she said turning to him And you missus Van The Bishop blushed Was he thinking of Beryl I wonder But I didn t hear his answer for it was at that moment that I caught Fred s voice He had told me he was going to call for me I think he fancied that the old Cruelty would depress me as dreams of it have you know and he wanted to come and carry me away from it just as at night when I ve waked shivering and moaning I ve felt his dear arms lifting me out of the black night memory of it But it was anything but a doleful Nance he found and hurried down the snowy steps out to a hansom and off to rehearsal For the Bishop had said to me God bless you child when he shook hands with both of us at parting and the very Cruelty seemed to smile a grim benediction as we drove off together on Fred and NANCY O End of Project Gutenberg s In the Bishop s Carriage by
