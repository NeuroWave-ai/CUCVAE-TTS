yo lib we do keep a movin cried Dinah as she climbed into the big depot wagon We didn t forget Snoop this time exclaimed Freddie following close on Dinah s heels with the box containing Snoop his pet cat who always went traveling with the little fellow I m glad I covered up the ferns with wet paper Flossie remarked for this sun would surely kill them if it could get at them Bert you may carry my satchel said missus Bobbsey and be careful as there are some glasses of jelly in it you know I wish I had put my hat in my trunk remarked Nan I m sure someone will sit on this box and smash it before we get there Now all ready called Uncle Daniel as he prepared to start old Bill the horse Wait a minute Aunt Sarah ordered There was another box I m sure Freddie didn t you fix that blue shoe box to bring along Oh yes that s my little duck Downy Get him quick somebody he s on the sofa in the bay window Bert climbed out and lost no time in securing the missing box Now we are all ready this time mister Bobbsey declared while Bill started on his usual trot down the country road to the depot The Bobbseys were leaving the country for the seashore As told in our first volume The Bobbsey Twins the little family consisted of two pairs of twins Nan and Bert age eight dark and handsome and as like as two peas and Flossie and Freddie age four as light as the others were dark and just exactly chums as Flossie always declared The Bobbsey twins lived at Lakeport where mister Richard Bobbsey had large lumber yards The mother and father were quite young themselves and so enjoyed the good times that came as naturally as sunshine to the little Bobbseys Dinah the colored maid had been with the family so long the children at Lakeport called her Dinah Bobbsey although her real name was missus Sam Johnston and her husband Sam was the man of all work about the Bobbsey home Our first volume told all about the Lakeport home and our second book The Bobbsey Twins in the Country was the story of the Bobbseys on a visit to Aunt Sarah and Uncle Daniel Bobbsey in their beautiful country home at Meadow Brook Here Cousin Harry a boy Bert s age shared all the sports with the family from Lakeport Now the Lakeport Bobbseys were leaving Meadow Brook to spend the month of August with Uncle William and Aunt Emily Minturn at their seashore home called Ocean Cliff located near the village of Sunset Beach There they were also to meet their cousin Dorothy Minturn who was just a year older than Nan It was a beautiful morning the very first day of August that our little party started off Along the Meadow Brook road everybody called out Good by for in the small country place all the Bobbseys were well known and even those from Lakeport had many friends there Nettie Prentice the one poor child in the immediate neighborhood she only lived two farms away from Aunt Sarah ran out to the wagon as Uncle Daniel hurried old Bill to the depot Oh here Nan she called Do take these flowers if you can carry them They are in wet cotton battin at the stems and they won t fade a bit all day and Nettie offered to Nan a gorgeous bouquet of lovely pure white waxy lilies that grow so many on a stalk and have such a delicious fragrance Nettie s house was an old homestead and there delicate blooms crowded around the sitting room window Nan let her hatbox down and took the flowers These are lovely Nettie she exclaimed I ll take them no matter how I carry them Thank you so much and I hope I ll see you next summer Yes do come out again Nettie faltered for she would miss Nan the city girl had always been so kind even lent her one of her own dresses for the wonderful Fourth of July parade Maybe you will come down to the beach on an excursion called Nan as Bill started off again with no time to lose I don t think so answered Nettie for she had never been on an excursion poor people can rarely afford to spend money for such pleasures I ve got my duck called Freddie to the little girl who had given the little creature to Freddie at the farewell party as a souvenir of Meadow Brook Have you laughed Nettie Give him plenty of water Freddie let him loose in the ocean for a swim Then Nettie ran back to her home duties Queer remarked Nan as they hurried on The two girls I thought the most of in Meadow Brook were poor Nettie Prentice and Nellie the little cash girl at the fresh air camp Somehow poor girls seem so real and they talk to you so close I mean they seem to just speak right out of their eyes and hearts That s what we call sincerity daughter said missus Bobbsey You see children who have trials learn to appreciate more keenly than we who have everything we need That appreciation shows in their eyes and so they seem closer to you as you say Oh oh oh screamed Freddie I think my duck is choked He s got his head out the hole Take Snoop quick Bert till I get Downy in again and the poor little fellow looked as scared as did the duck with his head out of the hole He can t get it in again cried Freddie pushing gently on the little lump of down with the queer yellow bill the duck s head The hole ain t big enough and he ll surely choke in it Tear the cardboard down said Bert That s easy enough and the older brother coming to the rescue put his fingers under the choking neck gave the paper box a jerk and freed poor Downy When we get to the depot we will have to paste some paper over the tear continued Bert or Downy will get out further next time Here we are called Uncle Daniel pulling up to the old station I ll attend to the baggage announced mister Bobbsey while you folks all go to the farther end of the platform Our car will stop there For a little place like Meadow Brook seven people getting on the Express seemed like an excursion and Dave the lame old agent hobbled about with some consequence as he gave the man in the baggage car instruction about the trunk and valises During that brief period Harry Aunt Sarah and Uncle Daniel were all busy with good byes Aunt Sarah giving Flossie one kiss more and Uncle Daniel tossing Freddie up in the air in spite of the danger to Downy the duck All aboard called the conductor Good by Good by Come and see us at Christmas called Bert to Harry I may go down to the beach answered Harry while the train brakes flew off We will expect you Thanksgiving missus Bobbsey nodded out the window to Aunt Sarah I ll come if I can called back the other Good by Good by Now let us all watch out for the last look at dear old Meadow Brook exclaimed Nan standing up by the window Let Snoop see said Freddie with his hand on the cover of the kitten s box Oh no called everybody at once If you let that cat out we will have just as much trouble as we did coming up Keep him in his box He would like to see too pouted Freddie Snoop liked Meadow Brook Didn t you Snoopy putting his nose close to the holes in the box I suppose by the time we come back from the beach Freddie will have a regular menagerie said Bert with a laugh He had a kitten first now he has a kitten and a duck and next he ll have a kitten a duck and a Sea serpent put in Freddie believing that he might get such a monster if he cared to possess one There goes the last of Meadow Brook sighed Nan as the train rounded a curve and slowed up on a pretty bridge And we did have such a lovely time there Isn t it going to be just as nice at the ocean Freddie inquired with some concern We hope so his mother replied but sister Nan always likes to be grateful for what she has enjoyed So am I insisted the little fellow not really knowing what he meant himself I likes dis yere car de best spoke up Dinah looking around at the ordinary day coach the kind used in short journeys De red velvet seats seems de most homey she went on throwing her kinky head back and I likes to lean back wit out tumbling ober And there s more to see agreed Bert In the Pullman cars there are so few people and they re always Proud put in Flossie Yes they seem so declared her brother but see all the people in this car just eating and sleeping and enjoying themselves Now in our last book The Bobbsey Twins in the Country we told about the trip to Meadow Brook in the Pullman car and how Snoop the kitten got out of his box and had some queer experiences This time our friends were traveling in the car with the ordinary passengers and of course as Bert said there was more to be seen and the sights were different It is splendid to have so much room declared missus Bobbsey for Nan and Flossie had a big seat turned towards Bert and Freddie s while Dinah had a seat all to herself with some boxes of course and mister and missus Bobbsey had another seat The high back broad plush seats gave more room than the narrow revolving chairs besides the day coach afforded so much more freedom for children What a cute little baby exclaimed Nan referring to a tiny tot sleeping under a big white netting across the aisle We must be quiet said missus Bobbsey and let the little baby sleep It is hard to travel in hot weather Don t you think the duck should have a drink suggested mister Bobbsey You have a little cup for him haven t you Freddie Yep answered Freddie promptly pulling the cover off Downy s box Instantly the duck flew out Oh oh oh yelled everybody as the little white bird went flying out through the car First he rested on the seat then he tried to get through the window Somebody near by thought he had him but the duck dodged and made straight for the looking glass at the end of the car Oh do get him somebody cried Freddie while the other strange children in the car yelled in delight at the fun He s kissing himself in the looking glass declared one youngster as the frightened little duck flapped his wings helplessly against the mirror He thinks it s another duck called a boy from the back of the car clapping his hands in glee mister Bobbsey had gone up carefully with his soft hat in his hand Everybody stopped talking so the duck would keep in its place Nan held Freddie and insisted on him not speaking a word mister Bobbsey went as cautiously as possible One step more and he would have had the duck He raised his hand with the open hat and brought it down on the looking glass The duck was now gazing down from the chandelier Ha ha ha the boys laughed that s a wild duck sure Who s got a gun the boy in the back hollered Oh will they shoot my duck cried Freddie in real tears No they re only making fun said Bert You keep quiet and we will get him all right By this time almost everyone in the car had joined in the duck hunt while the frightened little bird seemed about ready to surrender Downy had chosen the highest hanging lamps as his point of vantage and from there he attempted to ward off all attacks of the enemy No matter what was thrown at him he simply flew around the lamp As it was a warm day chasing the duck was rather too vigorous exercise to be enjoyable within the close confines of a poorly ventilated car but that bird had to be caught somehow Oh the net cried Bert that mosquito netting over there We could stretch it up and surely catch him This was a happy thought The baby of course was awake and joined in the excitement so that her big white mosquito netting was readily placed at the disposal of the duck hunters A boy named Will offered to help Bert I ll hold one end here said Will and you can stretch yours opposite so we will screen off half of the car then when he comes this way we can readily bag him Will was somewhat older than Bert and had been used to hunting so that the present emergency was sport to him The boys now brought the netting straight across the car like a big white screen for each held his hands up high besides standing on the arm of the car seats Now drive him this way called Bert to his father and the men who were helping him Shoo Shoo Shoo yelled everybody throwing hats books and newspapers at the poor lost duck Shoo again called a little old lady actually letting her black silk bag fly at the lamp Of course poor Downy had to shoo right into the net Bert and Will brought up the four ends of the trap and Downy flopped That s the time we bagged our game laughed Will while everybody shouted and clapped for it does not take much to afford real amusement to passengers who are traveling and can see little but the other people the conductor and newspapers We ve got him at last cried Freddie in real glee for he loved the little duck and feared losing his companionship And he will have to have his meals served in his room for the rest of his trip laughed missus Bobbsey as the tired little Downy was once more put in his perforated box along the side of the tin dipper of water which surely the poor duck needed by this time CHAPTER II A TRAVELING MENAGERIE It took some time for the people to get settled down again for all had enjoyed the fun with the duck The boys wanted Freddie to let him out of the box on the quiet but Bert overheard the plot and put a stop to it Then when the strange youngsters got better acquainted and learned that the other box contained a little black kitten they insisted on seeing it We ll hold him tight declared the boy from the back seat and nothing will happen to him But you don t know Snoop insisted Bert We nearly lost him coming up in the train and he s the biggest member of Freddie s menagerie so we have to take good care of him mister Bobbsey too insisted that the cat should not be taken out of the box so the boys reluctantly gave in Now let us look around a little suggested missus Bobbsey when quiet had come again and only the rolling of the train and an occasional shrill whistle broke in on the continuous rumble of the day s journey Yes Dinah can watch the things and we can look through the other cars agreed mister Bobbsey We might find someone we know going down to the shore Be awful careful of Snoop and Downy cautioned Freddie as Dinah took up her picket duty Look out the boys don t get em with a wise look at the youngsters who were spoiling for more sport of some kind Dis yeah circus won t move way from Dinah she laughed When I goes on de police fo ce I takes good care ob my beat and you needn t be a worryin Freddie de Snoopy kitty cat and de Downy duck will be heah when you comes back and she nodded her wooly head in real earnest It was an easy matter to go from one car to the other as they were vestibuled so that the Bobbsey family made a tour of the entire train the boys with their father even going through the smoker into the baggage car and having a chance to see what their own trunk looked like with a couple of railroad men sitting on it Don t you want a job the baggagemaster asked Freddie We need a man about your size to lift trunks off the cars for us Of course the man was only joking but Freddie always felt like a real man and he answered promptly Nope I m goin to be a fireman I ve put lots of fires out already besides gettin awful hurted on the ropes with Frisky Frisky who is he inquired the men Why our cow out in Meadow Brook Don t you know Frisky and Freddie looked very much surprised that two grown up people had never met the cow that had given him so much trouble Why didn t you bring him along the men asked further Have you got a cow car Freddie asked in turn Yes we have Would you like to see one went on one of the railroaders If your papa will bring you out on the platform at the next stop I ll show you how our cows travel mister Bobbsey promised to do this and the party moved back to meet Nan Flossie and their mamma Freddie told them at once about his promised excursion to the cattle car and of course the others wanted to see too If we stop for a few minutes you may all come out mister Bobbsey said But it is always risky to get off and have to scramble to get back again Sometimes they promise us five minutes and give us two taking the other three to make up for lost time The train gave a jerk and the next minute they drew up to a little way station Here we are come now called mister Bobbsey picking Freddie up in his arms and telling the others to hurry after him Oh there go the boys from our car called Bert as quite a party of youngsters alighted They must be going on a picnic see their lunch boxes I hope Snoop is all right Freddie reflected seeing all the lunch boxes that looked so much like Snoop s cage Come on little fellow called the baggage man we only have a few minutes Then they took Freddie to the rear car and showed him a big cage of cows it was a cage made of slates with openings between and through the openings could be seen the crowded cattle Oh I would never put Frisky in a place like that declared Freddie he wouldn t have room to move There is not much room that s a fact agreed the man But you see cows are not first class passengers But they are good and know how to play and they give milk said Freddie speaking up bravely for his country friends What are you going to do with all of these cows I don t know replied the man not just wanting to talk about beefsteak Maybe they re going out to the pasture One pretty little cow tried to put her head out through the bars and Bert managed to give her a couple of crackers from his pocket She nibbled them up and bobbed her head as if to say Thank you I was very hungry They are awfully crowded Nan ventured and it must be dreadful to be packed in so How do they manage to get a drink They will be watered to night replied the man and then the Bobbseys had to all hurry to get on the train again for the locomotive whistle had blown and the bell was ringing They found Dinah with her face pressed close to the window pane enjoying the sights on the platform I specked you was clean gone and left me she laughed S pose you saw lots of circuses Freddie A whole carful he answered but Dinah he went on looking scared where s Snoop The box was gone Right where you left him she declared I nebber left dis yeah spot and nobody doan come ter steal de Snoopy kitty cat Dinah was crawling around much excited looking for the missing box Bert Nan and Flossie of course all rummaged about and even mister and missus Bobbsey joined in the search But there was no box to be found Oh the boys have stoled my cat wailed Freddie I dust knowed they would and he cried outright for Snoop was a dear companion of the little fellow and why should he not cry at losing his pet Now wait commanded his father we must not give up so easily Perhaps the boys hid him some place But suah s you lib I nebber did leab dis yeah seat insisted Dinah which was very true But how could she watch those boys and keep her face so close to the window Besides a train makes lots of noise to hide boys pranks Now we will begin a systematic search said mister Bobbsey who had already found out from the conductor and brakeman that they knew nothing about the lost box We will look in and under every seat Then we will go through all the baggage in the hangers meaning the overhead wire baskets and see if we cannot find Snoop The other passengers were very kind and all helped in the hunt The old lady who had thrown her hand bag at Downy thought she had seen a boy come in the door at the far end of the car and go out again quickly but otherwise no one could give any information that would lead to the discovery of the person or parties who had stolen Snoop All kinds of traveling necessities were upset in the search Some jelly got spilled some fresh country eggs were cracked but everybody was good natured and no one complained Yet after a thorough overhauling of the entire car there was no Snoop to be found He s gone they all admitted the children falling into tears while the older people looked troubled They could hardly have stolen him mister Bobbsey reflected and the conductor is sure not one of those boys went in another car for they all left the train at Ramsley s I don t care cried Freddie aloud I ll just have every one of them arrested when we get to Auntie s I knowed they had Snoop in their boxes How Snoop could be in boxes and how the boys could be found at Auntie s were two much mixed points but no one bothered Freddie about such trifles in his present grief Why doan you call dat kitty cat suggested Dinah for all this time no one had thought of that I couldn t answered Freddie cause he ain t here to call And he went on crying Snoop Snoop Snoop Cat called Dinah but there was no familiar me ow to answer her Now Freddie boy she insisted if dat cat is alibe he will answer if youse call him so just you stop a sniffing and come along Dere s a good chile and she patted him in her old way Come wit Dinah and we will find Snoop With a faint heart the little fellow started to call beginning at the front door and walking slowly along toward the rear Stoop down now and den ordered Dinah cause he might be hiding you know Freddie had reached the rear door and he stopped Now jist gib one more good call said Dinah and Freddie did Snoop Snoop he called Me ow came a faint answer Oh I heard him cried Freddie So did I declared Dinah Instantly all the other Bobbseys were on the scene He s somewhere down here said Dinah Call him Freddie Snoop Snoop called the boy again Me ow me ow came a distant answer In the stove declared Bert jerking open the door of the stove which of course was not used in summer and bringing out the poor frightened little cat CHAPTER III RAILROAD TENNIS Oh poor little Snoop whispered Freddie right into his kitten s ear I m so glad I got you back again So are we all said a kind lady passenger who had been in the searching party You have had quite some trouble for a small boy with two animals to take care of Everybody seemed pleased that the mischievous boys pranks had not hurt the cat for Snoop was safe enough in the stove only of course it was very dark and close in there and Snoop thought he surely was deserted by all his good friends Perhaps he expected Freddie would find him at any rate he immediately started in to purr rr in a cat s way of talking when Freddie took him in his arms and fondled him We had better have our lunch now suggested missus Bobbsey I m sure the children are hungry It s just like a picnic remarked Flossie when Dinah handed around the paper napkins and missus Bobbsey served out the chicken and cold tongue sandwiches There were olives and celery too besides apples and early peaches from Uncle Daniel s farm Let us look at the timetable see where we are now and then see where we will be when we finish proposed Bert Oh yes said Nan let us see how many miles it takes to eat a sandwich mister Bobbsey offered one to the conductor who just came to punch tickets This is not the regular business man s five minute lunch but the five mile article seems more enjoyable said mister Bobbsey Easier digested agreed the conductor accepting a sandwich You had good chickens out at Meadow Brook he went on complimenting the tasty morsel he was chewing with so much relish Yes and ducks said Freddie which remark made everybody laugh for it brought to mind the funny adventure of little white Downy the duck They certainly can fly said the conductor with a smile as he went along with a polite bow to the sandwich party Bert had attended to the wants of the animals not trusting Freddie to open the boxes Snoop got a chicken leg and Downy had some of his own soft food that had been prepared by Aunt Sarah and carried along in a small tin can Well I se done announced Dinah picking up her crumbs in her napkins Bert how many miles you say it takes me to eat Let me see Five eight twelve fourteen well I guess Dinah you had fifteen miles of a chicken sandwich An you go long she protested Taint no sech thing I ain t got sich a long appetite as date Fifteen miles Lan a massa whot you take me fo Everybody laughed and the children clapped hands at the length of Dinah s appetite but when the others had finished they found their own were even longer than the maid s the average being eighteen miles When will we get to Aunt Emily s Flossie asked growing tired over the day s journey Not until night her father answered When we leave the train we will have quite a way to go by stage We could go all the way by train but it would be a long distance around and I think the stage ride in the fresh air will do us good Oh yes let s go by the stage pleaded Freddie to whom the word stage was a stranger except in the way it had been used at the Meadow Brook circus This stage will be a great big wagon Bert told him with seats along the sides Can I sit up top and drive the little one asked Maybe the man will let you sit by him answered mister Bobbsey but you could hardly drive a big horse over those rough roads The train came to a standstill just then on a switch There was no station but the shore train had taken on another section Can Flossie and I walk through that new car Nan asked as the cars had been separated and the new section joined to that directly back of the one which the Bobbseys were in Why yes if you are very careful the mother replied and so the two little girls started off Dinah took Freddie on her lap and told him his favorite story about Pickin cotton in de Souf and soon the tired little yellow head fell off in the land of Nod Bert and his father were enjoying their magazines while missus Bobbsey busied herself with some fancy work so a half hour passed without any more excitement At the end of that time the girls returned Oh mother exclaimed Nan we found missus Manily the matron of the Meadow Brook Fresh Air Camp and she told us Nellie the little cash girl was so run down the doctors think she will have to go to the seashore Mother couldn t we have her down with us awhile We are only going to visit you know daughter and how can we invite more company But where is missus Manily I would like to talk to her said missus Bobbsey who was always interested in those who worked to help the poor Nan and Flossie brought their mother into the next car to see the matron We told in our book The Bobbsey Twins in the Country how good a matron this missus Manily was and how little Nellie the cash girl one of the visitors at the Fresh Air Camp was taken sick while there and had to go to the hospital tent It was this little girl that Nan wanted to have enjoy the seashore and perhaps visit Aunt Emily missus Manily was very glad to see missus Bobbsey for the latter had helped with money and clothing to care for the poor children at the Meadow Brook Camp Why how pleasant to meet a friend in traveling said the matron as she shook hands with missus Bobbsey You are all off for the seashore the girls tell me Yes replied missus Bobbsey One month at the beach and we must then hurry home to Lakeport for the school days But Nan tells me little Nellie is not well yet No I am afraid she will need another change of air to undo the trouble made by her close confinement in a city store She is not seriously sick but so run down that it will take some time for her to get strong again said the matron Have you a camp at the seashore asked missus Bobbsey No indeed I wish we had answered the matron I am just going down now to see if I can t find some place where Nellie can stay for a few weeks I m going to visit my sister missus Minturn at Ocean Cliff near Sunset Beach said missus Bobbsey They have a large cottage and are always charitable If they have no other company I think perhaps they would be glad to give poor little Nellie a room That would be splendid exclaimed the matron I was going to do a line of work I never did before I was just going to call on some of the well to do people and ask them to take Nellie We had no funds and I felt so much depended on the change of air I simply made up my mind to go and do what I could Then you can look in at my sister s first said missus Bobbsey If she cannot accommodate you perhaps she can tell who could Now won t you come in the other car with us and we can finish our journey together Yes indeed I will Thank you said the matron gathering up her belongings and making her way to the Bobbsey quarters in the other car Won t it be lovely to have Nellie with us Nan said to Flossie as they passed along I am sure Aunt Emily will say yes So am I said little Flossie whose kind heart always went out when it should I know surely they would not let Nellie die in the city while we enjoy the seaside Freddie was awake now and also glad to see missus Manily Where s Sandy he inquired at once Sandy had been his little chum from the Meadow Brook Camp I guess he is having a nice time somewhere replied missus Manily His aunt found him out you know and is going to take care of him now Well I wish he was here too said Freddie rubbing his eyes We re goin to have lots of fun fishing in the ocean The plan for Nellie was told to mister Bobbsey who of course agreed it would be very nice if Aunt Emily and Uncle William were satisfied And what do you suppose those boxes contain said missus Bobbsey to missus Manily pointing to the three boxes in the hanger above them Shoes ventured the matron Nope said Freddie One hat and my duck and my cat Downy is my duck and Snoop is my cat Then Nan told about the flight of the duck and the kidnapping of Snoop We put them up there out of the way finished Nan so that nothing more can happen to them The afternoon was wearing out now and the strong summer sun shrunk into thin strips through the trees while the train dashed along As the ocean air came in the windows the long line of woodland melted into pretty little streams that make their way in patches for many miles from the ocean front Like Baby Waters Nan said just growing out from the ocean and getting a little bit bigger every year Won t we soon be there asked Freddie for long journeys are always tiresome especially to a little boy accustomed to many changes in the day s play One hour more said mister Bobbsey consulting his watch Let s have a game of ball Nan suggested Bert who never traveled without a tennis ball in his pocket How could we the sister inquired Easily said Bert We ll make up a new kind of game We will start in the middle of the car at the two center seats and each move a seat away at every catch Then whoever misses first must go back to center again and the one that gets to the end first wins All right agreed Nan who always enjoyed her twin brother s games We will call it Railroad Tennis Just as soon as Nan and Bert took their places the other passengers became very much interested There is such a monotony on trains that the sports the Bobbseys introduced were welcome indeed We do not like to seem proud but certainly these twins did look pretty Nan with her fine back eyes and red cheeks and Bert just matching her only his hair curled around while hers fell down Their interest in Railroad Tennis made their faces all the prettier and no wonder the people watched them so closely Freddie was made umpire to keep him out of a more active part because he might do damage with a ball in a train his mother said so as Nan and Bert passed the ball he called his father prompting him Ball one Ball two Ball three Bert jerked with a sudden jolt of the train and missed Striker s out called the umpire while everybody laughed because the boy had missed first Then Bert had to go all the way back to center while Nan was four seats down Three more balls were passed then Nan missed I shouldn t have to go all the way back for the miss protested Nan You went three seats back so I ll go three back This was agreed to by the umpire and the game continued A smooth stretch of road gave a good chance for catching and both sister and brother kept moving toward the doors now with three points to the good for Nan as a big boy said Who would miss now Everybody waited to see The train struck a curve Bert threw a wild ball and Nan missed it Foul ball called the umpire and Bert did not dispute it Then Nan delivered the ball Oh mercy me shrieked the old lady who had thrown the handbag at Downy the duck my glasses and there upon the floor lay the pieces Nan s ball had hit the lady right in the glasses and it was very lucky they did not break until they came in contact with the floor I m so sorry Nan faltered The car jerked so I could not keep it Never mind my dear answered the nice old lady I just enjoyed that game as much as you did and if I hadn t stuck my eyes out so they would not have met your ball So it s all right I have another pair in my bag So the game ended with the accident for it was now time to gather up the baggage for the last stop CHAPTER IV NIGHT IN A BARN Beach Junction All off for the Junction called the train men while the Bobbseys and missus Manily hurried out to the small station where numbers of carriages waited to take passengers to their cottages on the cliffs or by the sea Sure we haven t forgotten anything asked missus Bobbsey taking a hasty inventory of the hand baggage Bert s got Snoop and I ve got Downy answered Freddie as if the animals were all that counted And I ve got my hatbox and flowers added Nan And I have my ferns said little Flossie I guess we re all here this time mister Bobbsey finished for nothing at all seemed to be missing It was almost nightfall and the beautiful glow of an ocean sunset rested over the place At the rear of the station an aged stage driver sat nodding on his turnout The stage coach was an old timer and had carried many a merry party of sightseers through the sandy roads of Oceanport and Sunset Beach while Hank the driver called out all spots of interest along the way And Hank had a way of making things interesting Pike s Peak he would call out for Cliff Hill The Giant s Causeway he would announce for Rocky Turn And so Hank was a very popular stage driver and never had to look for trade it always came to him That s our coach said mister Bobbsey espying Hank Hello there Going to the beach he called to the sleepy driver That s for you to say replied Hank straightening up Could we get to Ocean Cliff Minturn s place before dark asked mister Bobbsey noticing how rickety the old stagecoach was Can t promise answered Hank but you can just pile in and we ll try it There was no choice so the party piled into the carryall Isn t this fun remarked missus Manily taking her seat up under the front window It s like going on a May ride I m afraid it will be a moonlight ride at this rate laughed mister Bobbsey as the stagecoach started to rattle on Freddie wanted to sit in front with Hank but missus Bobbsey thought it safer inside for indeed the ride was risky enough inside or out As they joggled on the noise of the wheels grew louder and louder until our friends could only make themselves heard by screaming at each other Night is coming called missus Bobbsey and Dinah said Suah nough we be out in de night dis time It seemed as if the old horses wanted to stand still they moved so slowly and the old wagon creaked and cracked until Hank himself turned round looked in the window and shouted All right there Guess so called back mister Bobbsey but we don t see the ocean yet Oh we ll get there drawled Hank lazily We should have gone all the way by train declared missus Bobbsey in alarm as the stage gave one squeak louder than the others Haven t you got any lanterns shouted mister Bobbsey to Hank for it was pitch dark now Never use one answered the driver When it s good and dark the moon will come up but we ll be there fore that Get long there Doll he called to one horse Go long Kit he urged the other The horses did move a little faster at that then suddenly something snapped and the horses turned to one side Whoa Whoa called Hank jerking on the reins But it was too late The stage coach was in a hole Several screamed Sit still called mister Bobbsey to the excited party It s only a broken shaft and the coach can t upset now Flossie began to cry It was so dark and black in that hole Hank looked at the broken wagon Well we re done now he announced with as little concern as if the party had been safely landed on Aunt Emily s piazza instead of in a hole on the roadside Do you mean to say you can t fix it up mister Bobbsey almost gasped Not till I get the stage to the blacksmith s replied Hank Then what are we going to do mister Bobbsey asked impatiently Well there s an empty barn over there Hank answered The best thing you can do is pitch your tent there till I get back with another wagon Barn exclaimed missus Bobbsey How long will it take you to get a wagon demanded mister Bobbsey Not long said Hank sprucing up a trifle You just get yourselves comfortable in that there barn I ll get the coach to one side and take a horse down to Sterritt s He ll let me have a horse and a wagon and I ll be back as soon as I kin make it There seems nothing else to do mister Bobbsey said We may as well make the best of it Why yes missus Manily spoke up we can pretend we are having a barn dance And she smiled faintly Nevertheless it was not very jolly to make their way to the barn in the dark Dinah had to carry Freddie he was so sleepy missus Manily took good care of Flossie But of course there was the duck and the cat that could not be very safely left in the broken down stagecoach Say papa Bert exclaimed suddenly I saw an old lantern up under the seat in that stagecoach Maybe it has some oil in it I ll go back and see All right son replied the father we won t get far ahead of you And while Bert made his way back to the wagon the others bumped up and down through the fields that led to the vacant barn There was no house within sight The barn belonged to a house up the road that the owners had not moved into that season I got one called Bert running up from the road This lantern has oil in I can hear it rattle Have you a match pa mister Bobbsey had and when the lantern had been lighted Bert marched on ahead of the party swinging it in real signal fashion You ought to be a brakeman Nan told her twin brother at which remark Bert swung his light above his head and made all sorts of funny railroad gestures The barn door was found unlocked and excepting for the awful stillness about it was not really so bad to find refuge in a good clean place like that for outside it was very damp almost wet with the ocean spray mister Bobbsey found seats for all and with the big carriage doors swung open the party sat and listened for every sound that might mean the return of the stage driver Come Freddie chile said Dinah put yer head down on Dinah s lap She won t let nothin tech you An youse kin jest go to sleep if youse a mind ter I se a watchin out The invitation was welcome to the tired little youngster and it was not long before he had followed Dinah s invitation Next Flossie cuddled up in missus Manily s arms and stopped thinking for a while It is awfully lonely whispered Nan to her mother I do wish that man would come back So do I agreed the mother This is not a very comfortable hotel especially as we are all tired out from a day s journey What was that asked Bert as a strange sound like a howl was heard A dog lightly answered the father I don t think so said Bert Listen Oh cried Flossie starting up and clinging closer to missus Manily I m just scared to death Dinah I want to go home cried Freddie Take me right straight home Hush children you are safe insisted their mother The stage driver will be back in a few minutes But what is that funny noise asked Freddie It ain t no cow nor no dog The queer Whoo oo oo came louder each time It went up and down like a scale and left a hole in the air Bert declared It s an owl exclaimed missus Bobbsey and she was right for up in the abandoned hay loft the queer old birds had found a quiet place and had not been disturbed before by visitors Let s get after them proposed Bert with lantern in hand You would have a queer hunt his father told him I guess you had better not think of it Hark there s a wagon I guess Hank is coming back to us and the welcome sound of wheels on the road brought the party to their feet again Hello there called Hank Here you are Come along now we ll make it this time It did not take the Bobbseys long to reach the roadside and there they found Hank with a big farm wagon The seats were made of boards and there was nothing to hold on to but the edge of the boards But the prospect of getting to Aunt Emily s at last made up for all their inconveniences and when finally Hank pulled the reins again our friends gave a sigh of relief CHAPTER V A QUEER STAGE DRIVER I reckon I ll have to make another trip to get that old coach down to the shop growled the stage driver as he tried to hurry the horses Kit and Doll along I hardly think it is worth moving mister Bobbsey said feeling somewhat indignant that a hackman should impose upon his passengers by risking their lives in such a broken down wagon Not worth it Wall I guess Hank don t go back on the old coach like that Why a little grease and a few bolts will put that rig in tip top order And he never made the slightest excuse for the troubles he had brought upon the Bobbseys Oh my cried Nan my hatbox Bert you have put your foot right into my best hat Couldn t help it answered the brother I either had to go through your box or go out of the back of this wagon when that seat slipped and he tried to adjust the board that had fallen into the wagon Land sakes alive exclaimed Dinah Say you driver man there she called in real earnest ef you doan go a little carefuler wit dis yere wagon you ll be spilling us all out I just caught dat cat s box a sliding and lan only knows how dat poor little Downy duck is way down under dat old board Hold on tight replied Hank as if the whole thing were a joke and his wagon had the privilege of a toboggan slide My 
5952-50948-0000	train-other-500	sighed missus Bobbsey putting her arms closer about Flossie I hope nothing more happens
none	none	 I am sure we are all right now missus Manily assured her 
5952-50948-0001	train-other-500	The road is broad and smooth here and it can t be far to the beach Here comes a carriage said Bert as two pretty coach lights flashed through the trees Hello there
none	none	 called someone from the carriage Uncle William Nan almost screamed and the next minute the carriage drew up alongside the wagon 
5952-50948-0002	train-other-500	Well I declare said Uncle William Minturn jumping front his seat and beginning to help the stranded party We are all here began mister Bobbsey but it was hard work to keep ourselves together
5952-50948-0003	train-other-500	Oh Uncle William cried Freddie put me in your carriage This one is breakin down every minute Come right along my boy I ll fix you up first declared the uncle giving his little nephew a good hug as he placed him on the comfortable cushions inside the big carriage
5952-50948-0004	train-other-500	There was not much chance for greetings as everybody was too anxious to get out of the old wagon So when all the boxes had been carefully put outside with the driver and all the passengers had taken their places on the long side seats
5952-50948-0005	train-other-500	it was one of those large side seated carriages that Uncle William had brought knowing he would have a big party to carry then with a sigh of relief missus Bobbsey attempted to tell something of their experiences But how did you know where we were Bert asked
none	none	 We had been waiting for you since four o clock replied Uncle William 
5952-50948-0006	train-other-500	Then I found out that the train was late and we waited some more But when it came to be night and you had not arrived I set out looking for you
none	none	 I went to the Junction first and the agent there told me you had gone in Hank s stage 
5952-50948-0007	train-other-500	I happened to be near enough to the livery stable to hear some fellows talking about Hank s breakdown with a big party aboard I knew then what had happened and sent Dorothy home she had been out most of the afternoon waiting
5952-50948-0008	train-other-500	got this carryall and here we are and Uncle William only had to hint hurry up to his horses and away they went Oh we did have the awfulest time insisted Freddie I feel as if we hadn t seen a house in a whole year sighed little Flossie
none	none	 And we only left Meadow Brook this morning added Nan It does seem much longer 
5952-50948-0009	train-other-500	than a day since we started Well you will be in Aunt Emily s arms in about
5952-50948-0010	train-other-500	two minutes now declared Uncle William as through the trees the lights from Ocean Cliff the Minturn cottage could now be seen Hello Hello called voices from the veranda Aunt Emily and Dorothy exclaimed Bert and called back to them
none	none	 Here we come Here we are and the wagon turned in to the broad steps at the side of the veranda I ve been worried to death declared Aunt Emily as she began kissing the girls We have brought company said missus Bobbsey introducing missus Manily 
5952-50948-0011	train-other-500	and I don t know what we should have done in all our troubles if she had not
none	none	 been along to cheer us up We are delighted to have you said Aunt Emily to missus Manily 
5952-50948-0012	train-other-500	while they all made their way indoors Oh Nan cried Dorothy hugging her cousin as tightly as ever she could I thought you would never come We were an awfully long time getting here Nan answered returning her cousin s caress
5952-50948-0013	train-other-500	but we had so many accidents Nothing happened to your appetites I hope laughed Uncle William as the dining room doors were swung open and a table laden with good things came into sight
5952-50948-0014	train-other-500	I think I could eat said missus Bobbsey then the mechanical piano player was started and the party made their way to the dining room
none	none	 Uncle William took missus Manily to her place as she was a stranger Bert sat between Dorothy and Nan mister Bobbsey looked after Aunt Emily and mister Jack Burnet a friend of Uncle William who had been spending the evening at the cottage escorted missus Bobbsey to her place Come Flossie my dear you see I have gotten a tall chair for you said Aunt Emily and Flossie was made comfortable in one of those between chairs higher than the others and not as high as a baby s It was quite a brilliant dinner party for the Minturns were well to do and enjoyed their prosperity as they went along missus Minturn had been a society belle when she was married She was now a graceful young hostess with a handsome husband She had married earlier than her sister missus Bobbsey but kept up her good times in spite of the home cares that followed During the dinner Dinah helped the waitress being perhaps a little jealous that any other maid should look after the wants of Flossie and Freddie Oh Dinah exclaimed Freddie as she came in with more milk for him did you take Snoop out of the box and did you give Downy some water I suah did chile said Dinah and you jest ought ter see that Downy duck fly round de kitchen Why he jest got one of dem fits he had on de train and we had to shut him in de pantry to get hold ob him The waitress too told about the flying duck and everybody enjoyed hearing about the pranks of Freddie s animals We ve got a lovely little pond for him Freddie said Dorothy There is a real little lake out near my donkey barn and your duck will have a lovely time there But he has to swim in the ocean insisted Freddie cause we re going to train him to be a circus duck You will have to put him in a bag and tie a rope to him then Uncle William teased because that s the only way a duck can swim in the ocean But you don t know about Downy argued Freddie He s wonderful He even tried to swim without any water on the train Through the looking glass said Bert laughing And through the air added Nan I tell you Freddie said Uncle William quite seriously we could get an airship for him maybe then he could really swim without water But Freddie took no notice of the way they tried to make fun of his duck for he felt Downy was really wonderful as he said and would do some wonderful things as soon as it got a chance When dinner was over Dorothy took Nan up to her room On the dresser in a cut glass bowl were little Nettie Prentice s lilies that Nan had carried all the way from Meadow Brook and they were freshened up beautifully thanks to Dorothy s thoughtfulness in giving them a cold spray in the bath tub What a lovely room Nan exclaimed in unconcealed admiration Do you like it said Dorothy It has a lovely view of the ocean and I chose it for you because I know you like to see pretty sights out of your window The sun seems to rise just under this window and she brushed aside the dainty curtains The moonlight made a bright path out on the ocean and Nan stood looking out spellbound I think the ocean is so grand she said It always makes me feel so small and helpless When you are under a big wave laughed her cousin who had a way of being jolly I felt that way the other day Just see my arm and Dorothy pushed up her short sleeve displaying a black and blue bruise too high up to be seen except in an evening dress or bathing costume How did you do that asked Nan in sympathy Ran into a pier returned the cousin with unconcern I thought my arm was broken first But we must go down said Dorothy while Nan wanted to see all the things in her pretty room We always sit outside before retiring Mamma says the ocean sings a lullaby that cures all sorts of bad dreams and sleeplessness On the veranda Nan and Dorothy joined the others Freddie was almost asleep in Aunt Emily s arms Uncle William mister Bobbsey and mister Burnet were talking with Bert as an interested listener while missus Manily told Aunt Emily of her mission to the beach As the children had thought Aunt Emily readily gave consent to have Nellie the little cash girl come to Ocean Cliff and on the morrow Nan and Dorothy were to write the letter of invitation CHAPTER VI THE OCEAN Is there anything more beautiful than sunrise on the ocean Nan crept out of bed at the first peep of dawn and still in her white robe she sat in the low window seat to see the sun rise under her window What a beautiful place Nan thought when dawn gave her a chance to see Ocean Cliff Dorothy must be awfully happy here To see the ocean from a bedroom window and she watched the streaks of dawn make maps on the waves If I were a writer I would always put the ocean in my book she told herself for there are so many children who never have a chance to see the wonderful world of water Nettie s flowers were still on the dresser Poor little Nettie Prentice thought Nan She has never seen the ocean and I wonder if she ever will Nan touched the lilies reverently There was something in the stillness of daybreak that made the girl s heart go out to poor Nettie just like the timid little sunbeams went out over the waters trying to do their small part in lighting up a day I ll just put the lilies out in the dew Nan went on to herself raising the window quietly for the household was yet asleep Perhaps I ll find someone sick or lonely to morrow who will like them and it will be so much better if they bring joy to someone for they are so sweet and pretty to die just for me Oh screamed Nan the next minute for someone had crept up behind her and covered her eyes with hands It is you Dorothy she declared getting hold of the small fingers Did I wake you with the window Yes indeed I thought someone was getting in from the piazza They always come near morning said Dorothy dropping down on the cushions of the window seat like a goddess of morn for Dorothy was a beautiful girl all pink and gold Bert said excepting for her eyes and they were like Meadow Brook violets deep blue Did you have the nightmare she asked Nightmare indeed Nan exclaimed Why you told me the sun would rise under my window and I got up to See it do the rise laughed Dorothy in her jolly way Well if I had my say I d make mister Sol Sun wear a mask and keep his glare to himself until respectable people felt like crawling out I lower my awning and close the inside blinds every night I like sunshine in reasonable doses at reasonable hours but the moon is good enough for me in the meantime and she fell over in a pretty lump feigning sleep in Nan s cushions I hope I did not wake anyone else said Nan Makes no difference about me of course laughed the jolly Dorothy Well I ll pay you back Nan Be careful I am bound to get even and Nan knew that some trick was in store for her as Dorothy had the reputation of being full of fun and always playing tricks The sun was up in real earnest now and the girls raised the window sash to let in the soft morning air I think this would really cure Nellie my little city friend said Nan and you don t know what a nice girl she is Just bring her down and I ll find out all about her said Dorothy I love city girls They are so wide awake and never say silly things like like some girls I know she finished giving her own cousin a good hug that belied the attempt at making fun of her Nellie is sensible Nan said and yet she knows how to laugh too She said she had never been in a carriage until she had a ride with us at Meadow Brook Think of that Wait till she sees my donkeys Dorothy finished gathering herself up from the cushions and preparing to leave Well Nannie dear I have had a lovely time and she made a mock social bow Come to see me some time and have some of my dawn only don t come before eleven A M or you might get mixed up for its awful dark in the blue room until that hour And like a real fairy Dorothy shook her golden hair and stooping low in myth fashion made a bee line across the hall She doesn t need any brother Nan thought as she saw Dorothy bolt in her door like a squirrel she is so jolly and funny But the girls were not the only ones who arose early that morning for Bert and his father came in to breakfast from a walk on the sands It s better than Meadow Brook Bert told Nan as she took her place at the table I wish Harry would come down It is so pleasant we want all our friends to enjoy it said missus Bobbsey But I m sure you have quite a hotel full now haven t you Dorothy Lots more rooms up near the roof replied Dorothy and it s a pity to waste them when there s plenty of ocean to spare Now Freddie went on Dorothy when we finish breakfast I am going to show you my donkeys I called one Doodle and the other Dandy because papa gave them to me on Decoration Day Why didn t you call one Uncle Sam asked Freddie remembering his part in the Meadow Brook parade Well I thought Doodle Dandy was near enough red white and blue said Dorothy The children finished breakfast rather suddenly and then made their way to the donkey barn Oh aren t they lovely exclaimed Nan patting the pretty gray animals I think they are prettier than horses they are not so tall I know all about goats and donkeys declared Freddie I know Nan likes everything early so we will give her an early ride proposed Dorothy The Bobbseys watched their cousin with interest as she fastened all the bright buckles and put the straps together harnessing the donkeys Bert helped so readily that he declared he would do all the harnessing thereafter The cart was one of those pretty little basket affairs with seats at the side and Bert was very proud of being able to drive a team There were Dorothy Nan Freddie Flossie and Bert in the cart when they rode along the sandy driveway and they made a very pretty party in their bright summer costumes Freddie had hold of Doodle s reins and he insisted that his horse went along better than did Dandy on the other side Oh won t Nellie enjoy this cried Nan thinking of the little city girl who had only had one carriage ride in all her life missus Manily is going up to the city to bring her to day said Bert Aunt Emily sent for the depot wagon just as we came out Like many people at the seashore the Minturns did not keep their own horses but simply had to telephone from their house to the livery stable when they wanted a carriage Oh I see the ocean called out Freddie as Bert drove nearer the noise of the waves Why didn t we bring Downy for his swim Too early to bathe yet said Dorothy We have a bathing house all to ourselves papa rented it for the summer and about eleven o clock we will come down and take a dip Mamma always comes with me or sends Susan our maid Mamma cannot believe I really know how to swim And do you asked Nan in surprise Wait until you see replied the cousin And I am going to teach you too I d love to know how but it must be awfully hard to learn answered Nan Not a bit went on Dorothy I learned in one week We have a pool just over there and lots of girls are learning every day You can drive right along the beach Bert the donkeys are much safer than horses and never attempt to run away How delightful it was to ride so close to the great rolling ocean Even Freddie stopped exclaiming and just watched the waves as one after another they tried to get right under Dorothy s cart It makes me almost afraid faltered little Flossie as the great big waves came up so high out on the waters they seemed like mountains that would surely cover up the donkey cart But when they broke on the sands they were only little splashy puddles for babies to wash their pink toes in There s Blanche Bowden said Dorothy as another little cart a pony cart came along We have lovely times together I have invited her up to meet us this afternoon Nan The other girl bowed pleasantly from her cart and even Freddie remembered to raise his cap something he did not always think necessary for just girls Some afternoon our dancing class is going to have a matinee said Dorothy Do you like dancing Bert Some replied her cousin in a boy s indifferent way Nan is a good dancer Oh we don t have real dances protested Nan they are mostly drills and exercises Mamma doesn t believe in young children going right into society She thinks we will be old soon enough We don t have grown up dances said Dorothy only the two step and minuet I think the minuet is the prettiest of all dances We have had the varsovienne said Nan that is like the minuet Mother says they are old time dances but they are new in our class We may have a costume affair next month went on Dorothy Some of the girls want it but I don t like wigs and long dresses especially for dancing I get all tangled up in a train dress I never wore one said Nan excepting at play and I can t see how any girl can dance with a lot of long skirts dangling around Oh they mostly bow and smile put in Bert and a boy has to be awfully careful at one of those affairs If he should step on a skirt there surely would be trouble and he snapped his whip at the donkeys with the air of one who had little regard for the graceful art of dancing We had better go back now said Dorothy presently You haven t had a chance to see our own place yet but I thought you wanted to get acquainted with the ocean first Everybody does I have enjoyed it so much declared Nan It is pleasanter now than when the sun grows hot But we need the sun for bathing Dorothy told her That is why we go in at the noon hour The drive back to the Cliff seemed very short and when the children drove up to the side porch they found missus Bobbsey and Aunt Emily sitting outside with their fancy work Freddie could hardly find words to tell his mother how big the ocean was and Flossie declared the water ran right into the sky it was so high Now girls said Aunt Emily missus Manily has gone to bring Nellie down so you must go and arrange her room I think the front room over Nan s will be best Now get out all your pretty things Dorothy for little Nellie may be lonely and want some things to look at All right mother answered Dorothy letting Bert put the donkeys away we ll make her room look like like a valentine she finished always getting some fun in even where very serious matters were concerned The two girls with Flossie looking on were soon very busy with Nellie s room We must not make it too fussy said Dorothy or Nellie may not feel at home and we certainly want her to enjoy herself Will we put a pink or blue set on the dresser Blue said Nan for I know she loves blue She said so when we picked violets at Meadow Brook All right agreed Dorothy And say Let s fix up something funny We ll get all the alarm clocks in the house and set them so they will go off one after the other just when Nellie gets to bed say about nine o clock We ll hide them so she will just about find one when the other starts She isn t really sick is she Dorothy asked suddenly remembering that the visitor might not be in as good spirits as she herself was Oh no only run down answered Nan and I m sure she would enjoy the joke So the girls went on fixing up the pretty little room Nan ran downstairs and brought up Nettie Prentice s flowers I thought they would do someone good she said They are so fragrant Aren t they Dorothy said burying her pretty nose in the white lilies They smell better than florists bouquets I suppose that s from the country air Now I ll go collect clocks and without asking anyone s permission Dorothy went from room to room snatching alarm clocks from every dresser that held one Susan s is a peach she told Nan apologizing with a smile for the slang It goes off for fifteen minutes if you don t stop it and it sounds like a church bell Nellie will think she has gotten into college Nan said laughing This is like hazing isn t it Only we won t really annoy her said Dorothy We just want to make her laugh College boys they say do all sorts of mean things Make a boy swim in an icy river and all that I hope Bert never goes to a school where they do hazing said Nan feeling for her brother s safety I think such sport is just wicked So do I declared Dorothy and if I were a new fellow and they played such tricks on me I would just wait for years if I had to to pay them back I d put medicine in their coffee or do something They ought to be arrested Nan said and if the professors can t stop it they should not be allowed to run such schools There said Dorothy I guess everything is all right for Nellie She put a rose jar on a table in the alcove window Now I ll wind the clocks You mustn t look where I put them and she insisted that not even Nan should know the mystery of the clocks This will be a real surprise party finished Dorothy having put each of five clocks in its hiding place and leaving the tick ticks to think it over all by themselves before going off CHAPTER VII NELLIE Shall I take my cart over to meet Nellie and missus Manily mother Dorothy asked missus Minturn that afternoon when the city train was about due Why yes daughter I think that would be very nice replied the mother I intended to send the depot wagon but the cart would be very enjoyable Bert had the donkeys hitched up and at the door for Nan and Dorothy in a very few minutes and within a half hour from that time Nan was greeting Nellie at the station and making her acquainted with Dorothy If Dorothy had expected to find in the little cash girl a poor sickly ill child she must have been disappointed for the girl that came with missus Manily had none of these failings She was tall and graceful very pale but nicely dressed thanks to missus Manily s attention after she reached the city on the morning train With a gift from missus Bobbsey Nellie was fitted up from head to foot and now looked quite as refined a little girl as might be met anywhere You were so kind to invite me Nellie said to Dorothy as she took her seat in the cart This is such a lovely place and she nodded toward the wonderful ocean without giving a hint that she had never before seen it Yes you are sure the air is so strong you must swallow strength all the time and Nellie knew from the remark that Dorothy was a jolly girl and would not talk sickness like the people who visit poor children at hospital tents Even missus Manily who knew Nellie to be a capable girl was surprised at the way she fell in with Nan and Dorothy and missus Manily was quite charmed with her quiet reserved manner The fact was that Nellie had met so many strangers in the big department store she was entirely at ease and accustomed to the little polite sayings of people in the fashionable world When Nellie unpacked her bag she brought out something for Freddie It was a little milk wagon with real cans which Freddie could fill up with milk and deliver to customers That is to make you think of Meadow Brook said Nellie when she gave him the little wagon Yes and when there s a fire answered Freddie I can fill the cans with water and dump it on the fire like they do in Meadow Brook too Freddie always insisted on being a fireman and had a great idea of putting fires out and climbing ladders There was still an hour to spare before dinner and Nan proposed that they take a walk down to the beach Nellie went along of course but when they got to the great stretch of white sand near the waves the girls noticed Nellie was about to cry Maybe she is too tired Nan whispered to Dorothy as they made some excuse to go back home again All along the way Nellie was very quiet almost in tears and the other girls were disappointed for they had expected her to enjoy the ocean so much As soon as they reached home Nellie went to her room and Nan and Dorothy told missus Minturn about their friend s sudden sadness missus Minturn of course went up to see if she could do anything for Nellie There she found the little stranger crying as if her heart would break Oh I can t help it missus Minturn she sobbed It was the ocean Father must be somewhere in that big wild sea and again she cried almost hysterically Tell me about it dear said missus Minturn with her arm around the child Was your father drowned at sea Oh no that is we hope he wasn t said Nellie through her tears but sometimes we feel he must be dead or he would write to poor mother Now dry your tears dear or you will have a headache said missus Minturn and Nellie soon recovered her composure You see she began we had such a nice home and father was always so good But a man came and asked him to go to sea The man said they would make lots of money in a short time This man was a great friend of father and he said he needed someone he could trust on this voyage First father said no but when he talked it over with mother they thought it would be best to go if they could get so much money in a short time so he went Here Nellie stopped again and her dark eyes tried hard to keep back the tears When was that missus Minturn asked A year ago Nellie replied and he was only to be away six months at the most And that was why you had to leave school wasn t it missus Minturn questioned further Yes we had not much money saved and mother got sick from worrying so I did not mind going to work I m going back to the store again as soon as the doctor says I can and the little girl showed how anxious she was to help her mother But your father may come back said missus Minturn sailors are often out drifting about for months and come in finally I would not be discouraged you cannot tell what day your father may come back with all the money and even more than he expected Oh I know said Nellie I won t feel like that again It was only because it was the first time I saw the ocean I m never homesick or blue I don t believe in making people pity you all the time And the brave little girl jumped up dried her eyes and looked as if she would never cry again as long as she lived like one who had cried it out and done with it Yes you must have a good time with the girls said missus Minturn I guess you need fun more than any medicine That evening at dinner Nellie was her bright happy self again and the three girls chatted merrily about all the good times they would have at the seashore There was a ride to the depot after dinner for missus Manily insisted that she had to leave for the city that evening and after a game of ball on the lawn in which everybody even Flossie and Freddie had a hand the children prepared to retire There was to be a shell hunt very early in the morning that was a long walk on the beach looking for choice shells so the girls wanted to go to bed an hour before the usual time Wait till the clock strikes Nellie sang Dorothy as they went upstairs and of course no one but Nan knew what she meant Two hours after this the house was all quiet when suddenly there was the buzz of an alarm clock What was that asked missus Minturn coming out in the hall An alarm clock called Nellie in whose room the disturbance was I found it under my pillow she added innocently never suspecting that Dorothy had put it there purposely By and by everything was quiet again when another gong went off Well I declare said missus Minturn I do believe Dorothy has been up to some pranks Ding a ling a long a ling went the clock and Nellie was laughing outright as she searched about the room for the newest alarm She had a good hunt too for the clock was in the shoe box in the farthest corner of the room After that there was quite an intermission as Dorothy expressed it Even Nellie had stopped laughing and felt very sleepy when another clock started This was the big gong that belonged in Susan s room and at the sound of it Freddie rushed out in the hall yelling That s a fire bell Fire fire fire he shouted while everybody else came out this time to investigate the disturbance Now Dorothy said missus Minturn I know you have done this Where did you put those clocks Dorothy only laughed in reply for the big bell was ringing furiously all the time Nellie had her dressing robe on and opened the door to those outside her room I guess it s ghosts she laughed They are all over A serenade called Bert from his door What ails dem der clocks shouted Dinah Pears like as if dey had a fit suah Nebber heard such clockin since we was in de country and Susan who had discovered the loss of her clock laughed heartily knowing very well who had taken the alarm away When the fifteen minutes were up that clock stopped and another started Then there was a regularly cannonading Bert said for there was scarcely a moment s quiet until every one of the six clocks had gone off bing bang biff as Freddie said There was no use trying to locate them for they went off so rapidly that Nellie knew they would go until they were all done so she just sat down and waited Think you ll wake up in time asked Dorothy full of mischief as she came into the clock corner I guess so Nellie answered laughing We surely were alarmed to night Then aside to Nan Nellie whispered Wait we ll get even with her won t we And Nan nodded with a sparkle in her eyes CHAPTER VIII EXPLORING A RACE FOR POND LILIES Now let s explore Bert said to the girls the next morning We haven t had a chance yet to see the lake the woods or the island Hal Bingham is coming over to see you this morning Dorothy told Bert He said you must be tired toting girls around and he knows everything interesting around here to show you Glad of it said Bert You girls are very nice of course but a boy needs another fellow in a place like this and he swung himself over the rail of the veranda instead of walking down the steps It was quite early for there was so much planned to be accomplished before the sun got too hot that all the children kept to their promise to get up early and be ready for the day s fun by seven o clock The girls with missus Bobbsey missus Minturn and Freddie were to go shell hunting but as Bert had taken that trip with his father on the first morning after their arrival he preferred to look over the woods and lake at the back of the Minturn home where the land slid down from the rough cliff upon which the house stood Here comes Hal now called Dorothy as a boy came whistling up the path He was taller than Bert but not much older and he had a very jolly squint in his black eyes that is Dorothy called it a jolly squint but other people said it was merely a twinkle But all agreed that Hal was a real boy the greatest compliment that could be paid him There was not much need of an introduction although Dorothy did call down from the porch Bert that s Hal Hal that s Bert to which announcement the boys called back All right Dorothy We ll get along Have you been on the lake yet Hal asked as they started down the green stretch that bounded the pretty lake on one side while a strip of woodland pressed close to the edge across the sheet of water No Bert answered we have had so much coming and going to the depot since we came down I couldn t get a chance to look around much It s an awfully pretty lake isn t it Yes and it runs in and out for miles Hal replied I have a canoe down here at our boathouse Let s take a sail The Bingham property like the Minturn was on a cliff at the front and ran back to the lake where the little boathouse was situated The house was made of cedars bound together in rustic fashion and had comfortable seats inside for ladies to keep out of the sun while waiting for a sail Father and I built this house Hal told Bert We were waiting so long for the carpenters we finally got a man to bring these cedars in from Oakland Then we had him cut them that is the line of uprights and we built the boathouse without any trouble at all It was sport to arrange all the little turns and twists like building a block house in the nursery You certainly made a good job of it said Bert looking critically over the boathouse It s all in the design of course the nailing together is the easiest part You might think so said Hal but it s hard to drive a nail in round cedar But we thought it so interesting we didn t mind the trouble finished Hal as he prepared to untie his canoe What a pretty boat exclaimed Bert in real admiration The canoe was green and brown the body being colored like bark while inside the lining was of pale green The name Dorothy shone in rustic letters just above the water edge And you called it Dorothy Bert remarked Yes she s the liveliest girl I know and a good friend of mine all summer said Hal There are some boys down the avenue but they don t know as much about good times as Dorothy does Why she can swim row paddle climb trees and goes in for almost any sport that s on Last week she swam so far in the sun she couldn t touch an oar or paddle for days her arms were so blistered But she didn t go around with her hands in a muff at that Dorothy s all right finished Hal Bert liked to hear his cousin complimented especially when he had such admiration himself for the girl who never pouted and he knew that the tribute did not in any way take from Dorothy s other good quality that of being a refined and cultured girl Girls don t have to be babies to be ladylike added Bert Nan always plays ball with me and can skate and all that She s not afraid of a snowball either Well I m all alone said Hal Haven t even got a first cousin We ve been coming down here since I was a youngster so that s why Dorothy seems like my sister We used to make mud pies together The boys were in the canoe now and each took a paddle The water was so smooth that the paddles merely patted it like brushing a cat s back Bert said and soon the little bark was gliding along down the lake in and out of the turns until the narrows were reached Here s where we get our pond lilies said Hal Oh let s get some exclaimed Bert Mother is so fond of them It was not difficult to gather the beautiful blooms that nested so cosily on the cool waters too fond of their cradle to ever want to creep or walk upon their slender green limbs They just rocked there with every tiny ripple of the water and only woke up to see the warm sunlight bleaching their dainty yellow heads Aren t they fragrant said Bert as he put one after the other into the bottom of the canoe There s nothing like them declared Hal Some people like roses best but give me the pretty pond lilies he finished The morning passed quickly for there was so much to see around the lake Wild ducks tried to find out how near they could go to the water without touching it and occasionally one would splash in by accident What large birds there are around the sea Bert remarked I suppose they have to be big and strong to stand long trips without food when the waves are very rough and they can hardly see fish Yes and they have such fine plumage said Hal I ve seen birds around here just like those in museums all colors and with all kinds of feathers Birds of Paradise I guess they call them Do you ever go shooting No not in summer time replied Hal But sometimes father and I take a run down here about Thanksgiving That s the time for seaside sport Why last year we fished with rakes just raked the fish up in piles frosties they call them That must be fun reflected Bert Maybe you could come this year continued Hal We might make up a party if you have school vacation for a week We could camp out in our house and get our meals at the hotel That would be fine exclaimed Bert Maybe Uncle William would come and perhaps my Cousin Harry from Meadow Brook He loves that sort of sport By the way we expect him down for a few days perhaps next week Good cried Hal The boat carnival is on next week I m sure he would enjoy that The boys were back at the boathouse now and Bert gathered up his pond lilies There ll be a scramble for them when the girls see them he said Nellie McLaughlin next to Dorothy is out for fun She is not a bit like a sick girl Perhaps she isn t sick now said Hal but has to be careful She seems quite thin Mother says she wants fun more than medicine went on Bert I guess she had to go to work because her father is away at sea He s been gone a year and he only expected to be away six months So is my Uncle George remarked Hal He went to the West Indies to bring back a valuable cargo of wood He had only a small vessel and a few men Say did you say her name was McLaughlin exclaimed Hal suddenly Yes they call him Mack for short but his name is McLaughlin Why that was the name of the man who went with Uncle George declared Hal Maybe it was her father Sounds like it Bert said Tell Uncle William about it sometime I wouldn t mention it to Nellie she cut up so they said the first time she saw the ocean Poor thing I suppose she just imagined her father was tossing about in the waves The boys had tied the canoe to its post and now made their way up over the hill toward the house Here they come said Bert as Nan Nellie and Dorothy came racing down the hill Oh cried Dorothy give me some Oh you know me Bert pleaded Nellie Hal I wound up your kite string didn t I insisted Nan by way of showing that she surely deserved some of Hal s pond lilies And I found your ball in the bushes Bert urged Dorothy They re not for little girls Hal said waving his hand comically like a duke in a comic opera Run along little girls run along he said rolling his r s in real stage fashion and holding the pond lilies against his heart But if we get them may we have them sir knight asked Dorothy keeping up the joke You surely can replied Hal running short on his stage words At this Nellie dashed into the path ahead of Hal and Dorothy turned toward Bert Nan crowded in close to Dorothy and the boys had some dodging to get a start Finally Hal shot out back of the big bush and Nellie darted after him Of course the boys were better runners than the girls but somehow girls always expect something wonderful to happen when they start on a race like that Hal had tennis slippers on and he went like a deer But just as he was about to call home free and as he reached the donkey barn he turned on his ankle Nellie had her hands on the pond lilies instantly for Hal was obliged to stop and nurse his ankle They re yours he gave in handing her the beautiful bunch of blooms Oh aren t they lovely exclaimed the little cash girl but no one knew that was the first time she ever in all her life held a pond lily in her hand I m going to give them to missus Bobbsey she decided starting at once to the house with the fragrant prize in her arms Neither Dorothy nor Nan had caught Bert but he handed his flowers to his cousin Give them to Aunt Emily he said gallantly while Dorothy took the bouquet and declared she could have caught Bert anyhow if she only had a few more feet whatever that meant CHAPTER IX FUN ON THE SANDS How many shells did you get in your hunt Bert asked the girls when the excitement over the pond lilies had died away We never went replied Dorothy First Freddie fell down and had to cry awhile then he had to stop to see the gutter band next he had a ride on the five cent donkey and by that time there were so many people out mother said there would not be a pretty shell left so we decided to go to morrow morning Then Hal and I will go along said Bert I want to look for nets to put in my den at home We are going for a swim now went on Dorothy we only came back for our suits There seems so much to do down here it will take a week to have a try at everything said Bert I ve only been in the water once but I m going for a good swim now Come along Hal Yes we always go before lunch said Hal starting off for his suit Soon Dorothy Nan Nellie and Flossie appeared with their suits done up in the neat little rubber bags that Aunt Emily had bought at a hospital fair Then Freddie came with missus Bobbsey and Dorothy with her bag on a stick over her shoulder led the procession to the beach As Dorothy told Nan they had a comfortable bathhouse rented for the season with plenty of hooks to hang things on besides a mirror to see how one s hair looked after the waves had done it up mermaid fashion It did not take the girls long to get ready and presently all appeared on the beach in pretty blue and white suits with the large white sailor collars that always make bathing suits look just right because real sailors wear that shape of collar Flossie wore a white flannel suit and with her pretty yellow curls she looked like a doll so Nellie said Freddie s suit was white too as he always had things as near like his twin sister s as a boy s clothes could be Altogether the party made a pretty summer picture as they ran down to the waves and promptly dipped in Put your head under or you ll take cold called Dorothy as she emerged from a big wave that had completely covered her up Nellie and Nan ducked under but Flossie was a little timid and held her mother s right hand even tighter than Freddie clung to her left We must get hold of the ropes declared missus Bobbsey seeing a big wave coming They just reached the ropes when the wave caught them Nellie and Nan were out farther and the billow struck Nellie with such force it actually washed her up on shore Ha ha laughed Dorothy Nellie got the first tumble And then the waves kept dashing in so quickly that there was no more chance for conversation Freddie ducked under as every wave came but Flossie was not always quick enough and it was very hard for her to keep hold of the ropes when a big splasher dashed against her Dorothy had not permission to swim out as far as she wanted to go for her mother did not allow her outside the lines excepting when mister Minturn was swimming near her so she had to be content with floating around near where the other girls bounced up and down like the bubbles on the billows Look out Nan called Dorothy suddenly as Nan stood for a moment fixing her belt But the warning came too late for the next minute a wave picked Nan up and tossed her with such force against a pier that everybody thought she must be hurt missus Bobbsey was quite frightened and ran out on the beach putting Freddie and Flossie at a safe distance from the water while she made her way to where Nan had been tossed For a minute or so it seemed Nan disappeared but presently she bobbed up out of breath but laughing for Hal had her by the hand and was helping her to shore The boys had been swimming around by themselves near by and Hal saw the wave making for Nan just in time to get there first I had to swim that time laughed Nan whether I knew how or not You made a pretty good attempt Hal told her and the water is very deep around those piles You had better not go out so far again until you ve learned a few strokes in the pools Get Dorothy to teach you Oh oh oh Nellie screamed missus Bobbsey Where is she She has gone under that wave Sure enough Nellie had disappeared She had only let go the ropes one minute but she had her back to the ocean watching Nan s rescue when a big billow struck her knocked her down and then where was she Oh cried Freddie She is surely drowned Hal struck out toward where Nellie had been last seen but he had only gone a few strokes when Bert appeared with Nellie under his arm She had received just the same kind of toss Nan got and fortunately Bert was just as near by to save her as Hal had been to save Nan Nellie too was laughing and out of breath when Bert towed her in I felt like a rubber ball she said as soon as she could speak and Bert caught me on the first bounce You girls should have ropes around your waists and get someone to hold the other end teased Dorothy coming out with the others on the sands Well I think we have all had enough of the water for this morning said missus Bobbsey too nervous to let the girls go in again Boys and girls were willing to take a sun bath on the beach so while Hal and Bert started in to build a sand house for Freddie the four girls capered around playing tag and enjoying themselves generally Flossie thought it great fun to dig for the little soft crabs that hide in the deep damp sand She found a pasteboard box and into this she put all her fish I ve got a whole dozen she called to Freddie presently But Freddie was so busy with his sand castle he didn t have time to bother with baby crabs Look at our fort called Bert to the girls We can shoot right through our battlements he declared as he sank down in the sand and looked out through the holes in the sand fort Shoot the Indian and you get a cigar called Dorothy taking her place as Indian in front of the fort and playing target for the boys First Hal tossed a pebble through a window in the fort then Bert tried it but neither stone went anywhere near Dorothy the Indian Now my turn she claimed squatting down back of the sand wall and taking aim at Hal who stood out front And if she didn t hit him just on the foot with a little white pebble Hurrah for our sharpshooter cried Bert Of course the hard part of the trick was to toss a pebble through the window without knocking down the wall but Dorothy stood to one side and swung her arm so that the stone went straight through and reached Hal who stood ten feet away I m next said Nellie taking her place behind the guns Nellie swung her arm and down came the fort Oh my called Freddie you ve knocked down the whole gun wall You ll have to be Court martialed said Hal helping Freddie out with his war terms She s a prisoner of war announced Bert getting hold of Nellie who dropped her head and acted like someone in real distress Just as if it were all true Nan and Dorothy stood by wringing their hands in horror while the boys brought the poor prisoner to the frontier bound her hands with a piece of cord and stood her up against an abandoned umbrella pole Hal acted as judge Have you anything to say why sentence should not be pronounced upon you he asked in a severe voice I have sighed Nellie I did not intend to betray my country The enemy caused the the downfall of Quebec she stammered just because the name of that place happened to come to her lips Who is her counsel asked the Judge Your honor spoke up Dorothy this soldier has done good service She has pegged stones at your honor with good effect she has even captured a company of wild pond lilies in your very ranks and now your honor I plead for mercy The play of the children had by this time attracted quite a crowd for the bathing hour was over and idlers tarried about Fair play called a strange boy in the crowd taking up the spirit of fun That soldier has done good service She took a sassy little crab out of my ear this very day Freddie looked on as if it were all true Flossie did not laugh a bit but really seemed quite frightened I move that sentence be pronounced called Bert being on the side of the prosecution The prisoner will look this way commanded Hal Nellie tossed back her wet brown curls and faced the crowd The sentence of the court is that the prisoner be transported for life announced Hal while four boys fell in around Nellie and she silently marched in military fashion toward the bathing pavilion with Dorothy and Nan at her heels Here the war game ended and everyone was satisfied with that day s fun on the sands CHAPTER X THE SHELL HUNT Now all ready for the hunting expedition called Uncle William very early the next morning he having taken a day away from his office in the city to enjoy himself with the Bobbseys at the seashore It was to be a long journey so Aunt Emily thought it wise to take the donkey cart so that the weary travelers as they fell by the wayside might be put in the cart until refreshed Besides the shells and things could be brought home in the cart Freddie expected to capture a real sea serpent and Dorothy declared she would bring back a whale Nellie had an idea she would find something valuable maybe a diamond that some fish had swallowed in mistake for a lump of sugar at the bottom of the sea So with pleasant expectations the party started off Bert and Hal acting as guides and leading the way If you feel like climbing down the rocks here we can walk all along the edge said Hal But be careful he cautioned the rocks are awfully slippery Dorothy will have to go on ahead down the road with the donkeys and we can meet her at the Point Freddie and Flossie went along with Dorothy as the descent was considered too dangerous for the little ones Dorothy let Freddie drive to make up for the fun the others had sliding down the rocks Uncle Daniel started down the cliffs first and close behind him came missus Bobbsey and Aunt Emily Nan and Nellie took another path if a small strip of jagged rock could be called a path while Hal and Bert scaled down over the very roughest part it seemed to the girls Oh mercy called Nan as a rock slipped from under her foot and she promptly slipped after it Nellie give me your hand or I ll slide into the ocean Nellie tried to cross over to Nan but in doing so she lost her footing and fell then turned over twice and only stopped as she came in contact with Uncle William s heels Are you hurt everybody asked at once but Nellie promptly jumped up showing the toss had not injured her in the least I thought I was going to get an unexpected bath that time she said laughing only for mister Minturn interfering I saw a star in each heel of his shoe she declared and I was never before glad to bump my nose Without further accident the party reached the sands and saw Dorothy and the little ones a short distance away Freddie had already filled his cap with little shells and Flossie was busy selecting some of the finest from a collection she had made Let s dig said Hal to Bert There are all sorts of mussels crabs clams and oysters around here The fisheries are just above that point So the boys began searching in the wet sand now and then bringing up a fairy crab or a baby clam Here s an oyster called Nellie coming up with the shellfish in her hand It was a large oyster and had been washed quite clean by the noisy waves Let s open it said Hal Shall I Nellie Yes if you want to replied the girl indifferently for she did not care about the little morsel Hal opened it easily with his knife and then he asked who was hungry Oh see here he called suddenly What this It looks like a pearl Let me see said mister Minturn taking the little shell in his hand and turning out the oyster Yes that surely is a pearl Now Nellie you have a prize Sometimes these little pearls are quite valuable At any rate you can have it set in a ring declared mister Minturn Oh let me see pleaded Dorothy I ve always looked for pearls and never could find one How lucky you are Nellie It s worth some money Maybe it isn t a pearl at all objected Nellie hardly believing that anything of value could be picked up so easily Yes it is declared mister Minturn I ve seen that kind before I ll take care of it for you and find out what it is worth and he very carefully sealed the tiny speck in an envelope which he put in his pocketbook After that everybody wanted to dig for oysters but it seemed the one that Nellie found had been washed in somehow for the oyster beds were out in deeper water Yet every time Freddie found a clam or a mussel he wanted it opened to look for pearls Let us get a box of very small shells and we can string them for necklaces suggested Nan We can keep them for Christmas gifts too if we string them well Oh I ve got enough for beads and bracelets declared Flossie for indeed she had lost no time in filling her box with the prettiest shells to be found on the sands Oh I see a net called Bert running toward a lot of driftwood in which an old net was tangled Bert soon disentangled it and it proved to be a large piece of seine the kind that is often used to decorate walls in libraries Just what I wanted he declared And smell the salt I will always have the ocean in my room now for I can close my eyes and smell the salt water It is a good piece declared Hal You were lucky to find it Those sell for a couple of dollars to art dealers Well I won t sell mine at any price Bert said I ve been wishing for a net to put back of my swords and Indian arrows They make a fine decoration The grown folks had come up now and all agreed the seine was a very pretty one Well I declare said Uncle William I have often looked for a piece of net and never could get that kind You and Nellie were the lucky ones to day Oh oh oh screamed Freddie What s that and before he had a chance to think he ran down to the edge of the water to meet a big barrel that had been washed in Look out screamed Bert but Freddie was looking in and at that moment the water washed in right over Freddie s shoes stockings and all Oh screamed everybody in chorus for the next instant a stronger wave came in and knocked Freddie down Quick as a flash Dorothy who was nearest the edge jumped in after Freddie for as the wave receded the little boy fell in again and might have been washed out into real danger if he had not been promptly rescued But as it was he was dripping wet even his curls had been washed and his linen suit looked just like one of Dinah s dish towels Dorothy too was wet to the knees but she did not mind that The day was warming up and she could get along without shoes or stockings until she reached home Freddie s always fallin in gasped Flossie who was always getting frightened at her twin brother s accidents Well I get out don t I pouted Freddie not feeling very happy in his wet clothing Now we must hurry home insisted missus Bobbsey as she put Freddie in the donkey cart while Dorothy after pulling off her wet shoes and stockings put a robe over her feet whipped up the donkeys Doodle and Dandy and with Freddie and Flossie in the seat of the cart the shells and net in the bottom started off towards the cliffs there to fix Freddie up in dry clothing Of course he was not wet to the skin as he said but his shoes and stockings were soaked and his waist was wet and that was enough Five minutes later Dorothy pulled up the donkeys at the kitchen door where Dinah took Freddie in her arms and soon after fixed him up You is de greatest boy for fallin in she declared Nebber saw sech a faller But all de same you se Dinah s baby boy and kind hearted Dinah rubbed Freddie s feet well so he would not take cold then with fresh clothing she made him just as comfortable and happy as he had been when he had started out shell hunting CHAPTER XI DOWNY ON THE OCEAN Harry is coming to day Bert told Freddie on the morning following the shell hunt and maybe Aunt Sarah will come with him I m going to get the cart now to drive over to the station You may come along Freddie mother said so Get your cap and hurry up and Bert rushed off to the donkey barn to put Doodle and Dandy in harness Freddie was with Bert as quickly as he could grab his cap off the rack and the two brothers promptly started for the station I hope they bring peaches Freddie said thinking of the beautiful peaches in the Meadow Brook orchard that had not been quite ripe when the Bobbseys left the country for the seaside Numbers of people were crowded around the station when the boys got there as the summer season was fast waning so that Bert and Freddie had hard work to get a place near the platform for their cart That s the train cried Bert Now watch out so that we don t miss them in the crowd and the older brother jumped out of the cart to watch the faces as they passed along There he is cried Freddie clapping his hands Harry Harry Aunt Sarah he called until everybody around the station was looking at him Here we are exclaimed Aunt Sarah the next minute having heard Freddie s voice and followed it to the cart I m so glad you came declared Bert to Harry And I m awfully glad you came Freddie told Aunt Sarah when she stopped kissing him But we cannot ride in that little cart Aunt Sarah said as Bert offered to help her in Oh yes you can Bert assured her These donkeys are very strong and so is the cart Put your satchel right in here and he shoved the valise up in front under the seat But we have a basket of peaches somewhere said Aunt Sarah They came in the baggage car Oh goody goody cried Freddie clapping his little brown hands Let s get them No we had better have them sent over Bert insisted knowing that the basket would take up too much room also that Freddie might want to sample the peaches first and so make trouble in the small cart Much against his will the little fellow left the peaches and started off for the cliffs The girls Dorothy Nellie and Nan were waiting at the driveway and all shouted a welcome to the people from Meadow Brook You just came in time declared Dorothy We are going to have a boat carnival tomorrow and they expect it will be lovely this year Aunt Emily and missus Bobbsey met the others now and extended such a hearty welcome there could be no mistaking how pleased they all were to see Harry and Aunt Sarah As soon as Harry had a chance to lay his traveling things aside Bert and Freddie began showing him around Come on down to the lake first Bert insisted Hal Bingham may have his canoe out He s a fine fellow and we have splendid times together And you ll see my duck Downy said Freddie Oh he s growed so big he s just like a turkey Harry thought Downy must be a queer duck if he looked that way but of course he did not question Freddie s description Here Downy Downy called Freddie as they came to the little stream where the duck always swam around But there was no duck to be seen Where is he Freddie asked anxiously Maybe back of some stones ventured Harry Then he and Bert joined in the search but no duck was to be found That s strange Bert reflected He s always around here Where does the lake run to Harry inquired Into the ocean answered Bert but Downy never goes far There s Hal now We ll get in his boat and see if we can find the duck Hal seeing his friends rowed in to the shore with his father s new rowboat that he was just trying We have lost Freddie s duck said Bert Have you seen him anywhere No I just came out replied Hal But get in and we ll go look for him This is my Cousin Harry I told you about said Bert introducing Harry and the two boys greeted each other cordially All four got into the boat and Harry took care of Freddie while the other boys rowed Oh I m afraid someone has stoled Downy cried Freddie and maybe they ll make make pudding out of him No danger said Hal laughing No one around here would touch your duck But he might have gotten curious to see the ocean He certainly doesn t seem to be around here The boys had reached the line where the little lake went in a tunnel under a road and then opened out into the ocean We ll have to leave the boat here said Hal and go and ask people if Downy came down this way Tying up the boat to a stake the boys crossed the bridge and made their way through the crowd of bathers down to the waves Oh oh screamed Freddie I see him There he is and sure enough there was Downy like a tiny speck rolling up and down on the waves evidently having a fine swim and not being in the least alarmed at the mountains of water that came rolling in Oh how can we get him cried Freddie nearly running into the water in his excitement I don t know Hal admitted He s pretty far out Just then a life saver came along Freddie always insisted the life guards were not white people because they were so awfully browned from the sun and really this one looked like some foreigner for he was almost black What s the trouble he asked seeing Freddie s distress Oh Downy is gone cried the little fellow in tears now Gone exclaimed the guard thinking Downy was some boy who had swam out too far Yes see him out there sobbed Freddie and before the other boys had a chance to tell the guard that Downy was only a duck the life saver was in his boat and pulling out toward the spot where Freddie said Downy was downing There s someone drowning went up the cry all around Then numbers of men and boys who had been bathing plunged into the waves and followed the life saver out to the deeper water It was useless for Harry Hal or Bert to try to explain to anyone about the duck for the action of the life saver told a different story Another guard had come down to the beach now and was getting his ropes ready besides opening up the emergency case that was locked in the boat on the shore Wait till they find out whispered Hal to Bert watching the guard in the boat nearing the white speck on the waves It was a long ways out but the boys could see the guard stop rowing He s got him shouted the crowd also seeing the guard pick something out of the water I guess he had to lay him in the bottom of the boat Maybe he s dead the people said still believing the life saver had been after some unfortunate swimmer Oh he s got him He s got him cried Freddie joyfully still keeping up the mistake for the sightseers As the guard in the boat had his back to shore and pulled in that way even his companion on land had not yet discovered his mistake and he waited to help revive whoever lay in the bottom of the boat The crowd pressed around so closely now that Freddie s toes were painfully trampled upon He s mine cried the little fellow Let me have him It s his brother whispered a sympathetic boy almost in tears Let him get over by the boat and so the crowd made room for Freddie as the life saver pulled up on the beach The people held their breath He s dead insisted a number when there was no move in the bottom of the boat Then the guard stooped down and brought up Downy Only a duck screamed all the boys in the crowd while the other life saver laughed heartily over his preparations to restore a duck to consciousness He s mine He s mine insisted Freddie as the life saver fondled the pretty white duck and the crowd cheered Yes he does belong to my little brother Bert said and he didn t mean to fool you at all It was just a mistake the older brother apologized Oh I know that laughed the guard But when we think there is any danger we don t wait for particulars He s a very pretty duck all the same and a fine swimmer and I m glad I got him for the little fellow for likely he would have kept on straight out to smooth water Then he would never have tried to get back The guard now handed Downy over to his young owner and without further remarks than Thank you Freddie started off through the crowd while everybody wanted to see the wonderful duck The joke caused no end of fun and it took Harry Hal and Bert to save Freddie and Downy from being too roughly treated by the boys who were over curious to see both the wonderful duck and the happy owner CHAPTER XII REAL INDIANS Now we will have to watch Downy or he will be sure to take that trip again said Bert as they reached home with the enterprising duck We could build a kind of dam across the narrowest part of the lake suggested Hal kind of a close fence he would not go through See over there it is only a little stream about five feet wide We can easily fence that up I ve got lots of material up in our garden house That would be a good idea agreed Bert We can put Downy in the barn until we get it built We won t take any more chances So Downy was shut up in his box back of the donkey stall for the rest of the day How far back do these woods run Harry asked his companions he always being interested in acres as all real country boys are I don t know Hal Bingham answered I never felt like going to the end to find out But they say the Indians had reservations out here not many years ago Then I ll bet there are lots of arrow heads and stone hatchets around Let s go look Have we time before dinner Bert Harry asked I guess so replied the cousin Uncle William s train does not get in until seven and we can be back by that time We ll have to slip away from Freddie though Here he comes Hide and at this the boys got behind things near the donkey house and Freddie after calling and looking around went back to the house without finding the boy boys We can cross the lake in my boat said Hal as they left their hiding places Then we will be right in the woods I ll tie the boat on the other side until we come back no one will touch it Is there no bridge Harry asked Not nearer than the crossings away down near the ocean beach said Bert But the boat will be all right There are no thieves around here It was but a few minutes work to paddle across the lake and tie up the canoe on the opposite shore Hal and Bert started off feeling they would find something interesting under Harry s leadership It was quite late in the afternoon and the thick pines and ferns made the day almost like night as the boys tramped along Fine big birds around here remarked Harry as the feathered creatures of the ocean darted through the trees making their way to the lake s edge Yes we re planning for a Thanksgiving shoot Hal told him We hope if we make it up you can come down I d like to first rate said Harry Hello he suddenly exclaimed I thought I kicked over a stone hatchet head Instantly the three boys were on their knees searching through the brown pine needles There it is declared Harry picking up a queer shaped stone That s real Indian I know Father has some but this is the first I was ever lucky enough to find The boys examined the stone There were queer marks on it but they were so worn down it was impossible to tell what they might mean What tribe camped here asked Harry I don t know answered Hal I just heard an old farmer out Berkley way talking about the Indians You see we only come down here in the summer time Then we keep so close to the ocean we don t do much exploring The boys were so interested now they did not notice how dark it was getting Neither did they notice the turns they were making in the deep woodlands Now and then a new stone would attract their attention They would kick it over pick it up and if it were of queer shape it would be pocketed for further inspection Say said Hal suddenly doesn t it look like night and at that he ran to a clear spot between the trees where he might see the sky Sure as you live it is night he called back to the others We better pick the trail back to our canoe or we may have to become real Indians and camp out here in spite of our appetites Then the boys discovered that the trees were much alike and there were absolutely no paths to follow Well there s where the sun went down so we must turn our back to that advised Hal as they tramped about without making any progress toward finding the way home What at first seemed to be fun soon turned out to be a serious matter for the boys really could not find their way home Each in turn thought he had the right way but soon found he was mistaken Well I ll give up said Hal To think we could be lost like three babies Only worse added Harry for little fellows would cry and someone might help them Oh oh oh oh we re lost We re the babes in the woods shouted Bert at the top of his voice joking yet a little in earnest Let s build a fire suggested Harry That s the way the Indians used to do When our comrades see the smoke of the fire they will come and rescue us The other boys agreed to follow the chief s direction So they set to work It took some time to get wood together and to start the fire but when it was finally lighted they sat around it and wasted a lot of time It would have been better had they tried to get out of the woods for as they waited it grew darker I wouldn t mind staying here all night drawled Harry stretching himself out on the dry leaves alongside the fire Well I d like supper first put in Hal We were to have roast duck to night and he smacked his lips What was that Harry exclaimed jumping up A bell I thought whispered Hal quite frightened Indians added Bert Oh take me home he wailed and while he tried to laugh it was a failure for he really felt more like crying There it is again A cow bell declared Harry who could not be mistaken on bells Let s find the cow and maybe she will then find us he suggested starting off in the direction that the tink tink tink tink came from Here she is he called the next moment as he walked up to a pretty little cow with the bell on her neck Now where do you belong Harry asked the cow Do you know where the Cliffs are and how we can get home The cow was evidently hungry for her supper and bellowed loud and long Then she rubbed her head against Harry s sleeve and started to walk through the dark woods If we follow her she will take us out all right said Harry and so the three boys willingly started off after the cow Just as Harry had said she made her way to a path then the rest of the way was clear Hurrah shouted Hal I smell supper already and now at the end of the path an opening in the trees showed a few scattered houses Why we are away outside of Berkley went on Hal Now we will have a long tramp home but I m glad even at that for a night under the trees was not a pleasant prospect We must take this cow home first said Harry with a farmer s instinct Where do you suppose she belongs We might try that house first suggested Bert pointing to a cottage with a small barn a little way from the wood Come Cush said Harry to the strange cow and the animal obediently walked along There was no need to make inquiries for outside of the house a little woman met them Oh you ve found her she began Well my husband was just going to the pound for that old miser of a pound master takes a cow in every chance he gets just for the fine Come Daisy you re hungry and she patted the cow affectionately Now young men I m obliged to you and you have saved a poor man a day s pay for that is just what the fine would be If you will accept a pail of milk each I have the cans and would be glad to give you each a quart You might have berries for dinner she finished We would be very glad of the milk spoke up Harry promptly always wide awake and polite when there was a question that concerned farmers Do you live far asked the woman Only at the Cliffs said Harry We will soon he home now But we were lost until your cow found us She brought us here or we would be in the woods yet Well I do declare laughed the little woman filling each of three pails from the fresh milk that stood on a bench under the kitchen window Now our man goes right by your house to morrow morning and if you leave the pails outside he will get them Maybe your mothers might like some fresh milk or buttermilk or fresh eggs or new butter she asked Shouldn t wonder said Hal We have hard work to get fresh stuff they seem to send it all to the hotels I ll let the man know when he comes for the pails Thank you thank you replied the little woman and much obliged for bringing Daisy home If you ever want a drink of milk and are out this way just knock at my door and I ll see you don t go away thirsty After more thanks on both sides the lost boys started homeward like a milk brigade each with his bright tin pail of sweet new milk in his hand CHAPTER XIII THE BOAT CARNIVAL It didn t seem right to take all this milk remarked Hal as the three boys made their way in the dark along the ocean road But we would have offended the lady had we refused said Harry Besides we may be able to get her good customers by giving out the samples he went on I m sure it is good milk for the place was clean and that cow we found or that found us was a real Jersey The other boys did not attempt to question Harry s right to give expert views where cows and milk were concerned so they made their way along without further comment I suppose our folks will think we are lost ventured Hal Then they will think right admitted Bert for that was just what we were lost Crossing the bridge the boys could hear voices That s father declared Hal Then they listened And that s Uncle William said Bert as another voice reached them Gracious I m sorry this happened the first day I came spoke up Harry realizing that the other boys would not have gone into the deep woods if he had not acted as leader Here we are called Hal Hello there That you Hal came a call Yes we re coming Hal answered and the lost boys quickened their steps as much as the pails of milk allowed Presently Uncle William and mister Bingham came up and were so glad to find that Hal Harry and Bert were safe they scarcely required any explanation for the delay in getting home Of course both men had been boys themselves and well remembered how easy it was to get lost and be late reaching home The milk pails too bore out the boys story had there been any doubt about it but beyond a word of caution about dangerous places in deep woodlands there was not a harsh word spoken A little farther on the road home Dorothy Nan and Nellie met the wanderers and then the woodland escapade seemed a wild tale about bears Indians and even witches for each girl added to the boys story so much of her own imagination that the dark night and the roaring of the ocean finished up a very wild picture indeed Now you are real heroes answered Dorothy and you are the bravest boys I know I wish I had been along Just think of sitting by a campfire in a dark woods and having no one to bring you home but a poor little cow and Dorothy insisted on carrying Bert s milk pail to show her respect for a real hero Even Dinah and Susan did not complain about serving a late dinner to the boys and both maids said they had never before seen such perfectly splendid milk as came from the farmhouse We really might take some extra milk from that farm said Aunt Emily for what we get is nothing like as rich in cream as this is So as Harry said the sample brought good results for on the following morning when the man called for the empty pail Susan ordered two quarts a day besides some fresh eggs and new butter to be delivered twice a week Do you know said Uncle William to missus Bobbsey next morning at breakfast when the children had left the table mister Bingham was telling me last night that his brother is at sea on just such a voyage as little Nellie s father went on And a man named McLaughlin went with him too Now that s Nellie s name and I believe George Bingham is the very man he went with You don t tell me exclaimed missus Bobbsey And have they heard any news from mister Bingham s brother Nothing very definite but a vessel sighted the schooner ten days ago mister Bingham has no idea his brother is lost as he is an experienced seaman and the Binghams are positive it is only a matter of the schooner being disabled and the crew having a hard time to reach port replied mister Minturn If Nellie s mother only knew that said missus Bobbsey Tell you what I ll do said the brother in law just give me missus McLaughlin s address and I ll go to see her to day while I m in town Then I can find out whether we have the right man in mind or not Of course nothing was said to Nellie about the clew to her father s whereabouts but missus Bobbsey and Aunt Emily were quite excited over it for they were very fond of Nellie and besides had visited her mother and knew of the poor woman s distress If it only could be true that the vessel is trying to get into port reflected missus Bobbsey Surely there would be enough help along the coast to save the crew While this very serious matter was occupying the attention of the grown up folks the children were all enthusiasm over the water carnival coming off that afternoon Hal and Bert were dressed like real Indians and were to paddle in Hal s canoe while Harry was fixed up like a student a French explorer and he was to row alone in Hal s father s boat to represent Father Marquette the discoverer of the upper Mississippi River It was quite simple to make Harry look like the famous discoverer for he was tall and dark and the robes were easily arranged with Susan s black shawl a rough cord binding it about his waist Uncle William s traveling cap answered perfectly for the French skullcap Then I m going to be Pocahontas insisted Dorothy as the boys costumes brought her mind back to Colonial days Oh no objected Hal you girls better take another period of history We can t all be Indians Well I ll never be a Puritan not even for fun declared Dorothy whose spirit of frolic was certainly quite opposite that of a Priscilla Who was some famous girl or woman in American history asked Harry glad to get a chance to stick Dorothy Oh there are lots of them answered the girl promptly Don t think that men were the only people in America who did anything worth while Then be one that you particularly admire teased Harry knowing very well Dorothy could not at that minute name a single character she would care to impersonate Oh let us be real suggested Nellie Everybody will be all make believe I saw lots of people getting ready and I m sure they will all look like Christmas tree things tinsel and paper and colored stuffs What would be real questioned Dorothy Well the Fisherman s Daughters Nellie said very slowly We have a picture at home of two little girls waiting for their father The boys noticed Nellie s manner and knew why she hesitated Surely it would be real for her to be a fisherman s daughter waiting for her father Oh good said Dorothy I ve got that picture in a book and we can copy it exactly You and I can be in a boat alone I can row You had better have a line to my boat suggested Harry It would be safer in the crowd It had already been decided that Flossie Freddie and Nan should go in the Minturn launch that was made up to look like a Venetian gondola missus Bobbsey and Aunt Emily and Aunt Sarah were to be Italian ladies not that they cared to be in the boat parade but because Aunt Emily being one of the cottagers felt obliged to encourage the social features of the little colony It was quite extraordinary how quickly and how well Dorothy managed to get up her costume and Nellie s Of course the boys were wonderful Indians and Harry a splendid Frenchman missus Bobbsey Aunt Sarah and Aunt Emily only had to add lace headpieces to their brightest dinner gowns to be like the showy Italians while Freddie looked like a little prince in his black velvet suit with Flossie s red sash tied from shoulder to waist in gay court fashion Flossie wore the pink slip that belonged under her lace dress and on her head was a silk handkerchief pinned up at the ends in that square quaint fashion of little ladies of Venice There were to be prizes of course for the best costumes and prettiest boats and the judges stand was a very showy affair built at the bridge end of the lake There was plenty of excitement getting ready but finally all hands were dressed and the music from the lake told our friends the procession was already lining up missus Minturn s launch was given second place just back of the Mayor s and missus Bingham s launch fixed up to represent an automobile came next Then there were all kinds of boats some made to represent impossible things like big swans eagles and one even had a lot of colored ropes flying about it while an automobile lamp fixed up in a great paper head was intended to look like a monster sea serpent the ropes being its fangs By cutting out a queer face in the paper over the lighted lamp the eyes blazed of course while the mouth was red and wide open and there were horns too made of twisted pieces of tin so that altogether the sea serpent looked very fierce indeed The larger boats were expected to be very fine so that as the procession passed along the little lake the steam launches did not bring out much cheering from the crowd But now the single boats were coming Father Marquette cried the people instantly recognizing the historic figure Harry represented So slowly his boat came along and so solemn he looked Then as he reached the judges stand he stood up put his hand over his eyes looking off in the distance exactly like the picture of the famous French explorer This brought out long and loud cheering and really Harry deserved it for he not only looked like but really acted the character There were a few more small boats next In one the summer girl was all lace and parasol in another there was a rude fisherman then some boys were dressed to look like dandies and they seemed to enjoy themselves more than did the people looking at them There was also a craft fixed up to look like a small gunboat Hal and Bert then paddled along They were perfect Indians even having their faces browned with dark powder Susan s feather duster had been dissected to make up the boys headgear and two overall suits with jumpers had been slashed to pieces to make the Indian suits The canoe of course made a great stir Who are they everybody wanted to know But no one could guess Oh look at this called the people as an old boat with two little girls drifted along The Fisherman s Daughters Perhaps it was because there was so much gayety around that these little girls looked so real From the side of their weather beaten boat dragged an old fishnet Each girl had on her head a queer half hood black and from under this Nellie s brown hair fell in tangles on her bare shoulders and Dorothy s beautiful yellow ringlets framed in her own pretty face The children wore queer bodices like those seen in pictures of Dutch girls and full skirts of dark stuff finished out their costumes As they sat in the boat and looked out to sea watching for the fisherman s return their attitude and pose were perfect The people did not even cheer They seemed spellbound That child is an actress they said noting the real look on Nellie s face But Nellie was not acting She was waiting for the lost father at sea When would he come back to her CHAPTER XIV THE FIRST PRIZE When the last craft in the procession had passed the judges stand and the little lake was alive with decorations and nautical novelties everybody of course in the boats and on land was anxious to know who would get the prizes There were four to be given and the fortunate ones could have gifts in silver articles or the value in money just as they chose Everybody waited anxiously when the man at the judges stand stood up and called through the big megaphone Let the Fisherman s Daughters pass down to the stand Oh we are going to get a prize Dorothy said to Nellie I ll just cut the line to Harry s boat and row back to the stand Then when the two little girls sailed out all by themselves Dorothy rowing gracefully while Nellie helped some although not accustomed to the oars the people fairly shouted For a minute the girls waited in front of the stand But the more people inspected them the better they appeared Finally the head judge stood up First prize is awarded to the Fisherman s Daughters he announced The cheering that followed his words showed the approval of the crowd Nellie and Dorothy were almost frightened at the noise Then they rowed their boat to the edge and as the crowd gathered around them to offer congratulations the other prizes were awarded The second prize went to the Indians Lucky they don t know us said Hal to Bert for they would never let the two best prizes get in one set The Indians were certainly well made up and their canoe a perfect redman s bark The third prize went to the Sea serpent for being the funniest boat in the procession and the fourth to the gunboat Then came a great shouting A perfect day had added to the success of the carnival and now many people adjourned to the pavilion where a reception was held and good things to eat were bountifully served But who was the little girl with Dorothy Minturn asked the mayor s wife Of course everybody knew Dorothy but Nellie was a stranger missus Minturn missus Bobbsey Aunt Sarah missus Bingham and missus Blake the latter being the mayor s wife had a little corner in the pavilion to themselves Here Nellie s story was quietly told How nice it was she got the prize said missus Blake after hearing about Nellie s hardships I think we had better have it in money and we might add something to it she suggested I am sure mister Blake would be glad to He often gives a prize himself I ll just speak to him Of course Dorothy was to share the prize and she accepted a pretty silver loving cup But what do you suppose they gave Nellie Fifty dollars Was not that perfectly splendid The prize for Nellie was twenty five dollars but urged by missus Blake the mayor added to it his own check for the balance Naturally Nellie wanted to go right home to her mother with it and nothing about the reception had any interest for her after she received the big check However missus Bobbsey insisted that mister Minturn would take the money to Nellie s mother the next day so the little girl had to be content Then when all the festivities were over and the children s excitement had brought them to bed very tired that night Nellie sat by her window and looked out at the sea Always the same prayer but to night somehow it seemed answered Was it the money for mother that made the father seem so near The roaring waves seemed to call out Nellie Nellie dear I m coming coming home to you And while the little girl was thus dreaming upstairs mister Minturn down in the library was telling about his visit to Nellie s mother There is no doubt about it he told missus Bobbsey It was Nellie s father who went away with George Bingham and it was certainly that schooner that was sighted some days ago The ladies of course were overjoyed at the prospect of the best of luck for Nellie her father s possible return and then it was decided that Uncle William should again go to missus McLaughlin this time to take her the prize money and that missus Bobbsey should go along with him as it was such an important errand And you remember that little pearl that Nellie found on the beach Well I m having it set in a ring for her It is a real pearl but not very valuable yet I thought it would be a souvenir of her visit at the Cliffs said mister Minturn That will be very nice declared missus Bobbsey I am sure no one deserves to be made happy more than that child does for just fancy how she worked in that store as cash girl until her health gave way And now she is anxious to go back to the store again Of course she is worried about her mother but the prize money ought to help missus McLaughlin so that Nellie would not need to cut her vacation short What kind of treasure was it that these men went to sea after Aunt Emily asked Uncle William A cargo of mahogany mister Minturn replied You see that wood is scarce now a cargo is worth a fortune and a shipload was being brought from the West Indies to New York when a storm blew the vessel out to a very dangerous point Of course the vessel was wrecked and so were two others that later attempted to reach the valuable cargo You see the wind always blows the one way there and it is impossible to get the mahogany out of its trap Now George Bingham was offered fifty thousand dollars to bring that wood to port and he decided that he could do it by towing each log around the reef by canoes The logs are very heavy each one is worth between eighty and one hundred dollars but the risk meant such a reward in case of success that they went at it Of course the real danger is around the wreck Once free from that point and the remainder of the voyage would be only subject to the usual ocean storms And those men were to go through the dangerous waters in little canoes exclaimed Aunt Emily But the danger was mostly from winds to the sails of vessels explained Uncle William Small craft are safest in such waters And if they succeeded in bringing the mahogany in asked missus Bobbsey Nellie would be comparatively rich for her father went as George Bingham s partner finished mister Minturn So the evening went into night and Nellie the Fisherman s Daughter slept on to dream that the song of the waves came true CHAPTER XV LOST ON AN ISLAND The calm that always follows a storm settled down upon the Cliffs the day after the carnival The talk of the entire summer settlement was Nellie and her prize and naturally the little girl herself thought of home and the lonely mother who was going to receive such a surprise fifty dollars It was a pleasant morning and Freddie and Flossie were out watching Downy trying to get through the fence that the boys had built to keep him out of the ocean Freddie had a pretty little boat Uncle William had brought down from the city It had sails that really caught the wind and carried the boat along Of course Freddie had a long cord tied to it so it could not get out of his reach and while Flossie tried to steer the vessel with a long whip Freddie made believe he was a canal man and walked along the tow path with the cord in hand I think I would have got a prize in the boat parade if I had this steamer said Freddie feeling his craft was really as fine as any that had taken part in the carnival Maybe you would agreed Flossie Now let me sail it a little All right said Freddie and he offered the cord to his twin sister Oh she exclaimed I dropped it The next minute the little boat made a turn with the breeze and before Flossie could get hold of the string it was all in the water Oh my boat cried Freddie Get it quick I can t declared Flossie It is out too far Oh what shall we do Now you just get it You let it go went on the brother without realizing that his sister could not reach the boat nor the string either for that matter Oh it s going far away cried Flossie almost in tears The little boat was certainly making its way out into the lake and it sailed along so proudly it must have been very glad to be free There s Hal Bingham s boat ventured Flossie Maybe I could go out a little ways in that Of course you can promptly answered Freddie I can row I don t know we might upset Flossie said hesitating But it isn t deep Why Downy walks around out here went on the brother This assurance gave the little girl courage and slipping the rope off the peg that secured the boat to the shore very carefully she put Freddie on one seat while she sat herself on the other The oars were so big she did not attempt to handle them but just depended on the boat to do its own sailing Isn t this lovely declared Freddie as the boat drifted quietly along Yes but how can we get back asked Flossie beginning to realize their predicament Oh easy replied Freddie who suddenly seemed to have become a man he was so brave The tide comes down pretty soon and then our boat will go back to shore Freddie had heard so much about the tide he felt he understood it perfectly Of course there was no tide on the lake although the waters ran lazily toward the ocean at times But we are not getting near my boat Freddie complained for indeed the toy sailboat was drifting just opposite their way Well I can t help it I m sure cried Flossie And I just wish I could get back I m going to call somebody Nobody can hear you said her brother They are all down by the ocean and there s so much noise there you can t even hear thunder Where the deep woods joined the lake there was a little island This was just around the turn and entirely out of view of either the Minturn or the Bingham boat landing Toward this little island the children s boat was now drifting Oh we ll be real Robinson Crusoes exclaimed Freddie delighted at the prospect of such an adventure I don t want to be no Robinson Crusoe pouted his sister I just want to get back home and she began to cry We re going to bunk announced Freddie as at that minute the boat did really bump into the little island Come Flossie let us get ashore said the brother in that superior way that had come to him in their distress Flossie willingly obeyed Be careful she cautioned Don t step out till I get hold of your hand It is awfully easy to slip getting out of a boat Fortunately for the little ones they had been taught to be careful when around boats so that they were able to take care of themselves pretty well even in their present danger Once on land Flossie s fears left her and she immediately set about picking the pretty little water flowers that grew plentifully among the ferns and flag lilies I m going to build a hut said Freddie putting pieces of dry sticks up against a willow tree Soon the children became so interested they did not notice their boat drift away and really leave them all alone on the island In the meantime everybody at the house was looking for the twins Their first fear of course was the ocean and down to the beach missus Bobbsey Aunt Sarah and the boys hurried while Aunt Emily and the girls made their way to the Gypsy Camp fearing the fortune tellers might have stolen the children in order to get money for bringing them back again Dorothy walked boldly up to the tent An old woman sat outside and looked very wicked her face was so dark and her hair so black and tangled Have you seen a little boy and girl around here asked Dorothy looking straight into the tent No nobody round here Tell your fortune lady This to Aunt Emily who waited for Dorothy Not to day answered Aunt Emily We are looking for two children Are you sure you have not seen them No lady Gypsy tell lady s fortune then lady find them she suggested with that trick her class always uses trying to impose on persons in trouble with the suggestion of helping them out of it No we have not time insisted Aunt Emily really quite alarmed now that there was no trace of the little twins Let me look through your tent asked Dorothy bravely What for demanded the old woman To make sure the children are not hiding and without waiting for a word from the old woman Dorothy walked straight into that gypsy tent Even Aunt Emily was frightened Suppose somebody inside should keep Dorothy Come out of my house muttered the woman starting after Dorothy Come out Dorothy called her mother but the girl was making her way through the old beds and things inside to make sure there was no Freddie or Flossie to be found in the tent It was a small place of course and it did not take Dorothy very long to search it Presently she appeared again much to the relief of her mother Nan and Nellie who waited breathlessly outside They are not around here said Dorothy Now mother give the old woman some change to make up for my trespassing Aunt Emily took a coin from her chatelaine Thank the lady Good lady exclaimed the old gypsy Lady find her babies babies play see And she pretended to look into the future with some dirty cards Babies play in woods Natalie sees babies picking flowers Now how could anybody ever guess that the old gypsy had just come down from picking dandelions by the lake where she really had seen Freddie and Flossie on the island And how could anybody know that she was too wicked to tell Aunt Emily this but was waiting until night to bring the children back home herself and get a reward for doing so She had seen the boat drift away and she knew the little ones were helpless to return home unless someone found them missus Bobbsey and the boys were now coming up from the beach What at first seemed only a mishap now looked like a very serious matter We must go to the woods insisted Dorothy Maybe that old woman knew they were in the woods But as such things always happen the searchers went to the end of the woods far away from the island Of course they all called loudly and the boys gave the familiar yodel but the noise of the ocean made it impossible for the call to reach Freddie and Flossie Oh I m so afraid they are drowned exclaimed missus Bobbsey breaking down and crying No mamma insisted Nan I am sure they are not Flossie is so afraid of the water and Freddie always minds Flossie They must be playing somewhere Maybe they are home by this time and so it was agreed to go back to the house and if the little ones were not there then But they must be there insisted Nellie starting on a run over the swampy grounds toward the Cliffs And all this time Freddie and Flossie were quite unconcerned playing on the island Oh there s a man shouted Freddie seeing someone in the woods Maybe it s Friday Say there Mister he shouted Say will you help us get to land The man heard the child s voice and hurried to the edge of the lake Wall I declare he exclaimed if them babies ain t lost out there And here comes their boat Well I ll just fetch them in before they try to swim out he told himself swinging into the drifting boat and with the stout stick he had in his hand pushing off for the little island The island was quite near to shore on that side and it was only a few minutes work for the man to reach the children What s your name he demanded as soon as he touched land Freddie Bobbsey spoke up the little fellow bravely and we live at the Cliffs You do eh Then it was your brothers who brought my cow home so I can pay them back by taking you home now I can t row to the far shore with this stick so we ll have to tramp it through the woods Come along and carefully he lifted the little ones into the boat pushing to the woods and started off to walk the round about way through the woods to the bridge then along the road back to the Cliffs where a whole household was in great distress because of the twins absence CHAPTER XVI DOROTHY S DOINGS Here they come called Nellie who was searching around the barn and saw the farmer with the two children crossing the hill I m Robinson Crusoe insisted Freddie and this is my man Friday he added pointing to the farmer Of course it did not take long to clear up the mystery of the little ones disappearance But since his return Freddie acted like a hero and certainly felt like one and Flossie brought home with her a dainty bouquet of pink sebatia that rare little flower so like a tiny wild rose The farmer refused to take anything for his time and trouble being glad to do our friends a favor Aunt Sarah and Harry were to leave for Meadow Brook that afternoon but the worry over the children being lost made Aunt Sarah feel quite unequal to the journey so Aunt Emily prevailed upon her to wait another day There are so many dangers around here remarked Aunt Sarah when all the scare was over It is different in the country We never worry about lost children out in Meadow Brook But I often got lost out there insisted Freddie Don t you remember Aunt Sarah had some recollection of the little fellow s adventures in that line and laughed over them now that they were recalled Late that afternoon Dorothy Nan and Nellie had a conference that is they talked with their heads so close together not even Flossie could get an idea of what they were planning But it was certainly mischief for Dorothy had most to say and she would rather have a good joke than a good dinner any day so Susan said Harry Hal and Bert had been chasing through the woods after a queer looking bird It was large and had brilliant feathers and when it rested for a moment on a tree it would pick at the bark as if it were trying to play a tune with its beak Each time it struck the bark its head bobbed up and down in a queer way for a bird But the boys could not get it They set Hal s trap and even used an air rifle in hopes of bringing it down without killing it but the bird puttered from place to place not in a very great hurry but just fast enough to keep the boys busy chasing it That evening at dinner the strange bird was much talked about Dat s a ban shee declared Dinah jokingly Dat bird came to bring a message from somebody You boys will hear dat tonight see if you doesn t and she gave a very mysterious wink at Dorothy who just then nearly choked with her dessert A few hours later the house was all quiet The happenings of the day brought a welcome night and tired little heads comfortably hugged their pillows It must have been about midnight Bert was positive he had just heard the clock strike a lot of rings surely a dozen or so when at his window came a queer sound like something pecking At first Bert got it mixed up with his dreams but as it continued longer and louder he called to Harry who slept in the alcove in Bert s room and together the boys listened attentively That s the strange bird declared Harry Sure enough it is bringing us a message as Dinah said and while the boys took the girl s words in a joke they really seemed to be coming true Don t light the gas cautioned Bert or that will surely frighten it off We can get our air guns and I ll go crawl out on the veranda roof back of it so as to get it if possible All this time the peck peck peck kept at the window but just as soon as Bert went out in the hall to make his way through the storeroom window to the veranda roof the pecking ceased Harry hurried after Bert to tell him the bird was gone and then together the boys put their heads out of their own window But there was not a sound not even the distant flutter of a bird s wing to tell the boys the messenger had gone Back to bed for us said Harry laughing I guess that bird is a joker and wants to keep us busy and both boys being healthy were quite ready to fall off to sleep as soon as they felt it was of no use to stay awake longer looking for their feathered visitor There it is again called Bert when Harry had just begun to dream of hazelnuts in Meadow Brook I ll get him this time and without waiting to go through the storeroom Bert raised the window and bolted out on the roof What s de matter down dere called Dinah from the window above Pears like as if you boys had de nightmare Can t you let nobody get a wink ob sleep Ebbery time I puts my head down bang comes a noise and up pops my head Now what s a ailin ob you Bert and the colored girl showed by her tone of voice she was not a bit angry but chock full of laugh as Bert whispered to Harry But the boys had not caught the bird had not even seen it for that matter Both Bert and Harry were now on the roof in their pajamas What s the matter there called Dorothy in a very drowsy voice from her window at the other end of the roof What are you boys after called Uncle William from a middle window Anything the matter asked Aunt Sarah anxiously from the spare room Got a burgulor shrieked Freddie from the nursery Do you want any help offered Susan her head out of the top floor window All these questions came so thick and fast on the heads of Bert and Harry that the boys had no idea of answering them Certainly the bird was nowhere to be seen and they did not feel like advertising their April fool game to the whole house so they decided to crawl into bed again and let others do the same The window in the boys room was a bay and each time the pecking disturbed them they thought the sound came from a different part of the window Bert said it was the one at the left so where the bird called from was left a mystery But neither boy had time to close his eyes before the noise started up again Well if that isn t a ghost it certainly is a ban shee as Dinah said whispered Bert I m going out to Uncle William s room and tell him Maybe he will have better luck than we had and so saying Bert crept out into the hall and down two doors to his uncle s room Uncle William had also heard the sound Don t make a particle of noise cautioned the uncle and we can go up in the cupola and slide down a post so quietly the bird will not hear us and as he said this he in his bath robe went cautiously up the attic stairs out of a small window and slid down the post before Bert had time to draw his own breath But there was no bird to be seen anywhere I heard it this very minute declared Harry from the window It might be bats suggested Uncle William But listen I thought I heard the girls laughing and at that moment an audible titter was making its way out of Nan s room That s Dorothy s doings declared Uncle William getting ready to laugh himself She s always playing tricks and he began to feel about the outside ledge of the bay window But there was nothing there to solve the mystery A tick tack declared Harry I ll bet from the girls room and without waiting for another word he jumped out of his window ran along the roof to Nan s room and then grabbed something Here it is he called confiscating the offending property You just wait girls he shouted in the window If we don t give you a good ducking in the ocean for this to morrow The laugh of the three girls in Nan s room made the joke on the boys more complete and as Uncle William went back to his room he declared to missus Bobbsey and Aunt Emily that his girl Dorothy was more fun than a dozen boys and he would match her against that number for the best piece of good natured fun ever played A bird sneered Bert making fun of himself for being so easily fooled A girls game of tick tack laughed Harry making up his mind that if he did not get back at Dorothy he would certainly have to haul in his colors as captain of the Boys Brigade of Meadow Brook for she certainly did fool me he admitted turning over to sleep at last CHAPTER XVII OLD FRIENDS Now Aunt Sarah pleaded Nan the next morning you might just as well wait and go home on the excursion train 
5854-50960-0001	train-other-500	All Meadow Brook will be down and it will be so much pleasanter for you The train will be here by noon and leave at three o clock But think of the hour that would bring us to Meadow Brook objected Aunt Sarah Well
5854-50960-0002	train-other-500	you will have lots of company and if Uncle Daniel shouldn t meet you you can ride up with the Hopkinses or anybody along your road missus Bobbsey and Aunt Emily
none	none	 added their entreaties to Nan s and Aunt Sarah finally agreed to wait If I keep on she said 
5854-50960-0003	train-other-500	I ll be here all summer And think of the fruit that s waiting to be preserved Hurrah shouted Bert giving his aunt a good hug Then Harry and I can have a fine time with the Meadow Brook boys
5854-50960-0004	train-other-500	and Bert dashed out to take the good news to Harry and Hal Bingham who were out at the donkey house Come on fellows he called Down to the beach We can have a swim before the crowd gets there
5854-50960-0005	train-other-500	And with renewed interest the trio started off for the breakers I would like to live at the beach all summer remarked Harry Even in winter it must be fine here It is said Hal
5854-50960-0006	train-other-500	But the winds blow everything away regularly and they all have to be carted back again each spring This shore with all its trimmings now will look like a bald head by the first of December All three boys were fine swimmers
5854-50960-0007	train-other-500	and they promptly struck off for the water that was straightened out as Bert said beyond the tearing of the breakers at the edge There were few people in the surf
none	none	 and the boys made their way around as if they owned the ocean 
5854-50960-0008	train-other-500	Suddenly Hal thought he heard a call Then a man s arm appeared above the water s surface a few yards away Cramps yelled Hal to Harry and Bert while all three hurried to where the man s hand had been seen
5854-50960-0009	train-other-500	But it did not come up again I ll dive down spluttered Hal who had the reputation of being able to stay a long time under water It seemed quite a while to Bert and Harry before Hal came up again
5854-50960-0010	train-other-500	but when he did he was trying to pull with him a big fat man who was all but unconscious Can t move gasped Hal as the heavy burden was pulling him down Bit by bit the man with cramps gained a little strength
none	none	 and with the boys help he was towed in to shore 
5854-50960-0011	train-other-500	There was not a life guard in sight and Hal had to hurry off to the pier for some restoratives for the man was very weak On his way Hal met a guard who of course ran to the spot where Harry and Bert were giving the man artificial respiration
5854-50960-0012	train-other-500	You boys did well declared the guard promptly seeing how hard they worked with the sick man Yes they saved my life gasped the half drowned man This little fellow pointing to Hal brought me up almost from
5854-50960-0013	train-other-500	the bottom and he caught his breath painfully The man was assisted to a room at the end of the pier and after a little while he became much better Of course the boys did not stand around being satisfied they could be of no more use
5854-50960-0014	train-other-500	I must get those lads names declared the man to the guard Mine is and he gave the name of the famous millionaire who had a magnificent summer home in another colony three miles away And you swam from the Cedars mister Black
5854-50960-0015	train-other-500	exclaimed the guard No wonder you got cramps An hour later the millionaire was walking the beach looking for the life savers He finally spied Hal Here there you boy he called and Hal came in to the edge
5854-50960-0016	train-other-500	but hardly recognized the man in street clothes I want your name demanded the stranger Do you know there are medals given to young heroes like you
none	none	 Oh that was nothing 
5854-50960-0017	train-other-500	stammered Hal quite confused now Nothing Why I was about dead and pulled on you with all my two hundred pounds You knew too you had hardly a chance to bring me up Yes indeed I want your name and as he insisted
none	none	 Hal reluctantly gave it but felt quite foolish to make such a fuss over nothing as he said It was now about time for the excursion train to come in 
5854-50960-0018	train-other-500	so the boys left the water and prepared to meet their old friends I hope Jack Hopkins comes said Bert for Jack was a great friend Oh he will be along Harry remarked Nobody likes a good time better than Jack Here they come announced Hal the next minute
5854-50960-0019	train-other-500	as a crowd of children with many lunch boxes came running down to the ocean Hello there Hello there called everybody at once for of course all the children knew Harry and many also knew Bert There were Tom Mason Jack Hopkins August Stout
5854-50960-0020	train-other-500	and Ned Prentice in the first crowd while a number of girls friends of Nan s were in another group Nan Nellie and Dorothy had been detained by somebody further up on the road but were now coming down slowly Such a delight as the ocean was to the country children
5854-50960-0021	train-other-500	As each roller slipped out on the sands the children unconsciously followed it and so many unsuspected pairs of shoes were caught by the next wave that washed in Well here comes Uncle Daniel called Bert as sure enough
5854-50960-0022	train-other-500	down to the edge came Uncle Daniel with Dorothy holding on one arm Nan clinging to the other while Nellie carried his small satchel Santa Claus could hardly have been more welcome to the Bobbseys at that moment than was Uncle Daniel
5854-50960-0023	train-other-500	They simply overpowered him as the surprise of his coming made the treat so much better The girls had dragged him down to the ocean he said when he had intended first going to Aunt Emily s I must see the others he insisted Freddie and Flossie
none	none	 Oh they are all coming down Nan assured him 
5854-50960-0024	train-other-500	Aunt Sarah too is coming All right then agreed Uncle Daniel I ll wait awhile Well Harry you look like an Indian Can you see through that coat of tan Harry laughed and said he had been an Indian in having a good time
5854-50960-0025	train-other-500	Presently somebody jumped up on Uncle Daniel s back As he was sitting on the sands the shock almost brought him down Of course it was Freddie who was so overjoyed he really treated the good natured uncle a little roughly Freddie boy Freddie boy
5854-50960-0026	train-other-500	exclaimed Uncle Daniel giving his nephew a good long hug And you have turned Indian too Where s that sea serpent you were going to catch for me I ll get him yet declared the little fellow It hasn t rained hardly since we came down and they only come in to land out of the rain
5854-50960-0027	train-other-500	This explanation made Uncle Daniel laugh heartily The whole family sat around on the sands and it was like being in the country and at the seashore at the one time Flossie declared The boys of course were in the water
5854-50960-0028	train-other-500	August Stout had not learned much about swimming since he fell off the plank while fishing in Meadow Brook so that out in the waves the other boys had great fun with their fat friend And there is Nettie Prentice exclaimed Nan suddenly
none	none	 as she espied her little country friend looking through the crowd 
5854-50960-0029	train-other-500	evidently searching for friends Oh Nan called Nettie in delight I m just as glad to see you as I am to see the ocean and I never saw that before and the two little girls exchanged greetings of genuine love for each other
5854-50960-0030	train-other-500	Won t we have a perfectly splendid time declared Nan Dorothy my cousin is so jolly and here s Nellie you remember her Of course Nettie did remember her and now all the little girls went around hunting for fun
5854-50960-0031	train-other-500	in every possible corner where fun might be hidden As soon as the boys were satisfied with their bath they went in search of the big sun umbrellas so that Uncle William Aunt Emily missus Bobbsey and Aunt Sarah might sit under the sunshades while eating lunch
5854-50960-0032	train-other-500	Then the boys got long boards and arranged them from bench to bench in picnic style so that all the Meadow Brook friends might have a pleasant time eating their box lunches Let s make lemonade suggested Hal
5854-50960-0033	train-other-500	I know where I can get a pail of nice clean water I ll buy the lemons offered Harry I ll look after sugar put in Bert And I ll do the mixing declared August Stout while all set to work to produce the wonderful picnic lemonade
none	none	 Now don t go putting in white sand instead of sugar 
5854-50960-0034	train-other-500	teased Uncle Daniel as the caterers with sleeves rolled up worked hard over the lemonade What can we use for cups asked Nan Oh I know said Harry over at the Indian stand they have a lot of gourds
5854-50960-0035	train-other-500	the kind of mock oranges that Mexicans drink out of I can buy them for five cents each and after the picnic we can bring them home and hang them up for souvenirs Just the thing declared Hal
5854-50960-0036	train-other-500	who had a great regard for things that hang up and look like curios I ll go along and help you make the bargain When the boys came back they had a dozen of the funny drinking cups The long crooked handles were so queer
5854-50960-0037	train-other-500	that each person tried to get the cup to his or her mouth in a different way We stopped at the hydrant and washed the gourds thoroughly declared Hal so you need not expect to find any Mexican diamonds in them
5854-50960-0038	train-other-500	Or tarantulas put in Uncle Daniel What s them asked Freddie with an ear for anything that sounded like a menagerie A very bad kind of spider that sometimes comes in fruit from other countries explained Uncle Daniel
5854-50960-0039	train-other-500	Then Nan filled his gourd from the dipper that stood in the big pail of lemonade and he smacked his lips in appreciation There was so much to do and so much to see that the few hours allowed the excursionists slipped by all too quickly
5854-50960-0040	train-other-500	Dorothy ran away and soon returned with her donkey cart to take Nettie Prentice and a few of Nettie s friends for a ride along the beach Nan and Nellie did not go preferring to give the treat to the little country girls
5854-50960-0041	train-other-500	Now don t go far directed Aunt Emily for Aunt Sarah and Uncle Daniel were already leaving the beach to make ready for the train Of course Harry and Aunt Sarah were all packed up
5854-50960-0042	train-other-500	and had very little to do at Aunt Emily s before starting Hal and Bert were sorry indeed to have Harry go for Harry was such a good leader in outdoor sports his country training always standing by him in emergencies
5854-50960-0043	train-other-500	Finally Dorothy came back with the girls from their ride and the people were beginning to crowd into the long line of cars that waited on a switch near the station Now Nettie be sure to write to me said Nan bidding her little friend good by
5854-50960-0044	train-other-500	And come down next year insisted Dorothy I had such a lovely time declared Nettie I m sure I will come again if I can The Meadow Brook Bobbseys had secured good seats in the middle car
5854-50960-0045	train-other-500	Aunt Sarah thought that the safest and now the locomotive whistle was tooting calling the few stragglers who insisted on waiting at the beach until the very last minute
none	none	 Freddie wanted to cry when he realized that Uncle Daniel Aunt Sarah and even Harry were going away but with the promises of meeting again Christmas and possibly Thanksgiving all the good bys were said and the excursion train puffed out on its long trip to dear old Meadow Brook and beyond CHAPTER XVIII THE STORM When Uncle William Minturn came in from the city that evening he had some mysterious news Everybody guessed it was about Nellie but as surprises were always cropping up at Ocean Cliff the news was kept secret and the whispering increased I had hard work to get her to come said Uncle William to missus Bobbsey still guarding the mystery but I finally prevailed upon her and she will be down on the morning train Poor woman I am sure it will do her good remarked missus Bobbsey Your house has been a regular hotel this summer she said to mister Minturn That s what we are here for he replied We would not have much pleasure I am sure if our friends were not around us Did you hear anything more about the last vessel asked Aunt Emily Yes I went down to the general office today and an incoming steamer was sure it was the West Indies vessel that was sighted four days ago Then they should be near port now asked missus Bobbsey They ought to be replied Uncle William but the cargo is so heavy and the schooner such a very slow sailer that it takes a long time to cover the distance Next morning bright and early Dorothy had the donkeys in harness We are going to the station to meet some friends Nellie she said Come along What More company exclaimed Nellie I really ought to go home I am well and strong now Indeed you can t go until we let you said Dorothy laughing I suppose you think all the fun went with Harry she added teasingly for Dorothy knew Nellie had been acting lonely ever since the carnival She was surely homesick to see her mother and talk about the big prize The two girls had not long to wait at the station for the train pulled in just as they reached the platform Dorothy looked about a little uneasily We must watch for a lady in a linen suit with black hat she said to Nellie she s a stranger That very minute the linen suit appeared Oh oh screamed Nellie unable to get her words There is my mother and the next thing Dorothy knew Nellie was trying to wear the same linen dress that the stranger appeared in at least that was how Dorothy afterwards told about Nellie s meeting with her mother My daughter exclaimed the lady I have been so lonely I came to bring you home And this is Dorothy said Nellie recovering herself Dorothy is my best friend next to Nan You have surely been among good friends declared the mother for you have gotten the roses back in your cheeks again How well you do look Oh I ve had a perfectly fine time declared Nellie Fine and dandy repeated Dorothy unable to restrain her fun making spirit At a glance Dorothy saw why Nellie although poor was so genteel for her mother was one of those fine featured women that seem especially fitted to say gentle things to children missus McLaughlin was not old no older than Nan s mother and she had that wonderful wealth of brown hair just like Nellie s Her eyes were brown too while Nellie s were blue but otherwise Nellie was much like her mother so people said Aunt Emily and missus Bobbsey had visited missus McLaughlin in the city so that they were quite well acquainted when the donkey cart drove up and they all had a laugh over the surprise to Nellie Of course that was Uncle William s secret and the mystery of the whispering the evening before But we must go back on the afternoon train insisted missus McLaughlin who had really only come down to the shore to bring Nellie home Indeed no objected Aunt Emily that would be too much traveling in one day You may go early in the morning Everybody is going home sighed Dorothy I suppose you will be the next to go Nan and she looked quite lonely at the prospect We are going to have a big storm declared Susan who had just come in from the village We have had a long dry spell now we are going to make up for it Dear me sighed missus McLaughlin I wish we had started for home Oh there s lots of fun here in a storm laughed Dorothy The ocean always tries to lick up the whole place but it has to be satisfied with pulling down pavilions and piers Last year the water really went higher than the gas lights along the boulevard Then that must mean an awful storm at sea reflected Nellie s mother Storms are bad enough on land but at sea they must be dreadful And she looked out toward the wild ocean that was keeping from her the fate of her husband Long before there were close signs of storm life guards on the beach were preparing for it They were making fast everything that could be secured and at the life saving station all possible preparations were being made to help those who might suffer from the storm It was nearing September and a tidal wave had swept over the southern ports Coming in all the way from the tropics the storm had made itself felt over a great part of the world in some places taking the shape of a hurricane On this particular afternoon while the sun still shone brightly over Sunset Beach the storm was creeping in under the big waves that dashed up on the sands It is not safe to let go the ropes the guards told the people but the idea of a storm from such a pretty sky made some daring enough to disobey these orders The result was that the guards were kept busy trying to bring girls and women to their feet who were being dashed around by the excited waves This work occupied the entire afternoon and as soon as the crowd left the beach the life guards brought the boats down to the edge got their lines ready and when dark came on they were prepared for the life patrol the long dreary watch of the night so near the noisy waves and so far from the voice of distress that might call over the breakers to the safe shores where the life savers waited watched and listened The rain began to fall before it was entirely dark The lurid sunset glaring through the dark and rain gave an awful yellow look to the land and sea alike It is like the end of the world whispered Nellie to Nan as the two girls looked out of the window to see the wild storm approaching Then the lightning came in blazing blades cutting through the gathering clouds The thunder was only like muffled rolls for the fury of the ocean deadened every other sound of heaven or earth It will be a dreadful storm said Aunt Emily to missus Bobbsey We must all go into the sitting room and pray for the sailors Everyone in the house assembled in the large sitting room and Uncle William led the prayers Poor missus McLaughlin did not once raise her head Nellie too hid her pale face in her hands Dorothy was frightened and when all were saying good night she pressed a kiss on Nellie s cheek and told her that the life savers on Sunset Beach would surely be able to save all the sailors that came that way during the big storm Nellie and her mother occupied the same room Of course the mother had been told that the long delayed boat had been sighted and now how anxiously she awaited more news of Nellie s father We must not worry she told Nellie for who knows but the storm may really help father s boat to get into port So while the waves lashed furiously upon Sunset Beach all the people in the Minturn cottage were sleeping or trying to sleep for indeed it was not easy to rest when there was so much danger at their very door CHAPTER XIX LIFE SAVERS Mother mother called Nellie look down at the beach The life guards are burning the red signal lights They have found a wreck It was almost morning but the black storm clouds held the daylight back missus McLaughlin and her little daughter strained their eyes to see if possible what might be going on down at the beach While there was no noise to give the alarm it seemed almost everybody in that house felt the presence of the wreck for in a very few minutes Bert was at his window Dorothy and Nan were looking out of theirs while the older members of the household were dressing hastily to see if they might be of any help in case of accident at the beach Can I go with you Uncle called Bert who had heard his uncle getting ready to run down to the water s edge Yes come along answered mister Minturn and as day began to peep through the heavy clouds the two hurried down to the spot where the life guards were burning their red light to tell the sailors their signal had been seen There s the vessel exclaimed Bert as a rocket flew up from the water Yes that s the distress signal replied the uncle It is lucky that daylight is almost here Numbers of other cottagers were hurrying to the scene now mister Bingham and Hal being among the first to reach the spot It s a schooner said mister Bingham to mister Minturn and she has a very heavy cargo The sea was so wild it was impossible to send out the life savers boats so the guards were making ready the breeches buoy They are going to shoot the line out now explained Hal to Bert as the two wheel car with the mortar or cannon was dragged down to the ocean s edge Instantly there shot out to sea a ball of thin cord To this cord was fastened a heavy rope or cable They ve got it on the schooner exclaimed a man for the thin cord was now pulling the cable line out over the water What s that board for asked Bert as he saw a board following the cable That s the directions said Hal They are printed in a number of languages and they tell the crew to carry the end of the cable high up the mast and fasten it strongly there Oh I see said Bert the line will stretch then and the breeches buoy will go out on a pulley That s it replied Hal See there goes the buoy and then the queer looking life preserver made of cork and shaped like breeches swung out over the waves It was clear day now and much of the wicked storm had passed Its effect upon the sea was however more furious every hour for while the storm had left the land it was raging somewhere else and the sensitive sea felt every throb of the excited elements With the daylight came girls and women to the beach missus Bobbsey missus Minturn Nellie and her mother besides Dorothy and Nan were all there Flossie and Freddie being obliged to stay home with Dinah and Susan Of course the girls asked all sorts of questions and Bert and Hal tried to answer them as best they could It seemed a long time before any movement of the cable showed that the buoy was returning Here she comes Here she comes called the crowd presently as the black speck far out and the strain on the cord showed the buoy was coming back Up and down in the waves it bobbed sometimes seeming to go all the way under Nearer and nearer it came until now a man s head could be seen There s a man in it exclaimed the boys all excitement while the life guards pulled the cord steadily dragging in their human freight The girls and women were too frightened to talk and Nellie clung close to her mother A big roller dashing in finished the work for the life guards and a man in the cork belt bounded upon shore He was quite breathless when the guards reached him but insisted on walking up instead of being carried Soon he recovered himself and the rubber protector was pulled off his face Everybody gathered around and Nellie with a strange face and a stranger hope broke through the crowd to see the rescued man Oh it is my father she screamed falling right into the arms of the drenched man Be careful called mister Minturn fearing the child might be mistaken or missus McLaughlin might receive too severe a shock from the surprise But the half drowned man rubbed his eyes as if he could not believe them then the next minute he pressed his little daughter to his heart unable to speak a word What a wonderful scene it was The child almost unconscious in her father s arms he almost dead from exhaustion and the wife and mother too overcome to trust herself to believe it could be true Even the guards who were busy again at the ropes having left the man to willing hands on the beach could not hide their surprise over the fact that it was mother father and daughter there united under such strange conditions My darling my darling exclaimed the sailor to Nellie as he raised himself and then he saw his wife missus Bobbsey had been holding missus McLaughlin back but now the sailor was quite recovered so they allowed her to speak to him mister Bingham and Hal had been watching it all anxiously Are you McLaughlin suddenly asked mister Bingham I am replied the sailor And is George Bingham out there anxiously asked the brother Safe and well came the welcome answer Just waiting for his turn to come in Oh screamed Dorothy Hal s uncle is saved too I guess our prayers were heard last night Here comes another man exclaimed the people as this time a big man dashed on the sands All right exclaimed the man as he landed for he had had a good safe swing in and was in no way exhausted Hello there called mister Bingham Well if this isn t luck George Bingham Sure enough it was Hal s Uncle George and Hal was hugging the big wet man while the man was jolly and laughing as if the whole thing were a good joke instead of the life and death matter it had been I only came in to tell you began George Bingham that we are all right and the boat is lifting off the sand bar we stuck on But I m glad I came in to the reception he said laughing So you ve found friends McLaughlin he added seeing the little family united Why how do you do missus McLaughlin he went on offering her his hand And little Nellie Well I declare we did land on a friendly shore Just as mister Bingham said the life saving work turned out to be a social affair for there was a great time greeting Nellie s father and Hal s uncle Wasn t it perfectly splendid that Nellie and her mother were here declared Dorothy And Hal and his father too put in Nan It is just like a story in a book But we don t have to look for the pictures chimed in Bert who was greatly interested in the sailors as well as in the work of the life saving corps As mister Bingham told the guards it would not be necessary to haul any more men in and as the sea was calm enough now to launch a life boat both Nellie s father and Hal s uncle insisted on going back to the vessel to the other men Nellie was dreadfully afraid to have her father go out on the ocean again but he only laughed at her fears and said he would soon be in to port to go home with her and never go on the big wild ocean again Two boats were launched a strong guard going in each with mister McLaughlin in one and mister Bingham in the other and now they pulled out steadily over the waves back to the vessel that was freeing itself from the sand bar What a morning that was at Sunset Beach The happiness of two families seemed to spread all through the little colony and while the men were thinking of the more serious work of helping the sailors with their vessel the girls and women were planning a great welcome for the men who had been saved from the waves I m so glad we prayed said little Flossie to Freddie when she heard the good news It was Uncle William prayed the loudest insisted Freddie believing firmly that to reach heaven a long and loud prayer is always best But we all helped declared his twin sister while surely the angels had listened to even the sleepy whisper of the little ones who had asked help for the poor sailors in their night of peril CHAPTER XX THE HAPPY REUNION A beautiful day had grown out of the dreadful storm The sun seemed stronger each time it made its way out from behind a cloud just as little girls and boys grow strong in body by exercise and strong in character by efforts to do right And everybody was so happy The Neptune the vessel that had struck on the sand bar was now safely anchored near shore and the sailors came in and out in row boats back and forth to land just as they wished Of course Captain Bingham Hal s uncle was at the Bingham cottage and the first mate Nellie s father was at Minturn s But that evening there was a regular party on Minturn s veranda Numbers of cottagers called to see the sailors and all were invited to remain and hear about the strange voyage of the Neptune There is not much to tell began the captain Of course I knew we were going to have trouble getting that mahogany Two vessels had been wrecked trying to get it so when we got to the West Indies I decided to try canoes and not risk sails where the wind always blew such a gale it dragged any anchor that could be dropped Well it was a long slow job to drag those heavy logs around that point and just when we were making headway along comes a storm that drove the schooner and canoes out of business Here Mate McLaughlin told about the big storm and how long it took the small crew to repair the damage done to the sails Then we had to go back to work at the logs went on the captain and then one of our crew took a fever Well then we were quarantined Couldn t get things to eat without a lot of trouble and couldn t go on with the carting until the authorities decided the fever was not serious That was what delayed us so Finally we had every log loaded on the schooner and we started off But I never could believe any material would be as heavy as that mahogany why we just had to creep along and the least contrary wind left us motionless on the sea We counted on getting home last week when this last storm struck us and drove us out of our course But we are not sorry for our delay now since we have come back to our own About the value asked mister Bobbsey who was down from the city The value repeated the captain aside so that the strangers might not hear Well I m a rich man now and so is my mate McLaughlin for that wood was contracted for by the largest and richest piano firm in this country and now it is all but delivered to them and the money in our hands Then it was well worth all your sacrifice said mister Minturn Yes indeed It would have taken us a lifetime to accumulate as much money as we have earned in this year Of course it was hard for the men who had families McLaughlin especially the others were all working sailors but he was a landsman and my partner in the enterprise but I will make it up to him and the mahogany hunt will turn out the best paying piece of work he ever undertook Oh isn t it perfectly splendid declared Nan and Dorothy hugging Nellie You will never again have to go back to that horrid store that made you so pale and your mother will have a lovely time and nothing to worry about I can hardly believe it all replied their little friend But having father back is the very best of all But all the same sighed Dorothy I just know you will all be going home before we leave for the city and I shall just die of loneliness But we have to go to school said Nan and we have only a few days more Of course continued Dorothy and our school will not open for two weeks yet Maybe Aunt Emily will take you down to the city on her shopping tour suggested Nan Indeed I do not like shopping answered the cousin Every time I go in a store that is crowded with stuff on the counters under people s elbows I feel like knocking the things all over I did a lot of damage that way once It was holiday time and a counter that stuck out in the middle of the store was full of little statues My sleeve touched one and the whole lot fell down as if a cannon had struck them I broke ten and injured more than I wanted to count And Aunt Emily had to pay for them said Nan No she didn t either corrected Dorothy The manager came up and said the things should not be put out in people s way He made the clerks remove all the truck from the aisles and I guess everybody was glad the army fell down I never can forget those pink and white soldiers and Dorothy straightened herself up in comical soldier s arms fashion imitating the unfortunate statues I hope you can come to Lakeport for Thanksgiving said Nan We have done so much visiting this summer out to Aunt Sarah s and down here mamma feels we ought to have a grand reunion at our house next If we do I am going to try to have some of the country girls down and give them all a jolly good time Oh I ll come if you make it jolly answered Dorothy If there is one thing in this world worth while it is fun and she tossed her yellow head about like a buttercup that has no other way of laughing That had been an eventful day at Ocean Cliff and the happy ending of it with a boat and its crew saved was as some of the children said just like a story in a book only the pictures were all alive The largest hotel at Sunset Beach was thrown open to the sailors that night and here Captain Bingham and Mate McLaughlin together with the rest of the crew took up comfortable lodgings It was very late long after the little party had scattered from Minturn s piazza that the sailors finished dancing their hornpipe for the big company assembled to greet them in the hotel Never had they danced to such fine music before for the hotel orchestra played the familiar tune and the sailors danced it nimbly hitching up first one side then the other crossing first one leg then the other and wheeling around in that jolly fashion How rugged and handsome the men looked The rough ocean winds had tanned them like bronze and their muscles were as firm and strong almost as the cables that swing out with the buoys The wonderful fresh air that these men lived in night and day had brightened their eyes too so that even the plainest face and the most awkward man among them was as nimble as an athlete from his perfect exercise And last night what an awful experience they had remarked one of the spectators It is no wonder that they are all so happy to night Besides added someone else they are all going to receive extra good pay for the captain and mate will be very rich when the cargo is landed So the sailors danced until they were tired and then after a splendid meal they went to sleep in as comfortable beds as might be found in any hotel on Sunset Beach CHAPTER XXI GOOD BY I don t know how to say good by to you Nellie told Dorothy and Nan next morning To think how kind you have been to me and how splendidly it has all turned out Now father is home again I can hardly believe it Mother told me last night she was going to put back what money she had to use out of my prize the fifty dollars you know and I am to make it a gift to the Fresh Air Fund Oh that will be splendid declared Nan Perhaps they will buy another tent with it for they need more room out at Meadow Brook You are quite rich now aren t you remarked Dorothy I suppose your father will buy a big house and maybe next time we meet you you will put on airs and walk like this and Dorothy went up and down the room like the pictures of Cinderella s proud sisters No danger replied Nellie whose possible tears at parting had been quickly chased away by the merry Dorothy But I hope we will have a nice home for mother deserves it besides I am just proud enough to want to entertain a few young ladies among them Miss Nan Bobbsey and Miss Dorothy Minturn And we will be on hand thank you replied the joking Dorothy Be sure to have ice cream and chocolates I want some good fresh chocolates Those we get down here always seem soft and salty like the spray Come Nellie called missus McLaughlin I am ready Where is your hat Oh yes mother I m coming replied Nellie Bert had the donkey cart hitched and there was now no time to spare Nellie kissed Freddie and Flossie affectionately and promised to bring the little boy all through a big city real fire engine house when he came to see her And can I ring the bell and make the horses jump he asked We might be able to manage that too Nellie told him My uncle is a fireman and he can take us through his engine house Nan went to the station with her friends and when the last good bys were said and the train steamed out the twins turned back again to the Minturn Cottage Our turn next remarked Bert as he pulled the donkeys into the drive Yes it seems it is nothing but going and coming all the time I wonder if all the other girls will be home at Lakeport in time for the first day of school said Nan Most of them I guess answered Bert Well we have had a good vacation and I am willing to go to work again So am I declared Nan Vacation was just long enough I think mister Bobbsey was down from the city of course to take the family home and now all hands even Freddie and Flossie were busy packing up There were the shells to be looked after the fish nets besides Downy the duck and Snoop the cat And just to add one more animal to your menagerie said Uncle William I have brought you a little goldfinch It will sing beautifully for you and be easy to carry in its little wooden cage Then I have ordered sent directly to your house a large cage for him to live in so he will have plenty of freedom and perhaps Christmas you may get some more birds to put in the big house to keep Dick company Of course Freddie was delighted with the gift for it was really a beautiful little bird with golden wings and a much prettier pet than a duck or a cat although he still loved his old friends The day passed very quickly with all that was crowded into it the last ocean bath taking up the best part of two hours while a sail in Hal s canoe did away with almost as much more time Dorothy gave Nan a beautiful little gold locket with her picture in it and Flossie received the dearest little real shell pocketbook ever seen Hal Bingham gave Bert a magnifying glass to use at school in chemistry or physics so that every

glint of Cousin Dorothy s yellow head passed by the train window I hope we will meet them all soon again said Nan s mother It is not long until Thanksgiving Then perhaps we can give a real harvest party out at Lakeport and try to repay our friends for some of their hospitality to us Well I like Hal Bingham first rate declared Bert thinking of the friend from whom he had just parted There goes
