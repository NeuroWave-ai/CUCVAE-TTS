THE Methodist circuit preacher is in the way of seeing human nature in many rare and curious aspects Under the itinerating system the United States are divided into conferences districts and circuits The conference usually embraces a State the district a certain division of the State or conference and the circuit a portion of the district To every circuit is assigned a preacher who is expected to provide himself with a horse and his duty is to pass round his circuit regularly at appointed seasons through the year and meet the members of the church at the various places of worship established on the circuit Every year he attends the annual conference of preachers at which one of the bishops presides and is liable to be assigned a new circuit in the selection of which as a general thing he has no choice the bishop making all the appointments and so term after term he goes to a new place among strangers Before any strong attachments can be formed the relation between him and his people is severed and he begins as it were life anew hundreds of miles away it may be from any former field of labour To a married man this system is one involving great self denial and sacrifice assuming often a painful character In those circuits that embrace wealthy and populous sections of the country the Methodist minister is well taken care of but there are many other sections where the people are not only very poor but indifferent to matters of religion ignorant in the extreme and not over burdened with kind or generous feelings On circuits of this character the preacher meets sometimes with pretty rough treatment and if for his year s service he is able to get being we will suppose a single man fifty or sixty dollars in money he may think himself pretty well off To one of these hard circuits a preacher whom we shall call the reverend mister Odell of the New Jersey conference found himself assigned by the bishop who presided at the annual conference The change was felt as pretty severe he having been on a comfortable station for two years but as he must take the evil with the good he conscientiously repressed all natural regrets and murmurings and as in duty bound started at the close of the conference for his new field of labour A day or two before leaving and after the appointments were announced mister Odell said to the brother who had ridden that circuit during the previous year So I am to follow in your footsteps It appears so was the brief reply How did you like the circuit I am very well pleased to change Not much encouragement in that answer We can t all have good places Some of us must take our turn in the highways and byways of the land True I am not disposed to complain I have taken up the cross and mean to bear it to the end if possible without a murmur As we all should Well brother Odell if you pass the year on the circuit without a murmur your faith and firmness will be strong I can assure you that it will be more than I did a great deal more I have been among some pretty rough people in my time So have I but and he checked himself however I will not prejudice your mind it would be wrong They do as well I suppose as they know how and the best can do no more Truly said And the more rude ignorant and selfish they are the more need they have of gospel instruction and the more willing should we be to break the bread of life for them If our Master had not even where to lay his head it ill becomes us to murmur because every natural good is not spread out before us In this state of mind Odell went to his new circuit Having deposited his family consisting of a wife and one child in the little village of S with a kind brother who offered them a home at a mere nominal board he mounted his horse and started forth on a three weeks tour among the members of the church to whom he was to minister during the next twelve months in holy things The first preaching place was ten miles distant and the little meeting house stood on the roadside nearly a mile from any dwelling and in an exceedingly poor district of country Before leaving S mister Odell made inquiries of the brother at whose house he was staying in regard to the route he was to take and the people among whom he was going As to the route all that was made satisfactory enough but the account given of the people was not encouraging in a very high degree The fact is said the brother rather warmly it s my opinion that they don t deserve to have the gospel preached among them To this however the preacher very naturally demurred and said that he was not sent to call the righteous but sinners to repentance Where will I stop to night he inquired It was Saturday afternoon and on Sunday morning he was to preach at his first appointment Well said the brother slowly and thoughtfully I can tell you where you ought to stop but I don t know you will be so welcome there as at a poorer place Brother Martin is better able to entertain the preachers comfortably than any one else in that section but I believe he has never invited them home and they have generally gone to the house of a good widow lady named Russell whose barrel of meal and cruse of oil deserve never to fail She is about the only real Christian among them Is brother Martin a farmer Yes and comfortably off but how he ever expects to get his load of selfishness into heaven is more than I can tell You must not be uncharitable brother said Odell I know that but truth is truth However you must see and judge for yourself I think you had better go to the house of sister Russell who will welcome you with all her heart and give you the best she has And I want no more said the preacher After getting precise directions for finding sister Russell he started on his journey It was nearly five o clock and he made his calculation to reach sister Russell s by seven where he would remain all night and go with her to the preaching place on Sunday morning He had not however been half an hour on his journey before heavy masses of deep blue clouds began to roll up from the horizon and spread over the sky and ere he had accomplished half the distance he was going large drops of rain began to fall as the beginning of a heavy storm The preacher was constrained to turn aside and seek the shelter of a farm house where he was received with much kindness Night fall brought no abatement of the tempest The lightning still blazed out in broad masses of fire the thunder jarred and rattled amid the clouds like parks of artillery and the rain continued to pour down unceasingly The invitation to remain all night which the farmer and his wife tendered in all sincerity was not of course declined by the preacher In the morning after being served with a plentiful breakfast Odell returned his warmest thanks for the kindness he had received and proceeded on his journey He had five miles to ride but it was only half past eight o clock when he started and as the hour for preaching was ten there was plenty of time for him to proceed at his leisure As sister Russell lived nearly a mile away from a direct course he did not turn aside to call upon her but went on to the meeting house On reaching the little country church mister Odell found a small company of men assembled in front of the humble building who looked at him curiously and with something of shyness in their manner as he rode up and dismounted No one offering to take his horse he led him aside to a little grove and tied the reins to a tree One or two of the men nodded distantly as he passed them on his way to the meeting house door but none of them spoke to him On entering the meeting house mister Odell found some thirty persons assembled most of them women If there were any official members present they made themselves in no way officious in regard to the preacher who after pausing at the door leading into the little altar or chancel for a short time and looking around with an expression of inquiry on his face ascended the pulpit stairs and took his seat All was as silent almost as if the house had been tenantless In a little while the preacher arose and gave out a hymn but there was no one to raise the tune One looked at another uneasily sundry persons coughed and cleared their throats but all remained silent Odell was not much of a singer but had practised on Old Hundred so much that he could lead that air very well and the hymn happening by good luck to be set to a long metre tune he was able to start it This done the congregation joined in and the singing went off pretty well After praying and reading a chapter in the Bible Odell sat down to collect his thoughts for the sermon which was of course to be extempore as Methodist sermons usually are It is customary for the choir if there is one to sing an anthem during this pause or where no singers are set apart for some members to strike up an appropriate hymn in which the congregation joins On this occasion all was silent After the lapse of a few minutes mister Odell arose and turning in the Bible to the chapter where the text from which he was to preach was recorded read the verse that was to form the groundwork of his remarks Before opening the subject he stated briefly that he was the preacher who was to labour among them during the ensuing year and hoped in the Divine Providence that good both to them and to him would result from the new spiritual relations that were about to be commenced Then proceeding with his discourse he preached to and exhorted them with great earnestness but without seeming to make any impression Not an amen was heard from any part of the house not an eye grew moist not an audible groan or sigh disturbed the air Nothing responded to his appeals but the echo of his own voice Never had the preacher delivered a discourse in which he felt so little freedom His words came back upon his ears with a kind of a dull reverberation as if the hearts of his hearers were of ice instead of flesh Before singing the last hymn which mister Odell gave out at the conclusion of the sermon he announced that he would hold a class meeting After he had finally pronounced the benediction there was a general movement towards the door only seven remained and these were all female members most of them pretty well advanced in their life journey mister Martin was at the meeting but ere the preacher had descended the pulpit stairs he was out of the house and preparing to leave for home Where is the new preacher going asked a member of mister Martin as he led out his horse To sister Russell s I presume Sister Russell is not here Isn t she No she s sick He stayed there last night I suppose and will go back after class Martin sprang upon his horse as he said this We ought to be sure of it remarked the other I can t invite him home said Martin If I do I shall have him through the whole year and that is not convenient The preachers have always stayed at sister Russell s and there is no reason why they shouldn t continue to do so I haven t a corner to put him in remarked the other Besides these preachers are too nice for me It s all right no doubt said Martin as he balanced himself in his saddle all right He stayed at sister Russell s last evening and will go back and stay there until to morrow morning Get up Tom And with this self satisfying remark the farmer rode away The man with whom he had been talking was like him a member and like him had omitted to attend class in order to shift off upon some one else the burden of entertaining the new preacher for whoever first tendered him the hospitalities of his house and table would most probably have to do it through the year He too rode off and left others to see that the preacher was duly cared for An icy coldness pervaded the class meeting Only four out of the seven sisters one of whom was an old black woman could muster up courage enough to tell in answer to the preacher s call the dealing of God with their souls and only two of them could effect an utterance louder than a whisper What they did say had in it but little coherence and mister Odell had to content himself with an exhortation to each of a general rather than a particular character When the hymn was sung at the close only one thin voice joined in the song of praise and not a sob or sigh was heard in response to his prayer The class paper showed the names of thirty members but here were only seven This was rather discouraging for a commencement mister Odell hardly knew what course to take whether to stir up with some pretty sharp remarks the little company of believers who were present and thus seek to impress the whole through them or to wait until he came round again and have a good chance at them from the pulpit He concluded in the end that the last course might be the best one In calling over the names on the class paper he found that sister Russell was absent On dismissing the meeting all except the old black woman retired She lingered however to shake hands with the new preacher and to show him that if she was old her teeth were good and her eyes bright and lively On emerging into the open air Odell saw the last of his flock slowly retiring from the scene of worship For two of the women their husbands had waited on the outside of the meeting house and they had taken into their wagons two other women who lived near them These wagons were already in motion when the preacher came out followed by the old black woman who it now appeared had the key of the meeting house door which she locked Then you are the sexton Aunty remarked Odell with a smile Yes massa I keeps de key Well Nancy said Odell who had already made up his mind what he would do I am going home to dinner with you Me massa Old Nancy looked as much surprised as a startled hare Yes You see they ve all gone and left me and I feel hungry You ll give me some of your dinner Yes massa please God I ll give you all of it but it s only pork and hominy Very good and it will be all the sweeter because I am welcome Deed massa and you is welcome five hundred times over But it was a downright shame for all de white folks to go off so I never seed such people Never mind Nancy don t trouble yourself I shall be well enough taken care of I ll trust to you for that And so mister Odell mounted his horse and accompanied the old woman home She lived rather over a mile from the meeting house and the way was past the comfortable residence of mister Martin The latter did not feel altogether satisfied with himself as he rode home He was not certain that the preacher had stayed at sister Russell s the night before He might have ridden over from S since morning This suggestion caused him to feel rather more uneasy in mind for if this were the case it was doubtful whether after class was over there would be any one to invite him home What kind of a man is the new preacher asked missus Martin of her husband on his return from meeting He seemed like a very good sort of man replied Martin indifferently Is he young or old He s about my age I should think Married I m sure I don t know Did you speak to him No I came away after the sermon Then you didn t stop to class No Sister Russell was not there of course No she s sick So I heard The preacher didn t stay at her house last night How do you know missus Williams called in while you were away She had just been to sister Russell s And the new preacher didn t stay at her house last night No missus Williams asked particularly He must have ridden over from S this morning I am sorry I didn t wait and ask him to come home and stay with us I wish you had Sister Russell is too sick to have him at her house if he should go there Who stayed to class meeting Not over half a dozen and they were all women I left Bill Taylor and Harry Chester waiting outside for their wives They wouldn t ask him home No and if they did I should be sorry to have him go there I wish I had stayed in and invited him home But it can t be helped now and there s no use in fretting over it Soon after this dinner was announced and the farmer sat down with his family to a table loaded with good and substantial things He ate and enjoyed himself though not as highly as he would have done had not thoughts of the new preacher intruded themselves After dinner Martin took a comfortable nap which lasted about an hour He then went out and took a little walk to himself While standing at the gate which opened from his farm on to the county road a man who lived half a mile below came along This man was not a member of any church and took some delight at times in having his jest with professors of religion Fine afternoon mister Ellis said Martin as the man stopped Very fine How are you all Quite well Any news stirring Why no not much Only they say that the Methodists about here have all joined the Amalgamation Society Who says so inquired Martin slightly colouring Well they say it down our way I thought it was only a joke at first But a little while after dinner Aunt Nancy s Tom came over to my house for some oats and hay for your new minister s horse He said the preachers were going to stop at the old woman s after this I half doubted the rascal s story though I let him have the provender Sure enough as I came along just now who should I see but the preacher sitting before the door of old Nancy s log hut as much at home as if his skin were the colour of ebony These are rather queer doings friend Martin I don t know what folks ll say We will not pause to describe the astonishment and confusion of Martin on learning this but step down to Aunt Nancy s where Odell after dining on pork and hominy with the addition of potatoes and corn bread was sitting in the shade before the log cabin of the old negro The latter was busy as a bee inside in preparation of something for the preacher s supper that she thought would be more suited to his mode of living and appetite than pork corn bread and hominy Odell was rather more inclined to feel amused than annoyed at his new position Aunt Nancy s dinner had tasted very good and had been sweetened rather than spoiled by the old creature s loquacious kindness and officious concern lest what she had to set before him would not be relished While he thus sat musing the subject of his thoughts is of no particular consequence to be known his attention was arrested by hearing Aunt Nancy exclaim Ki Here comes Massa Martin The preacher turned his head and saw a man approaching with the decided and rather quick step of one who had something on his mind Is that brother Martin asked mister Odell calling to Aunt Nancy who was near the window of her hut Yes please goodness Wonder what he comin here bout We ll soon see returned the preacher composing himself in his chair In a few minutes the farmer looking sadly flustered arrived at the door of the old negro s humble abode Odell kept his seat with an air of entire self possession and unconcern and looked at the new comer as he would have done at any other stranger mister Odell the new preacher on this circuit said Martin in a respectful manner as he advanced towards the minister Yes sir replied Odell without rising or evincing any surprise at the question I am very sorry indeed sir very sorry began Martin in a deprecating and troubled voice that you should have been so badly neglected as you were to day I had no idea I never once thought the preachers have always stayed at sister Russell s I took it for granted that you were there To think you should not have been invited home by any one I am mortified to death Oh no returned the preacher smiling it is not quite so bad as that Our good old sister here very kindly tendered me the hospitalities of her humble home which I accepted gratefully No one could be kinder to me than she has been no one could have given me a warmer welcome But but stammered forth Martin this is no place for a preacher to stay A far better place than my Lord and Master had The foxes have holes and the birds of the air have nests but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head The servant must not seek to be greater than his Lord But my dear sir my house is a far more suitable and congenial home for you urged the distressed brother Martin You must go home with me at once My wife is terribly hurt about the matter She would have come over for you herself but she is not very well to day Tell the good sister replied Odell affecting not to know the individual before him that I am so comfortable here that I cannot think of changing my quarters Besides after Aunt Nancy has been so kind as to invite me home and provide for both me and my horse when no one else took the least notice of me nor seemed to care whether I got the shelter of a roof or a mouthful of food it would not be right for me to turn away from her because a more comfortable place is offered It was in vain that Martin argued and persuaded The preacher s mind was made up to stay where he was And he did stay with Aunt Nancy until the next morning when after praying with the old lady and giving her his blessing he started on his journey When at the end of four weeks mister Odell again appeared at the little meeting house you may be sure he was received with marked attention Martin was the most forward of all and after preaching and class meeting there was a pretty full attendance at both took the minister home with him Ever since that time the preachers have been entertained at his house THE PROTEST READER did you ever have a visit from that dreaded functionary that rod in pickle held in terrorem over the heads of the whole note paying fraternity yclepted a notary I do not mean to insult you so don t look so dark and dignified I am serious If no why no and there let the matter rest as far as you are concerned if yes why yes and so I have an auditor who can understand me As for me I have been protested I say it neither with shame nor pride Yes I have suffered notarial visitation and am still alive to tell the tale I was in business when the exciting event occurred and I am still in business and I believe as well off as I was then But let me relate the circumstance When I first started in the world for myself I had a few thousand dollars In a little while I found myself solicited on all sides to make bills I could have bought fifty thousand dollars worth of goods as easily as to the amount of five thousand dollars and the smallest sum I have named was about the extent of my real capital There was one firm importunate above the rest and they were successful in getting me into their debt more heavily than I was to any other house If I happened to be passing their store I would be called in with Here Jones I want to show you something New goods just in the very thing for your sales Or Ah how are you Jones Can t we sell you a bill to day They were for ever importuning me to buy and often tempted me to make purchases of goods that I really did not want I was young and green then and did not know any thing about shelves full of odds and ends and piece upon piece of unsaleable goods all of which had to be paid for For two or three years I managed to keep along though not so pleasantly as if I had used my credit with less freedom By that time however the wheels of my business machinery were sadly clogged From a salesman behind my counter I became a financier During the best hours of the day and when I was most wanted in the store I was on the street hunting for money It was borrow borrow borrow and pay pay pay My thoughts were not directed toward the best means of making my business profitable but were upon the ways and means of paying my notes that were falling due with alarming rapidity I was nearly all the time in the delectable state of mind of the individual who on running against a sailor was threatened with being knocked into the middle of next week Do it for heaven s sake he replied I would give the world to be there On Monday morning I could see my way through the week no clearer than this note haunted sufferer In fact I lived a day at a time On the first of each month when I looked over my bill book and then calculated my resources I was appalled I saw nothing ahead but ruin Still I floundered on getting myself deeper and deeper in the mire and rendering my final extrication more and more difficult At last I found that my principal creditors who had sold me so freely from the first and to whom nearly the half of what I owed was due began to be less anxious about selling me goods They did not call me in as of old when I passed nor did they urge me to buy when I went to their store Still they sent home what I ordered but their prices which before were the lowest in the trade were now above the average rates I noticed felt and thought I understood all this I had been careful not to borrow money from that firm still I was borrowing somewhere every day and they of course knew it and began to be a little doubtful of my stability At last I was cornered on a note of a thousand dollars due this house Besides this note I had fifteen hundred dollars of borrowed money to pay At nine o clock I started forth leaving good customers in the store to whom no one could attend as well as myself By twelve o clock I was able to return my borrowed money and had the promise of a thousand dollars by half past one Until half past one I waited when a note came from the friend who had promised the loan informing me with many expressions of regret that he had been disappointed and therefore could not accommodate me Here was a dilemma indeed Half past one o clock and a thousand dollars to raise but there was no time for regrets I started forth with a troubled heart and not feeling very sanguine of success Borrowing money is far from being pleasant employment and is only endurable as a less evil than not meeting your obligations For that day I had thought my trials on this head over but I erred I had again to put on my armour of brass and go forth to meet coldness rebuffs and polite denials Alas I got no more not a dollar rewarded my earnest efforts Two o clock found me utterly discouraged Then for the first time it occurred to me to go to the holders of the note and frankly tell them that I could not lift it But that will ruin your credit with them Yes that was the rub and then it was so mortifying a resource After a short space of hurried reflection I concluded that as I had twice as much credit in other quarters as it was prudent to use I would ask a renewal of the note which would be a great relief It was better certainly than to suffer a protest At the thought of a protest I shuddered and started to see the parties to whom the note was due feeling much as I suppose a culprit feels when about being arraigned for trial It was twenty minutes past two when I called at their store I am sorry I said to one of the firm whom I first met speaking in a husky agitated voice to inform you that I shall not be able to lift my note that falls due to day His brows fell instantly I had made every arrangement to meet it I continued and was to receive the money at one o clock to day but was unexpectedly disappointed I have tried since to raise the amount but find it too late in the day The man s brows fell still lower while his eyes remained steadily fixed upon my face I shall have to ask you to extend it for me I don t think we can do that he coldly replied Will you consult your partners I said time presses The man bowed stiffly his aspect about as pleasing as if I had robbed him and turned away I was standing near the door of the counting room inside of which were his two partners with whom he had retired to confer Jones can t pay his note I heard him say in tones most unpleasant to my ear What was replied Jones Yes Jones What does he want A renewal Nonsense He can pay if he finds he must It is nearly half past two one of them remarked No matter It s of too much importance to him to keep his good name he ll find somebody to help him Threaten him with a protest shake that over his head and the money ll be raised With a Siberian aspect the man returned to me Can t do any thing for you he said Sorry for it My note must lie over then I replied It will be protested The very sound of the word went through me like an arrow I felt the perspiration starting from every pore but I was indignant at the same time and answered as firmly as I could speak Very well let it be As you like he said in the same cold tone and with the same dark aspect partly turning away as he spoke But my dear sir It is useless to waste words he remarked interrupting me You have our ultimatum As I left the store I felt as if I had been guilty of some crime I was ashamed to look even the clerks in the face A feeble resolution to make an effort to save myself from the disgrace and disaster of a protest stirred in my mind but it died away and I returned to my store to await the dread result that must follow this failure to take up my paper I looked at the slow moving hand on the clock and saw minute after minute go by with a stoicism that surprised even myself At last the stroke of the hammer fell the die was cast I would be protested that greatest of all evils dreaded by a man of business As to going home to dinner that was out of the question I could not have eaten a mouthful to save me All I had now to do was to wait for the visit of the notary from which I shrank with a nervous dread Everybody in the street would know him I thought and everybody would see him enter my store and comprehend his business Half past three arrived and yet I had not been bearded by the dread monster at whose very name thousands have trembled and do still tremble I sat awaiting him in stern silence Four o clock and yet he had not come Perhaps it was suggested to me the holders of the note had withdrawn it at the last moment Cheering thought Just then I saw a lad enter the store and speak to one of the clerks who pointed back to where I sat The boy was not over fourteen and had I noticed as he approached a modest rather shrinking look mister Jones he said when he had come near to me Yes I replied indifferently scarcely wondering what he wanted Will you pay this note he said opening a piece of paper that I had not observed in his hand and presenting it to me My head was in a whirl for an instant but was as quickly clear again No my lad I replied in a composed voice I shall not pay it You will not pay it he repeated as if he had not heard me distinctly No said I The lad bowed politely slipped the dishonoured note into his pocket and retired I drew a long breath leaned back in my chair with a sense of relief and murmured Not such a dreadful affair after all So I am protested The operation is over and I hardly felt the pain And now what next As I said this the man whose Siberian face had almost congealed me entered my store and came hurriedly back to where I still remained sitting His face was far less wintry The fact was I owed the firm fifteen thousand dollars which was no joke and they were nearly as much alarmed when they found that my note was actually under protest as I was before the fact Is it possible mister Jones he said his voice as husky and tremulous as mine was when I called upon him an hour or two before that you have suffered your note to lie over Did I not inform you that such would be the case I replied with assumed sternness of voice and manner The boot was on the other leg and I was not slow in recognising the fact But what do you intend to do mister Jones What is the state of your affairs At the proper time I will inform you I answered coldly You have driven me into a protest and you must stand the consequences Are your affairs desperate mister Jones The creditor became almost imploring in his manner They will probably become so now Does a man s note lie over without his affairs becoming desperate Perhaps There was a pause I looked unflinchingly into the man s face If we extend this note and keep the matter quiet what then It won t do I returned More than that will be required to save me My creditor looked frightened while I maintained an aspect of as much indifference and resolution as I could assume What will save you he asked I was thinking as rapidly as I could in order to be prepared for striking while the iron was hot and that to good purpose I ll tell you I replied Well what is it He looked eager and anxious My fault has been one into which your house led me that of buying too freely said I of using my credit injudiciously The consequence is that I am cramped severely and am neglecting my legitimate business in order to run about after money I owe your house more than half of the aggregate of my whole liabilities Give me the time I ask in order to recover myself and curtail my business and I can go through What time do you ask I owe you fifteen thousand dollars So much Yes and the whole of it falls due within seven months What I propose is to pay you five per cent on the amount of my present indebtedness every thirty days from this time until the whole is liquidated you to hand me a thousand dollars to morrow morning to enable me to get my note out of bank in order to save my credit The gentleman looked blank at the boldness of my proposition Is that the best you can do he asked The very best You have driven me into a protest and now the bitterness of that dreaded ordeal being past I prefer making an assignment and having my affairs settled up to going on in the old way I will not continue in business unless I can conduct it easily and safely I am sick of being on the rack I would rather grub for a living I was eloquent in my tone and manner for I felt what I said It shall be as you wish said my creditor You should not you must not make an assignment every interest will suffer in that event We will send you a check for a thousand dollars early to morrow morning and as to what has occurred keep our own counsel I bowed and he bowed I was conscious of having risen in his estimation Get such a man in your power and his respect for you increases fourfold My sleep was sound that night for I was satisfied that the thousand dollars would come And they did come After that I was as easy as an old shoe I was soon off the borrowing list my business I contracted into a narrower and safer sphere and really made more profit than before I have never stood in fear of notaries or protests since Why should I To me the notary proved a lamb rather than a lion and my credit instead of being ruined was saved by a protest RETRENCHMENT OR WHAT A MAN SAVED BY STOPPING HIS NEWSPAPER NOT many years ago a farmer who lived a hundred or two miles from the seaboard became impressed with the idea that unless he adopted a close cutting system of retrenchment he would certainly go to the wall Wheat during the preceding season had been at a high price but unluckily for him he had only a small portion of his land in wheat Of corn and potatoes he had raised more than the usual quantity but the price of corn was down and potatoes were low This year he had sown double the wheat he had ever sown before and instead of raising a thousand bushels of potatoes as he had generally done only planted about an acre in that vegetable the product of which was about one hundred and fifty bushels Unluckily for mister Ashburn his calculations did not turn out well After his wheat was harvested and his potatoes nearly ready to dig the price of the former fell to ninety cents per bushel and the price of the latter rose to one dollar Everywhere the wheat crop had been abundant and almost everywhere the potato crop promised to be light mister Ashburn was sadly disappointed at this result I shall be ruined he said at home and carried a long face while abroad When his wife and daughters asked for money with which to get their fall and winter clothing he grumbled sadly gave them half what they wanted and said they must retrench A day or two afterwards the collector of the Post came along and presented his bill Ashburn paid it in a slow reluctant manner and then said I wish you to have the paper stopped mister Collector Oh no don t say that mister Ashburn You are one of our old subscribers and we can t think of parting with you Sorry to give up the paper But must do it returned the farmer Isn t it as good as ever You used to say you d rather give up a dinner a week than the Post Oh yes it s as good as ever and sometimes I think much better than it was It s a great pleasure to read it But I must retrench at every point and then I don t see how I m to get along Wheat s down to ninety cents and falling daily But the paper is only two dollars a year mister Ashburn I know But two dollars are two dollars However it s no use to talk mister Collector the Post must be stopped If I have better luck next year I will subscribe for it again This left the collector nothing to urge and he withdrew In his next letter to the publishers he ordered the paper to be discontinued which was accordingly done Of this little act of retrenchment Jane Margaret and Phoebe knew nothing at the time and the farmer was rather loathe to tell them When the fact did become known as it must soon he expected a buzzing in the hive and the anticipation of this made him half repent of what he had done and almost wish that the collector would forget to notify the office of his wish to have the paper stopped But the collector was a prompt man On the second Saturday morning Ashburn went to the post office as usual The postmaster handed him a letter saying as he did so I can t find any paper for you to day They have made a mistake in not mailing it this week No replied Ashburn I have stopped it Indeed The Post is an excellent paper What other one do you intend to take I shall not take any newspaper this year replied Ashburn Not take a newspaper mister Ashburn said the postmaster with a look and in a tone of surprise No I must retrench I must cut off all superfluous expenses And I believe I can do without a newspaper as well as any thing else It s a mere luxury though a very pleasant one I own but still dispensable Not a luxury but a necessary I say and indispensable returned the postmaster I don t know what I wouldn t rather do without than a newspaper What in the world are Phoebe and Jane and Margaret going to do They will have to do without There is no help for it If they don t raise a storm about your ears that you will be glad to allay even at the cost of half a dozen newspapers I am mistaken said the postmaster laughing Ashburn replied as he turned to walk away that he thought he could face all storms of that kind without flinching Give me the Post papa said Margaret running to the door to meet her father when she saw him coming I haven t got it replied mister Ashburn feeling rather uncomfortable Why Hasn t it come No is hasn t come Margaret looked very much disappointed It has never missed before she said looking earnestly at her father No suspicion of the truth was in her mind but to the eyes of her father her countenance was full of suspicion Still he had not the courage to confess what he had done The Post hasn t come he heard Margaret say to her sisters a few minutes afterwards and their expressions of disappointment fell rebukingly upon his ears It seemed to mister Ashburn that he heard of little else while in the house during the whole day but the failure of the newspaper When night came even he as he sat with nothing to do but think about the low price of wheat for an hour before bedtime missed his old friend with the welcome face that had so often amused instructed and interested him On Monday morning the girls were very urgent for their father to ride over to the post office and see if the paper hadn t come but of course the farmer was too busy for that On Tuesday and Wednesday the same excuse was made On Thursday Margaret asked a neighbour who was going by the office to call and get the newspaper for them Towards evening mister Markland the neighbour was seen riding down the road and Margaret and Jane ran down eagerly to the gate for the newspaper Did you get the paper for us asked Margaret showing two smiling rows of milk white teeth while her eyes danced with anticipated pleasure mister Markland shook his head Why asked both the girls at once The postmaster says it has been stopped Stopped How changed were their faces and tones of voice Yes He says your father directed it to be stopped That must be a mistake said Margaret He would have told us mister Markland rode on and the girls ran back into the house Father the postmaster says you have stopped the newspaper exclaimed his daughters breaking in upon mister Ashburn s no very pleasant reflections on the low price of wheat and the difference in the return he would receive at ninety cents a bushel to what he would have realized at the last year s price of a dollar twenty five It s true he replied trenching himself behind a firm decided manner But why did you stop it father inquired the girls Because I can t afford to take it It s as much as I shall be able to do to get you enough to eat and wear this year mister Ashburn s manner was decided and his voice had a repelling tone Margaret and Phoebe could say no more but they did not leave their father s presence without giving his eyes the benefit of seeing a free gush of tears It would be doing injustice to mister Ashburn s state of mind to say that he felt very comfortable or had done so since stopping the Post an act for which he had sundry times more than half repented But as it had been done he could not think of recalling it Very sober were the faces that surrounded the supper table that evening and but few words were spoken mister Ashburn felt oppressed and also fretted to think that his daughters should make both themselves and him unhappy about the trifle of a newspaper when he had such serious troubles to bear On the next Saturday as mister Ashburn was walking over his farm he saw a man sitting on one of his fences dressed in a jockey cap and wearing a short hunting coat He had a rifle over his shoulder and carried a powder flask shot and bird bags In fact he was a fully equipped sportsman a somewhat rara avis in those parts What s this lazy fellow doing here said Ashburn to himself I wonder where he comes from Good morning neighbour spoke out the stranger in a familiar way as soon as the farmer came within speaking distance Is there any good game about here Any wild turkeys or pheasants There are plenty of squirrels returned Ashburn a little sarcastically and the woods are full of robbins Squirrels make a first rate pie But I needn t tell you that my friend Every farmer knows the taste of squirrels said the sportsman with great good humour Still I want to try my hand at a wild turkey I ve come off here into the country to have a crack at game better worth the shooting than we get in the neighbourhood of P You re from P then said the farmer Yes I live in P When did you leave there Four or five weeks ago Then you don t know what wheat is selling for now Wheat No I think it was ninety five or a dollar I don t remember which when I left Ninety is all it is selling for here Ninety I should like to buy some at that I have no doubt you can be accommodated replied the farmer That is exceedingly low for wheat If it wasn t for having a week s sport among your wild turkeys and the hope of being able to kill a deer I d stop and buy up a lot of wheat on speculation I ll sell you five hundred bushels at ninety two said the farmer half hoping that this green customer might be tempted to buy at this advance upon the regular rate Will you interrogated the stranger Yes I m half tempted to take you up I really believe I no I must knock over some wild turkeys first It won t do to come this far without bagging rarer game than wheat I believe I must decline friend What would you say to ninety one The farmer had heard a rumour a day or two before of a fall of two or three cents in wheat and if he could get off five hundred bushels upon this sportsman who had let the breast of his coat fly open far enough to give a glimpse of a large thick pocketbook at ninety one it would be quite a desirable operation Ninety one ninety one said the stranger to himself That is a temptation I can turn a penny on that But the wild turkeys I must have a crack at a wild turkey or a deer I think friend he added speaking louder that I will have some sport in these parts for a few days first Then maybe I ll buy up a few thousand bushels of wheat if the prices haven t gone up I shouldn t wonder if prices advanced a little said the farmer Wouldn t you And the stranger looked into the farmer s face with a very innocent expression It can t go much lower if there should be any change it will doubtless be an improvement How much wheat have you asked the sportsman I ve about a thousand bushels left A thousand bushels Ninety cents nine hundred dollars I ll tell you what friend since talking to you has put me into the notion of trying my hand at a speculation on wheat I ll just make you an offer which you may accept or not just as you please I ll give you ninety cents cash for all you ve got one half payable now and the other half on delivery of the wheat at the canal provided you get extra force and deliver it immediately Ashburn stood thoughtful for a moment or two and then replied Very well sir it s a bargain Which to save time we will close immediately I will go with you to your house and pay you five hundred dollars on the whole bill for a thousand bushels The farmer had no objection to this of course and invited the stranger to go to his house with him where the five hundred dollars were soon counted out For this amount of money he wrote a receipt and handed it to the stranger who after reading it said I would prefer your making out a bill for a thousand bushels and writing on it Received on account five hundred dollars It may overrun that quantity said Ashburn No matter a new bill can be made out for that I ll take all you have The farmer saw no objection to the form proposed by the stranger and therefore tore up the receipt he had written and made a bill out in the form desired Will you commence delivering to day inquired the sportsman who all at once began to manifest a marked degree of interest in the business Yes replied the farmer How many wagons have you Two As it is down hill all the way to the canal they can easily take a hundred bushels each Oh yes Very well They can make two loads apiece to day and by starting early three loads apiece on Monday which will transfer the whole thousand bushels to the canal I will go down immediately and see that a boat is ready to commence loading You can go to work at once By extra effort the wheat was all delivered by Monday afternoon and the balance of the purchase money paid As mister Ashburn was riding home a neighbour who had noticed his wagons going past his house with wheat for the two days overtook him So I see friend Ashburn that like me you are content to take the first advance of the market instead of running the risk of a decline for a further rise in prices What did you get for your wheat I sold for ninety cents Ninety cents exclaimed the neighbour Surely you didn t sell for that I certainly did I tried to get ninety two but ninety was the highest offer I could obtain Ninety cents Why what has come over you Ashburn Wheat is selling for a dollar and twenty cents I ve just sold five hundred bushels for that Impossible ejaculated the farmer Not at all impossible Don t you know that by the last arrival from England have come accounts of a bad harvest and that wheat has taken a sudden rise No I don t know any such a thing returned the astonished Ashburn Well it s so Where is your newspaper Haven t you read it I got mine on Friday evening and saw the news Early on Saturday morning I found two or three speculators ready to buy up all the wheat they could get at old prices but they didn t make many operations One fellow who pretended to be a fancy sportsman thrust himself into my way but even if I had not know of a rise in the price of wheat I should have suspected it as soon as I saw him for I read last week of just such a looking chap as him having got ahead of some ignorant country farmers by buying up their produce on a sudden rise of the market at price much below its real value Good day said Ashburn suddenly applying his whip to the flank of his horse and away dashed homeward at a full gallop The farmer never sat down to make a regular calculation of what he had lost by stopping his news paper but it required no formality of pencil and paper to arrive at this A difference of thirty cents on each bushel made for a thousand bushels the important sum of three hundred dollars and this fact his mind instantly saw By the next mail he enclosed two dollars to the publishers of the Post and re ordered the paper He will doubtless think a good while and retrench at a good many points before he orders an other discontinuance HUNTING UP A TESTIMONIAL DOCTOR said a man with a thin sallow countenance pale lips and leaden eyes coming up to the counter of a drug store in Baltimore some ten years ago Doctor I ve been reading your advertisement about the UNIVERSAL RESTORER AND BALSAM OF LIFE and if that mister John Johnson s testimony is to be relied on it ought to suit my case for in describing his own sufferings he has exactly described mine But I ve spent so much money in medicine to no purpose that I am tired of being humbugged so if you ll just tell me where I can find this mister Johnson I ll give him a call I d like to know if he s a real flesh and blood man You don t mean to insinuate that I d forge a testimonial replied the man of medicine with some slight show of indignation Oh no I don t insinuate any thing at all doctor answered the pale looking man But I d like to see this mister John Johnson and have a little talk with him You can do that if you ll take the trouble to call on him said the doctor in an off hand way Where can I find him asked the man He lives a little way out of town about three miles on the Fredrick turnpike Ah so far Yes Go out until you come to the three mile stone then keep on to the first road turning off to the right along which you will go about a quarter of a mile when you will see a brick house mister Johnson lives there The thin sallow faced man bowed and retired As he left the store the doctor gave a low chuckle and then said half aloud I guess he won t try to find this mister John Johnson But he was mistaken Three hours afterwards the sick man entered the shop and sinking upon a chair with an expression of weariness said in a fretful tone Well doctor I ve been out where you said but no mister John Johnson lives there mister Johnson lives at the place to which I directed you said the doctor positively But the man shook his head You went out the Fredrick road to the three mile stone Yes And turned off at the first road on the left hand side You told me the right hand side said the man Oh there s the mistake replied the doctor with the air of a man who had discovered a very material error by which an important result was affected I told you to turn off to the left I m sure you said the right persisted the man Impossible returned the doctor in a most confident tone of voice How could I have said the right hand side when I knew it was the left I know mister Johnson as well as I know my own brother and have been at his house hundreds of times I am almost sure you said the right persisted the man Oh no You misunderstood me most positively answered the doctor Well I must only try it again said the man languidly but shall have to defer the walk until to morrow for I m completely worn down You d better try a bottle of the RESTORER said the doctor with a benevolent smile I know it will just suit your case mister Johnson looked worse than you do when he commenced taking it and three bottles made a well man of him And the doctor held up a bottle of the Restorer with its handsome label temptingly before the eyes of the sick man adding as he did so It is only fifty cents I ve been humbugged too often replied the suspicious patron of patent medicine venders No I ll see mister Johnson first Well did you see mister Johnson asked the doctor with a pleasant smile and confident air as the testimonial hunter entered his shop on the next day about noon No I did not was replied a little impatiently Ah How comes that Did you follow the directions I gave Yes to the very letter Then you must have found mister Johnson But I tell you I didn t It s very strange I can t understand it You turned off at the first road to the left after passing the third milestone I did Two tall poplars stood at the gate which opened from the turnpike What gate The gate opening into the lane leading to mister Johnson s house I didn t turn of at any gate said the man I kept on as you directed to the first road that led off from the turnpike You didn t mention any thing about a gate I didn t suppose it necessary replied the doctor with a show of impatience A road is a road whether you enter it by a gate or in any other manner Roads leading to gentlemen s country seats are not usually left open for every sort of ingress and egress I don t wonder that you were unable to find mister Johnson I wish you d give me a more particular direction said the invalid I m nearly dead now with fatigue I ll try once more to find this man and if I don t turn him up I ll let the matter drop I don t believe your medicine will do me much good anyhow I m sure it will help you replied the doctor I can tell from your very countenance that it is what you want Hundreds affected as you are have been restored to health Better take a bottle I want to see this mister Johnson first persisted the sick man Get a carriage then This walking in the hot sun is too much for you Can t afford to ride in carriages Have spent all my money in doctor stuffs Oh dear Well You say this man lives just beyond the three mile stone at the first road leading off to the left Yes Two poplars stand at the gate Yes I ought to find that said the man You can find it if you try returned the doctor The man started off again Plague on the persevering fellow muttered the man of drugs as soon as the invalid retired I wish I d sent him six miles instead of three The day wore on but the testimonial hunter did not reappear Early on the next morning however his pale thin face and emaciated brows were visible in the shop of the quack doctor Ah good morning good morning cried the latter with one of the most assured smiles in the world You found mister Johnson and pleasant of course Confound you and mister Johnson too No replied the invalid impatiently The doctor was a man of great self control and of course did not in the least become offended Strange said he seriously You surely didn t follow my directions I surely did The first gate on the left hand side But your two tall poplars was one tall elm There it is again and the doctor in the fulness of his surprise actually let a small package that he held in his hand fall upon the counter I told you poplars distinctly The elm tree gate is at least a quarter of a mile this side But to settle the matter at once and the doctor speaking like a man who was about doing a desperate thing turned to his shelves and took therefrom a bottle of the Universal Restorer here s the medicine I know it will cure you Take a bottle It shall cost you nothing The sick man tempted strongly by the hope of a cure hesitated for a short time and then said I don t want your stuff for nothing But half a dollar won t kill me So he drew a coin from his pocket laid it upon the counter and taking the medicine went slowly away Rather a hard customer that said the doctor to himself with a chuckle as he slipped the money in his drawer But I ll take good care to send the next one like him a little farther on his fool s errand He d much better have taken my word for it in the beginning The sick man never came back for a second bottle of the Restorer Whether the first bottle killed or cured him is to the chronicler unknown 
4948-28002-0000	train-other-500	TRYING TO BE A GENTLEMAN THE efforts which certain young men make on entering the world to become gentlemen is not a little amusing to sober thoughtful lookers on
4948-28002-0001	train-other-500	To become is not perhaps what is aimed at so much as to make people believe that they are gentlemen for if you should happen to insinuate any thing to the contrary no matter how wide from the mark they go
4948-28002-0002	train-other-500	you may expect to receive summary punishment for your insolence One of these characters made himself quite conspicuous in Baltimore a few years ago His name was L and he hailed from Richmond we believe
4948-28002-0003	train-other-500	and built some consequence upon the fact that he was a son of the Old Dominion He dressed in the extreme of fashion spent a good deal of time strutting up and down Market street switching his rattan boarded at one of the hotels
none	none	 drank wines freely and pretended to be quite a judge of their quality swore round oaths occasionally and talked of his honour as a gentleman His knowledge of etiquette he obtained from books 
4948-28002-0004	train-other-500	and was often quite as literal in his observance of prescribing modes and forms as was the Frenchman in showing off his skill in our idioms when he informed a company of ladies as an excuse for leaving them that he had some fish to fry
4948-28002-0005	train-other-500	That he was no gentleman internally or externally was plain to every one yet he verily believed himself to be one of the first water and it was a matter of constant care to preserve the reputation
4948-28002-0006	train-other-500	Among those who were thrown into the society of this L was a young man named Briarly who had rather more basis to his character and who although he dressed well and moved in good society
4948-28002-0007	train-other-500	by no means founded thereon his claim to be called a gentleman He never liked L because he saw that he had no principle whatever that all about him was mere sham The consequence was that he was hardly civil to him
4948-28002-0008	train-other-500	a circumstance which L was slow either to notice or resent It happened one day that the tailor of Briarly asked him if he knew any thing about L Not much replied Briarly Why do you ask
4948-28002-0009	train-other-500	Do you think him a gentleman How do you estimate a gentleman asked the young man A gentleman is a man of honour returned the tailor Very well
4948-28002-0010	train-other-500	then L must be a gentleman for he has a great deal to say about his honour I know he has
none	none	 but I find that those who talk much of their honour 
4948-28002-0011	train-other-500	don t as a general thing possess much to brag of Then he talks to you of his honour Oh yes and gives me his word as a gentleman Does he always keep his word as a gentleman
none	none	 The tailor shrugged his shoulders Not always he replied Then I should say that the word of a gentleman isn t worth much smilingly remarked Briarly 
4948-28002-0012	train-other-500	Not the word of such broadcloth and buckram gentlemen as he is Take care what you say or you may find yourself called to account for using improper language about this gentleman We may have a duel on the carpet
4948-28002-0013	train-other-500	It would degrade him to fight with a tailor replied the man of shears So I may speak my mind with impunity But if he should challenge me I will refuse to fight him on the ground that he is no gentleman
none	none	 Indeed How will you prove that 
4948-28002-0014	train-other-500	Every man must be permitted to have his own standard of gentility Certainly I have mine Ah Well how do you measure gentility By my ledger
4948-28002-0015	train-other-500	A man who doesn t pay his tailor s bill I consider no gentleman If L sends me a challenge I will refuse to fight him on that ground
none	none	 Good said Briarly laughing 
4948-28002-0016	train-other-500	I m afraid if your standard were adopted that a great many who now pass themselves off for gentlemen would be held in little estimation It is the true standard nevertheless replied Shears
4948-28002-0017	train-other-500	A man may try to be a gentleman as much as he pleases but if he don t try to pay his tailor s bill at the same time he tries in vain You may be right enough remarked Briarly a good deal amused at the tailor s mode of estimating a gentleman
none	none	 and possessed of a new fact in regard to L s claim to the honourable distinction of which he so often boasted 
4948-28002-0018	train-other-500	Shortly after this it happened that L made Briarly angry about something when the latter very unceremoniously took hold of the handle on the young man s face and moved his head around
4948-28002-0019	train-other-500	Fortunately the body moved with the head or the consequences might have been serious There were plenty to assure L that for this insult he must if he wished to be considered a gentleman challenge Briarly and shoot him if he could
none	none	 Several days elapsed before L s courage rose high enough 
4948-28002-0020	train-other-500	to enable him to send the deadly missive by the hand of a friend Meantime a wag of a fellow an intimate friend of Briarly s appeared in Market street in an old rusty coat worn hat
4948-28002-0021	train-other-500	and well mended but clean and whole trowsers and vest Friend after friend stopped him and in astonishment inquired the cause of this change He had but one answer in substance But we will give his own account
4948-28002-0022	train-other-500	of the matter as related to three or four young bucks in an oyster house where they happened to meet him L was of the number A patch on your elbow Tom as I live said one and here s another on your vest Why
4948-28002-0023	train-other-500	old fellow this is premeditated poverty Better wear patched garments than owe for new ones replied Tom with great sobriety Bless us when did you turn economist Ever since I tried to be a gentleman
4948-28002-0024	train-other-500	What Ever since I tried to be a gentleman I may strut up and down Market street in fine clothes switch my rattan about talk nonsense to silly ladies swear and drink wine
4948-28002-0025	train-other-500	but if I don t pay my tailor I m no gentleman Nonsense was replied There was a general laugh but few of Tom s auditors felt very much flattered by his words No nonsense at all he said
4948-28002-0026	train-other-500	We may put on airs of gentility boast of independence and spirit and all that but it s a mean kind of gentility that will let a man flourish about in a fine coat for which he owes his tailor
none	none	 Wyville has a large bill against me for clothes Grafton another for boots and Cox another for hats 
4948-28002-0027	train-other-500	I am trying to pay these off trying to become a gentleman Then you don t consider yourself a gentleman now said one Oh no I m only trying to become a gentleman meekly replied Tom
4948-28002-0028	train-other-500	though a close observer could see a slight twitching in the corner of his mouth and a slight twinkle in the corner of his eye My honour is in pawn and will remain so until I pay these bills
4948-28002-0029	train-other-500	Then I shall feel like holding up my head again and looking gentlemen in the face The oddness of this conceit and the boldness with which it was carried out attracted attention and made a good deal of talk at the time
4948-28002-0030	train-other-500	A great many tailors bills were paid instanter that would not have been paid for months perhaps not at all In a few days however Tom appeared abroad again quite as handsomely dressed as before
4948-28002-0031	train-other-500	alleging that his uncle had taken compassion on him and out of admiration for his honest principles paid off his bills and made a gentleman of him once more No one of course believed Tom to be sincere in all this
4948-28002-0032	train-other-500	It was looked upon as one of his waggish tricks intended to hit off some one or perhaps the whole class of fine tailor made gentlemen who forget their benefactors While Tom was metamorphosed as stated
4948-28002-0033	train-other-500	Briarly was waited upon one day by a young man who presented him with a challenge to mortal combat from the insulted L and desired him to name his friend I cannot accept the challenge said Briarly promptly
4948-28002-0034	train-other-500	Why not asked the second of L in surprise Because your principal is no gentleman What Is no gentleman coolly returned Briarly Explain yourself sir if you please
4948-28002-0035	train-other-500	He doesn t pay his tailor he doesn t pay his boot maker he doesn t pay his hatter he is therefore no gentleman and I cannot fight him You will be posted as a coward said the second fiercely
4948-28002-0036	train-other-500	In return for which I will post him as no gentleman and give the evidence replied Briarly I will take his place You will hear from me shortly said the second turning away Be sure you don t owe your tailor any thing
4948-28002-0037	train-other-500	for if you do I will not stoop to accept your challenge returned Briarly I will consider it prima facie evidence that you are no gentleman I know Patterson very well and will in the mean time inform myself on the subject
4948-28002-0038	train-other-500	All this was said with the utmost gravity and with a decision of tone and manner that left no doubt of the intention The second withdrew An hour elapsed but no new challenge came
4948-28002-0039	train-other-500	Days went by but no posters drew crowds at the corners Gradually the matter got wind to the infinite amusement of such as happened to know L who was fairly driven from a city where it was no use trying to be a gentleman
none	none	 without paying his tailor s bill 
4693-28003-0000	train-other-500	TAKING A PRESCRIPTION SUMMER before last the time when cholera had poisoned the air a gentleman of wealth standing and intelligence
4693-28003-0001	train-other-500	from one of the Southern or Middle States while temporarily sojourning in Boston felt certain premonitory symptoms that were rather alarming all things considered
4693-28003-0002	train-other-500	So he inquired of the hotel keeper where he could find a good physician One of your best said he with an emphasis in his tones that showed how important was the matter in his eyes
none	none	 Doctor 
4693-28003-0003	train-other-500	stands at the head of his profession in our city returned the hotel keeper
none	none	 You may safely trust yourself in his hands 
4693-28003-0004	train-other-500	Thank you I will call upon him immediately said the gentleman and away he went The doctor fortunately as the gentleman mentally acknowledged was in his office
none	none	 The latter after introducing himself stated his case with some concern of manner when the doctor felt his pulse looked at his tongue and made sundry professional inquiries 
4693-28003-0005	train-other-500	Your system is slightly disturbed remarked the doctor after fully ascertaining the condition of his patient
4693-28003-0006	train-other-500	but I ll give you a prescription that will bring all right again in less than twenty four hours And so he took out his pencil and wrote a brief prescription How much am I indebted doctor
4693-28003-0007	train-other-500	inquired the gentleman as he slipped the little piece of paper into his vest pocket Five dollars for the consultation and prescription replied the doctor bowing
4693-28003-0008	train-other-500	Cheap enough if I am saved from an attack of cholera said the patient as he drew forth his pocket book and abstracted from its folds the required fee He then returned to the hotel
4693-28003-0009	train-other-500	and going to one of the clerks or bar keeper in the office said to him I wish you would send out and get me this prescription Prescription Why
none	none	 mister are you sick 
4693-28003-0010	train-other-500	returned the bar keeper I m not very well was answered What s the matter Symptoms of the prevailing epidemic Oh Ah And you ve been to see a doctor Yes Who
none	none	 Doctor 
4693-28003-0011	train-other-500	The bar keeper shrugged his shoulders as he replied Good physician None better That all acknowledge But if you ll let me prescribe for you
4693-28003-0012	train-other-500	I ll put you all straight in double quick time Well what will you prescribe Andy said the gentleman I ll prescribe this And as he spoke he drew from under the counter a bottle labelled
none	none	 missus s 
4693-28003-0013	train-other-500	Cordial Take a glass of that and you can throw your doctor s prescription into the fire You speak confidently Andy I do for I know its virtue
4693-28003-0014	train-other-500	The gentleman who had in his hand a prescription for which he had paid five dollars to one of the most skilful and judicious physicians in New England strange as it may seem listened to this bar keeper
4693-28003-0015	train-other-500	and in the end actually destroyed the prescription and poured down his throat a glass of
none	none	 missus s Cordial 
4693-28003-0016	train-other-500	It is no matter of surprise that ere ten o clock in the evening the gentleman s premonitory symptoms which had experienced a temporary abatement assumed a more alarming character
4693-28003-0017	train-other-500	And now instead of going to he was obliged to send for a physician Doctor
none	none	 whom he had consulted 
4693-28003-0018	train-other-500	was called in and immediately recognised his patient of the morning I m sorry to find you worse said he I did not in the least doubt the efficacy of the remedy I gave you But
4693-28003-0019	train-other-500	have you taken the prescription Wh wh why no doctor stammered the half ashamed patient I confess that I did not I took something else Something else What was it
none	none	 I thought a glass of missus s cordial would answer just as well 
4693-28003-0020	train-other-500	You did and pray who prescribed this for you said the doctor moving his chair instinctively from his patient and speaking in a rather excited tone of voice
4693-28003-0021	train-other-500	No one prescribed it I took it on the recommendation of the bar keeper down stairs who said that he knew it would cure me And you had my prescription in your pocket at the same time
4693-28003-0022	train-other-500	The prescription of a regular physician of twenty five years practice set aside for a quack nostrum recommended by a bar keeper A fine compliment to common sense and the profession truly
none	none	 My friend if I must speak out plainly you deserve to die and I shouldn t much wonder if you got your deserts Good evening Saying this the doctor arose and was moving towards the door 
4693-28003-0023	train-other-500	when the frightened patient called to him in such appealing tones that he was constrained to pause A humble confession of error and repeated apologies softened the physician s suddenly awakened anger
4693-28003-0024	train-other-500	and he came back and resumed his seat My friend said he on recovering his self possession which had been considerably disturbed
none	none	 Do you know the composition of missus s cordial 
4693-28003-0025	train-other-500	which you took with so much confidence I do not replied the gentleman Humph Well I can tell you About nine tenths of it is cheap brandy or New England rum
4693-28003-0026	train-other-500	which completely destroys or neutralizes
none	none	 the salutary medicaments that form the tithe thereof 
4693-28003-0027	train-other-500	I don t wonder that this stuff has aggravated all your symptoms
none	none	 I would if in your state of health 
4693-28003-0028	train-other-500	about as leave take poison Pray don t talk to me in that way doctor said the patient imploringly I am sick and what you say can only have the effect to make me worse
4693-28003-0029	train-other-500	I am already sufficiently punished for my folly Prescribe for me once more and be assured that I will not again play the fool
none	none	 Doctor s professional indignation had pretty well burned itself out by this time 
4693-28003-0030	train-other-500	so he took up the case again and once more gave a prescription In a couple of days the gentleman was quite well again but that missus
none	none	 s 
4693-28003-0031	train-other-500	cordial cost him twenty dollars He is now a little wiser than he was before and is very careful as to whose prescriptions he takes It would be better for the health of the entire community if every individual would be as careful
4693-28003-0032	train-other-500	in the same matter as he is now Those who are sick should ere taking medicine consult a physician of experience and skill but above all things
4693-28003-0033	train-other-500	they should shun advertised nostrums in the sale of which the manufacturers and vendors are interested Often testimonials as to their efficacy are mere forgeries
none	none	 Health is too vital a thing to be risked in this way THE YANKEE AND THE DUTCHMAN OR I LL GIVE OR TAKE A SHREWD Yankee with about five hundred dollars in his pocket came along down South a few years ago seeking for some better investment of his money than offered in the land of steady habits where he found people as a general thing quite as wide awake as himself In Philadelphia our adventurer did not stay long but something in the air of Baltimore pleased him and he lingered about there for several weeks prying into every thing and getting acquainted with everybody that was accessible Among others for whom the Yankee seemed to take a liking was a Dutchman who was engaged in manufacturing an article for which there was a very good demand and on which there was a tempting profit He used to drop in almost every day and have a talk with the Dutchman who seemed like a good easy kind of a man and just the game for the Yankee if he should think it worth the candle Why don t you enlarge your business asked Jonathan one day You can sell five times what you make I knows dat returned the Dutchman but I wants de monish Wait a while den I enlarsh Then you are laying by something Leetle mite In two or three days Jonathan came round again He had thought the matter all over and was prepared to invest his five hundred dollars in the Dutchman s business provided the latter had no objections It s a pity to creep along in the way you are going he said when so much money might be made in your business by the investment of more capital Can t you borrow a few hundred dollars Me borrow Oh no nobody lend me few hunnard dollar I go on save up bimeby I enlarsh But somebody else with plenty of money might go into the business and fill the market then it would be no use to enlarge Sorry but can t help it No monish no enlarsh I ve got five hundred dollars The phlegmatic Dutchman brightened up Fife hunnard dollar Yes Much monish Do great business on fife hunnard dollar That you could You lend me de monish asked the Dutchman Jonathan shook his head Can t do that I m going into business myself Ah what business Don t know yet haven t decided Into your business maybe My business The Dutchman looked surprised Yes it appears to me like a very good business Don t you think I could start very fair on five hundred dollars The Dutchman hesitated to answer that question he didn t want to say yes and he was conscious that the Yankee knew too much of his affairs to believe him if he said no He therefore merely shrugged his shoulders looked stupid and remained silent You don t know of a large room that I could get anywhere do you The Dutchman shook his head and gave a decided negative Jonathan said no more on that occasion Two days afterwards he dropped in again Have you fount a room yet asked the Dutchman I ve seen two or three replied Jonathan One of them will suit me I guess But I ll tell you what I ve been thinking about since I saw you If I open another establishment the business will be divided Now it has struck me that perhaps it might be better all round for me to put my five hundred dollars into your business as a partner and push the whole thing with might and main How does it strike you Vell I can t say shust now I ll dink of him You put in fife hunnard dollar you say Yes five hundred down in hard cash every dollar in gold Fife hunnard Let us see And the Dutchman raised his chin and dropped his eyes and stood for some minutes in a deep study Fife hunnard he repeated several times Come to morrow he at length said Den I tell you Very well I ll drop in to morrow replied the Yankee I m not very anxious about it you see but as the thing occurred to me I thought I would mention it Five hundred dollars will make a great difference in your business On the next day Jonathan appeared looking quite indifferent about the matter The Dutchman had turned over the proposition and dreamed about it both sleeping and waking His final decision was to take in the Yankee as a partner Now a cool thoughtful Dutchman and a quick witted Yankee are not a very bad match for each other provided the former sees reason to have his wits about him which was the case in the present instance The Dutchman meant all fair he had no thought of taking any advantage but he had suspicion enough of Jonathan to put him on his guard and look to see that no high handed game was played off upon him You put in fife hunnard dollar he said when the Yankee appeared Yes Hard cash Yes in gold Gold All in half eagles like these And he drew a handful of gold coins from his pocket Very well I dake you You put in fife hunnard dollar I put in all I got here den we joint owner Equal partners Yes That is I own half and you half Yes And we divide equally the profits Yes Very well that ll do I guess We ll have writings drawn to this effect articles of company partnership you know Oh yes This settled nothing remained but to have the articles drawn the money paid in and the agreement signed and witnessed all of which was done in the course of a few weeks Then Jonathan went into the business and infused some Yankee spirit into every part of it he made things move ahead fast In less than a year the business was much more than doubled and the profits in proportion thut Jonathan was not satisfied with his half of these he wanted the whole and hedge hog like he did all he could by merely bristling up to make things unpleasant for his partner But the Dutchman was by no means thin skinned the sharp spikes of the Yankee s character annoyed him but little As for himself he felt very well satisfied with his share of the profits and willing to go on as they were going At the end of the second year when the establishment had grown into quite an important and profitable concern the Yankee had a visit from an Eastern friend a man of some capital That s a stupid looking fellow that partner of yours said this person And he is as stupid as a mule I have to carry him on my back and the business too Why don t you get rid of him I ve been wanting to do so for some time but haven t seen my way clear yet Does your partnership expire at any time by limitation No It can only be dissolved by mutual consent Won t he sell out his interest I don t know but I ve always intended to make him an offer to give or take as soon as I could see my way clear to do it Don t you see your way clear now No When such an offer is made it must be of a sum that it is impossible for him to raise otherwise he might agree to give the amount proposed and I don t want that I wish to stick to the business for it s going to be a fortune At present I am not able to raise what I think should be offered How much is that About three thousand dollars I only put in five hundred two years ago You can see how the business has increased The half is worth five thousand in reality and I would give rather than take that sum You think your partner can t raise three thousand dollars Oh no he s got no friends and he hasn t three hundred out of the business How long would you want the sum mentioned A year or eighteen months I reckon I can supply it said the friend It s a pity for you to be tied to this old Dutchman when you can conduct the business just as well yourself A great deal better he is only in my way Very well You make him the offer to give or take three thousand dollars and I will supply the money But you ought by all means to add a stipulation that whoever goes out shall sign a written agreement not to go into the same business for at least ten years to come If you don t do this he can take his three thousand dollars and start another establishment upon as large a scale as the one you have and seriously affect your operations Such a stipulation must be signed of course remarked Jonathan I ve always had that in my mind let me once get this business into my hands and I ll make it pay better than it ever has yet Before ten years roll over my head if I a n t worth forty or fifty thousand dollars then I don t know any thing You think it will pay like that Yes I know it I haven t put out half my strength yet for I didn t want to let this Dutchman see what could be made of the business He ll catch at three thousand dollars like a trout at a fly it s more money than he ever saw in his life On the next day Jonathan told his partner that he wanted to have some talk with him so they retired into their little private office to be alone Vat you want said the Dutchman when they were by themselves for he saw that his partner had something on his mind of graver import than usual I m tired of a company partnership business said the Yankee coming straight to the main point Vell And the Dutchman looked at him without betraying the least surprise Either of us could conduct this business as well as both together Vell Now I propose to buy you out or sell you my interest as you please Vell What will you give me for my half of the business and let me go at something else The Dutchman shook his head At a word then to make the matter as simple as possible and as fair as possible I ll tell you what I ll give or take Vell Of course it would not be fair for the one who goes out to commence the same business I would not do it There should be a written agreement to this effect Yes Vell vat vill you give or dake I ll give or take three thousand dollars I don t care which Dree dousand dollar You give dat Yes Or take dat Either You pay down de monish Cash down Humph Dree dousand dollar Me tink about him How long do you want to think Undil de mornin Very well we ll settle the matter to morrow morning In the morning Jonathan s friend came with three thousand dollars in order to pay the Dutchman right down and have the whole business concluded while the matter was warm Meantime the Dutchman who was not quite so friendless nor so stupid as the Yankee supposed turned the matter over in his mind very coolly He understood Jonathan s drift as clearly as he understood it himself and was fully as well satisfied as he was in regard to the future value of the business which he had founded Two of their largest customers were Germans and to them he went and made a full statement of his position and gave them evidence that entirely satisfied them as to the business Without hesitation they agreed to advance him the money he wanted and to enable him to strike while the iron was hot checked him out the money on the next morning One of them accompanied him to his manufactory to be a witness in the transaction Jonathan and his friend were first on the spot In about ten minutes the Dutchman and his friend arrived Well have you made up your mind yet asked the Yankee De one who goes out ish not to begin de same business No certainly not it wouldn t be fair No I spose not Suppose we draw up a paper and sign it to that effect before we go any farther Vell The paper was drawn signed and witnessed by the friends of both parties You are prepared to give or take said Jonathan with same eagerness in his manner Yes Well which will you do I vill give coolly replied the Dutchman Give echoed the Yankee taken entirely by surprise at so unexpected a reply Give You mean take I no means dake I means give Here ish de monish and he drew forth a large roll of bank bills You say give or dake I say give With the best face it was possible to put upon the matter Jonathan who could not back out took the three thousand dollars and for that sum signed away on the spot all right title and claim to benefit in the business from that day henceforth and for ever With his three thousand dollars in his pocket the Yankee started off farther South vowing that if he lived to be as old as Methuselah he d never have any thing to do with a Dutchman again 
4687-28005-0000	train-other-500	A TIPSY PARSON IN a village not a hundred miles from Philadelphia
none	none	 resided the reverend mister Manlius 
4687-28005-0001	train-other-500	who had the pastoral charge of a very respectable congregation and was highly esteemed by them but there was one thing in which he did not give general satisfaction and in consequence of which many excellent members of his church felt seriously scandalized
4687-28005-0002	train-other-500	He would neither join a temperance society
none	none	 nor omit his glass of wine when he felt inclined to take it It 
4687-28005-0003	train-other-500	is only fair to say however that such spirituous indulgences were not of frequent occurrence It was more the principle of the thing as he said that he stood upon than any thing else that prevented his signing a temperance pledge
4687-28005-0004	train-other-500	Sundry were the attacks both open and secret to which the Reverend mister Manlius was subjected and many were the discussions into which he was drawn by the advocates of total abstinence His mode of argument was very summary
4687-28005-0005	train-other-500	I would no more sign a pledge not to drink brandy than I would sign a pledge not to steal was the position he took I wish to be free to choose good or evil and to act right because it is wrong to do otherwise
4687-28005-0006	train-other-500	I do not find fault with others for signing a pledge nor for abstaining from wine If they think it right it is right for them But as for myself
none	none	 I would cut off my right hand before I would bind myself by mere external restraint 
4687-28005-0007	train-other-500	My bonds are internal principles I am temperate because intemperance is sin For men who have abused their freedom and so far lost all rational control over themselves that they cannot resist the insane spirit of intemperance
4687-28005-0008	train-other-500	the pledge is all important Sign it I say in the name of Heaven but do not sign it because this that or the other temperate man has signed it but because you feel it to be your only hope Do it for yourself
4687-28005-0009	train-other-500	and do it if you are the only man in the world who acts thus To sign because another man whom you think more respectable has signed will give you little or no strength You must do it for yourself and because it is right
4687-28005-0010	train-other-500	The parson was pretty ready with the tongue and rarely came off second best when his opponents dragged him into a controversy although his arguments were called by them when he was not present mere fustian
4687-28005-0011	train-other-500	His love for wine and brandy is at the bottom of all this hostility to the temperance cause was boldly said of him by individuals in and out of his church But especially were the members of other churches severe upon him He ll turn out a drunkard said one
none	none	 I shouldn t be surprised to see him staggering in the streets before two years said another 
4687-28005-0012	train-other-500	He does more harm to the temperance cause than ten drunkards alleged a third While others said Isn t it scandalous He s a disgrace to his profession He pretend to have religion A minister indeed And so the changes rang
4687-28005-0013	train-other-500	All this time mister Manlius firmly maintained his ground taking his glass of wine whenever it suited him At last
none	none	 after the occurrence of a dinner party given by a family of some note in the place and at which the minister was present 
4687-28005-0014	train-other-500	and at which wine was circulated freely a rather scandalous report got abroad and soon went buzzing all over the village A young man who made no secret of being fond of his glass and who was at the dinner party met on the day after
4687-28005-0015	train-other-500	a very warm advocate of temperance and a member of a different denomination from that in which mister Manlius was a minister and said to him with mock gravity We had a rara avis at our dinner party yesterday Perkins Indeed What wonderful thing was that
4687-28005-0016	train-other-500	A tipsy parson A what The man s eyes became instantly almost as big as saucers A tipsy parson Who mister Manlius was eagerly inquired I didn t say so I call no names
4687-28005-0017	train-other-500	He was present I know and drank wine I am told like a fish I wasn t aware before that fishes drank wine said the man gravely It was Manlius wasn t it urged the other I call no names was repeated
4687-28005-0018	train-other-500	All I said was that we had a tipsy parson and so we had I ll prove it before a jury of a thousand if necessary It s no more than I expected said the temperance man
none	none	 He s a mere winebibber at best 
4687-28005-0019	train-other-500	He pretend to preach the gospel I wonder he isn t struck dead in the pulpit The moment his informant had left him
none	none	 Perkins started forth to communicate the astounding intelligence that mister Manlius had been drunk on the day before 
4687-28005-0020	train-other-500	at mister Reeside s dinner party From lip to lip the scandal flew with little less than electric quickness It was all over the village by the next day Some doubted some denied but the majority believed the story it was so likely to be true
none	none	 This occurred near the close of the week and Sunday arrived before the powers that be in the church were able to confer upon the subject 
4687-28005-0021	train-other-500	and cite the minister to appear and answer for himself on the scandalous charge of drunkenness There was an unusual number of vacant pews during service both morning and afternoon Monday came
4687-28005-0022	train-other-500	and early in the day a committee of two deacons waited upon mister Manlius and informed him of the report in circulation and of their wish that he would appear before them on the next afternoon to give an account of himself
4687-28005-0023	train-other-500	as the church deemed the matter far too serious to be passed lightly over The minister was evidently a good deal surprised and startled at this but he neither denied the charge nor attempted any palliation merely saying that he would attend of course
none	none	 It s plain that he s guilty said Deacon Jones to Deacon Todd 
4687-28005-0024	train-other-500	as they walked with sober faces away from the minister s dwelling Plain Yes it s written in his face returned Deacon Todd So much for opposing temperance reforms and drinking wine It s a judgment upon him But what a scandal to our church said Deacon Jones
4687-28005-0025	train-other-500	Yes think of that He must be suspended and not restored until he signs the pledge I don t believe he ll ever do that Why not He says he would cut off his right hand first People are very fond of cutting off their right hand you know
4687-28005-0026	train-other-500	My word for it this will do the business for him
none	none	 He will be glad enough to get the matter hushed up so easily 
4687-28005-0027	train-other-500	I shall go for suspending him until he signs the pledge I don t know but that I will go with you If he signs the pledge he s safe And so the two deacons settled the matter On the next day in grave council assembled were all the deacons of the church
4687-28005-0028	train-other-500	besides sundry individuals who had come as the minister s friends or accusers Perkins who had put the report in circulation was there at the special request of one of the deacons who had ascertained that he had as much or a little more to say in the matter than any one
4687-28005-0029	train-other-500	Perkins was called upon rather unexpectedly to answer one or two questions immediately on the opening of the meeting but as he was a stanch temperance man and cordially despised the minister he was bold to reply
4687-28005-0030	train-other-500	mister Perkins said the presiding deacon as far as we can learn this scandalous charge originated with you I will therefore ask you
none	none	 did you say that the reverend mister Manlius was drunk at mister Reeside s dinner party 
4687-28005-0031	train-other-500	I did was the unhesitating answer Were you present at mister Reeside s No sir Did you see mister Manlius coming from the house intoxicated No What evidence then have you of the truth of your charge
4687-28005-0032	train-other-500	We have conversed this morning with several who were present and all say that they observed nothing out of the way in mister Manlius on the occasion of which you speak This is a serious matter and we should like to have your authority for a statement
4687-28005-0033	train-other-500	so injurious to the reputation of the minister and the cause of religion My authority is mister Burton who was present Did he tell you that mister Manlius was intoxicated
4687-28005-0034	train-other-500	He said there was a drunken minister there and mister Manlius I have ascertained was the only clergyman present Was that so asked the deacon of an individual who was at mister Reeside s mister Manlius was the only clergyman there was replied
4687-28005-0035	train-other-500	Then said Perkins if there was a drunken minister there it must have been mister Manlius I can draw no other inference Can mister Burton be found was now asked An individual immediately volunteered to go in search of him
4687-28005-0036	train-other-500	In half an hour he was produced As he entered the grave assembly he looked around with great composure upon the array of solemn faces and eyes intently fixed upon him He did not appear in the least abashed
4687-28005-0037	train-other-500	You were at mister Reeside s last week at a dinner party I believe said the presiding deacon I was Did you see mister Manlius intoxicated on that occasion mister Manlius Good heavens no
4687-28005-0038	train-other-500	I can testify upon oath that he was as solemn as a judge Who says that I made so scandalous an allegation Burton appeared to grow strongly excited I say so cried Perkins in a loud voice You say so
4687-28005-0039	train-other-500	And pray upon what authority Upon the authority of your own words Never But you did tell me so Perkins was much excited When On the day after the dinner party Don t you remember what you said to me
4687-28005-0040	train-other-500	Oh yes perfectly That you had a drunken minister at dinner No I never said that But you did I can be qualified to it I said we had a tipsy parson And pray
4687-28005-0041	train-other-500	what is the difference At the words tipsy parson the minister burst into a loud laugh and so did two or three others who had been at mister Reeside s The grave deacon in the chair looked around with frowning wonder at such indecorum
4687-28005-0042	train-other-500	and felt that especially ill timed was the levity of the minister I do not understand this he said with great gravity I can explain it remarked an individual rising
none	none	 as I happened to be at mister Reeside s and know all about 
4687-28005-0043	train-other-500	the tipsy parson The cook of our kind hostess in her culinary ingenuity furnished a dessert which she called tipsy parson made I believe by soaking sponge cake in brandy and pouring a custard over it It is therefore true
4687-28005-0044	train-other-500	as our friend Burton has said that there was a tipsy parson at the table but as to the drunken minister of mister Perkins I know nothing Never before in a grave and solemn assembly of deacons was there such a sudden and universal burst of laughter
4687-28005-0045	train-other-500	such a holding of sides and vibration of bodies as followed this unexpected speech In the midst of the confusion and noise Perkins quietly retired He has been known ever since in the village much to his chagrin and scandalization
4687-28005-0046	train-other-500	he being still a warm temperance man as the tipsy parson
none	none	 There goes the tipsy parson he hears said as he passes along the street a dozen times in a week 
4687-28005-0047	train-other-500	and he is now seriously inclined to leave the village in order to escape the ridicule his over zealous effort to blast the minister s reputation has called into existence
none	none	 As for the reverend mister Manlius he often tells the story and laughs over it as heartily as any one MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING OR THE REASON WHY missus TODD DIDN T SPEAK TO missus JONES DID you see that said missus Jones to her friend missus Lion with whom she was walking See what Why that missus Todd didn t speak to me No I thought she spoke to you as well as to me Indeed then and she didn t Are you sure Sure Can t I believe my own eyes She nodded and spoke to you but she didn t as much as look at me What in the world can be the reason missus Jones Dear knows You certainly must be mistaken missus Todd would not refuse to speak to one of her old friends in the street Humph I don t know she s rather queer sometimes She s taken a miff at something I suppose and means to cut my acquaintance But let her I shall not distress myself about it she isn t all the world Have you done any thing likely to offend her asked missus Lyon Me returned her companion No not that I am aware of but certain people are always on the lookout for something or other wrong and missus Todd is just one of that kind I never thought so missus Jones She is then I know her very well I m sorry said missus Lyon evincing a good deal of concern Hadn t you better go to her in a plain straight forward way and ask the reason of her conduct This would make all clear in a moment Go to her missus Lyon exclaimed missus Jones with ill concealed indignation No indeed that I will not Do you think I would demean myself so much I am not sure that by so doing you would demean yourself as you say There is clearly some mistake and such a course would correct all false impressions But it was only a suggestion thrown out for your consideration Oh no missus Lyon replied missus Jones with warmth You never find me cringing to people and begging to know why they are pleased to cut my acquaintance I feel quite as good as anybody and consider myself of just as much consequence as the proudest and best missus Todd needn t think I care for her acquaintance I never valued it a pin Notwithstanding missus Jones s perfect indifference toward missus Todd she continued to talk about her pretty much after this fashion growing more excited all the while during the next half hour at the close of which time the ladies parted company When missus Jones met her husband at the dinner table she related what had happened during the morning mister Jones was disposed to treat the matter lightly but his wife soon satisfied him that the thing was no joke What can be missus Todd s reason for such conduct he asked with a serious air I can t tell for my life She must have heard some false report about you It s as likely as not but what can it be Something serious to cause her to take so decided a stand as she seems to have done mister Jones looked grave and spoke in a grave tone of voice This made matters worse missus Jones s first idea was that missus Todd had heard something that she might have said about her and that wounded pride had caused her to do as she had done but her husband s remark suggested other thoughts It was possible that reports were in circulation calculated to injure her social standing and that missus Todd s conduct toward her was not the result of any private pique It is certainly strange and unaccountable she said in reply to her husband s last remark speaking in a thoughtful tone Would it not be the fairest and best way for you to go and ask for an explanation No I can t do that replied missus Jones quickly I am willing to bear undeserved contempt and unjust censure but I will never humble myself to any one For the rest of the day missus Jones s thoughts all flowed in one channel A hundred reasons for missus Todd s strange conduct were imagined but none seemed long satisfactory At last she remembered having spoken pretty freely about the lady to a certain individual who was not remarkable for his discretion That s it she said rising from her chair and walking nervously across the floor of her chamber backward and forward for two or three times while a burning glow suffused her cheek Isn t it too bad that words spoken in confidence should have been repeated I don t wonder she is offended This idea was retained for a time and then abandoned for some other that seemed more plausible For the next two weeks missus Jones was very unhappy She did not meet missus Todd during that period but she saw a number of her friends to whom either she or missus Lyon had communicated the fact already stated All declared the conduct of missus Todd to be unaccountable but several among themselves had shrewd suspicions of the real cause Conversations on the subject like the following were held I can tell you what I think about it missus S You know missus Jones is pretty free with her tongue Yes You ve heard her talk about missus Todd I don t remember now I have often she doesn t spare her sometimes You know yourself that missus Todd has queer ways of her own She is not perfect certainly Not by a great deal and missus Jones has not hesitated to say so There is not the least doubt in my mind that missus Todd has heard something Perhaps so but she is very foolish to take any notice of it So I think but you know she is touchy In some instances the conversation assumed a grave form Do you know what has struck me in this matter of missus Jones and missus Todd says one scandal loving personage to another whose taste ran parallel with her own No What is it eagerly asks the auditor I will tell you but you mustn t speak of it for your life Never fear me The communication was made in a deep whisper Bless me exclaims the recipient of the secret It surely cannot be so There is not the least doubt of it I had it from a source that cannot be doubted How in the world did you hear it In a way not dreamed of by missus Jones No doubt missus Todd has heard the same Not the least in the world But don t you think her to blame in refusing to keep missus Jones s company or even to speak to her Certainly I do It happened a long time ago and no doubt poor missus Jones has suffered enough on account of it Indeed I don t think she ought to be blamed in the matter at all it was her misfortune not her fault So I think In fact I believe she is just as worthy of respect and kindness as missus Todd No doubt of it in the world and from me she shall always receive it And from me also In this way the circle spread so that before two weeks had elapsed there were no less than twenty different notions held about missus Todd s behaviour to missus Jones Some talked very seriously about cutting the acquaintance of missus Jones also while others took her side and threatened to give up the acquaintance of missus Todd Thus matters stood when a mutual friend who wished to do honour to some visitors from a neighbouring city sent out invitations for a party Before these invitations were despatched it was seriously debated whether it would do to invite both missus Jones and missus Todd considering how matters stood between them The decision was in favour of letting them take care of their own difficulties If I thought missus Todd would be there I am sure I wouldn t go said missus Jones on receiving her card of invitation I hardly think that would be acting wisely replied her husband You are not conscious of having wronged missus Todd Why then should you shun her But it is so unpleasant to meet a person with whom you have been long intimate who refuses to speak to you No doubt it is Still we ought not to go out of our way to shun that person Let us while we do not attempt to interfere with the liberties of others be free ourselves Were I in your place I would not move an inch to keep out of her way I have not your firmness I wish I had It was only yesterday that I crossed the street to keep from meeting her face to face You were wrong I can t help it it is my weakness Three times already have I put myself about to avoid her and if I could frame any good excuse for staying away from this party I certainly should do so I would give any thing for a good sick headache on Tuesday next I am really ashamed of you Ellen I thought you more of a woman said mister Jones The night of the party at length came round During the whole day preceding it missus Jones could think of nothing but the unpleasant feelings she would have upon meeting with missus Todd and her heart was in her mouth all the time She wished a dozen times that it would rain But her wishes availed nothing not a cloud was to be seen in the clear blue firmament from morning until evening Oh if I only had some good excuse for staying at home she said over and over again but no good excuse offered mister Jones saw that his wife was in a very unhappy state of mind and tried his best to cheer her but with little good effect It is no use to talk to me I can t help it she replied to his remonstrance in a husky voice I am neither a stock nor a stone There s missus Jones said one friend to another on seeing the lady they named enter missus s well filled parlours Where is missus Todd asked the lady addressed Sure enough where is she replied the other Oh there she is in the other room I wonder why it is that she does not speak to missus Jones No one knows It s very strange I ll tell you what I ve heard What That she s jealous of missus Jones Ridiculous Isn t it I don t believe a word of it Nor I I only told you what I had heard There must be some other reason And doubtless is Meantime missus Jones found a seat in a corner where she ensconced herself with the determination of keeping her place during the evening that she might avoid the unpleasantness of coming in contact with missus Todd All this was of course very weak in missus Jones But she had no independent strength of character it must be owned Poor missus Jones How cut down she looks remarked a lady who knew all about the trouble that existed I really feel sorry for her She takes it a great deal too much to heart was the reply missus Todd might refuse to speak to me a dozen times if she liked It wouldn t break my heart But where is she In the other room as gay and lively as ever I saw her See there she is Yes I see her Hark You can hear her laugh to here I must confess I don t like it I don t believe she has any heart She must know that missus Jones is hurt at what she has done Of course she does and her manner is meant to insult her Seeing the disturbed and depressed state of missus Jones s mind two or three of her friends held a consultation on the subject and finally agreed that they would ask missus Todd who seemed purposely to avoid missus Jones why she acted towards her as she did But before they could find an opportunity of so doing a messenger came to say that one of missus Todd s children had been taken suddenly ill The lady withdrew immediately missus Jones breathed more freely on learning that missus Todd had gone home Soon after she emerged from her place in the corner and mingled with the company during the rest of the evening missus Todd on arriving at home found one of her children quite sick but it proved to be nothing serious On the following morning the little fellow was quite well again On that same morning three ladies personal friends of missus Todd met by appointment and entered into grave consultation They had undertaken to find out the cause of offence that had occurred of so serious a character as to lead missus Todd to adopt so rigid a course towards missus Jones and if possible to reconcile matters The sickness of her child will be a good excuse for us to call upon her said one If he is better we can introduce the matter judiciously I wonder how she will take it suggested another Kindly I hope remarked the third Suppose she does not We have done our duty True And that consciousness ought to be enough for us She is a very proud woman and my fear is that having taken an open and decided stand will yield to neither argument nor persuasion Last night she overacted her part While she carefully avoided coming in contact with missus Jones she was often near her and on such occasions talked and laughed louder than at any other time I thought once or twice that there was something of malice exhibited in her conduct To this one of the three assented But the other thought differently After some further discussion and an ineffectual attempt to decide which of them should open the matter to missus Todd the ladies sallied forth on their errand of peace They found missus Todd at home who received them in her usual agreeable manner How is your little boy was the first question after the first salutations were over Much better than he was last night I thank you Indeed he is quite as well as usual What was the matter with him missus Todd It is hard to tell I found him with a high fever when I got home But it subsided in the course of an hour Children often have such attacks They will be quite sick one hour and apparently well the next I am very glad to hear that it is nothing serious said one of the ladies I was afraid it might have been croup or something as bad There was a pause It seemed a little unfortunate remarked one of the visitors for it deprived you of an evening s enjoyment Yes it does appear so but no doubt it is all right I suppose you had a very pleasant time Oh yes Delightful I hadn t seen half my friends when I was summoned away Was missus Williams there Oh yes And missus Gray Yes And missus Elder Yes I didn t see either of them Not a word about missus Jones thought the ladies A light running conversation something after this style was kept up with occasional pauses for half an hour when one of the visitors determined to come to the point missus Todd a hem she said in one of the pauses that always take place in uninteresting conversation The lady s tone of voice had so changed from what it was a few moments before that missus Todd looked up at her with surprise No less changed was the lady s countenance missus Todd was mistified But she was not long in doubt A hem missus Todd we have come to to as friends mutual friends to ask you The lady s voice broke down but two or three a hems partially restored it and she went on To ask why you refused to to speak to missus Jones Why I refused to speak to missus Jones said missus Todd her cheek flushing Yes missus Jones is very much hurt about it and says she cannot imagine the reason It has made her very unhappy As mutual friends we have thought it our duty to try and reconcile matters It is on this errand that we have called this morning missus Jones says she met you for the last time about two weeks ago and that you refused to speak to her May we ask the reason You may certainly was calmly replied Expectation was now on tiptoe What then was the reason I did not see her What Didn t you refuse to speak to her Never in my life I esteem missus Jones too highly If I passed her as you say without speaking it was because I did not see her In less than half an hour missus Todd was at the house of missus Jones What passed between the ladies need not be told ALMOST A TRAGEDY A REMINISCENCE OF mister JOHN JONES IT is now about five years since I met with a little adventure in the West which may be worth relating It caused me a good deal of excitement at first regrets afterward for the temporary pain I inflicted and many a hearty laugh since New things come up so rapidly that it is almost impossible to keep the run of them and it is not at all surprising that those who are content to go along in the good old way should now and then be caught napping I own that I was completely Business took me out West in the spring of eighteen and kept me in Ohio for the entire summer of that year After a hard day s ride in the month of August I entered just before nightfall a certain town lying on the National Road where I expected to remain for a week After taking possession of my room at the hotel shaving washing and improving my appearance in other respects I came down and took a seat in the porch that ran along the front of the house I had not been here very long before the stage from the East drove up and the passengers who were to take supper as this was a stage house alighted Among them I noticed a woman with a pale emaciated and I would have said dying child in her arms Her face was anxious and haggard in its expression She was accompanied by a man whom I rightly supposed to be her husband He immediately went to the bar and engaged a room saying that his child was too sick to permit them to continue their journey Do you wish a doctor asked the landlord No replied the man We have medicine prescribed by our own physician before we left home If that does no good we have little confidence in any other remedies No more was said The man was shown to his room whither he retired with his wife and sick child The room it so happened was next to mine and the two rooms communicated by a door which was of course closed and fastened The emaciated child and anxious mother presented a sight that fixed itself upon my mind and excited my liveliest sympathies I could not get them from my thoughts About ten o clock that night I took a candle and went to my room Before undressing myself I sat down at a table to make some entries of collections and expenses and to think over and arrange my business for the next day All was still except now and then a slight movement in the next chamber where the parents were sitting up with their sick child What did you give him last I heard the father say in a low but distinct tone Aconite was as distinctly replied This I knew to be a deadly poison I listened you may be sure with a more earnest attention How many grains was next asked Two replied the mother Two grains of aconite My hair began to rise I think we had better increase the dose to five grains Horrible It s an hour since he took the last and I see no change said the mother Perhaps we had better try the arsenic My blood ran cold at this murderous proposition I felt like starting up bursting open the door and confronting them in their dreadful work But as if spell bound I remained where I was To the last proposition the man replied I would rather see the aconite tried in a larger dose If in half an hour there is no visible effect from it then we will resort to the arsenic If you think it best said the mother in a low sad voice well she might be sad over such awful work let us try the aconite again but in a larger dose You will find it on the mantelpiece I heard the deliberate tread of the man as he crossed the room for a larger dose of the poison while I hurriedly deliberated the question of what I should do Before I could make up my mind to act I heard his returning step A few moments of awful stillness succeeded I felt as if I were in the centre of a sphere with the gravitating forces from every point of the circumference upon me I don t think I could have moved a limb to save my life There let us see what they will do came distinctly upon my ear Gracious Heaven the deed was done Five grains of aconite given to the tender child already on the verge of death The cold sweat came out over my whole body and stood in clammy drops upon my forehead All was still Death was doing his awful work in silence I sat motionless under the influence of a strange irresolution or imbecility of mind unable to determine what steps to take in a matter where all now seems as plain to me as days light I do not know what came over me The fact only shows how when placed in certain positions we become paralyzed and unable to act even with common decision I remember saying to myself as a justification for not interfering at this stage of the proceedings It is too late now Five and three are eight Eight grains of aconite There is no longer a vestige of hope for the child Death is as certain as if a bullet were fired through the sufferer s head I did not stir from where I sat but tried to hush my deep breathing and quiet the loud pulsations of my heart lest even they should be heard and betray my proximity to the wretches Half an hour passed There was a movement and the murmuring sound of voices but though I listened eagerly I was not able to make out what was said I heard the tread of a man across the floor and I also heard his return I thought of the arsenic and said to myself at the same time They will not need that The woman was speaking I listened Was that the arsenic Yes How many grains did you give him I meant to give him three but in mistake gave him six or seven It was too late now for any interference But I was determined that the wretches should not escape I was an ear witness to their murderous act and I resolved to bring them to the light While I thus mused and resolved I was thrilled by a long tremulous cry from the dying child All was again still as death save an occasional deep sob that seemed bursting up from the remnant of stifled nature in the mother s bosom Again that cry arose suddenly on the air but feebler and shorter The mother s sob now became a moan and soon changed to a low wailing cry Her child was dead The fatal drugs had too surely done their murderous work But why should she weep over the precious babe her own hand had destroyed and why came there now and then from that chamber of death a deep sighing moan struggling up in spite of all efforts to repress it from the breast of the miserable father Strange enigma I could not read satisfactorily to myself the difficult solution I still remained quiet where I was In a little while I heard the father go out and listened to his footsteps until they became lost in silence Soon the hasty tread of several feet were heard and two or three females entered the room Their presence caused the woman to cry bitterly False hearted cruel wretch I could not help muttering to myself Hypocritical cries and crocodile tears will not hide your sin An ear of which you dreamed not has heard your hellish plots and been witness to your hellish deeds upon the body of your poor babe You cannot escape The voice of blood cries from the very ground The hope of the murderer is vain He cannot hide himself from the pursuer For half the night I lay awake thinking of what had occurred and settling in my mind the course of proceeding to adopt in the morning I was up long before sunrise in fact long before anybody else was stirring awaiting the appearance of the landlord to whom it was my intention to give information of the dreadful deed that had been committed Full an hour elapsed before he made his appearance I immediately drew him aside There has been a death in the house said I Yes he replied The poor sick child that was brought here by the Eastern stage last evening died in the night I did not suppose it would live till morning To me it seemed in a dying state when its parents arrived There has been foul play said I with emphasis That child has not died a natural death How so What do you mean asked the landlord with a look of surprise I mean what I say was my reply As sure as I am a living man that child has been murdered I then related all I had heard to the horror and astonishment of the landlord A deed like this must not go unpunished he said sternly and angrily It is horrible to think of it After talking over the matter for some time it was determined to call a council of half a dozen of the regular boarders in the house as soon as breakfast was over and decide upon the steps best to be taken Accordingly after breakfast a few of us assembled in a private parlour and I again related with minuteness all that I had heard After sundry expressions of horror and indignation a gentleman said to me Are you sure it was grains or granules of aconite and arsenic that were given to the child Grains sir I replied promptly This is a serious matter he added and if there should be any mistake it would be sad indeed to harrow the feelings of those bereaved parents by so dreadful a charge as that of the murder of their own offspring My own impression is that our friend here is under a mistake Can t I believe my own ears sir said I a little indignantly Don t misunderstand me returned the gentleman politely I don t doubt you have heard all you say and it may be even to the word grains but I am under the impression that the arsenic and aconite given were in the homoeopathic preparations and therefore no longer poisonous There was a long pause after this was said every one present seemed to breathe more freely I had heard of homoeopathy and something about infinitesimal doses but had never seen the medicine used neither did I know any thing about the mode in which it was sometimes practised Suppose we send for the man suggested the landlord and question him but in a way not to wound him if he be innocent This after some debate was agreed upon and a servant was sent to his room with a request that he would come to the parlour He obeyed the summons instantly but looked a good deal surprised when he saw a grave assembly of six or seven persons The gentleman who had expressed the doubt in the man s favour said to him as soon as he had taken his seat We have learned sir with sincere regret that you were so unfortunate as to lose your child last night a severe affliction Though strangers we deeply sympathize with you The man expressed his thanks in a few words for the kind feelings manifested and said that as it was their only child they felt the affliction more severely but were still willing to submit to the loss as a Divine dispensation grievous to be borne yet intended for good You did not call in a physician said the individual who had at first addressed him No replied the man Before starting for Cincinnati yesterday morning we learned that no matter how ill our child might become we could not get the advice of a homoeopathic physician until we reached home and we were not willing to trust our child in the hands of any other We therefore before commencing our journey obtained medicine and advice how to administer it should alarming symptoms occur Homoeopathic medicines Yes sir In powders I suppose No sir in little grains or pellets like these And he drew from his pocket a diminutive vial the smallest I had ever seen in which were a number of little white granules about the size of the head of a pin A printed label was wound around the vial and it bore the word Arsenicum It passed from hand to hand and all read it You gave this said the volunteer spokesman Yes sir that and aconite How much is a dose From one to five or six grains Or granules Yes The little bottle was returned to the man who placed it in his pocket A pause ensued The truth was plain enough to us all The individual whose sagacity or better information about what was going on in the world had saved a most painful denouement to this affair said to the man in a way as little as possible calculated to wound his feelings You are of course surprised at this proceeding this seemingly wanton intrusion upon your grief But you will understand it when I tell you that a lodger in a room adjoining yours who knew nothing of homoeopathy heard you speak of giving your child several grains of aconite and arsenic You can easily infer the impression upon his mind This morning he related what he had heard when an individual here present who suspected the truth suggested that you be sent for and asked the questions which you have so satisfactorily answered Do not let me beg of you feel hurt What we have done was but an act of justice to yourself The man smiled sadly and thanking us with eyes fast filling with tears rose up quickly to conceal his emotion and retired from the room Landlord said I an hour afterwards I want my valise taken out of No ten and put into some other room Why so Isn t the room a pleasant one Oh yes but I d like a change Very well we ll put you in No sixteen I was the lodger in the room adjoining and didn t therefore wish to appear on the premises and be known by the man as the getter up of a suspicion against him I did not come home to dinner and kept out of the way till after dark When I returned to the hotel I was relieved to find that the bereaved parents had departed with the dead body of their child But the whole company were now at liberty to laugh at what had occurred to their hearts content and to laugh at me in particular I stood it that evening as well as I could but finding on the next day that it was renewed with as keen a zest as ever concluded to close up my business on the spot and leave the place which I did THAT JOHN MASON WHAT kind of people have you here I asked of one of my first acquaintances after becoming a denizen of the pleasant little village of Moorfield Very clever people with one or two exceptions he replied I am sure you will like us very well Who are the exceptions I asked For I wish to keep all such exceptions at a distance Being a stranger I will wisely take a hint in time It s an easy matter to shun an acquaintanceship but by no means so easy to break it off after it is once formed Very truly said mister Jones And I will warn you in time of one man in particular His name is John Mason Keep clear of him if you wish to keep out of trouble He s as smooth and oily as a whetstone and like a whetstone abrades every thing he touches He s a bad man that John Mason Who or what is he I asked He s a lawyer and one of the principal holders of property in the township But money can t gild him over He s a bad man that John Mason and my advice to you and to every one is to keep clear of him I know him like a book I m very much obliged to you said I for your timely caution I will take care to profit by it My next acquaintance bore pretty much the same testimony and so did the next It was plain that John Mason was not the right kind of a man and rather a blemish upon the village of Moorfield notwithstanding he was one of the principal property holders in the township If it wasn t for that John Mason I heard on this hand and If it wasn t for that John Mason I heard on the other hand as my acquaintanceship among the people extended Particularly bitter against him was the first individual who had whispered in my ear a friendly caution and I hardly ever met with him that he hadn t something to say about that John Mason About six months after my arrival in Moorfield I attended a public meeting at which the leading men of the township were present Most of them were strangers to me At this meeting I fell in company with a very pleasant man who had several times addressed those present and always in such a clear forcible and common sense way as to carry conviction to all but a few who carped and quibbled at every thing he said and in a very churlish manner Several of those quibblers I happened to know He represented one set of views and they another His had regard for the public good theirs looked it was plain to sectional and private interests How do you like our little town mister Jones said this individual to me after the meeting had adjourned and little knots of individuals were formed here and there for conversation Very well I replied And the people he added The people I answered appear to be about a fair sample of what are to be found everywhere Good and bad mixed up together Yes That I suppose is a fair general estimate Of course I added we find in all communities certain individuals who stand out more prominent than the rest distinguished for good or evil This appears to be the case here as well as elsewhere You have already discovered then that even in Moorfield there are some bad men Oh yes There s that John Mason for instance The man looked a little surprised but remarked without any change of tone So you have heard of him have you Oh yes As a very bad man Yes very well Have you ever met him No and never wish to You ve seen him I presume Never Is he here The man glanced round the room and then replied I don t see him He was here I suppose Oh yes and addressed the meeting several times In one of those sneering ill tempered answers to your remarks no doubt The man slightly inclined his head as if acknowledging a compliment It s a pity said I that such men as this John Mason often have wealth and some shrewdness of mind to give them power in the community Perhaps said my auditor your prejudices against this man are too strong He s not perfect I know but even the devil is often painted blacker than he is If you knew him I rather think you would estimate him a little differently I don t wish to know him Opportunities have offered but I have always avoided an introduction Who first gave you the character of this man asked the individual with whom I was conversing mister Laxton I replied Do you know him Oh yes very well He speaks hard of Mason does he He has cause I believe Did he ever explain to you what it was Not very fully but he gives him a general bad character and says he has done more to injure the best interests of the village than any ten of its worst enemies that exist Indeed That is a sweeping declaration But I will frankly own that I cannot join in so broad a condemnation of the man although he has his faults and no one knows them I think better than I do This made no impression upon me The name of John Mason was associated in my mind with every thing that was bad and I replied by saying that I was very well satisfied in regard to his character and didn t mean to have any thing to do with him while I lived in Moorfield Some one interrupted our conversation at this point and I was separated from my very agreeable companion I met him frequently afterwards and he was always particularly polite to me and once or twice asked me if I had fallen in with that John Mason yet to which I always replied in the negative and expressed myself as ever in regard to the personage mentioned Careful as we may be to keep out of trouble we are not always successful in our efforts When I removed to Moorfield I supposed my affairs to be in a very good way but things proved to be otherwise I was disappointed not only in the amount I expected to receive from the business I followed in the village but disappointed in the receipt of money I felt sure of getting by a certain time When I first came to Moorfield I bought a piece of property from Laxton this business transaction made us acquainted and paid cash down one third of the purchase money the property remaining as security for the two thirds which I was under contract to settle at a certain time My first payment was two thousand dollars Unfortunately when the final payment became due I was not in funds and the prospect of receiving money within five or six months was any thing but good In this dilemma I waited upon Laxton and informed him of my disappointment His face became grave I hope it will not put you to any serious inconvenience What he asked My failure to meet this payment on the property You are fully secured and within six months I will be able to do what I had hoped to do at this time I am sorry mister Jones he returned but I have made all my calculations to receive the sum due at this time and cannot do without it But I haven t the money mister Laxton and have fully explained to you the reason why That is your affair not mine mister Jones If you have been disappointed at one point it is your business to look to another A contract is a contract Will you not extend the time of payment said I No sir I cannot What will you do Do You ask a strange question Well what will you do Why raise the money on the property How will you do that Sell it of course I asked no further questions but left him and went away Before reaching home to which place I was retiring in order to think over the position in which I was placed and determine what steps to take if any were left to me I met the pleasant acquaintance I had made at the town meeting You look grave mister Jones said he as we paused facing each other What s the matter I frankly told him my difficulty So Laxton has got you in his clutches has he was the simple yet I perceived meaning reply that he made I am in his clutches certainly said I And will not get out of them very easily I apprehend What will he do He will sell the property at auction It won t bring his claim under the hammer No I suppose not for that is really more than the property is worth Do you think so Certainly I do I know the value of every lot of ground in the township and know that you have been taken in in your purchase What do you suppose it will bring at a forced sale Few men will bid over twenty five hundred dollars You cannot be serious I assure you I am He however will overbid all up to four thousand He will probably have it knocked down to him at three thousand and thus come into the unencumbered possession of a piece of property upon which he has received two thousand dollars But three thousand dollars will not satisfy his claim against me No You will still owe him a thousand dollars Will he prosecute his claim He And the man smiled Yes to the last extremity if there be hope of getting any thing Then I am certainly in a bad way I m afraid you are unless you can find some one here who will befriend you in the matter There is no one here who will lend me four thousand dollars upon that piece of property said I I don t know but one man who is likely to do it was answered Who is that I asked eagerly John Mason John Mason I ll never go to him Why not I might as well remain where I am as get into his hands a sharper and a lawyer to boot No no Better to bear the evils that we have than fly to others that we know not of You may get assistance somewhere else but I am doubtful said the man and bowing politely passed on and left me to my own unpleasant reflections Laxton made as quick work of the business as the nature of the case would admit and in a very short time the property was advertised at public sale As the time for the sale approached the great desire to prevent the sacrifice that I was too well assured would take place suggested the dernier resort of ailing upon Mason but my prejudice against the man was so strong that I could not get my own consent to do so On the day before the sale I met the individual before alluded to Have you been to see Mason he asked I shook my head Then you have made up your mind to let that scoundrel Laxton fleece you out of your property I see no way of preventing it Why don t you try Mason I don t believe it would do any good I think differently If he did help me out of this difficulty I replied it would only be to get me into a more narrow corner You don t know any such thing said the man a different tone from any in which he had yet taken when Mason was the subject of our remarks Think for a moment upon the basis of your prejudice it lies mainly upon the assertion of Laxton from your own experience has proved to be a scoundrel The fact is your estimate of Mason s character is entirely erroneous Laxton hates him because he has circumvented him more than a dozen times in his schemes of iniquity and will circumvent him again if I do not greatly err provided you give him the opportunity of doing so There was force in the view True enough what confidence was there to be placed in Laxton s words And if Mason had circumvented him as was alleged of course there was a very good reason for detraction At what hour do you think I can see him said I I believe he is usually in about twelve o clock I will see him said I with emphasis Do so returned the man and may your interview be as satisfactory as you can desire At twelve precisely I called upon Mason not without many misgivings I must own I found my prejudices still strong and as to the good result I could not help feeling serious doubts On entering his office I found no one present but the individual under whose advice I had called mister Mason is not in said I feeling a little disappointed Oh yes he is in was replied I looked around and then turned my eyes upon the man s face I did not exactly comprehend its expression My name is John Mason said he bowing politely so be seated and let us talk over the business upon which you have called on me I needed no invitation to sit down for I could not have kept my feet if I had tried so suddenly and completely did his words astonish and confound me I will not repeat the confused blundering apologies I attempted to make nor give his gentlemanly replies Enough that an hour before the time at which the sale was advertised to take place on the next day I waited upon Laxton Be kind enough said I to let me have that obligation upon which your present stringent measures are founded I wish to take it up The man looked perfectly blank mister John Mason said I has generously furnished me with the funds necessary to save my property from sacrifice and will take the securities you hold Blast that John Mason ejaculated Laxton with excessive bitterness turning away and leaving where I stood I waited for ten minutes but did not come back A suspicion that he meant let the sale go on if possible crossed my mind and I returned to Mason who saw the sheriff and the whole matter arranged Laxton has never spoken to me since As for That John Mason I have proved him to be fast friend and a man of strict honour in every thing So much for slander A NEW WAY TO COLLECT AN OLD DEBT EARLY in life mister Jenkins had been what is called unfortunate in business Either from the want of right management or from causes that he could not well control he became involved and was broken all to pieces It was not enough that he gave up every dollar he possessed in the world In the hope that friends would interfere to prevent his being sent to jail some of his creditors pressed eagerly for the balance of their claims and the unhappy debtor had no alternative but to avail himself of the statute made and provided for the benefit of individuals in his extremity It was a sore trial for him but any thing rather than to be thrown into prison After this tempest of trouble and excitement there fell upon the spirits of mister Jenkins a great calm He withdrew himself from public observation for a time but his active mind would not let him remain long in obscurity In a few months he was again in business though in a small way His efforts were more cautiously directed than before and proved successful He made something above his expenses during the first year and after that accumulated money rapidly In five or six years mister Jenkins was worth some nine or ten thousand dollars But with this prosperity came no disposition on the part of mister Jenkins to pay off his old obligations They used the law against me he would say when the subject pressed itself upon his mind as it would sometimes do and now let them get what the law will give them There was a curious provision in the law by which Jenkins had been freed from all the claims of his creditors against him and this provision is usually incorporated in all similar laws though for what reason it is hard to tell It is only necessary to promise to pay a claim thus annulled to bring it in full force against the debtor If a man owes another a hundred dollars and by economy and self denial succeeds in saving twenty dollars and paying them to him he becomes at once liable for the remaining eighty dollars unless the manner of doing it be very guarded and is in danger of a prosecution although unable to pay another cent A prudent man who has once been forced into the unhappy alternative of taking the benefit of the insolvent law is always careful lest in an unguarded moment he acknowledge his liability to some old creditor before he is fully able to meet it Anxious as he is to assure this one and that one of his desire and intention to pay them if ever in his power and to say to them that he is struggling early and late for their sakes as well as his own his lips must remain sealed A word of his intentions and all his fond hopes of getting fairly on his feet again are in danger of shipwreck Understanding the binding force of a promise of this kind made in writing or in the presence of witnesses certain of the more selfish or less manly and honorable class of creditors are ever seeking to extort by fair or foul means from an unfortunate debtor who has honestly given up every thing an acknowledgment of his indebtedness to them in order that they may reap the benefit of his first efforts to get upon his feet again Many and many an honest but indiscreet debtor has been thrown upon his back once more from this cause and all his hopes in life blasted for ever The means of approach to a debtor in this situation are many and various Do you think you will ever be able to do any thing on that old account blandly asked in the presence of a third party is answered by I hope so But at present it takes every dollar I can earn for the support of my family This is sufficient the whole claim is in full force In the course of a month or two perhaps in a less period a sheriff s writ is served and the poor fellow s furniture or small stock in trade is seized and he broken all up again To have replied You have no claim against me to the insidious question seemed in the mind of the poor but honest man so much like a public confession that he was a rogue that he could not do it And yet this was his only right course and he should have taken it firmly Letters are often written calling attention to the old matter in which are well timed allusions to the debtor s known integrity of character and willingness to pay every dollar he owes in the world if ever able Such letters should never be answered for the answer will be almost sure to contain something that in a court of justice will be construed into an acknowledgment of the entire claim In paying off old accounts that the law has cancelled which we think every man should do if in his power the acknowledgment of indebtedness never need go further than the amount paid at any time Beyond this no creditor who does not wish to oppress will ask a man to go If any seek a further revival of the old claim let the debtor be aware of them and also let him be on his guard against him who in any way alludes either in writing or personally to the previous indebtedness But we have digressed far enough mister Jenkins we are sorry to say was not of that class of debtors who never consider an obligation morally cancelled The law once on his side he fully made up his mind to keep it for ever between him and all former transactions Sundry were the attempts made to get old claims against him revived after it was clearly understood that he was getting to be worth money but Jenkins was a rogue at heart and rogues are always more wary than honest men Among the creditors of Jenkins was a man named Gooding who had loaned him five hundred dollars and lost three hundred of it two fifths being all that was realized from the debtor s effects Gooding pitied sincerely the misfortunes of Jenkins and pocketed his loss without saying a hard word or laying the weight of a finger upon his already too heavily burdened shoulders But it so happened that as Jenkins commenced going up in the world Gooding began to go down At the time when the former was clearly worth ten thousand dollars he was hardly able to get money enough to pay his quarterly rent bills Several times he thought of calling the attention of his old debtor to the balance still against him which as it was for borrowed money ought certainly to be paid But it was an unpleasant thing to remind a friend of an old obligation and Gooding for a time chose to bear his troubles as the least disagreeable of the two alternatives At last however difficulties pressed so hard upon him that he forced himself to the task Both he and Jenkins lived about three quarters of a mile distant from their places of business in a little village beyond the suburbs of the city Gooding was lame and used to ride to and from his store in a small wagon which was used for sending home goods during the day Jenkins usually walked into town in the morning and home in the evening It not unfrequently happened that Gooding overtook the latter while riding home after business hours when he always invited him to take a seat by his side which invitation was never declined They were riding home in this way one evening when Gooding after clearing his throat two or three times said with a slight faltering in his voice I am sorry neighbour Jenkins to make any allusion to old matters but as you are getting along very comfortably and I am rather hard pressed don t you think you could do something for me on account of the three hundred dollars due for borrowed money If it had been a regular business debt I would never have said a word about it but Neighbour Gooding said Jenkins interrupting him don t give yourself a moment s uneasiness about that matter It shall be paid every dollar of it but I am not able just yet to make it up for you But you shall have it This was said in the blandest way imaginable yet in a tone of earnestness How soon do you think you can do something for me asked Gooding I don t know If not disappointed however I think I can spare you a little in a couple of months My rent is due on the first of October If you can let me have say fifty dollars then it will be a great accommodation I will see If in my power you shall certainly have at least that amount Two months rolled round and Gooding s quarter day came Nothing more had been said by Jenkins on the subject of the fifty dollars and Gooding felt very reluctant about reminding him of his promise but he was short in making up his rent just the promised sum He waited until late in the day but Jenkins neither sent nor called As the matter was pressing he determined to drop in upon his neighbour and remind him of what he had said He accordingly went round to the store of Jenkins and found him alone with his clerk How are you to day said Jenkins smiling Very well How are you So so Then came a pause Business rather dull remarked Jenkins Very replied Gooding with a serious face and more serious tone of voice Nothing at all doing I never saw business so flat in my life Flat enough Another pause Ahem mister Jenkins began Gooding after a few moments do you think you can do any thing for me to day If there is any thing I can do for you it shall be done with pleasure said Jenkins in a cheerful way In what can I oblige you You remember you said that in all probability you would be able to spare me as much as fifty dollars to day I said so Jenkins asked this question with an appearance of real surprise Yes Don t you remember that we were riding home one evening about two months ago and I called your attention to the old account standing between us and you promised to pay it soon and said you thought you could spare me fifty dollars about the time my quarter s rent became due Upon my word friend Gooding I have no recollection of the circumstance whatever replied Jenkins with a smile It must have been some one else with whom you were riding I never said I owed you any thing or promised to pay you fifty dollars about this time Oh yes but I am sure you did And I am just as sure that I did not returned Jenkins still perfectly undisturbed while Gooding as might be supposed felt his indignation just ready to boil over But the latter controlled himself as best he could and as soon as he could get away from the store of Jenkins without doing so in a manner that would tend to close all intercourse between them he left and returned to his own place of business chagrined and angry On the same evening as Gooding was riding home he saw Jenkins ahead of him on the road He soon overtook him Jenkins turned his usual smiling face upon his old creditor and said Good evening in his usual friendly way The invitation to get up and ride that was always given on like occasions was extended again and in a few moments the two men were riding along side by side as friendly to all appearance as if nothing had happened Jenkins how could you serve me such a scaly trick as you did Gooding said soon after his neighbour had taken a seat by his side You know very well that you promised to pay my claim and also promised to give me fifty dollars of it to day if possible I know I did But it was out of my power to let you have any thing to day replied Jenkins But what was the use of your denying it and making me out a liar or a fool in the presence of your clerk I had a very good reason for doing so My clerk would have been a witness to my acknowledgment of your whole claim against me and thus make me liable before I was ready to pay it As my head is fairly clear of the halter you cannot blame me for wishing to keep it so A burnt child you know dreads the fire But you know me well enough to know that I never would have pressed the claim against you Friend Gooding I have seen enough of the world to satisfy me that we don t know any one I am very ready to say to you that your claim shall be satisfied to the full extent whenever it is in my power to do so but a legal acknowledgment of the claim I am not willing to make You mustn t think hard of me for what I did to day I could not in justice to myself have done any thing else Gooding professed to be fully satisfied with this explanation although he was not He was very well assured that Jenkins was perfectly able to pay him the three hundred dollars if he chose to do so and that his refusal to let him have the fifty dollars conditionally promised was a dishonest act More than a year passed during which time Gooding made many fruitless attempts to get something out of Jenkins who was always on the best terms with him but put him off with fair promises that were never kept These promises were never made in the presence of a third person and might therefore have just as well been made to the wind so far as their binding force was concerned Things grew worse and worse with Gooding and he became poorer every day while the condition of Jenkins as steadily improved One rainy afternoon Gooding drove up to the store of his old friend about half an hour earlier than he usually left for home Jenkins was standing in the door As it is raining I thought I would call round for you he said as he drew up his horse Very much obliged to you indeed returned Jenkins quite well pleased Stop a moment until I lock up my desk and then I will be with you In a minute or two Jenkins came out and stepped lightly into the wagon It is kind in you really to call for me he said as the wagon moved briskly away I was just thinking that I should have to get a carriage It is no trouble to me at all returned Gooding and if it were the pleasure of doing a friend a kindness would fully repay it You smell strong of whisky here said Jenkins after they had ridden a little way turning his eyes toward the back part of the wagon as he spoke What have you here An empty whisky hogshead This rain put me in mind of doing what my wife has been teasing me to do for the last six months get her a rain barrel I tried to get an old oil cask but couldn t find one They make the best rain barrels Just burn them out with a flash of good dry shavings and they are clear from all oily impurities and tight as a drum Indeed I never thought of that I must look out for one for our old rain hogshead is about tumbling to pieces From rain barrels the conversation turned upon business and at length Gooding brought up the old story and urged the settlement of his claim as a matter of charity You don t know how much I need it he said Necessity alone compels me to press the claim upon your attention It is hard I know and I am very sorry for you Jenkins replied Next week I will certainly pay you fifty dollars I shall be very thankful How soon after do you think you will be able to let me have the balance of the three hundred due me Say as early as possible Within three months at least I hope replied Jenkins Harry Do you hear that said Gooding turning his head toward the back part of the wagon and speaking in a quick elated manner Oh ay came ringing from the bunghole of the whisky hogshead Who the dickens is that exclaimed Jenkins turning quickly round No one replied Gooding with a quiet smile but my clerk Harry Williams Where Here replied the individual named pushing himself up through the loose head of the upright hogshead and looking into the face of the discomfited Jenkins with a broad smile of satisfaction upon his always humorous phiz Whoa Charley said Gooding at this moment reining up his horse before the house of Jenkins The latter stepped out with his eyes upon the ground and stood with his hand upon the wagon in thought for some moments then looking up he said while the humour of the whole thing pressed itself so full upon him that he could not help smiling See here Gooding if both you and Harry will promise me never to say a word about this confounded trick I will give you a check for three hundred dollars on the spot No I must have four hundred and twenty six dollars the principal and interest Nothing less returned Gooding firmly You have acknowledged the debt in the presence of mister Williams and if it is not paid by to morrow twelve o clock I shall commence suit against you If I receive the money before that time we will keep this little matter quiet if suit is brought all will come out on the trial As you please said Jenkins angrily turning away and entering his house Before twelve o clock on the next day however Jenkins s clerk called in at the store of Gooding and paid him four hundred and twenty six dollars for which he took his receipt in full for all demands to date The two men were never afterward on terms of sufficient intimacy to ride in the same wagon together Whether Gooding and his clerk kept the matter a secret as they promised we don t know It is very certain that it was known all over town in less than a week and soon after was told in the newspapers as a most capital joke A SHOCKING BAD MEMORY MUST I give up every thing asked mister Hardy of his lawyer with whom he was holding a consultation as to the mode and manner of getting clear of certain responsibilities in the shape of debt Yes every thing or commit perjury The oath you have taken is very comprehensive If you keep back as much as ten dollars you will swear falsely Bad bad I have about seven thousand dollars and I owe twenty thousand To divide this among my creditors gives them but a small sum apiece while it strips me of every thing Is there no way mister Dockett by which I can retain this money and yet not take a false oath You gentlemen of the bar can usually find some loop hole in the law out of which to help your clients I know of several who have gone through the debtors mill and yet not come forth penniless and some of them I know would not be guilty of false swearing Oh yes the thing is done every day Ah well how is it done The process is very simple Take your seven thousand dollars and make it a present to some friend in whom you can confide Then you will be worth nothing and go before the insolvent commissioners and swear until you are black and blue without perjuring yourself Humph is that the way it is done said mister Hardy The very way But suppose the friend should decline handing it back The lawyer shrugged his shoulders as he replied You must take care whom you trust in an affair of this kind At worst however you would be just as well off assuming that your friend should hold on to what you gave him as you would be if you abandoned all to your creditors True if I abandon all there is no hope of even getting back a dollar It is the same as if I had thrown every thing into the sea Precisely While in adopting the plan you propose the chances for getting back my own again are eight to ten in my favour Or you might almost say ten to ten No friend into whose hands you confided the little remnant of your property would be so base as to withhold it from you I will do it said mister Hardy as he parted with the lawyer One day a few weeks after this interview took place the client of mister Dockett came hurriedly into his office and drawing him aside said as he slipped a small package into his hand Here is something for you You remember our conversation a short time ago Oh very well You understand me mister Dockett Oh perfectly all right when do you go before the commissioners To morrow Ah Yes good morning I will see you again as soon as all is over Very well good morning On the next day mister Hardy met before the commissioners and took a solemn oath that he had truly and honestly given up into the hands of his assignee every dollar of his property for the benefit of his creditors and that he did not now possess any thing beyond what the law permitted him to retain Upon this the insolvent commissioners gave him a full release from the claims that were held against him and mister Hardy was able to say as far as the law was concerned I owe no man any thing mister Dockett the lawyer was sitting in his office on the day after his client had shuffled off his coil of debt his mind intent upon some legal mystery when the latter individual came in with a light step and cheerful air Good morning mister Hardy said the lawyer smiling blandly Good morning returned the client How are things progressing inquired the lawyer All right returned Hardy rubbing his hands I am at last a free man The cursed manacle of debt has been stricken off I feel like a new being For which I most sincerely congratulate you returned the lawyer For your kindness in so materially aiding me in the matter said mister Hardy after a pause I am most truly grateful You have been my friend as well as my legal adviser I have only done by you as I would have done by any other man replied the lawyer You came to me for legal advice and I gave it freely Still beyond that you have acted as my disinterested friend said mister Hardy and I cannot express my gratitude in terms sufficiently strong The lawyer bowed low and looked just a little mistified A slight degree of uneasiness was felt by the client A pause now ensued mister Hardy felt something like embarrassment For some time he talked around the subject uppermost in his mind but the lawyer did not appear to see the drift of his remarks At last he said Now that I have every thing arranged I will take the little package I yesterday handed you There was a slight expression of surprise on the countenance of mister Dockett as he looked inquiringly into the face of his client Handed to me he said in a tone the most innocent imaginable Yes returned Hardy with much earnestness Don t you recollect the package containing seven thousand dollars that I placed in your hands to keep for me yesterday while I went before the commissioners The lawyer looked thoughtful but shook his head Oh but mister Dockett said Hardy now becoming excited you must remember it Don t you recollect that I came in here yesterday while you were engaged with a couple of gentlemen and took you aside for a moment It was then that I gave you the money mister Dockett raised his eyes to the ceiling and mused for some time as if trying to recall the circumstance to which allusion was made He then shook his head very deliberately two or three times remarking as he did so You are evidently labouring under a serious mistake mister Hardy I have not the most remote recollection of the incident to which you refer So far from having received the sum of money you mention I do not remember having seen you for at least a week before to day I am very certain you have not been in my office within that time unless it were when I was away Your memory is doubtless at fault You must have handed the money to some one else and in the excitement of the occasion confounded me with that individual Were I not charitable enough to suppose this I should be deeply offended by what you now say mister Dockett returned the client contracting his brow heavily Do you take me for a simpleton Pray don t get excited mister Hardy replied the lawyer with the utmost coolness Excitement never does any good Better collect your thoughts and try and remember into whose hands you really did place your money That I have not a dollar belonging to you I can positively affirm Perhaps you call my seven thousand dollars your own now I gave you the sum according to your own advice but it was an understood matter that you were to hand the money back so soon as I had appeared before the commissioners mister Hardy and the lawyer began to look angry mister Hardy I will permit neither you nor any other man to face me with such an insinuation Do you take me for a common swindler You came and asked if there was not some mode by which you could cheat your creditors out of six or seven thousand dollars and I as in duty bound professionally told you how the law might be evaded And now you affirm that I joined you as a party in this nefarious transaction This is going a little too far Amazement kept the duped client dumb for some moments When he would have spoken his indignation was so great that he was afraid to trust himself to utter what was in his mind Feeling that too much was at stake to enter into any angry contest with the man who had him so completely in his power mister Hardy tore himself away by a desperate effort in order that alone he might be able to think more calmly and devise if possible the means whereby the defective memory of the lawyer might be quickened On the next day he went again to the office of his legal adviser and was received very kindly by that individual I am sure mister Dockett he said after he was seated speaking in a soft insinuating tone of voice that you can now remember the little fact of which I spoke yesterday But mister Dockett shook his head and answered You have made some mistake mister Hardy No such sum of money was ever intrusted to me Perhaps said Hardy after thinking for a few minutes I may have been in error in regard to the amount of money contained in the package Can t you remember having received five thousand dollars from me Think now The lawyer thought for a little while and then shook his head No I have not the slightest recollection of having received such a sum of money from you The package may only have contained four thousand dollars said mister Hardy driven to this desperate expedient in the hope of inducing the lawyer to share the plunder of the creditors But mister Dockett again shook his head Say then I gave you but three thousand dollars No was the emphatic answer But I am sure you will remember having received two thousand dollars from my hand No nor one thousand nor one hundred replied the lawyer positively mister Dockett you are a knave exclaimed the client springing to his feet and shaking his clenched fists at the lawyer And you are both a knave and a fool sneeringly replied mister Dockett Hardy maddened to desperation uttered a threat of personal violence and advanced upon the lawyer But the latter was prepared for him and before the excited client had approached three paces there was heard a sharp click and at the same moment the six dark barrels of a revolver became visible While mister Dockett thus coolly held his assailant at bay he addressed him in this wise mister Hardy from what you have just said it is clear that you have been playing a swindling game with your creditors and stained your soul with perjury into the bargain Now if you do not leave my office instantly I will put your case in the hands of the Grand Jury at present in session and let you take your chance for the State prison on the charge of false swearing mister Hardy became instantly as quiet as a lamb For a few moments he looked at the lawyer in bewildered astonishment and then turning away left his office in a state of mind more easily imagined than described Subsequently he tried at various times and on various occasions to refresh the memory of mister Dockett on the subject of the seven thousand dollars but the lawyer remained entirely oblivious and to this day has not been able to recall a single incident attending the alleged transfer mister Dockett has without doubt a shocking bad memory DRIVING A HARD BARGAIN WE know a great many businessmen famous for driving hard bargains who would consider an insinuation that they were not influenced by honest principles in their dealings a gross outrage And yet such an insinuation would involve only the truth Hard bargains by which others are made to suffer in order that we may gain are not honest transactions and calling them so don t in the least alter their quality We have our doubts whether men who overreach others in this way are really gainers in the end They get to be known and are dealt with by the wary as sharpers A certain manufacturer we will not say of what place for our story being substantially true to particularize in this respect would be almost like pointing out the parties concerned was obliged to use a kind of goods imported only by two or three houses The article was indispensable in his business and his use of it was extensive This man whom we will call Eldon belonged to the class of bargain makers It was a matter of principle with him never to close a transaction without if possible getting an advantage The ordinary profits of trade did not satisfy him he wanted to go a little deeper The consequence was that almost every one was on the look out for him and it not unfrequently happened that he paid more for an article which he imagined he was getting in consequence of some manoeuvre at less than cost than his next door neighbour who dealt fairly and above board One day a mister Lladd an importer called upon him and said I d like to close out that entire lot of goods Eldon I wish you d take them How many pieces have you left inquired Eldon with assumed indifference It occurred to him on the instant that the merchant was a little pressed and that in consequence he might drive a sharp bargain with him Two hundred Eldon shook his head What s the matter asked Lladd The lot is too heavy You ll work up every piece before six months No indeed Not in twelve months Oh yes you will I looked over your account yesterday and find that you have had a hundred aid fifty pieces from me alone and in six months You must be in error No It is just as I say Well what terms do you offer If you will take the entire lot you may have them for ten and a quarter three months Eldon thought for a few moments and then shook his head You must say better than that What better can you ask You have been buying a dozen pieces at a time for ten and a half cash and now I offer you the lot at ten and a quarter three months Not inducement enough If you will say ten at six months perhaps I will close with you No I have named the lowest price and best terms If you like to take the goods well and good if not why you can go on and pay ten and a half cash as before I ll give you what I said Oh no mister Eldon Not a cent less will bring them Very well Then we can t trade said the manufacturer As you like replied the merchant And the two men parted Now Eldon thought the offer of Lladd a very fair one and meant to accept of it if he could make no better terms but seeing that the merchant had taken the pains to come and offer him the goods he suspected that he was in want of money and would take less than he asked in order to get his note and pass it through bank But he erred in this Eldon fully expected to see mister Lladd before three days went by But two weeks elapsed and as there had been no visit from the dealer the manufacturer found it necessary to go to him in order to get a fresh supply of goods So he went to see him I must have a dozen pieces of those goods to day said he as he met mister Lladd Very well They are at your service You ll sell them at ten and a quarter I suppose mister Lladd shook his head But you offered them at that you know I offered the whole lot at that price and the offer is still open though I am in no way particular about selling Since ten dollars and a quarter a piece had been mentioned the idea of paying more had become entirely obliterated from the mind of Eldon But if you can sell for ten and a quarter three months you can sell for the same cash Yes so I can but I don t mean to do it The merchant felt a little fretted Eldon was disappointed He stood chaffering for some time longer but finding it impossible to bring Lladd over to his terms he finally agreed to take the two hundred pieces at ten and a quarter on his note at three months Still he was far from being satisfied He had fully believed that the merchant was pressed for money and that he would in consequence be able to drive a hard bargain with him Notwithstanding he had been compelled to go to Lladd and to accept his terms he yet believed that money was an object to him and that rather than not have the sale confirmed he would let it be closed at ten dollars a piece on a note at six months So firmly was he impressed with this idea that he finally concluded to assume boldly that ten dollars was the price agreed upon and to affect surprise that the bill expressed any other rate In due time the goods were delivered and the bill sent in Immediately upon this being done Eldon called upon the merchant and said in a confident manner as he laid the bill he had received upon his desk You ve made a mistake haven t you How In charging these goods No I told you the price would be ten and a quarter didn t I I believe not I understood the terms to be ten dollars at six months You offered that but I positively refused it I am sure I understood you as accepting my offer and ordered the goods to be sent home under that impression If so you erred coolly replied Lladd I can t take them at the price called for in this bill said Eldon assuming a positive air and thinking by doing so Lladd would deem it his better policy to let the goods go at ten dollars Then you can send them home replied the merchant in a manner that offended Eldon Very well I will do so and you may keep your goods he retorted betraying as he spoke a good deal of warmth And the goods were sent back both parties feeling offended Lladd at the glaring attempt made to overreach him and Eldon because the other would not submit to be overreached On the day following Eldon started out in search of another lot of the goods he wanted and thought himself fortunate in meeting with some in the hands of a dealer named Miller but demurred when twelve dollars and a half a piece were asked for them I can t take less was replied But said Eldon Lladd has the same article for ten and a half You don t pretend to put his goods alongside of mine returned Miller Eldon examined them more closely They are better it is true But the difference is not so great as the price Look again Another close examination was made They are finer and thicker certainly But you ask too much for them It s my lowest price They will bring it in the market which is now bare Won t you let me have a dozen pieces at twelve dollars asked Eldon Can t sell a piece for less than what I said Eldon hung on for some time but finally ordered a dozen pieces to be sent home and paid the bill though with a bad grace Still he was so angry with Lladd because he had shown a proper resentment at the effort made to overreach him that he determined to buy no more of his goods if he could supply himself at a higher price Thus matters went on for five or six months Eldon supplying himself at the store of Miller and reconciling himself to the serious advance in price with the reflection that Lladd s goods were remaining dead on his hands At last Miller s supply was exhausted Eldon called one day and ordered a dozen pieces and received for answer Not a piece in the store What All gone said Eldon Yes you got the last some days ago I m sorry for that Lladd has a good stock on hand but I don t care about dealing with him if I can help it He s a crusty sort of a fellow Has no other house a supply Not to my knowledge There is only a limited demand for the article you know and but few importers care about ordering it for the reason that it goes off slowly Eldon tried several places but couldn t find a yard By the next day his workmen would be idle and so he had no alternative but to call upon Lladd The merchant received him pleasantly and they chatted for a while on matters and things in general At last Eldon though it went against the grain said I want you to send me twenty pieces of those goods around with the bill The merchant smiled blandly and replied Sorry I can t accommodate you But I haven t a yard in the store What Lladd looked blank No I have sold off the entire lot and concluded not to import any more of that class of goods Ah I supposed they were still on hand No I placed them in the hands of Miller and he has worked them all off for me at a considerable advance on former prices He notified me a week ago that the lot was closed out and rendered account sales at twelve and a half per piece Lladd said all this seemingly unconscious that every word he was uttering fell like a blow upon his old customer But he understood it all very well and had caught the hard bargain maker in a trap he little dreamed had been laid for his feet Eldon stammered out some half coherent responses and took his departure with more evidences of his discomfiture in his face and manner than he wished to appear He had in fact been paying twelve dollars and a half for the very goods he had sent back because he couldn t get them for ten dollars at six months credit Eldon did not understand how completely he had overreached himself until a part of his establishment had been idle for days and he had been compelled to go to New York and purchase some fifty pieces of the goods he wanted for cash at twelve dollars per piece a price that he is still compelled to pay as neither Lladd nor any other importing house in the city has since ordered a case from abroad So much for driving a hard bargain OUT OF THE FRYING PAN INTO THE FIRE OR THE LOVE OF A HOUSE HADN T you better give your landlord notice to day that we will move at the end of the year mister Plunket Move For heaven s sake Sarah what do we want to move for mister Plunket missus Plunket It s a very strange way for you to address me mister Plunket A very strange way But for what on earth do you want to move Sarah Tell me that I m sure we are comfortable enough off here Here I wouldn t live in this miserable house another twelve months if you gave me the rent free I don t see any thing so terribly bad about the house I am well satisfied Are you indeed But I am not I can tell you for your comfort What s the matter with the house Every thing There isn t a comfortable or decent room in it from the garret to the cellar Not one It s a horrid place to live in and such a neighbourhood to bring up children in You thought it a love of a house a year ago Me mister Plunket I never liked it and it was all your fault that we ever took the miserable affair My fault Bless me Sarah what are you talking about I didn t want to move from where we were I never want to move Oh no you d live in a pigstye for ever if you once got there rather than take the trouble to get out of it missus Plunket mister Plunket Wise from experience the gentleman deemed it better to run than fight So muttering to himself he took up his hat and beat a hasty retreat missus Plunket had a mother a fact of which mister Plunket was perfectly aware particularly as said relative was a member of his family She happened to be present when the above spicy conversation took place As soon as he had retired she broke out with Humph just like him any thing to be contrary But I wouldn t live in this old rattle trap of a place another year for any man that ever stepped into shoe leather No indeed not I Out of repair from top to bottom not a single convenience so to speak walls cracked paper soiled and paint yellow as a pumpkin And worse than all ma every closet is infested with ants and overrun with mice Ugh I m afraid to open a cupboard or look into a drawer Why yesterday a mouse jumped upon me and came near going into my bosom I almost fainted Oh dear I never can live in this house another year it is out of the question I should die No one thinks of it except mister Plunket and he s always opposed to every thing but that s no matter If he don t notify the landlord we can Live here another twelvemonth No indeed I saw a bill on a house in Seventh street yesterday and I had a great mind then to stop and look at it It was a beautiful place just what we want Put your things on Sarah right away and go and see about it Depend upon it we can t do worse than this Worse No indeed that s impossible But mister Plunket Pshaw never mind him he s opposed to every thing If you had given him his way where would you have been now missus Plunket did not reply to this for the question brought back the recollection of a beautiful little house new and perfect in every part from which she had forced her husband to move because the parlours were not quite large enough Never before nor since had they been so comfortably situated Acting as well from her own inclination as from her mother s advice missus Plunket went and made an examination of the house upon which she had seen the bill Oh it is such a love of a house she said upon her return Perfect in every respect it is larger than this and is full of closets and the rent is just the same Did you get the refusal of it Yes I told the landlord that I would give him an answer by to morrow morning He says there are a great many people after it that he could have rented it a dozen times if he had approved the tenants who offered He says he knows mister Plunket very well and will be happy to rent him the house We must take it by all means That is if mister Plunket is willing Willing Of course he ll have to be willing Oh it is such a love of a house ma I m sure it must be A very different kind of an affair from this you may be certain When mister Plunket came home that evening his wife said to him quite amiably Oh you don t know what a love of a house I saw to day up in Seventh street larger better and more convenient than this in every way and the rent is just the same But I am sure Sarah we are very comfortable here Comfortable Good gracious mister Plunket I should like to know what you call comfort How can any one be comfortable in such a miserable old rattletrap of a place as this You thought it a love of a house you remember before we came into it Me Me mister Plunket Why I never liked it and it was all your fault that we ever moved here My fault Yes indeed it was all your fault I wanted the house in Walnut street but you were afraid of a little more rent Oh no mister Plunket you mustn t blame me for moving into this barracks of a place you have only yourself to thank for that and now I want to get out of it on the first good opportunity Poor mister Plunket was silenced The very boldness of the position taken by his wife completely knocked him hors du combat His fault indeed He would have lived on year after year in a log cabin rather than encounter the horrors of moving and yet he was in the habit of moving about once a year What could he do now He had yielded so long to his wife who had grown bolder at each concession that opposition was now hopeless Had she stood alone there might have been some chance for him but backed up as she was by her puissant mother victory was sure to perch on her banner and well did mister Plunket know this It will cost at least a hundred and fifty or two hundred dollars to move he ventured to suggest Indeed and it will cost no such thing I ll guaranty the whole removal for ten dollars It cost over a hundred last year Nonsense it didn t cost a fifth of it But mister Plunket knew he had the best right to know for he had paid the bills From the first mister Plunket felt that opposition was useless A natural repugnance to change and a horror of the disorder and discomfort of moving caused him to make a feeble resistance but the opposing current swept strongly against him and he had to yield The house in Seventh street was taken and in due time the breaking up and change came Carpets were lifted boxes barrels and trunks packed and all the disorderly elements of a regular moving operation called into activity Every preparation had been made on the day previous to the contemplated flight the cars were to be at the door by eight o clock on the next morning In anticipation of this early movement the children had been dragged out of bed an hour before their usual time for rising They were in consequence cross and unreasonable but not more so than mother grandmother and nurse all of whom either boxed them scolded them or jerked them about in a most violent manner Breakfast was served early but such a breakfast the least said about that the better It was well there were no keen appetites to turn away with disappointment Strange that the cars are not here said mister Plunket who had put himself in going order It s nearly half an hour past the time now Oh dear confound all this moving say I That s a strange way for you to talk before children mister Plunket retorted his wife And this is a much stranger way for you to act madam for ever dragging your husband and children about from post to pillar For my part I feel like Noah s dove without a place to rest the sole of my foot mister Plunket missus Plunket A war of words was about commencing but the furniture cars drove up at the moment when an armistice took place In due time the family of the Plunkets were bag and baggage in their new house A lover of quiet the male head of the establishment tried to refrain from any remarks calculated to excite his helpmate but this was next to impossible there being so much in the new house that he could not in conscience approve If missus Plunket would have kept quiet all might have gone on very smoothly but missus Plunket could not or would not keep quiet She was extravagant in her praise of every thing and incessant in her comparisons between the old and the new house mister Plunket listened and bit his lip to keep silent At last the lady said to him with a coaxing smile for she was not going to rest until some words of approval were extorted from her liege lord Now mister Plunket don t you think this a love of a house No was the gruff answer mister Plunket Why what is your objection I m sure we can t be more uncomfortable than we have been for a year Oh yes we can How so There is such a thing as going from the frying pan into the fire mister Plunket Just what you ll find we have done madam How will you make that appear pray In a few words Just step this way Do you see that building I do Just to the south west of us from that quarter the cool breezes of summer come We shall now have them fragrant with the delightful exhalations of a slaughter house Humph Won t that be delightful Then again the house is damp Oh no The landlord assured me it was as dry as a bone The landlord lied then I ve been from garret to cellar half a dozen times and it is just as I say My eyes never deceive me As to its being a better or more comfortable house that is all in my eye I wouldn t give as much for it by fifty dollars as for the one we have left Notwithstanding missus Plunket s efforts to induce her husband to praise the house she was not as well satisfied with it as she was at the first inspection of the premises I m sure she replied in rather a subdued manner that it is quite as good as the old house and has many advantages over it Name one said her husband It is not overrun with vermin Wait a while and see Oh I know it isn t How do you know I asked the landlord particularly And he said no He did Humph We shall see And they did see Tired but with a day s moving and fixing the whole family feeling hungry out of humour and uncomfortable descended to the kitchen after it had become dark to overhaul the provision baskets and get a cold cut of some kind But alas to their dismay it was found that another family and that a numerous one already had possession Floor dresser and walls were alive with a starving colony of enormous cockroaches and the baskets into which bread meats c had been packed were literally swarming with them In horror man woman and child beat a hasty retreat and left the premises It would hardly be fair to record all the sayings and doings of that eventful evening Overwearied in body and mind the family retired to rest but some of them alas not to sleep From washboards and every other part of the chamber in which a crevice existed crept out certain little animals not always to be mentioned to ears polite and more bold than the denizens of the kitchen made immediate demonstrations on the persons of master mistress child and maid It took less than a week to prove satisfactorily to missus Plunket though she did not admit the fact that the new house was not to be compared with the old one in any respect It had not a single advantage over the other while the disadvantages were felt by every member of the family In a few months however mister Plunket began to feel at home and to settle down into contentment but as he grew better and better satisfied his wife grew more and more desirous of change and is now as the year begins to draw to a close looking about her for bills on houses and examining every day the to let department of the newspapers with a lively degree of interest mister Plunket will probably resist stoutly when this lady proposes some new love of a house but it will be of no use he will have to pull up stakes and try it again It is his destiny he has got a moving wife and there is no help for him MARRYING A COUNT IS any body dead Yes somebody dies every second So they say But I don t mean that Why are you looking so solemn I am not aware that I look so very solemn You do then as solemn as the grave Then I must be a grave subject The young man affected to smile You smile like a death s head Abel What is the matter Abel Lee took his interrogator by the arm and drew him aside When they were a little apart from the company he said in a low voice You know that I have taken a fancy to Arabella Jones Yes you told me that a month ago She is here to night So I see And is as cold to me as an icicle For a very plain reason Yes too plain Whiskers and moustaches are driving all before them The man is nothing now hair is every thing Glover will carry off the prize unless you can hit upon some plan to win back the favour of Miss Arabella You must come forward with higher attractions than this rival can bring Lee drew his fingers involuntarily over his smooth lip and chin a movement which his friend observed and comprehended Before the hair can grow Arabella will be won he said Do you think I would make such a fool of myself Fool of yourself What do you mean by that You say you love Arabella Jones If you wish to win her you must make yourself attractive in her eyes To make yourself attractive you have only to cultivate whiskers moustaches and an imperial and present a more luxuriant crop than Glover The whole matter is very simple and comprised in a nut shell The only difficulty in the way is the loss of time consequent upon the raising of this hairy crop It is plain in fact that you must take a shorter way you must purchase what you haven t time to grow Hide yourself for a week or two and then make your appearance with enough hair upon your face to conceal one half or two thirds of your features and your way to the heart of Miss Jones is direct I feel too serious on the subject to make it a matter of jesting said Lee not by any means relishing the levity of his friend But my dear sir urged the friend what I propose is your only chance Glover will have it all his own way if you do not take some means to head him off The matter is plain enough In the days of chivalry a knight would do almost any unreasonable thing enter upon almost any mad adventure to secure the favour of his lady love and will you hesitate when nothing of more importance than the donning of false whiskers and moustaches is concerned You don t deserve to be thought of by Miss Jones Jest away Marston if it is so pleasant to you remarked Lee with a slightly offended air No but my dear fellow I am in earnest I really wish to serve you Still if the only plan at all likely to succeed is so repugnant to your feelings you must let the whole matter go Depend upon it there is no other chance for you with the lady Then she must go I would not make a fool of myself for the Queen of Sheba A man who sacrifices his own self respect in order to secure the love of a woman becomes unworthy of her love Well said Abel Lee That is the sentiment of a right mind and proves to me that Arabella Jones is unworthy of you Let her go to the whiskers and do you try to find some one who has soul enough to love the man The young men separated to mingle with the company Marston could not help noticing Miss Arabella Jones more particularly than before and perceived that she was coldly polite to all the young men who ventured to approach her but warm and smiling as a June morning to an individual named Glover who had been abroad and returned home rich in hairy honours if in nothing else The manners of this Glover distinguished him as much as his appearance To think that a woman could be attracted by a thing like that he said to himself a little pettishly as he saw the alacrity with which Arabella seized the offered arm of Glover to accompany him to the supper table Marston was a fellow of a good deal of humour and relished practical joking rather more than was consistent with the comfort of other people We cannot commend him for this trait of character But it was one of his faults and all men have their failings It would have given him great pleasure could he have induced Abel Lee to set up a rivalry in the moustache and whisker line but Abel had too much good sense for that and Marston be it said to his credit was rejoiced to find that he had Still the idea having once entered his head he could not drive it away He had a most unconquerable desire to see some one start in opposition to Glover and was half tempted to do it himself for the mere fun of the thing But this was rather more trouble than he wished to take Not very long after this a young stranger made his appearance in fashionable circles and created quite a flutter among the ladies He had besides larger whiskers larger moustache and larger imperial than Glover a superb goatee and a decided foreign accent He soon threw the American in the shade especially as a whisper got out that he was a French count travelling through the country who purposely concealed his title The object of his visit it was also said was the selection of a wife from among the lovely and unsophisticated daughters of America He wished to find some one who had never breathed the artificial air of the higher circles in his own country who would love him for himself alone and become his loving companion through life How all these important facts in relation to him got wind few paused to inquire Young ladies forgot their plain faced untitled vulgar lovers and put on their best looks and most winning graces for the count For a time he carried all before him Daily might he be seen in Chestnut street gallanting some favoured belle with the elegant air of a dancing master and the grimace of a monkey Staid citizens stopped to look at him and plain old ladies were half in doubt whether he were a man or a pongo At last the count s more particular attentions were directed toward Miss Arabella Jones and from that time the favoured Glover found that his star had passed its zenith It was in vain that he curled his moustache more fiercely and hid his chin in a goatee fully as large as the count s all was of no avail The ladies generally and Miss Arabella in particular looked coldly upon him As for Abel Lee the bitterness of his disappointment was already past The conduct of Arabella had disgusted him and he therefore looked calmly on and marked the progress of events At length the count from paying marked attention to Arabella in company began to visit her occasionally at her father s house little to the satisfaction of mister Jones the father who had never worn a whisker in his life and had a most bitter aversion to moustaches This being the case the course of Arabella s love did not it may be supposed run very smooth for her father told her very decidedly that he was not going to have that monkey faced fellow coming about his house Shocked at such vulgar language Arabella replied Gracious me father Don t speak in that way of mister De Courci He s a French count travelling in disguise A French monkey What on earth put that nonsense into your head Everybody knows it father mister De Courci tried to conceal his rank but his English valet betrayed the secret He is said to be connected with one of the oldest families in France and to have immense estates near Paris The largest estates he possesses are in Whiskerando if you ever heard of that place A French count Preposterous I know it to be true said Arabella emphatically How do you know it Miss Confidence I know it from the fact that I hinted to him delicately my knowledge of his rank abroad and he did not deny it His looks and his manner betrayed what he was attempting to conceal Arabella said mister Jones with a good deal of sternness if you were silly enough to hint to this fellow what you say you did and he was impostor enough not to deny it on the spot in the most unequivocal terms then he adds the character of a designing villain to that of a senseless fop In the name of homely American common sense can you not see as plain as daylight that he is no nearer akin to a foreign nobleman than his barber or boot black may be Arabella was silenced because it was folly to contend in this matter with her father who was a blunt common sense clear seeing man but she was not in the least convinced mister De Courci was not a French count for all he might say and what was better evidently saw attractions in her superior to those of which any of her fair compeers could boast My dear Miss Jones said the count when they next met speaking in that delightful foreign accent so pleasant to the ear of the young lady and with the frankness peculiar to his nature I cannot withhold from you the honest expression of my sentiments It would be unjust to myself and unjust to you for those sentiments too nearly involve my own peace and it may be yours The count hesitated and looked interesting Arabella blushed and trembled The words You will speak to my father were on the young lady s tongue But she checked herself and remained silent It would not do to make that reference of the subject Then came a gentle pressure of hair upon her cheek and a gentle pressure from the gloved hand in which her own was resting My dear young lady am I understood Arabella answered delicately by returning the gentle pressure of her hand and leaning perceptibly nearer the Count De Courci I am the happiest of men said the count enthusiastically And I the happiest of women responded Arabella not audibly but in spirit Your father said De Courci Shall I see him It will not be well yet replied the maiden evincing a good deal of confusion My father is Is what asked the nobleman slightly elevating his person Is a man of some peculiar notions Is in fact too rigidly American He does not like Arabella hesitated Doesn t like foreigners Ah I comprehend and the count shrugged his shoulders and looked dignified that is as dignified as a man whose face is covered with hair can look I am sorry to say that he has unfounded prejudices against every thing not vulgarly American He will not consent then I fear not mister De Courci Hum m Ah and the count thought for some moments Will not consent What then Arabella and he warmed in his manner Arabella shall an unfounded prejudice interpose with its icy barriers Shall hearts that are ready to melt into one be kept apart by the mere word of a man Forbid it love But suppose I go to him It will be useless He is as unbending as iron Such being the case the count proposed an elopement to which Arabella agreed after the expression of as much reluctance as seemed to be called for A few weeks subsequently mister Jones received a letter from some person unknown advising him of the fact that if at a certain hour on that evening he would go to a certain place he would intercept mister De Courci in the act of running away with his daughter This intelligence half maddened the father He hurried home intending to confront Arabella with the letter he had received and then lock her up in her room But she had gone out an hour before Pacing the floor in a state of strong excitement he awaited her return until the shadows of evening began to fall Darkness closed over all things but still she was away and it soon became evident that she did not mean to come back It was arranged between De Courci and Arabella that he was to wait for her with a carriage at a retired place in the suburbs where she was to join him They were then to drive to a minister s get the marriage ceremony performed and proceed thence to take possession of an elegant suite of rooms which had been engaged in one of the most fashionable hotels in the city To escape all danger of interference with her movements the young lady had left home some hours before evening and spent the time between that and the blissful period looked for with such trembling delight in the company of a young friend and confidante Darkness at length threw a veil over all things and under cover of this veil Arabella went forth alone and hurried to the appointed place of meeting A lamp showed her the carriage in waiting and a man pacing slowly the pavement near by while she was a considerable distance off Her heart beat wildly the breath came heavily up from her bosom She quickened her pace but soon stopped suddenly in alarm for she saw a man advancing rapidly from another quarter It a few moments this individual came up to the person who was walking before the carriage and whom she saw to be her lover Loud words instantly followed and she was near enough to hear an angry voice say Ill count you you base scoundrel It was the voice of her father Fearful lest violence should be done to her lover Arabella screamed and flew to the spot Already was the hand of mister Jones at De Courci s throat but the count in disguise not relishing the rough grasp of the indignant father disengaged himself and fled ingloriously leaving poor Arabella to the unbroken fury of his ire Without much ceremony he thrust her into the waiting carriage and giving the driver a few hurried directions entered himself What passed between the disappointed countess that was to be and her excited father it is not our business to relate Not content with having interrupted this nice little matrimonial arrangement mister Jones called at the hotel where De Courci put up early on the next morning But the elegant foreigner had not occupied his apartments during the night He called a few hours later but he had not yet made his appearance in the morning but De Courci was still away On the next morning the following notice appeared in one of the daily newspapers NIPPED IN THE BUD Fashionable people will remember a whiskered mustachioed fellow with a foreign accent named De Courci who has been turning the heads of half the silly young girls in town for the last two months He permitted it to leak out we believe that he was a French count with immense estates near Paris who had come to this country in order to look for a wife This was of course believed for there are people willing to credit the most improbable stories in the world Very soon a love affair came on and he was about running off with the silly daughter of a good substantial citizen By some means the father got wind of the matter and repaired to the appointed place of meeting just in time He found De Courci and a carriage in waiting Without much ceremony he laid violent hands on the count who thought it better to run than to fight and therefore fled ingloriously just as the daughter arrived on the ground He has not been heard of since We could write a column by way of commentary upon this circumstance but think that the facts in the case speak so plainly for themselves that not a single remark is needed to give them force We wish the lady joy at her escape for the count in disguise is no doubt a scheming villain at heart Poor Arabella was dreadfully cut down when this notice met her eye It was a long time before she ventured into company again and ever after had a mortal aversion to mustaches and imperials The count never after made his appearance in Philadelphia The young man named Marston who had jested with Abel Lee about the loss of his lady love was seated in his room some ten minutes after the sudden appearance of mister Jones at the place of meeting between the lovers when his door was thrown open and in bounded De Courci hair and all Cloak hat and hair were instantly thrown aside and a smooth young laughing face revealed itself from behind whiskers moustaches imperials and goatee Where s the countess asked Marston in a merry voice Did she faint Dear knows That sturdy old American father of hers got me by the throat before I could say Jack Robinson and I was glad to make off with a whole skin Arabella arrived at the moment and gave a glorious scream Of any thing further deponent sayeth not She ll be cured of moustaches or I m no prophet I guess she will But the fact is Marston and the young man looked serious I m afraid this joke has been carried too far Not at all The moral effect will tell upon our silly young ladies whose heads are turned with a foreign accent and a hairy lip You acted the whiskered fop to a charm No one could have dreamed that all was counterfeit So far as the general effect is concerned I have no doubt but I m afraid it was wrong to victimize Miss Arabella for the benefit of the whole race of weak minded girls The effect upon her may be more serious than we apprehend No I think not The woman who could pass by as true a young man as Abel Lee for a foreign count in disguise hasn t heart enough to receive a deep injury She will be terribly mortified but that will do her good If it turn out no worse than that I shall be glad But I must own now that the whole thing is over that I am not as well satisfied with myself as I thought I would be I don t know what my good sisters at the South would say if they knew I had been engaged in such a mad cap affair But I lay all the blame upon you You with your cool head ought to have known better than to start a young hot brained fellow like me just let loose from college upon such a wild adventure I m afraid that if Jones had once got me fairly into his clutches he would have made daylight shine through me Ha ha No doubt of it But come don t begin to look long faced We will keep our own counsel and no one need be the wiser for our participation in this matter Wait a while and let us enjoy the nine days wonder that will follow But the young man who was a relative of Marston and who had come to the city fresh from college just in the nick of time for the latter felt now that the excitement of his wild prank was over a great deal more sober about the matter than he had expected to feel Reason and reflection told him that he had no right to trifle with any one as he had trifled with Arabella Jones But it was too late to mend the matter No great harm however came of it and perhaps good for a year subsequently Abel Lee conducted his old flame to the altar and she makes him a loving and faithful wife JOB S COMFORTERS OR THE LADY WITH NERVES WHAT a blessed era in the world s history that was when the ladies had no nerves Alas I was born too late instead of too early as the complaint of some is I am cursed with nerves and as a consequence am ever and anon distressed with nervous fears of some direful calamity or painful affliction I am a simpleton for this I know but then how can I help it I try to be a woman of sense but my nerves are too delicately strung Reason is not sufficient to subdue the fears of impending evil that too often haunt me It would not be so bad with me if I did not find so many good souls ready to add fuel to the flames of my fears One of my most horrible apprehensions since I have been old enough to think about it has been of that dreadful disease cancer I am sure I shall die of it or if not some time in life have to endure a frightful operation for its removal I have had a dull and sometimes an acute pain in one of my breasts for some years I am sure it is a cancer forming though my husband always ridicules my fears A few days ago a lady called in to see me The pain had been troubling me and I felt nervous and depressed You don t look well said my visitor I am not very well I replied Nothing serious I hope I am afraid there is missus A I looked gloomy I suppose for I felt so You really alarm me What can be the matter I don t know that I have ever mentioned it to you but I have for a long time had a pain in my left breast where I once had a gathering and in which hard lumps have ever since remained These have increased in size of late and I am now confirmed in my fears that a cancer is forming Bless me And my visitor lifted both hands and eyes What kind of a pain is it A dull aching pain with occasional stitches running out from one spot as if roots were forming Just the very kind of pain that missus N had for some months before the doctors pronounced her affection cancer You know missus N Not personally I have heard of her You know she had one of her breasts taken off Had she I asked in a husky voice I had horrible feelings Oh yes My visitor spoke with animation She had an operation performed about six months ago It was dreadful Poor soul My blood fairly curdled but my visitor did not notice the effect of her words How long did the operation last I ventured to inquire Half an hour Half an hour So long Yes it was a full half hour from the time the first incision was made until the last little artery was taken up Horrible horrible I ejaculated closing my eyes and shuddering If so horrible to think of what must it be in reality said my thoughtless visitor If it were my case I would prefer death But missus N is not an ordinary woman She possesses unusual fortitude and would brave any thing for the sake of her husband and children It took even her however a long time to make up her mind to have the operation performed and it was only when she was satisfied that further delay would endanger her life that she consented to have it done I saw her just the day before she looked exceedingly pale and said but little A very intimate friend was with her whom I was surprised to hear talk to her in the liveliest manner upon subjects of the most ordinary interest She was relating a very amusing story which she had read when I entered and was laughing at the incidents Even missus N smiled It seemed to me very much out of place and really a mockery to the poor creature it was downright cruel How any one could do so I cannot imagine My dear madam I said as soon as I could get a chance to speak to her how do you feel I am grieved to death at the dreadful operation you will have to go through But you must bear it bravely it will soon be over She thanked me with tears in her eyes for my kind sympathies and said that she hoped she would be sustained through the severe trial Before I could get a chance to reply her friend broke in with some nonsensical stuff that made poor missus N laugh in spite of herself even though the tears were glistening on her eyelashes I felt really shocked And then she ran on in the wildest strain you ever heard turning even the most serious remark I could make into fun And would you believe it she treated with levity the operation itself whenever I alluded to it and said that it was nothing to fear a little smarting and a little pain but not so bad as a bad toothache she would wager a dollar That is all very well for you to say I replied my feelings of indignation almost boiling over but if you had the operation to bear you would find it a good deal worse than a bad toothache or the severest pain you ever suffered in your life Even this was turned into sport I never saw such a woman I believe she would have laughed in a cholera hospital I left assuring missus N of my deepest sympathies and urged her to nerve herself for the sad trial to which she was so soon to be subjected I was not present when the operation was performed but one who attended all through the fearful scene gave me a minute description of every thing that occurred The thought of hearing the details of a dreadful operation made me sick at heart and yet I felt a morbid desire to know all about it I could not ask my visitor to pause and yet I dreaded to hear her utter another sentence Such was the strange disorder of my feelings But it mattered not what process of thought was going on in my mind or what was the state of my feelings my visitor went steadily on with her story while every fifth word added a beat to my pulse per minute The effect of this detail was to increase all the cancerous symptoms in my breast or to cause me to imagine that they were increased When my husband came home I was in a sad state of nervous excitement He anxiously inquired the cause My breast feels much worse than it has felt for a long time said I I am sure a cancer is forming I have all the symptoms Do you know the symptoms he asked missus N had a cancer in her breast and my symptoms all resemble hers How do you know missus A has been here and she is quite intimate with missus N All my symptoms she says are precisely like hers I wish missus A was in the deserts of Arabia said my husband in a passion Even if what she said were true what business had she to say it Harm not good could come of it But I don t believe you have any more cancer in your breast than I have There is an obstruction and hardening of the glands and that is about all But missus N s breast was just like mine for missus A says so She described the feeling missus N had and mine is precisely like it missus A neither felt the peculiar sensation in missus N s breast nor in yours and therefore cannot know that they are alike She is an idle croaking gossip and I wish she would never cross our threshold She always does harm I felt that she had done me harm but I wouldn t say so I was a good deal vexed at the way my husband treated the matter and accused him of indifference as to whether I had a cancer or not He bore the accusation very patiently as indeed he always does any of my sudden ebullitions of feeling He knows my weakness If I thought there were danger he mildly said I would be as much troubled as you are As to danger that is imminent enough I returned fretfully On the contrary I am satisfied that there is none One of your symptoms makes this perfectly clear Indeed What symptom I eagerly asked Your terrible fears of a cancer are an almost certain sign that you will never have one The evil we most fear rarely if ever falls upon us That is a very strange way to talk I replied But a true way nevertheless said my husband I can see no reason in it Why should we be troubled to death about a thing that is never going to happen The trouble is bad enough without the reality I suppose We are all doomed to have a certain amount of anxiety and trouble here whether real or imaginary Some have the reality and others the imagination Either is bad enough I don t know which is worse I shall certainly be content to have the imaginary part I replied That part you certainly have and your full share of it I believe you have at some period or other suffered every ill that flesh is heir to As for me I would rather have a good hearty fit of sickness a broken leg or arm or even a cancer and be done with it than become a living Pandora s box even in imagination As you think I am As I know you are Then you would really like to see me have a cancer in my breast and be done with it I said this pretty sharply Don t look so fiercely at me returned my husband smiling I didn t say I would rather you would have a cancer I said I would rather have one and be done with it than suffer as you do from the fear of it and a hundred other evils I must say you are quite complimentary to your wife I returned in a little better humour than I had yet spoken The fact was my mind took hold of what my husband said about real and imaginary evils and was somewhat braced up Of imaginary evils I had certainly had enough to entitle me to a whole lifetime exemption from real ones From the time missus A left me until my husband came in the pain in my breast had steadily increased accompanied by a burning and stinging sensation In imagination I could clearly feel the entire cancerous nucleus and perceive the roots eating their way in all directions around it This feeling when I now directed my thoughts to my breast was gone very little pain remained After tea my husband went out and returned in about an hour He said he had been round to consult with our physician who assured him that he had seen hundreds of cases like mine not one of which terminated in cancer that such glandular obstructions were common and might under certain circumstances unless great care were used cause inflammation and suppuration but were no more productive of cancer a very rare disease and consequent upon hereditary tendencies than were any of the glandular obstructions or gatherings in other parts of the body But the breast is so tender a place I said And yet returned my husband the annals of surgery show ten cancers in other parts of the body to one in the breast In this way my husband dissipated my fears and restored my mind to a comparatively healthy state This however did not long remain I was attacked on the next day with a dull deeply seated pain in one of my jaw teeth At first I did not regard it much but its longer continuance than usual began to excite my fears especially as the tooth was to all appearance sound While suffering from this attack I had a visit from another friend of the same class with missus A She was a kind good natured soul and would watch by your sick bed untiringly night after night and do it with real pleasure But she had like missus A a very thoughtless habit of relating the many direful afflictions and scenes of human suffering it had been her lot to witness and hear of unconscious that she often did great harm thereby particularly when these things were done as was too often the case apropos You are not well she said when she came in and saw the expression of pain in my face What is the matter Nothing more than a very troublesome tooth ache I replied Use a little kreosote said she I would but the tooth is sound A sound tooth is it My visitor s tone and look made my heart beat quicker Yes it is perfectly sound I am always afraid of an aching tooth that is perfectly sound since poor missus P had such a time with her jaw What was that I asked feeling instantly alarmed Which tooth is it that aches my friend asked I pointed it out The very same one that troubled missus P for several months night and day Was the pain low and throbbing I eagerly asked Yes that was exactly the kind of pain she had And did it continue so long as several months Oh yes But that wasn t the worst the aching was caused by the formation of an abscess A what A cold chill passed over me An abscess At the root of her tooth Yes But that wasn t so bad as its consequences the abscess caused the bone to decay and produced what the doctors called a disease of the antrum which extended until the bone was eaten clear through so that the abscess discharged itself by the nostrils Oh horrible I exclaimed feeling as sick as death while the pain in my tooth was increased fourfold How long did you say this abscess was in forming Some months Did she have an operation performed I have a terrible fear of operations Oh yes It was the only thing that saved her life They scraped all the flesh away on one cheek and then cut a hole through the bone This was after the tooth had been drawn in doing which the jaw bone was broken dreadfully It was months before it healed or before she could eat with any thing but a spoon This completely unmanned or rather unwomanned me I asked no more questions although my visitor continued to give me a good deal of minute information on the subject of abscesses and the dreadful consequences that too frequently attended them After she left another friend called to whom I mentioned the fact of having a very bad tooth ache and asked her if she had ever known any one to have an abscess at the root of a sound tooth She replied that tooth ache from that cause was not unfrequent and that sometimes very bad consequences resulted from it She advised me by all means to have the tooth extracted I can t bear the thought of that I replied I never had but one tooth drawn and when I think of having another extracted I grow cold all over Still that is much better than having caries of the jaw which has been known to attend an abscess at the root of a tooth But this does not always follow No It is of rare occurrence I believe Though no one knows when such a disease exists nor where it is going to terminate Even apart from caries of the jaw the thing is painful enough missus T an intimate friend of mine suffered for nearly a mouth night and day and finally had to have the tooth extracted when her mouth was so much inflamed and so tender that the slightest touch caused the most exquisite pain A tumor was found at the root of the tooth as large as a pigeon s egg This completed the entire overthrow of my nerves I begged my friend in mercy to spare me any further relations of this kind She seemed half offended and I had to explain the state of mind which had been produced by what a former visitor had said She evidently thought me a very weak woman No doubt I am In the dumps again Kate said my husband when he returned home in the evening What is the matter now Enough to put you or any one else in the dumps I replied fretfully This tooth ache grows worse instead of better Does it indeed I am really very sorry Can t any thing be done to relieve you Nothing I am persuaded The tooth is sound and there must be an abscess forming at the root to occasion so much pain Who in the name of common sense has put this in your head My husband was worried Has missus A been here again No was my simple response Then what has conjured up this bugbear to frighten you out of your seven senses I didn t like this language at all My husband seemed captious and unreasonable Dear soul I supposed he had cause for they say a nervous woman is enough to worry a man s life out of him and dear knows I am nervous enough But I had only my fears before me then I saw that my husband did not sympathize with me in the least I merely replied It may be very well for you to speak to your wife in this way after she has suffered for nearly three days with a wretched tooth ache If the tooth were at all decayed or there were any apparent cause for the pain I could bear it well enough and wouldn t trouble you about it But it is so clear to my mind now that nothing but a tumour forming at the root could produce such a steady deep seated throbbing pain that I am with reason alarmed and instead of sympathy from my husband I am met with something very much like ridicule My dear Kate said my husband tenderly and in a serious voice pardon my apparent harshness and indifference If you are really so serious about the matter it may be as well to consult a dentist and get his advice He may be able to relieve very greatly your fears if not the pain in your jaw He will order the tooth to be extracted I have not the least doubt If there should be a tumour at the root it will be much safer to have it out than let it remain A visit to the dentist at once was so strenuously urged by my husband that I couldn t refuse to go I got myself ready and we went around before tea I did not leave the house however before making my husband promise he would not insist upon my having the tooth taken out on the first visit This he did readily The dentist after examining very carefully the tooth pointed out to him said that he didn t believe that tooth ached at all Not ache doctor said I a little indignantly If you had it in your head you would think it ached Pardon me madam he returned with a polite bow I did not mean to say that you were not in pain I only mean to say that I think that you are mistaken in its exact locality I don t see how I can be I have had it long enough I should think to determine its locality with some certainty Let me examine your mouth again madam said the dentist This time he examined the right jaw the pain was on the left side I think I have found out the enemy said he as he took the instrument from my mouth with which he had been sounding my teeth The corresponding tooth on the other side has commenced decaying and the nerve is already slightly exposed But what has that to do with this side I put my hand where the pain was as I spoke It may have a good deal to do with it We shall soon see And he went to his case of instruments You are not going to extract it doctor I rose from the operating chair in alarm Oh no no madam I am only going to put something into it to destroy the sensibility of the nerve previous to preparing it for being filled The tooth can still be preserved We will know in a minute or two whether all the difficulty lies here A preparation in which I could perceive the taste and odour of creosote was inserted in the cavity of the decayed tooth In less than five seconds I was free from pain I thought that was it said the dentist smiling A sound tooth is not very apt to ache of itself It is sometimes difficult to tell which is the troublesome member But we have discovered the offending one this time and will put an end to the disturbance he has been creating I could say not a word My husband looked at me with a humorous expression in his eye After we were in the street he remarked pleasantly No abscess yet my dear Were it not for physicians who understand their business I am afraid your Job s comforters would soon have you imagine yourself dying and keep up the illusion until you actually gave up the ghost I really am ashamed of myself I replied but you know how shattered my nerves are and how little a thing it takes to unsettle me I do wish my Job s comforters as you call them would have more discretion than to talk to me as they do Let them talk you know it is all talk No not all talk They relate real cases of disease and suffering and I immediately imagine that I have all the symptoms that ultimately lead to the same sad results Be a woman Kate be a woman responded my husband This was all very well and all easily said I believe however I am a woman but a woman of the nineteenth century with nerves far too delicately strung Ah me if some of my kind friends would only be a little more thoughtful they would save me many a wretched day I hope this will meet the eyes of some of them and that they will read it to a little profit It may save others if it does not save me from a repetition of such things as I have described THE CODE OF HONOUR TWO young men one with a leather cap on his head and military buttons on his coat sat in close conversation long years ago in the bar room of the Hotel 
4948-28015-0000	train-other-500	The subject that occupied their attention seemed to be a very exciting one at least to him of the military buttons and black cap for he emphasized strongly knit his brow awfully
4948-28015-0001	train-other-500	and at last went so far as to swear a terrible oath Don t permit yourself to get so excited Tom interposed a friend It won t help the matter at all But I ve got no patience
none	none	 Then it is time you had some coolly returned the friend 
4948-28015-0002	train-other-500	If you intend pushing your way into the good graces of my lady Mary Clinton you must do something more than fume about the little matter of rivalry that has sprung up Yes but to think of a poor milk sop of an author author pah
4948-28015-0003	train-other-500	scribbler to think I say of a spiritless creature like Blake thrusting himself between me and such a girl as Mary Clinton and worse gaining her notice is too bad
4948-28015-0004	train-other-500	He has sonneteered her eyebrows no doubt flattered her in verse until she don t know who or where she is and in this way become a formidable rival But I won t bear it
none	none	 I ll ll What will you do 
4948-28015-0005	train-other-500	Do I ll I ll wing him that s what I ll do I ll challenge the puppy and shoot him And the young lieutenant for such he was flourished his right arm and looked pistol balls and death But he won t fight Tom
4948-28015-0006	train-other-500	Won t he and the lieutenant s face brightened Then I ll post him for a coward that ll finish him All women hate cowards I ll post him yes and cowhide him in the bargain if necessary
4948-28015-0007	train-other-500	Posting will do half sarcastically replied his friend But upon what pretext will you challenge him I ll make one I ll insult him the first time I meet him and then if he says any thing challenge and shoot him
4948-28015-0008	train-other-500	That would be quite gentlemanly quite according to the code of honour returned the friend quietly The young military gentleman we have introduced was named Redmond The reader has already penetrated his character
4948-28015-0009	train-other-500	In person he was quite good looking though not the Adonis he deemed himself He had fallen deeply in love with the acres of charms possessed by a certain Miss Clinton and was making rapid inroad upon her heart at least he thought so
4948-28015-0010	train-other-500	when a young man well known in the literary circles made his appearance and was received with a degree of favour that confounded the officer who had already begun to think himself sure of the prize
4948-28015-0011	train-other-500	Blake had a much readier tongue and a great deal more in his head than the other and could therefore in the matter of mind at least appear to much better advantage than his rival
4948-28015-0012	train-other-500	He had also written and published one or two popular works this gave him a standing as an author Take him all in all he was a rival to be feared and Redmond was not long in making the discovery What was to be done
4948-28015-0013	train-other-500	A military man must not be put down or beaten off by a mere civilian The rival must be gotten rid of in some manner the professional means was as has been seen thought of first
4948-28015-0014	train-other-500	Blake must be challenged and killed off and then the course would be clear A few days after this brave and honourable determination the officer met the author in a public place and purposely jostled him rudely
4948-28015-0015	train-other-500	Blake said nothing thinking it possible that it was an accident but he remained near Redmond to give him a chance to repeat the insult if such had been his intention
4948-28015-0016	train-other-500	It was not long before the author was again jostled in a still ruder manner than before at the same time some offensive word was muttered by the officer This was in the presence of a number of respectable persons
4948-28015-0017	train-other-500	who could not help hearing seeing and understanding all Satisfied that an insult was intended Blake looked him in the face for a moment and then asked loud enough to be heard all around Did you intend to jostle me
none	none	 I did was the angry retort Gentlemen never do such things As Blake said this with marked emphasis he looked steadily into the officer s face You ll hear from me sir 
4948-28015-0018	train-other-500	And as the officer said this menacingly he turned and walked away with a military air There s trouble for you now Blake he ll challenge you said two or three friends who instantly gathered around him Do you think so
4948-28015-0019	train-other-500	Certainly he is an officer fighting is his trade Well let him What ll you do Accept the challenge of course And fight Certainly He ll shoot you I m not afraid
4948-28015-0020	train-other-500	Blake returned with his friend to his lodgings where he found a billet already from Redmond who was all eagerness to wing his rival
4948-28015-0021	train-other-500	On the next morning two friends of the bellige rents were closeted for the purpose of arranging the preliminaries for the fight The weapon asked the friend of the military man Your principal by the laws of honour has the choice
none	none	 as also to name time and place c Yes I understand All is settled 
4948-28015-0022	train-other-500	He will fight then Fight Oh certainly Blake is no coward Well then name the weapons A pair of goose quills Sir in profound astonishment
4948-28015-0023	train-other-500	The weapons are to be a pair of good Russia quills opaque manufactured into pens of approved quality
none	none	 The place of meeting the mdash Gazette the time 
4948-28015-0024	train-other-500	to morrow morning bright and early Do you mean to insult me By no means You cannot be serious Never was more serious in my life By the code of honour the challenged party has the right to choose weapons
4948-28015-0025	train-other-500	place of meeting and time Is it not so Certainly Very well Your principal has challenged mine All these rights are of course his and he is justified in choosing those weapons with which he is most familiar
4948-28015-0026	train-other-500	The weapon he can use best is the pen and he chooses that
none	none	 If Lieut Redmond had been the challenged party 
4948-28015-0027	train-other-500	he would of course have named pistols with which he is familiar and mister Blake would have been called a coward poltroon or something as bad if after sending a challenge he had objected to the weapons
4948-28015-0028	train-other-500	Will your principal find himself in a different position if he decline this meeting on like grounds I think not Pens are as good as pistols at any time and will do as much Fighting with pens Preposterous
4948-28015-0029	train-other-500	Not quite so preposterous as you may think mister B has more than insinuated that mister Redmond is no gentleman For this he is challenged to a single combat that is to prove him to be a gentleman or not one
4948-28015-0030	train-other-500	Surely the most sensible weapon with which to do this is the pen Pistols won t demonstrate the matter only the pen can do it so the pen is chosen In the Gazette of to morrow morning my friend stands ready to prove that he is a gentleman and your friend
4948-28015-0031	train-other-500	that he is one and that a gentleman has a right to insult publicly and without provocation whomsoever he pleases Depend upon it you will find this quite as serious an affair as if pistols were used I did not come here sir to be trifled with
4948-28015-0032	train-other-500	No trifling in the matter at all I am in sober earnest Pens are the weapons the Gazette the battle ground time early as you please to morrow morning Are you prepared for the meeting No
none	none	 Do you understand the consequences 
4948-28015-0033	train-other-500	What consequences Your principal will be posted as a coward before night Are you mad No cool and earnest We fully understand what we are about
4948-28015-0034	train-other-500	The officer s second was nonplussed he did not know what to say or think He was unprepared for such a position of affairs I ll see you in the course of an hour he at length said rising
4948-28015-0035	train-other-500	Very well you will find me here Is all settled asked the valiant lieutenant as his second came into his room at the hotel where he was pacing the floor
none	none	 Settled No nor likely to be I objected to the weapons and indeed the whole proposed arrangement Objected to the weapons And pray what did he name A blunderbuss 
4948-28015-0036	train-other-500	No nor a duck gun with trumpet muzzle but an infernal pen A what
none	none	 Why curse the fellow a pen You are to use pens 
4948-28015-0037	train-other-500	the place of meeting the Gazette time to morrow morning He is to prove you are no gentleman and you are to prove you are one and that a gentleman is at all times privileged to insult whomsoever he pleases without provocation He s a cowardly fool
none	none	 If his terms are not accepted he threatens to post you for a coward before night What You must accept or be posted Think of that 
4948-28015-0038	train-other-500	The precise terms in which the principal swore and the manner in which he fumed for the next five minutes need not be told He was called back to more sober feelings by the question Do you accept the terms of the meeting
4948-28015-0039	train-other-500	No of course not the fellow s a fool Then you consent to be posted How will that sound I ll cut off the rascal s ears if he dare do such a thing That won t secure Mary Clinton the cause of this contest Hang it no
4948-28015-0040	train-other-500	With pens for weapons he will wing you a little too quick No doubt But the public won t bear him out such an outrage such a violation of all the rules of honour
none	none	 By the code of honour the challenged party has the right to choose the weapons c 
4948-28015-0041	train-other-500	I know And you are afraid to meet the man you have challenged upon the terms he proposes That is all plain and simple enough The world will understand it all But what is to be done
4948-28015-0042	train-other-500	You must fight apologize or be posted there is no alternative To be posted won t do the laugh would be too strongly against you It will be as bad and even worse to fight as he proposes True
4948-28015-0043	train-other-500	What then It must be made up somehow or other So I think Will you write an apology
none	none	 I don t know that s too humiliating It s the least of the three evils So at last thought the valiant Lieut Redmond 
4948-28015-0044	train-other-500	When the seconds again met it was to arrange a settlement of differences This could only be done by a very humbly written apology which was made On the next day the young officer left the city a little wiser than he came
4948-28015-0045	train-other-500	Blake and his second said but little about the matter A few choice friends were let into the secret which afforded many a hearty laugh Among these friends was Mary Clinton who not long after gave her heart and hand to the redoubtable author
4948-28015-0046	train-other-500	As for the lieutenant he declares that he had as lief come in contact with a Paixhan gun as an author with his infernal pen
none	none	 He understands pistols small swords rifles and even cannons but he can t stand up when pen work is the order of the day The odds would be too much against him 
4948-28016-0000	train-other-500	TREATING A CASE ACTIVELY A PHYSICIAN S STORY
none	none	 I WAS once sent for in great haste 
4948-28016-0001	train-other-500	to attend a gentleman of respectability whose wife a lady of intelligence and refinement had discovered him in his room lying senseless upon the floor On arriving at the house I found missus H in great distress of mind
4948-28016-0002	train-other-500	What is the matter with mister H I asked on meeting his lady who was in tears and looking the picture of distress I m afraid it is apoplexy she replied
4948-28016-0003	train-other-500	I found him lying upon the floor where he had to all appearance fallen suddenly from his chair His face is purple and though he breathes it is with great difficulty I went up to see my patient
4948-28016-0004	train-other-500	He had been lifted from the floor and was now lying upon the bed Sure enough his face was purple and his breathing laboured but somehow the symptoms did not indicate apoplexy
none	none	 Every vein in his head and face was turgid and he lay perfectly stupid but still I saw no clear indications of an actual or approaching congestion of the brain 
4948-28016-0005	train-other-500	Hadn t he better be bled doctor asked the anxious wife I don t know that it is necessary I replied I think if we let him alone it will pass off in the course of a few hours A few hours
4948-28016-0006	train-other-500	He may die in half an hour I don t think the case is so dangerous madam Apoplexy not dangerous I hardly think it apoplexy I replied Pray what do you think it is doctor
4948-28016-0007	train-other-500	missus H looked anxiously into my face I delicately hinted that he might possibly have been drinking too much brandy but to this she positively and almost indignantly objected
none	none	 No doctor I ought to know about that she said 
4948-28016-0008	train-other-500	Depend upon it the disease is more deeply seated I am sure he had better be bled Won t you bleed him doctor A few ounces of blood taken from his arm may give life to the now stagnant circulation of the blood in his veins
4948-28016-0009	train-other-500	Thus urged I after some reflection ordered a bowl and bandage and opening a vein from which the blood flowed freely relieved him of about eight ounces of his circulating medium
4948-28016-0010	train-other-500	But he still lay as insensible as before much to the distress of his poor wife Something else must be done doctor she urged seeing that bleeding had accomplished nothing
4948-28016-0011	train-other-500	If my husband is not quickly relieved he must die By this time several friends and relatives who had been sent for arrived and urged upon me the adoption of some more active means for restoring the sick man to consciousness
4948-28016-0012	train-other-500	One proposed mustard plasters all over his body another a blister on the head another his immersion in hot water I suggested that it might be well to use a stomach pump
none	none	 Why doctor asked one of the friends 
4948-28016-0013	train-other-500	Perhaps he has taken some drug I replied Impossible doctor said the wife He has not been from home to day and there is no drug of any kind in the house No brandy I ventured this suggestion again
none	none	 No doctor no spirits of any kind nor even wine in the house returned missus H 
4948-28016-0014	train-other-500	in an offended tone I was not the regular family physician and had been called in to meet the alarming emergency because my office happened to be nearest to the dwelling of mister H
4948-28016-0015	train-other-500	Feeling my position to be a difficult one I suggested that the family physician had better be called But the delay doctor urged the friends No harm will result from it be assured I replied
4948-28016-0016	train-other-500	But my words did not assure them However as I was firm in my resolution not to do any thing more for the patient until doctor S came they had to submit
4948-28016-0017	train-other-500	I wished to make a call of importance in the neighbourhood and proposed going to be back by the time doctor S arrived but the friends of the sick man would not suffer me to leave the room When doctor S came
4948-28016-0018	train-other-500	we conversed aside for a few minutes and I gave him my views of the case and stated what I had done and why I had done it We then proceeded to the bedside of our patient there were still no signs of approaching consciousness
4948-28016-0019	train-other-500	Don t you think his head ought to be shaved and blistered asked the wife anxiously doctor S thought a moment and then said Yes by all means Send for a barber
4948-28016-0020	train-other-500	and also for a fresh fly blister four inches by nine I looked into the face of doctor S with surprise it was perfectly grave and earnest I hinted to him my doubt of the good that mode of treatment would do
4948-28016-0021	train-other-500	but he spoke confidently of the result and said that it would not only cure the disease but he believed
none	none	 take away the predisposition thereto with which mister H 
4948-28016-0022	train-other-500	was affected in a high degree The barber came The head of H was shaved and doctor S applied the blister with his own hands which completely covered the scalp from forehead to occiput
4948-28016-0023	train-other-500	Let it remain on for two hours and then make use of the ordinary dressing said doctor S If he should not recover during the action of the blister don t feel uneasy sensibility will be restored soon after
4948-28016-0024	train-other-500	I did not call again but I heard from doctor S the result After we left the friends stood anxiously around the bed upon which the sick man lay
4948-28016-0025	train-other-500	but though the blister began to draw no signs of returning consciousness showed themselves further than an occasional low moan or an uneasy tossing of the arms
none	none	 For full two hours the burning plaster parched the tender skin of H s shorn head 
4948-28016-0026	train-other-500	and was then removed it had done good service Dressings were then applied repeated and repeated again but still the sick man lay in a deep stupor It has done no good
4948-28016-0027	train-other-500	hadn t we better send for the doctor suggested the wife Just then the eyes of H opened and he looked with half stupid surprise from face to face of the anxious group that surrounded the bed
none	none	 What in the mischief s the matter he at length said At the same time feeling a strange sensation about his head 
4948-28016-0028	train-other-500	he placed his hand rather heavily thereon
none	none	 Heavens and earth He was now fully in his senses 
4948-28016-0029	train-other-500	Heavens and earth what ails my head For mercy s sake keep quiet said the wife the glad tears gushing over her face You have been very ill there there now And she spoke soothingly Don t say a word but lie very still
4948-28016-0030	train-other-500	But my head What s the matter with my head It feels as if scalded Where s my hair Heavens and earth Sarah I don t understand this And my arm What s my arm tied up in this way for
4948-28016-0031	train-other-500	Be quiet my dear husband and I ll explain it all Oh be very quiet your life depends upon it mister H sank back upon the pillow from which he had arisen and closed his eyes to think
4948-28016-0032	train-other-500	He put his hand to his head and felt it tenderly all over from temple to temple and from nape to forehead Is it a blister he at length asked
4948-28016-0033	train-other-500	Yes dear You have been very ill we feared for your life said missus H affectionately there have been two physicians in attendance H closed his eyes again his lips moved
4948-28016-0034	train-other-500	Those nearest were not much edified by the whispered words that issued therefrom They would have sounded very strangely in a church or to ears polite and refined After this he lay for some time quiet
4948-28016-0035	train-other-500	Threatened with apoplexy I suppose he then said interrogatively Yes dear replied his wife
4948-28016-0036	train-other-500	I found you lying insensible upon the floor on happening to come into your room It was most providential that I discovered you when I did or you would certainly have died H shut his eyes and muttered something with an air of impatience
4948-28016-0037	train-other-500	but its meaning was not understood Finding him out of danger friends and relatives retired and the sick man was left alone with his family
none	none	 Sarah he said why in the name of goodness did you permit the doctors to butcher me in 
4948-28016-0038	train-other-500	this way I m laid up for a week or two and all for nothing It was to save your life dear Save the
none	none	 H u s h There 
4948-28016-0039	train-other-500	do for mercy s sake be quiet every thing depends upon it With a gesture of impatience H shut his eyes teeth and hands and lay perfectly still for some minutes
4948-28016-0040	train-other-500	Then he turned his face to the wall muttering in a low petulant voice Too bad too
none	none	 bad too bad I had not erred in my first and my last impressions of H s disease 
4948-28016-0041	train-other-500	neither had doctor S although he used a very extraordinary mode of treatment The facts of the case were these H had a weakness he could not taste wine nor strong drink
4948-28016-0042	train-other-500	without being tempted into excess Both himself and friends were mortified and grieved at this and they by admonition and he by good resolutions tried to bring about a reform
4948-28016-0043	train-other-500	but to see was to taste to taste was to fall At last his friends urged him to shut himself up at home for a certain time and see if total abstinence would not give him strength
4948-28016-0044	train-other-500	He got on pretty well for a few days particularly so as his coachman kept a well filled bottle for him in the carriage house to which he not unfrequently resorted
4948-28016-0045	train-other-500	but a too ardent devotion to this bottle brought on the supposed apoplexy doctor S was right in his mode of treating the disease after all and did not err in supposing that it would reach the predisposition
