the quaestor business of state afterwards to the temple of Isis Vale An ostentatious bustling ill bred fellow muttered Clodius to himself as he sauntered slowly away He thinks with his feasts and his wine cellars to make us forget that he is the son of a freedman and so we will when we do him the honour of winning his money these rich plebeians are a harvest for us spendthrift nobles Thus soliloquising Clodius arrived in the Via Domitiana which was crowded with passengers and chariots and exhibited all that gay and animated exuberance of life and motion which we find at this day in the streets of Naples The bells of the cars as they rapidly glided by each other jingled merrily on the ear and Clodius with smiles or nods claimed familiar acquaintance with whatever equipage was most elegant or fantastic in fact no idler was better known in Pompeii What Clodius and how have you slept on your good fortune cried in a pleasant and musical voice a young man in a chariot of the most fastidious and graceful fashion Upon its surface of bronze were elaborately wrought in the still exquisite workmanship of Greece reliefs of the Olympian games the two horses that drew the car were of the rarest breed of Parthia their slender limbs seemed to disdain the ground and court the air and yet at the slightest touch of the charioteer who stood behind the young owner of the equipage they paused motionless as if suddenly transformed into stone lifeless but lifelike as one of the breathing wonders of Praxiteles The owner himself was of that slender and beautiful symmetry from which the sculptors of Athens drew their models his Grecian origin betrayed itself in his light but clustering locks and the perfect harmony of his features He wore no toga which in the time of the emperors had indeed ceased to be the general distinction of the Romans and was especially ridiculed by the pretenders to fashion but his tunic glowed in the richest hues of the Tyrian dye and the fibulae or buckles by which it was fastened sparkled with emeralds around his neck was a chain of gold which in the middle of his breast twisted itself into the form of a serpent s head from the mouth of which hung pendent a large signet ring of elaborate and most exquisite workmanship the sleeves of the tunic were loose and fringed at the hand with gold and across the waist a girdle wrought in arabesque designs and of the same material as the fringe served in lieu of pockets for the receptacle of the handkerchief and the purse the stilus and the tablets My dear Glaucus said Clodius I rejoice to see that your losses have so little affected your mien Why you seem as if you had been inspired by Apollo and your face shines with happiness like a glory any one might take you for the winner and me for the loser And what is there in the loss or gain of those dull pieces of metal that should change our spirit my Clodius By Venus while yet young we can cover our full locks with chaplets while yet the cithara sounds on unsated ears while yet the smile of Lydia or of Chloe flashes over our veins in which the blood runs so swiftly so long shall we find delight in the sunny air and make bald time itself but the treasurer of our joys You sup with me to night you know Who ever forgets the invitation of Glaucus But which way go you now Why I thought of visiting the baths but it wants yet an hour to the usual time Well I will dismiss my chariot and go with you So so my Phylias stroking the horse nearest to him which by a low neigh and with backward ears playfully acknowledged the courtesy a holiday for you to day Is he not handsome Clodius Worthy of Phoebus returned the noble parasite or of Glaucus Chapter II THE BLIND FLOWER GIRL AND THE BEAUTY OF FASHION THE ATHENIAN S CONFESSION THE READER S INTRODUCTION TO ARBACES OF EGYPT TALKING lightly on a thousand matters the two young men sauntered through the streets they were now in that quarter which was filled with the gayest shops their open interiors all and each radiant with the gaudy yet harmonious colors of frescoes inconceivably varied in fancy and design The sparkling fountains that at every vista threw upwards their grateful spray in the summer air the crowd of passengers or rather loiterers mostly clad in robes of the Tyrian dye the gay groups collected round each more attractive shop the slaves passing to and fro with buckets of bronze cast in the most graceful shapes and borne upon their heads the country girls stationed at frequent intervals with baskets of blushing fruit and flowers more alluring to the ancient Italians than to their descendants with whom indeed latet anguis in herba a disease seems lurking in every violet and rose the numerous haunts which fulfilled with that idle people the office of cafes and clubs at this day the shops where on shelves of marble were ranged the vases of wine and oil and before whose thresholds seats protected from the sun by a purple awning invited the weary to rest and the indolent to lounge made a scene of such glowing and vivacious excitement as might well give the Athenian spirit of Glaucus an excuse for its susceptibility to joy Talk to me no more of Rome said he to Clodius Pleasure is too stately and ponderous in those mighty walls even in the precincts of the court even in the Golden House of Nero and the incipient glories of the palace of Titus there is a certain dulness of magnificence the eye aches the spirit is wearied besides my Clodius we are discontented when we compare the enormous luxury and wealth of others with the mediocrity of our own state But here we surrender ourselves easily to pleasure and we have the brilliancy of luxury without the lassitude of its pomp It was from that feeling that you chose your summer retreat at Pompeii It was I prefer it to Baiae I grant the charms of the latter but I love not the pedants who resort there and who seem to weigh out their pleasures by the drachm Yet you are fond of the learned too and as for poetry why your house is literally eloquent with AEschylus and Homer the epic and the drama Yes but those Romans who mimic my Athenian ancestors do everything so heavily Even in the chase they make their slaves carry Plato with them and whenever the boar is lost out they take their books and their papyrus in order not to lose their time too When the dancing girls swim before them in all the blandishment of Persian manners some drone of a freedman with a face of stone reads them a section of Cicero De Officiis Unskilful pharmacists pleasure and study are not elements to be thus mixed together they must be enjoyed separately the Romans lose both by this pragmatical affectation of refinement and prove that they have no souls for either Oh my Clodius how little your countrymen know of the true versatility of a Pericles of the true witcheries of an Aspasia It was but the other day that I paid a visit to Pliny he was sitting in his summer house writing while an unfortunate slave played on the tibia His nephew oh whip me such philosophical coxcombs was reading Thucydides description of the plague and nodding his conceited little head in time to the music while his lips were repeating all the loathsome details of that terrible delineation The puppy saw nothing incongruous in learning at the same time a ditty of love and a description of the plague Why they are much the same thing said Clodius So I told him in excuse for his coxcombry but my youth stared me rebukingly in the face without taking the jest and answered that it was only the insensate ear that the music pleased whereas the book the description of the plague mind you elevated the heart Ah quoth the fat uncle wheezing my boy is quite an Athenian always mixing the utile with the dulce O Minerva how I laughed in my sleeve While I was there they came to tell the boy sophist that his favorite freedman was just dead of a fever Inexorable death cried he get me my Horace How beautifully the sweet poet consoles us for these misfortunes Oh can these men love my Clodius Scarcely even with the senses How rarely a Roman has a heart He is but the mechanism of genius he wants its bones and flesh Though Clodius was secretly a little sore at these remarks on his countrymen he affected to sympathize with his friend partly because he was by nature a parasite and partly because it was the fashion among the dissolute young Romans to affect a little contempt for the very birth which in reality made them so arrogant it was the mode to imitate the Greeks and yet to laugh at their own clumsy imitation Thus conversing their steps were arrested by a crowd gathered round an open space where three streets met and just where the porticoes of a light and graceful temple threw their shade there stood a young girl with a flower basket on her right arm and a small three stringed instrument of music in the left hand to whose low and soft tones she was modulating a wild and half barbaric air At every pause in the music she gracefully waved her flower basket round inviting the loiterers to buy and many a sesterce was showered into the basket either in compliment to the music or in compassion to the songstress for she was blind It is my poor Thessalian said Glaucus stopping I have not seen her since my return to Pompeii Hush her voice is sweet let us listen THE BLIND FLOWER GIRL S SONG I Buy my flowers O buy I pray The blind girl comes from afar If the earth be as fair as I hear them say These flowers her children are Do they her beauty keep They are fresh from her lap I know For I caught them fast asleep In her arms an hour ago With the air which is her breath Her soft and delicate breath Over them murmuring low On their lips her sweet kiss lingers yet And their cheeks with her tender tears are wet For she weeps that gentle mother weeps As morn and night her watch she keeps With a yearning heart and a passionate care To see the young things grow so fair She weeps for love she weeps And the dews are the tears she weeps From the well of a mother s love II Ye have a world of light Where love in the loved rejoices But the blind girl s home is the House of Night And its beings are empty voices As one in the realm below I stand by the streams of woe I hear the vain shadows glide I feel their soft breath at my side And I thirst the loved forms to see And I stretch my fond arms around And I catch but a shapeless sound For the living are ghosts to me Come buy come buy Hark how the sweet things sigh For they have a voice like ours The breath of the blind girl closes The leaves of the saddening roses We are tender we sons of light We shrink from this child of night From the grasp of the blind girl free us We yearn for the eyes that see us We are for night too gay In your eyes we behold the day O buy O buy the flowers I must have yon bunch of violets sweet Nydia said Glaucus pressing through the crowd and dropping a handful of small coins into the basket your voice is more charming than ever The blind girl started forward as she heard the Athenian s voice then as suddenly paused while the blood rushed violently over neck cheek and temples So you are returned said she in a low voice and then repeated half to herself Glaucus is returned Yes child I have not been at Pompeii above a few days My garden wants your care as before you will visit it I trust to morrow And mind no garlands at my house shall be woven by any hands but those of the pretty Nydia Nydia smiled joyously but did not answer and Glaucus placing in his breast the violets he had selected turned gaily and carelessly from the crowd So she is a sort of client of yours this child said Clodius Ay does she not sing prettily She interests me the poor slave Besides she is from the land of the Gods hill Olympus frowned upon her cradle she is of Thessaly The witches country True but for my part I find every woman a witch and at Pompeii by Venus the very air seems to have taken a love philtre so handsome does every face without a beard seem in my eyes And lo one of the handsomest in Pompeii old Diomed s daughter the rich Julia said Clodius as a young lady her face covered by her veil and attended by two female slaves approached them in her way to the baths Fair Julia we salute thee said Clodius Julia partly raised her veil so as with some coquetry to display a bold Roman profile a full dark bright eye and a cheek over whose natural olive art shed a fairer and softer rose And Glaucus too is returned said she glancing meaningly at the Athenian Has he forgotten she added in a half whisper his friends of the last year Beautiful Julia even Lethe itself if it disappear in one part of the earth rises again in another Jupiter does not allow us ever to forget for more than a moment but Venus more harsh still vouchsafes not even a moment s oblivion Glaucus is never at a loss for fair words Who is when the object of them is so fair We shall see you both at my father s villa soon said Julia turning to Clodius We will mark the day in which we visit you with a white stone answered the gamester Julia dropped her veil but slowly so that her last glance rested on the Athenian with affected timidity and real boldness the glance bespoke tenderness and reproach The friends passed on Julia is certainly handsome said Glaucus And last year you would have made that confession in a warmer tone True I was dazzled at the first sight and mistook for a gem that which was but an artful imitation Nay returned Clodius all women are the same at heart Happy he who weds a handsome face and a large dower What more can he desire Glaucus sighed They were now in a street less crowded than the rest at the end of which they beheld that broad and most lovely sea which upon those delicious coasts seems to have renounced its prerogative of terror so soft are the crisping winds that hover around its bosom so glowing and so various are the hues which it takes from the rosy clouds so fragrant are the perfumes which the breezes from the land scatter over its depths From such a sea might you well believe that Aphrodite rose to take the empire of the earth It is still early for the bath said the Greek who was the creature of every poetical impulse let us wander from the crowded city and look upon the sea while the noon yet laughs along its billows With all my heart said Clodius and the bay too is always the most animated part of the city Pompeii was the miniature of the civilization of that age Within the narrow compass of its walls was contained as it were a specimen of every gift which luxury offered to power In its minute but glittering shops its tiny palaces its baths its forum its theatre its circus in the energy yet corruption in the refinement yet the vice of its people you beheld a model of the whole empire It was a toy a plaything a showbox in which the gods seemed pleased to keep the representation of the great monarchy of earth and which they afterwards hid from time to give to the wonder of posterity the moral of the maxim that under the sun there is nothing new Crowded in the glassy bay were the vessels of commerce and the gilded galleys for the pleasures of the rich citizens The boats of the fishermen glided rapidly to and fro and afar off you saw the tall masts of the fleet under the command of Pliny Upon the shore sat a Sicilian who with vehement gestures and flexile features was narrating to a group of fishermen and peasants a strange tale of shipwrecked mariners and friendly dolphins just as at this day in the modern neighborhood you may hear upon the Mole of Naples Drawing his comrade from the crowd the Greek bent his steps towards a solitary part of the beach and the two friends seated on a small crag which rose amidst the smooth pebbles inhaled the voluptuous and cooling breeze which dancing over the waters kept music with its invisible feet There was perhaps something in the scene that invited them to silence and reverie Clodius shading his eyes from the burning sky was calculating the gains of the last week and the Greek leaning upon his hand and shrinking not from that sun his nation s tutelary deity with whose fluent light of poesy and joy and love his own veins were filled gazed upon the broad expanse and envied perhaps every wind that bent its pinions towards the shores of Greece Tell me Clodius said the Greek at last hast thou ever been in love Yes very often He who has loved often answered Glaucus has loved never There is but one Eros though there are many counterfeits of him The counterfeits are not bad little gods upon the whole answered Clodius I agree with you returned the Greek I adore even the shadow of Love but I adore himself yet more Art thou then soberly and honestly in love Hast thou that feeling which the poets describe a feeling that makes us neglect our suppers forswear the theatre and write elegies I should never have thought it You dissemble well I am not far gone enough for that returned Glaucus smiling or rather I say with Tibullus He whom love rules where er his path may be Walks safe and sacred In fact I am not in love but I could be if there were but occasion to see the object Eros would light his torch but the priests have given him no oil Shall I guess the object Is it not Diomed s daughter She adores you and does not affect to conceal it and by Hercules I say again and again she is both handsome and rich She will bind the door posts of her husband with golden fillets No I do not desire to sell myself Diomed s daughter is handsome I grant and at one time had she not been the grandchild of a freedman I might have Yet no she carries all her beauty in her face her manners are not maiden like and her mind knows no culture save that of pleasure You are ungrateful Tell me then who is the fortunate virgin You shall hear my Clodius Several months ago I was sojourning at Neapolis a city utterly to my own heart for it still retains the manners and stamp of its Grecian origin and it yet merits the name of Parthenope from its delicious air and its beautiful shores One day I entered the temple of Minerva to offer up my prayers not for myself more than for the city on which Pallas smiles no longer The temple was empty and deserted The recollections of Athens crowded fast and meltingly upon me imagining myself still alone in the temple and absorbed in the earnestness of my devotion my prayer gushed from my heart to my lips and I wept as I prayed I was startled in the midst of my devotions however by a deep sigh I turned suddenly round and just behind me was a female She had raised her veil also in prayer and when our eyes met methought a celestial ray shot from those dark and smiling orbs at once into my soul Never my Clodius have I seen mortal face more exquisitely molded a certain melancholy softened and yet elevated its expression that unutterable something which springs from the soul and which our sculptors have imparted to the aspect of Psyche gave her beauty I know not what of divine and noble tears were rolling down her eyes I guessed at once that she was also of Athenian lineage and that in my prayer for Athens her heart had responded to mine I spoke to her though with a faltering voice Art thou not too Athenian said I O beautiful virgin At the sound of my voice she blushed and half drew her veil across her face My forefathers ashes said she repose by the waters of Ilissus my birth is of Neapolis but my heart as my lineage is Athenian Let us then said I make our offerings together and as the priest now appeared we stood side by side while we followed the priest in his ceremonial prayer together we touched the knees of the goddess together we laid our olive garlands on the altar I felt a strange emotion of almost sacred tenderness at this companionship We strangers from a far and fallen land stood together and alone in that temple of our country s deity was it not natural that my heart should yearn to my countrywoman for so I might surely call her I felt as if I had known her for years and that simple rite seemed as by a miracle to operate on the sympathies and ties of time Silently we left the temple and I was about to ask her where she dwelt and if I might be permitted to visit her when a youth in whose features there was some kindred resemblance to her own and who stood upon the steps of the fane took her by the hand She turned round and bade me farewell The crowd separated us I saw her no more On reaching my home I found letters which obliged me to set out for Athens for my relations threatened me with litigation concerning my inheritance When that suit was happily over I repaired once more to Neapolis I instituted inquiries throughout the whole city I could discover no clue of my lost countrywoman and hoping to lose in gaiety all remembrance of that beautiful apparition I hastened to plunge myself amidst the luxuries of Pompeii This is all my history I do not love but I remember and regret As Clodius was about to reply a slow and stately step approached them and at the sound it made amongst the pebbles each turned and each recognized the new comer It was a man who had scarcely reached his fortieth year of tall stature and of a thin but nervous and sinewy frame His skin dark and bronzed betrayed his Eastern origin and his features had something Greek in their outline especially in the chin the lip and the brow save that the nose was somewhat raised and aquiline and the bones hard and visible forbade that fleshy and waving contour which on the Grecian physiognomy preserved even in manhood the round and beautiful curves of youth His eyes large and black as the deepest night shone with no varying and uncertain lustre A deep thoughtful and half melancholy calm seemed unalterably fixed in their majestic and commanding gaze His step and mien were peculiarly sedate and lofty and something foreign in the fashion and the sober hues of his sweeping garments added to the impressive effect of his quiet countenance and stately form Each of the young men in saluting the new comer made mechanically and with care to conceal it from him a slight gesture or sign with their fingers for Arbaces the Egyptian was supposed to possess the fatal gift of the evil eye The scene must indeed be beautiful said Arbaces with a cold though courteous smile which draws the gay Clodius and Glaucus the all admired from the crowded thoroughfares of the city Is Nature ordinarily so unattractive asked the Greek To the dissipated yes An austere reply but scarcely a wise one Pleasure delights in contrasts it is from dissipation that we learn to enjoy solitude and from solitude dissipation So think the young philosophers of the Garden replied the Egyptian they mistake lassitude for meditation and imagine that because they are sated with others they know the delight of loneliness But not in such jaded bosoms can Nature awaken that enthusiasm which alone draws from her chaste reserve all her unspeakable beauty she demands from you not the exhaustion of passion but all that fervor from which you only seek in adoring her a release When young Athenian the moon revealed herself in visions of light to Endymion it was after a day passed not amongst the feverish haunts of men but on the still mountains and in the solitary valleys of the hunter Beautiful simile cried Glaucus most unjust application Exhaustion that word is for age not youth By me at least one moment of satiety has never been known Again the Egyptian smiled but his smile was cold and blighting and even the unimaginative Clodius froze beneath its light He did not however reply to the passionate exclamation of Glaucus but after a pause he said in a soft and melancholy voice After all you do right to enjoy the hour while it smiles for you the rose soon withers the perfume soon exhales And we O Glaucus strangers in the land and far from our fathers ashes what is there left for us but pleasure or regret for you the first perhaps for me the last The bright eyes of the Greek were suddenly suffused with tears Ah speak not Arbaces he cried speak not of our ancestors Let us forget that there were ever other liberties than those of Rome And Glory oh vainly would we call her ghost from the fields of Marathon and Thermopylae Thy heart rebukes thee while thou speakest said the Egyptian and in thy gaieties this night thou wilt be more mindful of Leoena than of Lais Vale Thus saying he gathered his robe around him and slowly swept away I breathe more freely said Clodius Imitating the Egyptians we sometimes introduce a skeleton at our feasts In truth the presence of such an Egyptian as yon gliding shadow were spectre enough to sour the richest grape of the Falernian Strange man said Glaucus musingly yet dead though he seem to pleasure and cold to the objects of the world scandal belies him or his house and his heart could tell a different tale Ah there are whispers of other orgies than those of Osiris in his gloomy mansion He is rich too they say Can we not get him amongst us and teach him the charms of dice Pleasure of pleasures hot fever of hope and fear inexpressible unjaded passion how fiercely beautiful thou art O Gaming Inspired inspired cried Glaucus laughing the oracle speaks poetry in Clodius What miracle next Chapter III PARENTAGE OF GLAUCUS DESCRIPTION OF THE HOUSES OF POMPEII CLASSIC REVEL HEAVEN had given to Glaucus every blessing but one it had given him beauty health fortune genius illustrious descent a heart of fire a mind of poetry but it had denied him the heritage of freedom He was born in Athens the subject of Rome Succeeding early to an ample inheritance he had indulged that inclination for travel so natural to the young and had drunk deep of the intoxicating draught of pleasure amidst the gorgeous luxuries of the imperial court He was an Alcibiades without ambition He was what a man of imagination youth fortune and talents readily becomes when you deprive him of the inspiration of glory His house at Rome was the theme of the debauchees but also of the lovers of art and the sculptors of Greece delighted to task their skill in adorning the porticoes and exedrae of an Athenian His retreat in Pompeii alas the colors are faded now the walls stripped of their paintings its main beauty its elaborate finish of grace and ornament is gone yet when first given once more to the day what eulogies what wonder did its minute and glowing decorations create its paintings its mosaics Passionately enamoured of poetry and the drama which recalled to Glaucus the wit and the heroism of his race that fairy mansion was adorned with representations of AEschylus and Homer And antiquaries who resolve taste to a trade have turned the patron to the professor and still though the error is now acknowledged they style in custom as they first named in mistake the disburied house of the Athenian Glaucus THE HOUSE OF THE DRAMATIC POET Previous to our description of this house it may be as well to convey to the reader a general notion of the houses of Pompeii which he will find to resemble strongly the plans of Vitruvius but with all those differences in detail of caprice and taste which being natural to mankind have always puzzled antiquaries We shall endeavor to make this description as clear and unpedantic as possible You enter then usually by a small entrance passage called cestibulum into a hall sometimes with but more frequently without the ornament of columns around three sides of this hall are doors communicating with several bedchambers among which is the porter s the best of these being usually appropriated to country visitors At the extremity of the hall on either side to the right and left if the house is large there are two small recesses rather than chambers generally devoted to the ladies of the mansion and in the centre of the tessellated pavement of the hall is invariably a square shallow reservoir for rain water classically termed impluvium which was admitted by an aperture in the roof above the said aperture being covered at will by an awning Near this impluvium which had a peculiar sanctity in the eyes of the ancients were sometimes but at Pompeii more rarely than at Rome placed images of the household gods the hospitable hearth often mentioned by the Roman poets and consecrated to the Lares was at Pompeii almost invariably formed by a movable brazier while in some corner often the most ostentatious place was deposited a huge wooden chest ornamented and strengthened by bands of bronze or iron and secured by strong hooks upon a stone pedestal so firmly as to defy the attempts of any robber to detach it from its position It is supposed that this chest was the money box or coffer of the master of the house though as no money has been found in any of the chests discovered at Pompeii it is probable that it was sometimes rather designed for ornament than use In this hall or atrium to speak classically the clients and visitors of inferior rank were usually received In the houses of the more respectable an atriensis or slave peculiarly devoted to the service of the hall was invariably retained and his rank among his fellow slaves was high and important The reservoir in the centre must have been rather a dangerous ornament but the centre of the hall was like the grass plot of a college and interdicted to the passers to and fro who found ample space in the margin Right opposite the entrance at the other end of the hall was an apartment tablinum in which the pavement was usually adorned with rich mosaics and the walls covered with elaborate paintings Here were usually kept the records of the family or those of any public office that had been filled by the owner on one side of this saloon if we may so call it was often a dining room or triclinium on the other side perhaps what we should now term a cabinet of gems containing whatever curiosities were deemed most rare and costly and invariably a small passage for the slaves to cross to the further parts of the house without passing the apartments thus mentioned These rooms all opened on a square or oblong colonnade technically termed peristyle If the house was small its boundary ceased with this colonnade and in that case its centre however diminutive was ordinarily appropriated to the purpose of a garden and adorned with vases of flowers placed upon pedestals while under the colonnade to the right and left were doors admitting to bedrooms to a second triclinium or eating room for the ancients generally appropriated two rooms at least to that purpose one for summer and one for winter or perhaps one for ordinary the other for festive occasions and if the owner affected letters a cabinet dignified by the name of library for a very small room was sufficient to contain the few rolls of papyrus which the ancients deemed a notable collection of books At the end of the peristyle was generally the kitchen Supposing the house was large it did not end with the peristyle and the centre thereof was not in that case a garden but might be perhaps adorned with a fountain or basin for fish and at its end exactly opposite to the tablinum was generally another eating room on either side of which were bedrooms and perhaps a picture saloon or pinacotheca These apartments communicated again with a square or oblong space usually adorned on three sides with a colonnade like the peristyle and very much resembling the peristyle only usually longer This was the proper viridarium or garden being commonly adorned with a fountain or statues and a profusion of gay flowers at its extreme end was the gardener s house on either side beneath the colonnade were sometimes if the size of the family required it additional rooms At Pompeii a second or third story was rarely of importance being built only above a small part of the house and containing rooms for the slaves differing in this respect from the more magnificent edifices of Rome which generally contained the principal eating room or caenaculum on the second floor The apartments themselves were ordinarily of small size for in those delightful climes they received any extraordinary number of visitors in the peristyle or portico the hall or the garden and even their banquet rooms however elaborately adorned and carefully selected in point of aspect were of diminutive proportions for the intellectual ancients being fond of society not of crowds rarely feasted more than nine at a time so that large dinner rooms were not so necessary with them as with us But the suite of rooms seen at once from the entrance must have had a very imposing effect you beheld at once the hall richly paved and painted the tablinum the graceful peristyle and if the house extended farther the opposite banquet room and the garden which closed the view with some gushing fount or marble statue The reader will now have a tolerable notion of the Pompeian houses which resembled in some respects the Grecian but mostly the Roman fashion of domestic architecture In almost every house there is some difference in detail from the rest but the principal outline is the same in all In all you find the hall the tablinum and the peristyle communicating with each other in all you find the walls richly painted and all the evidence of a people fond of the refining elegancies of life The purity of the taste of the Pompeians in decoration is however questionable they were fond of the gaudiest colors of fantastic designs they often painted the lower half of their columns a bright red leaving the rest uncolored and where the garden was small its wall was frequently tinted to deceive the eye as to its extent imitating trees birds temples et cetera in perspective a meretricious delusion which the graceful pedantry of Pliny himself adopted with a complacent pride in its ingenuity But the house of Glaucus was at once one of the smallest and yet one of the most adorned and finished of all the private mansions of Pompeii it would be a model at this day for the house of a single man in Mayfair the envy and despair of the coelibian purchasers of buhl and marquetry You enter by a long and narrow vestibule on the floor of which is the image of a dog in mosaic with the well known Cave canem or Beware the dog On either side is a chamber of some size for the interior part of the house not being large enough to contain the two great divisions of private and public apartments these two rooms were set apart for the reception of visitors who neither by rank nor familiarity were entitled to admission in the penetralia of the mansion Advancing up the vestibule you enter an atrium that when first discovered was rich in paintings which in point of expression would scarcely disgrace a Rafaele You may see them now transplanted to the Neapolitan Museum they are still the admiration of connoisseurs they depict the parting of Achilles and Briseis Who does not acknowledge the force the vigour the beauty employed in delineating the forms and faces of Achilles and the immortal slave On one side the atrium a small staircase admitted to the apartments for the slaves on the second floor there also were two or three small bedrooms the walls of which portrayed the rape of Europa the battle of the Amazons et cetera You now enter the tablinum across which at either end hung rich draperies of Tyrian purple half withdrawn On the walls was depicted a poet reading his verses to his friends and in the pavement was inserted a small and most exquisite mosaic typical of the instructions given by the director of the stage to his comedians You passed through this saloon and entered the peristyle and here as I have said before was usually the case with the smaller houses of Pompeii the mansion ended From each of the seven columns that adorned this court hung festoons of garlands the centre supplying the place of a garden bloomed with the rarest flowers placed in vases of white marble that were supported on pedestals At the left hand of this small garden was a diminutive fane resembling one of those small chapels placed at the side of roads in Catholic countries and dedicated to the Penates before it stood a bronzed tripod to the left of the colonnade were two small cubicula or bedrooms to the right was the triclinium in which the guests were now assembled This room is usually termed by the antiquaries of Naples The Chamber of Leda and in the beautiful work of Sir William Gell the reader will find an engraving from that most delicate and graceful painting of Leda presenting her newborn to her husband from which the room derives its name This charming apartment opened upon the fragrant garden Round the table of citrean wood highly polished and delicately wrought with silver arabesques were placed the three couches which were yet more common at Pompeii than the semicircular seat that had grown lately into fashion at Rome and on these couches of bronze studded with richer metals were laid thick quiltings covered with elaborate broidery and yielding luxuriously to the pressure Well I must own said the aedile Pansa that your house though scarcely larger than a case for one s fibulae is a gem of its kind How beautifully painted is that parting of Achilles and Briseis what a style what heads what a hem Praise from Pansa is indeed valuable on such subjects said Clodius gravely Why the paintings on his walls Ah there is indeed the hand of a Zeuxis You flatter me my Clodius indeed you do quoth the aedile who was celebrated through Pompeii for having the worst paintings in the world for he was patriotic and patronized none but Pompeians You flatter me but there is something pretty AEdepol yes in the colors to say nothing of the design and then for the kitchen my friends ah that was all my fancy What is the design said Glaucus I have not yet seen your kitchen though I have often witnessed the excellence of its cheer A cook my Athenian a cook sacrificing the trophies of his skill on the altar of Vesta with a beautiful muraena taken from the life on a spit at a distance there is some invention there At that instant the slaves appeared bearing a tray covered with the first preparative initia of the feast Amidst delicious figs fresh herbs strewed with snow anchovies and eggs were ranged small cups of diluted wine sparingly mixed with honey As these were placed on the table young slaves bore round to each of the five guests for there were no more the silver basin of perfumed water and napkins edged with a purple fringe But the aedile ostentatiously drew forth his own napkin which was not indeed of so fine a linen but in which the fringe was twice as broad and wiped his hands with the parade of a man who felt he was calling for admiration A splendid nappa that of yours said Clodius why the fringe is as broad as a girdle A trifle my Clodius a trifle They tell me this stripe is the latest fashion at Rome but Glaucus attends to these things more than I Be propitious O Bacchus said Glaucus inclining reverentially to a beautiful image of the god placed in the centre of the table at the corners of which stood the Lares and the salt holders The guests followed the prayer and then sprinkling the wine on the table they performed the wonted libation This over the convivialists reclined themselves on the couches and the business of the hour commenced May this cup be my last said the young Sallust as the table cleared of its first stimulants was now loaded with the substantial part of the entertainment and the ministering slave poured forth to him a brimming cyathus May this cup be my last but it is the best wine I have drunk at Pompeii Bring hither the amphora said Glaucus and read its date and its character The slave hastened to inform the party that the scroll fastened to the cork betokened its birth from Chios and its age a ripe fifty years How deliciously the snow has cooled it said Pansa It is just enough It is like the experience of a man who has cooled his pleasures sufficiently to give them a double zest exclaimed Sallust It is like a woman s No added Glaucus it cools but to inflame the more When is our next wild beast fight said Clodius to Pansa It stands fixed for the ninth ide of August answered Pansa on the day after the Vulcanalia we have a most lovely young lion for the occasion Whom shall we get for him to eat asked Clodius Alas there is a great scarcity of criminals You must positively find some innocent or other to condemn to the lion Pansa Indeed I have thought very seriously about it of late replied the aedile gravely It was a most infamous law that which forbade us to send our own slaves to the wild beasts Not to let us do what we like with our own that s what I call an infringement on property itself Not so in the good old days of the Republic sighed Sallust And then this pretended mercy to the slaves is such a disappointment to the poor people How they do love to see a good tough battle between a man and a lion and all this innocent pleasure they may lose if the gods don t send us a good criminal soon from this cursed law What can be worse policy said Clodius sententiously than to interfere with the manly amusements of the people Well thank Jupiter and the Fates we have no Nero at present said Sallust He was indeed a tyrant he shut up our amphitheatre for ten years I wonder it did not create a rebellion said Sallust It very nearly did returned Pansa with his mouth full of wild boar Here the conversation was interrupted for a moment by a flourish of flutes and two slaves entered with a single dish Ah what delicacy hast thou in store for us now my Glaucus cried the young Sallust with sparkling eyes Sallust was only twenty four but he had no pleasure in life like eating perhaps he had exhausted all the others yet had he some talent and an excellent heart as far as it went I know its face by Pollux cried Pansa It is an Ambracian Kid Ho snapping his fingers a usual signal to the slaves we must prepare a new libation in honour to the new comer I had hoped said Glaucus in a melancholy tone to have procured you some oysters from Britain but the winds that were so cruel to Caesar have forbid us the oysters Are they in truth so delicious asked Lepidus loosening to a yet more luxurious ease his ungirdled tunic Why in truth I suspect it is the distance that gives the flavor they want the richness of the Brundusium oyster But at Rome no supper is complete without them The poor Britons There is some good in them after all said Sallust They produce an oyster I wish they would produce us a gladiator said the aedile whose provident mind was musing over the wants of the amphitheatre By Pallas cried Glaucus as his favorite slave crowned his streaming locks with a new chaplet I love these wild spectacles well enough when beast fights beast but when a man one with bones and blood like ours is coldly put on the arena and torn limb from limb the interest is too horrid I sicken I gasp for breath I long to rush and defend him The yells of the populace seem to me more dire than the voices of the Furies chasing Orestes I rejoice that there is so little chance of that bloody exhibition for our next show The aedile shrugged his shoulders The young Sallust who was thought the best natured man in Pompeii stared in surprise The graceful Lepidus who rarely spoke for fear of disturbing his features ejaculated Hercle The parasite Clodius muttered AEdepol and the sixth banqueter who was the umbra of Clodius and whose duty it was to echo his richer friend when he could not praise him the parasite of a parasite muttered also AEdepol Well you Italians are used to these spectacles we Greeks are more merciful Ah shade of Pindar the rapture of a true Grecian game the emulation of man against man the generous strife the half mournful triumph so proud to contend with a noble foe so sad to see him overcome But ye understand me not The kid is excellent said Sallust The slave whose duty it was to carve and who valued himself on his science had just performed that office on the kid to the sound of music his knife keeping time beginning with a low tenor and accomplishing the arduous feat amidst a magnificent diapason Your cook is of course from Sicily said Pansa Yes of Syracuse I will play you for him said Clodius We will have a game between the courses Better that sort of game certainly than a beast fight but I cannot stake my Sicilian you have nothing so precious to stake me in return My Phillida my beautiful dancing girl I never buy women said the Greek carelessly rearranging his chaplet The musicians who were stationed in the portico without had commenced their office with the kid they now directed the melody into a more soft a more gay yet it may be a more intellectual strain and they chanted that song of Horace beginning Persicos odi et cetera so impossible to translate and which they imagined applicable to a feast that effeminate as it seems to us was simple enough for the gorgeous revelry of the time We are witnessing the domestic and not the princely feast the entertainment of a gentleman not an emperor or a senator Ah good old Horace said Sallust compassionately he sang well of feasts and girls but not like our modern poets The immortal Fulvius for instance said Clodius Ah Fulvius the immortal said the umbra And Spuraena and Caius Mutius who wrote three epics in a year could Horace do that or Virgil either said Lepidus Those old poets all fell into the mistake of copying sculpture instead of painting Simplicity and repose that was their notion but we moderns have fire and passion and energy we never sleep we imitate the colors of painting its life and its action Immortal Fulvius By the way said Sallust have you seen the new ode by Spuraena in honour of our Egyptian Isis It is magnificent the true religious fervor Isis seems a favorite divinity at Pompeii said Glaucus Yes said Pansa she is exceedingly in repute just at this moment her statue has been uttering the most remarkable oracles I am not superstitious but I must confess that she has more than once assisted me materially in my magistracy with her advice Her priests are so pious too none of your gay none of your proud ministers of Jupiter and Fortune they walk barefoot eat no meat and pass the greater part of the night in solitary devotion An example to our other priesthoods indeed Jupiter s temple wants reforming sadly said Lepidus who was a great reformer for all but himself They say that Arbaces the Egyptian has imparted some most solemn mysteries to the priests of Isis observed Sallust He boasts his descent from the race of Rameses and declares that in his family the secrets of remotest antiquity are treasured He certainly possesses the gift of the evil eye said Clodius If I ever come upon that Medusa front without the previous charm I am sure to lose a favorite horse or throw the canes nine times running The last would be indeed a miracle said Sallust gravely How mean you Sallust returned the gamester with a flushed brow I mean what you would leave me if I played often with you and that is nothing Clodius answered only by a smile of disdain If Arbaces were not so rich said Pansa with a stately air I should stretch my authority a little and inquire into the truth of the report which calls him an astrologer and a sorcerer Agrippa when aedile of Rome banished all such terrible citizens But a rich man it is the duty of an aedile to protect the rich What think you of this new sect which I am told has even a few proselytes in Pompeii these followers of the Hebrew God Christus Oh mere speculative visionaries said Clodius they have not a single gentleman amongst them their proselytes are poor insignificant ignorant people Who ought however to be crucified for their blasphemy said Pansa with vehemence they deny Venus and Jove Nazarene is but another name for atheist Let me catch them that s all The second course was gone the feasters fell back on their couches there was a pause while they listened to the soft voices of the South and the music of the Arcadian reed Glaucus was the most rapt and the least inclined to break the silence but Clodius began already to think that they wasted time Bene vobis Your health my Glaucus said he quaffing a cup to each letter of the Greek s name with the ease of the practised drinker Will you not be avenged on your ill fortune of yesterday See the dice court us As you will said Glaucus The dice in summer and I an aedile said Pansa magisterially it is against all law Not in your presence grave Pansa returned Clodius rattling the dice in a long box your presence restrains all license it is not the thing but the excess of the thing that hurts What wisdom muttered the umbra Well I will look another way said the aedile Not yet good Pansa let us wait till we have supped said Glaucus Clodius reluctantly yielded concealing his vexation with a yawn He gapes to devour the gold whispered Lepidus to Sallust in a quotation from the Aulularia of Plautus Ah how well I know these polypi who hold all they touch answered Sallust in the same tone and out of the same play The third course consisting of a variety of fruits pistachio nuts sweetmeats tarts and confectionery tortured into a thousand fantastic and airy shapes was now placed upon the table and the ministri or attendants also set there the wine which had hitherto been handed round to the guests in large jugs of glass each bearing upon it the schedule of its age and quality Taste this Lesbian my Pansa said Sallust it is excellent It is not very old said Glaucus but it has been made precocious like ourselves by being put to the fire the wine to the flames of Vulcan we to those of his wife to whose honour I pour this cup It is delicate said Pansa but there is perhaps the least particle too much of rosin in its flavor What a beautiful cup cried Clodius taking up one of transparent crystal the handles of which were wrought with gems and twisted in the shape of serpents the favorite fashion at Pompeii This ring said Glaucus taking a costly jewel from the first joint of his finger and hanging it on the handle gives it a richer show and renders it less unworthy of thy acceptance my Clodius on whom may the gods bestow health and fortune long and oft to crown it to the brim You are too generous Glaucus said the gamester handing the cup to his slave but your love gives it a double value This cup to the Graces said Pansa and he thrice emptied his calix The guests followed his example We have appointed no director to the feast cried Sallust Let us throw for him then said Clodius rattling the dice box Nay cried Glaucus no cold and trite director for us no dictator of the banquet no rex convivii Have not the Romans sworn never to obey a king Shall we be less free than your ancestors Ho musicians let us have the song I composed the other night it has a verse on this subject The Bacchic hymn of the Hours The musicians struck their instruments to a wild Ionic air while the youngest voice in the band chanted forth in Greek words as numbers the following strain THE EVENING HYMN OF THE HOURS I Through the summer day through the weary day We have glided long Ere we speed to the Night through her portals grey Hail us with song With song with song With a bright and joyous song Such as the Cretan maid While the twilight made her bolder Woke high through the ivy shade When the wine god first consoled her From the hush d low breathing skies Half shut look d their starry eyes And all around With a loving sound The AEgean waves were creeping On her lap lay the lynx s head Wild thyme was her bridal bed And aye through each tiny space In the green vine s green embrace The Fauns were slily peeping The Fauns the prying Fauns The arch the laughing Fauns The Fauns were slily peeping II Flagging and faint are we With our ceaseless flight And dull shall our journey be Through the realm of night Bathe us O bathe our weary wings In the purple wave as it freshly springs To your cups from the fount of light From the fount of light from the fount of light For there when the sun has gone down in night There in the bowl we find him The grape is the well of that summer sun Or rather the stream that he gazed upon Till he left in truth like the Thespian youth His soul as he gazed behind him III A cup to Jove and a cup to Love And a cup to the son of Maia And honour with three the band zone free The band of the bright Aglaia But since every bud in the wreath of pleasure Ye owe to the sister Hours No stinted cups in a formal measure The Bromian law makes ours He honors us most who gives us most And boasts with a Bacchanal s honest boast He never will count the treasure Fastly we fleet then seize our wings And plunge us deep in the sparkling springs And aye as we rise with a dripping plume We ll scatter the spray round the garland s bloom We glow we glow Behold as the girls of the Eastern wave Bore once with a shout to the crystal cave The prize of the Mysian Hylas Even so even so We have caught the young god in our warm embrace We hurry him on in our laughing race We hurry him on with a whoop and song The cloudy rivers of night along Ho ho we have caught thee Psilas The guests applauded loudly When the poet is your host his verses are sure to charm Thoroughly Greek said Lepidus the wildness force and energy of that tongue it is impossible to imitate in the Roman poetry It is indeed a great contrast said Clodius ironically at heart though not in appearance to the old fashioned and tame simplicity of that ode of Horace which we heard before The air is beautifully Ionic the word puts me in mind of a toast Companions I give you the beautiful Ione Ione the name is Greek said Glaucus in a soft voice I drink the health with delight But who is Ione Ah you have but just come to Pompeii or you would deserve ostracism for your ignorance said Lepidus conceitedly not to know Ione is not to know the chief charm of our city She is of the most rare beauty said Pansa and what a voice She can feed only on nightingales tongues said Clodius Nightingales tongues beautiful thought sighed the umbra Enlighten me I beseech you said Glaucus Know then began Lepidus Let me speak cried Clodius you drawl out your words as if you spoke tortoises And you speak stones muttered the coxcomb to himself as he fell back disdainfully on his couch Know then my Glaucus said Clodius that Ione is a stranger who has but lately come to Pompeii She sings like Sappho and her songs are her own composing and as for the tibia and the cithara and the lyre I know not in which she most outdoes the Muses Her beauty is most dazzling Her house is perfect such taste such gems such bronzes She is rich and generous as she is rich Her lovers of course said Glaucus take care that she does not starve and money lightly won is always lavishly spent Her lovers ah there is the enigma Ione has but one vice she is chaste She has all Pompeii at her feet and she has no lovers she will not even marry No lovers echoed Glaucus No she has the soul of Vestal with the girdle of Venus What refined expressions said the umbra A miracle cried Glaucus Can we not see her I will take you there this evening said Clodius

none	none	 added he once more rattling the dice I am yours said the complaisant Glaucus Pansa turn your face Lepidus and Sallust played at odd and even and the umbra looked on while Glaucus and Clodius became gradually absorbed in the chances of the dice By Pollux cried Glaucus this is the second time I have thrown the caniculae the lowest throw Now Venus befriend me said Clodius rattling the box for several moments O Alma Venus it is Venus herself as he threw the highest cast named from that goddess whom he who wins money indeed usually propitiates Venus is ungrateful to me said Glaucus gaily I have always sacrificed on her altar He who plays with Clodius whispered Lepidus will soon like Plautus s Curculio put his pallium for the stakes Poor Glaucus he is as blind as Fortune herself replied Sallust in the same tone I will play no more said Glaucus I have lost thirty sestertia I am sorry began Clodius Amiable man groaned the umbra Not at all exclaimed Glaucus the pleasure I take in your gain compensates the pain of my loss The conversation now grew general and animated the wine circulated more freely and Ione once more became the subject of eulogy to the guests of Glaucus Instead of outwatching the stars let us visit one at whose beauty the stars grow pale said Lepidus Clodius who saw no chance of renewing the dice seconded the proposal and Glaucus though he civilly pressed his guests to continue the banquet could not but let them see that his curiosity had been excited by the praises of Ione they therefore resolved to adjourn all at least but Pansa and the umbra to the house of the fair Greek They drank therefore to the health of Glaucus and of Titus they performed their last libation they resumed their slippers they descended the stairs passed the illumined atrium and walking unbitten over the fierce dog painted on the threshold found themselves beneath the light of the moon just risen in the lively and still crowded streets of Pompeii They passed the jewellers quarter sparkling with lights caught and reflected by the gems displayed in the shops and arrived at last at the door of Ione The vestibule blazed with rows of lamps curtains of embroidered purple hung on either aperture of the tablinum whose walls and mosaic pavement glowed with the richest colors of the artist and under the portico which surrounded the odorous viridarium they found Ione already surrounded by adoring and applauding guests Did you say she was Athenian whispered Glaucus ere he passed into the peristyle No she is from Neapolis Neapolis echoed Glaucus and at that moment the group dividing on either side of Ione gave to his view that bright that nymph like beauty which for months had shone down upon the waters of his memory Chapter IV THE TEMPLE OF ISIS ITS PRIEST THE CHARACTER OF ARBACES DEVELOPS ITSELF THE story returns to the Egyptian We left Arbaces upon the shores of the noonday sea after he had parted from Glaucus and his companion As he approached to the more crowded part of the bay he paused and gazed upon that animated scene with folded arms and a bitter smile upon his dark features Gulls dupes fools that ye are muttered he to himself whether business or pleasure trade or religion be your pursuit you are equally cheated by the passions that ye should rule How I could loathe you if I did not hate yes hate Greek or Roman it is from us from the dark lore of Egypt that ye have stolen the fire that gives you souls Your knowledge your poesy your laws your arts your barbarous mastery of war all how tame and mutilated when compared with the vast original ye have filched as a slave filches the fragments of the feast from us And now ye mimics of a mimic Romans forsooth the mushroom herd of robbers ye are our masters the pyramids look down no more on the race of Rameses the eagle cowers over the serpent of the Nile Our masters no not mine My soul by the power of its wisdom controls and chains you though the fetters are unseen So long as craft can master force so long as religion has a cave from which oracles can dupe mankind the wise hold an empire over earth Even from your vices Arbaces distills his pleasures pleasures unprofaned by vulgar eyes pleasures vast wealthy inexhaustible of which your enervate minds in their unimaginative sensuality cannot conceive or dream Plod on plod on fools of ambition and of avarice your petty thirst for fasces and quaestorships and all the mummery of servile power provokes my laughter and my scorn My power can extend wherever man believes I ride over the souls that the purple veils Thebes may fall Egypt be a name the world itself furnishes the subjects of Arbaces Thus saying the Egyptian moved slowly on and entering the town his tall figure towered above the crowded throng of the forum and swept towards the small but graceful temple consecrated to Isis That edifice was then but of recent erection the ancient temple had been thrown down in the earthquake sixteen years before and the new building had become as much in vogue with the versatile Pompeians as a new church or a new preacher may be with us The oracles of the goddess at Pompeii were indeed remarkable not more for the mysterious language in which they were clothed than for the credit which was attached to their mandates and predictions If they were not dictated by a divinity they were framed at least by a profound knowledge of mankind they applied themselves exactly to the circumstances of individuals and made a notable contrast to the vague and loose generalities of their rival temples As Arbaces now arrived at the rails which separated the profane from the sacred place a crowd composed of all classes but especially of the commercial collected breathless and reverential before the many altars which rose in the open court In the walls of the cella elevated on seven steps of Parian marble various statues stood in niches and those walls were ornamented with the pomegranate consecrated to Isis An oblong pedestal occupied the interior building on which stood two statues one of Isis and its companion represented the silent and mystic Orus But the building contained many other deities to grace the court of the Egyptian deity her kindred and many titled Bacchus and the Cyprian Venus a Grecian disguise for herself rising from her bath and the dog headed Anubis and the ox Apis and various Egyptian idols of uncouth form and unknown appellations But we must not suppose that among the cities of Magna Graecia Isis was worshipped with those forms and ceremonies which were of right her own The mongrel and modern nations of the South with a mingled arrogance and ignorance confounded the worships of all climes and ages And the profound mysteries of the Nile were degraded by a hundred meretricious and frivolous admixtures from the creeds of Cephisus and of Tibur The temple of Isis in Pompeii was served by Roman and Greek priests ignorant alike of the language and the customs of her ancient votaries and the descendant of the dread Egyptian kings beneath the appearance of reverential awe secretly laughed to scorn the puny mummeries which imitated the solemn and typical worship of his burning clime Ranged now on either side the steps was the sacrificial crowd arrayed in white garments while at the summit stood two of the inferior priests the one holding a palm branch the other a slender sheaf of corn In the narrow passage in front thronged the bystanders And what whispered Arbaces to one of the bystanders who was a merchant engaged in the Alexandrian trade which trade had probably first introduced in Pompeii the worship of the Egyptian goddess what occasion now assembles you before the altars of the venerable Isis It seems by the white robes of the group before me that a sacrifice is to be rendered and by the assembly of the priests that ye are prepared for some oracle To what question is it to vouchsafe a reply We are merchants replied the bystander who was no other than Diomed in the same voice who seek to know the fate of our vessels which sail for Alexandria to morrow We are about to offer up a sacrifice and implore an answer from the goddess I am not one of those who have petitioned the priest to sacrifice as you may see by my dress but I have some interest in the success of the fleet by Jupiter yes I have a pretty trade else how could I live in these hard times The Egyptian replied gravely That though Isis was properly the goddess of agriculture she was no less the patron of commerce Then turning his head towards the east Arbaces seemed absorbed in silent prayer And now in the centre of the steps appeared a priest robed in white from head to foot the veil parting over the crown two new priests relieved those hitherto stationed at either corner being naked half way down to the breast and covered for the rest in white and loose robes At the same time seated at the bottom of the steps a priest commenced a solemn air upon a long wind instrument of music Half way down the steps stood another flamen holding in one hand the votive wreath in the other a white wand while adding to the picturesque scene of that eastern ceremony the stately ibis bird sacred to the Egyptian worship looked mutely down from the wall upon the rite or stalked beside the altar at the base of the steps At that altar now stood the sacrificial flamen The countenance of Arbaces seemed to lose all its rigid calm while the aruspices inspected the entrails and to be intent in pious anxiety to rejoice and brighten as the signs were declared favorable and the fire began bright and clearly to consume the sacred portion of the victim amidst odorous of myrrh and frankincense It was then that a dead silence fell over the whispering crowd and the priests gathering round the cella another priest naked save by a cincture round the middle rushed forward and dancing with wild gestures implored an answer from the goddess He ceased at last in exhaustion and a low murmuring noise was heard within the body of the statue thrice the head moved and the lips parted and then a hollow voice uttered these mystic words There are waves like chargers that meet and glow There are graves ready wrought in the rocks below On the brow of the future the dangers lour But blest are your barks in the fearful hour The voice ceased the crowd breathed more freely the merchants looked at each other Nothing can be more plain murmured Diomed there is to be a storm at sea as there very often is at the beginning of autumn but our vessels are to be saved O beneficent Isis Lauded eternally be the goddess said the merchants what can be less equivocal than her prediction Raising one hand in sign of silence to the people for the rites of Isis enjoined what to the lively Pompeians was an impossible suspense from the use of the vocal organs the chief priest poured his libation on the altar and after a short concluding prayer the ceremony was over and the congregation dismissed Still however as the crowd dispersed themselves here and there the Egyptian lingered by the railing and when the space became tolerably cleared one of the priests approaching it saluted him with great appearance of friendly familiarity The countenance of the priest was remarkably unprepossessing his shaven skull was so low and narrow in the front as nearly to approach to the conformation of that of an African savage save only towards the temples where in that organ styled acquisitiveness by the pupils of a science modern in name but best practically known as their sculpture teaches us amongst the ancients two huge and almost preternatural protuberances yet more distorted the unshapely head around the brows the skin was puckered into a web of deep and intricate wrinkles the eyes dark and small rolled in a muddy and yellow orbit the nose short yet coarse was distended at the nostrils like a satyr s and the thick but pallid lips the high cheek bones the livid and motley hues that struggled through the parchment skin completed a countenance which none could behold without repugnance and few without terror and distrust whatever the wishes of the mind the animal frame was well fitted to execute them the wiry muscles of the throat the broad chest the nervous hands and lean gaunt arms which were bared above the elbow betokened a form capable alike of great active exertion and passive endurance Calenus said the Egyptian to this fascinating flamen you have improved the voice of the statue much by attending to my suggestion and your verses are excellent Always prophesy good fortune unless there is an absolute impossibility of its fulfilment Besides added Calenus if the storm does come and if it does overwhelm the accursed ships have we not prophesied it and are the barks not blest to be at rest for rest prays the mariner in the AEgean sea or at least so says Horace can the mariner be more at rest in the sea than when he is at the bottom of it Right my Calenus I wish Apaecides would take a lesson from your wisdom But I desire to confer with you relative to him and to other matters you can admit me into one of your less sacred apartments Assuredly replied the priest leading the way to one of the small chambers which surrounded the open gate Here they seated themselves before a small table spread with dishes containing fruit and eggs and various cold meats with vases of excellent wine of which while the companions partook a curtain drawn across the entrance opening to the court concealed them from view but admonished them by the thinness of the partition to speak low or to speak no secrets they chose the former alternative Thou knowest said Arbaces in a voice that scarcely stirred the air so soft and inward was its sound that it has ever been my maxim to attach myself to the young From their flexile and unformed minds I can carve out my fittest tools I weave I warp I mould them at my will Of the men I make merely followers or servants of the women Mistresses said Calenus as a livid grin distorted his ungainly features Yes I do not disguise it woman is the main object the great appetite of my soul As you feed the victim for the slaughter I love to rear the votaries of my pleasure I love to train to ripen their minds to unfold the sweet blossom of their hidden passions in order to prepare the fruit to my taste I loathe your ready made and ripened courtesans it is in the soft and unconscious progress of innocence to desire that I find the true charm of love it is thus that I defy satiety and by contemplating the freshness of others I sustain the freshness of my own sensations From the young hearts of my victims I draw the ingredients of the caldron in which I re youth myself But enough of this to the subject before us You know then that in Neapolis some time since I encountered Ione and Apaecides brother and sister the children of Athenians who had settled at Neapolis The death of their parents who knew and esteemed me constituted me their guardian I was not unmindful of the trust The youth docile and mild yielded readily to the impression I sought to stamp upon him Next to woman I love the old recollections of my ancestral land I love to keep alive to propagate on distant shores which her colonies perchance yet people her dark and mystic creeds It may be that it pleases me to delude mankind while I thus serve the deities To Apaecides I taught the solemn faith of Isis I unfolded to him something of those sublime allegories which are couched beneath her worship I excited in a soul peculiarly alive to religious fervor that enthusiasm which imagination begets on faith I have placed him amongst you he is one of you He is so said Calenus but in thus stimulating his faith you have robbed him of wisdom He is horror struck that he is no longer duped our sage delusions our speaking statues and secret staircases dismay and revolt him he pines he wastes away he mutters to himself he refuses to share our ceremonies He has been known to frequent the company of men suspected of adherence to that new and atheistical creed which denies all our gods and terms our oracles the inspirations of that malevolent spirit of which eastern tradition speaks Our oracles alas we know well whose inspirations they are This is what I feared said Arbaces musingly from various reproaches he made me when I last saw him Of late he hath shunned my steps I must find him I must continue my lessons I must lead him into the adytum of Wisdom I must teach him that there are two stages of sanctity the first FAITH the next DELUSION the one for the vulgar the second for the sage I never passed through the first I said Calenus nor you either I think my Arbaces You err replied the Egyptian gravely I believe at this day not indeed that which I teach but that which I teach not Nature has a sanctity against which I cannot nor would I steel conviction I believe in mine own knowledge and that has revealed to me but no matter Now to earthlier and more inviting themes If I thus fulfilled my object with Apaecides what was my design for Ione Thou knowest already I intend her for my queen my bride my heart s Isis Never till I saw her knew I all the love of which my nature is capable I hear from a thousand lips that she is a second Helen said Calenus and he smacked his own lips but whether at the wine or at the notion it is not easy to decide Yes she has a beauty that Greece itself never excelled resumed Arbaces But that is not all she has a soul worthy to match with mine She has a genius beyond that of woman keen dazzling bold Poetry flows spontaneous to her lips utter but a truth and however intricate and profound her mind seizes and commands it Her imagination and her reason are not at war with each other they harmonize and direct her course as the winds and the waves direct some lofty bark With this she unites a daring independence of thought she can stand alone in the world she can be brave as she is gentle this is the nature I have sought all my life in woman and never found till now Ione must be mine In her I have a double passion I wish to enjoy a beauty of spirit as of form She is not yours yet then said the priest No she loves me but as a friend she loves me with her mind only She fancies in me the paltry virtues which I have only the profounder virtue to disdain But you must pursue with me her history The brother and sister were young and rich Ione is proud and ambitious proud of her genius the magic of her poetry the charm of her conversation When her brother left me and entered your temple in order to be near him she removed also to Pompeii She has suffered her talents to be known She summons crowds to her feasts her voice enchants them her poetry subdues She delights in being thought the successor of Erinna Or of Sappho But Sappho without love I encouraged her in this boldness of career in this indulgence of vanity and of pleasure I loved to steep her amidst the dissipations and luxury of this abandoned city Mark me Calenus I desired to enervate her mind it has been too pure to receive yet the breath which I wish not to pass but burningly to eat into the mirror I wished her to be surrounded by lovers hollow vain and frivolous lovers that her nature must despise in order to feel the want of love Then in those soft intervals of lassitude that succeed to excitement I can weave my spells excite her interest attract her passions possess myself of her heart For it is not the young nor the beautiful nor the gay that should fascinate Ione her imagination must be won and the life of Arbaces has been one scene of triumph over the imaginations of his kind And hast thou no fear then of thy rivals The gallants of Italy are skilled in the art to please None Her Greek soul despises the barbarian Romans and would scorn itself if it admitted a thought of love for one of that upstart race But thou art an Egyptian not a Greek Egypt replied Arbaces is the mother of Athens Her tutelary Minerva is our deity and her founder Cecrops was the fugitive of Egyptian Sais This have I already taught to her and in my blood she venerates the eldest dynasties of earth But yet I will own that of late some uneasy suspicions have crossed my mind She is more silent than she used to be she loves melancholy and subduing music she sighs without an outward cause This may be the beginning of love it may be the want of love In either case it is time for me to begin my operations on her fancies and her heart in the one case to divert the source of love to me in the other in me to awaken it It is for this that I have sought you And how can I assist you I am about to invite her to a feast in my house I wish to dazzle to bewilder to inflame her senses Our arts the arts by which Egypt trained her young novitiates must be employed and under veil of the mysteries of religion I will open to her the secrets of love Ah now I understand one of those voluptuous banquets that despite our dull vows of mortified coldness we the priests of Isis have shared at thy house No no Thinkest thou her chaste eyes are ripe for such scenes No but first we must ensnare the brother an easier task Listen to me while I give you my instructions Chapter V MORE OF THE FLOWER GIRL THE PROGRESS OF LOVE THE sun shone gaily into that beautiful chamber in the house of Glaucus which I have before said is now called the Room of Leda The morning rays entered through rows of small casements at the higher part of the room and through the door which opened on the garden that answered to the inhabitants of the southern cities the same purpose that a greenhouse or conservatory does to us The size of the garden did not adapt it for exercise but the various and fragrant plants with which it was filled gave a luxury to that indolence so dear to the dwellers in a sunny clime And now the odorous fanned by a gentle wind creeping from the adjacent sea scattered themselves over that chamber whose walls vied with the richest colors of the most glowing flowers Besides the gem of the room the painting of Leda and Tyndarus in the centre of each compartment of the walls were set other pictures of exquisite beauty In one you saw Cupid leaning on the knees of Venus in another Ariadne sleeping on the beach unconscious of the perfidy of Theseus Merrily the sunbeams played to and fro on the tessellated floor and the brilliant walls far more happily came the rays of joy to the heart of the young Glaucus I have seen her then said he as he paced that narrow chamber I have heard her nay I have spoken to her again I have listened to the music of her song and she sung of glory and of Greece I have discovered the long sought idol of my dreams and like the Cyprian sculptor I have breathed life into my own imaginings Longer perhaps had been the enamoured soliloquy of Glaucus but at that moment a shadow darkened the threshold of the chamber and a young female still half a child in years broke upon his solitude She was dressed simply in a white tunic which reached from the neck to the ankles under her arm she bore a basket of flowers and in the other hand she held a bronze water vase her features were more formed than exactly became her years yet they were soft and feminine in their outline and without being beautiful in themselves they were almost made so by their beauty of expression there was something ineffably gentle and you would say patient in her aspect A look of resigned sorrow of tranquil endurance had banished the smile but not the sweetness from her lips something timid and cautious in her step something wandering in her eyes led you to suspect the affliction which she had suffered from her birth she was blind but in the orbs themselves there was no visible defect their melancholy and subdued light was clear cloudless and serene They tell me that Glaucus is here said she may I come in Ah my Nydia said the Greek is that you I knew you would not neglect my invitation Glaucus did but justice to himself answered Nydia with a blush for he has always been kind to the poor blind girl Who could be otherwise said Glaucus tenderly and in the voice of a compassionate brother Nydia sighed and paused before she resumed without replying to his remark You have but lately returned This is the sixth sun that hath shone upon me at Pompeii And you are well Ah I need not ask for who that sees the earth which they tell me is so beautiful can be ill I am well And you Nydia how you have grown Next year you will be thinking what answer to make your lovers A second blush passed over the cheek of Nydia but this time she frowned as she blushed I have brought you some flowers said she without replying to a remark that she seemed to resent and feeling about the room till she found the table that stood by Glaucus she laid the basket upon it they are poor but they are fresh gathered They might come from Flora herself said he kindly and I renew again my vow to the Graces that I will wear no other garlands while thy hands can weave me such as these And how find you the flowers in your viridarium are they thriving Wonderfully so the Lares themselves must have tended them Ah now you give me pleasure for I came as often as I could steal the leisure to water and tend them in your absence How shall I thank thee fair Nydia said the Greek Glaucus little dreamed that he left one memory so watchful over his favorites at Pompeii The hand of the child trembled and her breast heaved beneath her tunic She turned round in embarrassment The sun is hot for the poor flowers said she to day and they will miss me for I have been ill lately and it is nine days since I visited them Ill Nydia yet your cheek has more color than it had last year I am often ailing said the blind girl touchingly and as I grow up I grieve more that I am blind But now to the flowers So saying she made a slight reverence with her head and passing into the viridarium busied herself with watering the flowers Poor Nydia thought Glaucus gazing on her thine is a hard doom Thou seest not the earth nor the sun nor the ocean nor the stars above all thou canst not behold Ione At that last thought his mind flew back to the past evening and was a second time disturbed in its reveries by the entrance of Clodius It was a proof how much a single evening had sufficed to increase and to refine the love of the Athenian for Ione that whereas he had confided to Clodius the secret of his first interview with her and the effect it had produced on him he now felt an invincible aversion even to mention to him her name He had seen Ione bright pure unsullied in the midst of the gayest and most profligate gallants of Pompeii charming rather than awing the boldest into respect and changing the very nature of the most sensual and the least ideal as by her intellectual and refining spells she reversed the fable of Circe and converted the animals into men They who could not understand her soul were made spiritual as it were by the magic of her beauty they who had no heart for poetry had ears at least for the melody of her voice Seeing her thus surrounded purifying and brightening all things with her presence Glaucus almost for the first time felt the nobleness of his own nature he felt how unworthy of the goddess of his dreams had been his companions and his pursuits A veil seemed lifted from his eyes he saw that immeasurable distance between himself and his associates which the deceiving mists of pleasure had hitherto concealed he was refined by a sense of his courage in aspiring to Ione He felt that henceforth it was his destiny to look upward and to soar He could no longer breathe that name which sounded to the sense of his ardent fancy as something sacred and divine to lewd and vulgar ears She was no longer the beautiful girl once seen and passionately remembered she was already the mistress the divinity of his soul This feeling who has not experienced If thou hast not then thou hast never loved When Clodius therefore spoke to him in affected transport of the beauty of Ione Glaucus felt only resentment and disgust that such lips should dare to praise her he answered coldly and the Roman imagined that his passion was cured instead of heightened Clodius scarcely regretted it for he was anxious that Glaucus should marry an heiress yet more richly endowed Julia the daughter of the wealthy Diomed whose gold the gamester imagined he could readily divert into his own coffers Their conversation did not flow with its usual ease and no sooner had Clodius left him than Glaucus bent his way to the house of Ione In passing by the threshold he again encountered Nydia who had finished her graceful task She knew his step on the instant You are early abroad said she Yes for the skies of Campania rebuke the sluggard who neglects them Ah would I could see them murmured the blind girl but so low that Glaucus did not overhear the complaint The Thessalian lingered on the threshold a few moments and then guiding her steps by a long staff which she used with great dexterity she took her way homeward She soon turned from the more gaudy streets and entered a quarter of the town but little loved by the decorous and the sober But from the low and rude evidences of vice around her she was saved by her misfortune And at that hour the streets were quiet and silent nor was her youthful ear shocked by the sounds which too often broke along the obscene and obscure haunts she patiently and sadly traversed She knocked at the back door of a sort of tavern it opened and a rude voice bade her give an account of the sesterces Ere she could reply another voice less vulgarly accented said Never mind those petty profits my Burbo The girl s voice will be wanted again soon at our rich friend s revels and he pays as thou knowest pretty high for his nightingales tongues Oh I hope not I trust not cried Nydia trembling I will beg from sunrise to sunset but send me not there And why asked the same voice Because because I am young and delicately born and the female companions I meet there are not fit associates for one who who Is a slave in the house of Burbo returned the voice ironically and with a coarse laugh The Thessalian put down the flowers and leaning her face on her hands wept silently Meanwhile Glaucus sought the house of the beautiful Neapolitan He found Ione sitting amidst her attendants who were at work around her Her harp stood at her side for Ione herself was unusually idle perhaps unusually thoughtful that day He thought her even more beautiful by the morning light and in her simple robe than amidst the blazing lamps and decorated with the costly jewels of the previous night not the less so from a certain paleness that overspread her transparent hues not the less so from the blush that mounted over them when he approached Accustomed to flatter flattery died upon his lips when he addressed Ione He felt it beneath her to utter the homage which every look conveyed They spoke of Greece this was a theme on which Ione loved rather to listen than to converse it was a theme on which the Greek could have been eloquent for ever He described to her the silver olive groves that yet clad the banks of Ilyssus and the temples already despoiled of half their glories but how beautiful in decay He looked back on the melancholy city of Harmodius the free and Pericles the magnificent from the height of that distant memory which mellowed into one hazy light all the ruder and darker shades He had seen the land of poetry chiefly in the poetical age of early youth and the associations of patriotism were blended with those of the flush and spring of life And Ione listened to him absorbed and mute dearer were those accents and those descriptions than all the prodigal adulation of her numberless adorers Was it a sin to love her countryman she loved Athens in him the gods of her race the land of her dreams spoke to her in his voice From that time they daily saw each other At the cool of the evening they made excursions on the placid sea By night they met again in Ione s porticoes and halls Their love was sudden but it was strong it filled all the sources of their life Heart brain sense imagination all were its ministers and priests As you take some obstacle from two objects that have a mutual attraction they met and united at once their wonder was that they had lived separate so long And it was natural that they should so love Young beautiful and gifted of the same birth and the same soul there was poetry in their very union They imagined the heavens smiled upon their affection As the persecuted seek refuge at the shrine so they recognized in the altar of their love an asylum from the sorrows of earth they covered it with flowers they knew not of the serpents that lay coiled behind One evening the fifth after their first meeting at Pompeii Glaucus and Ione with a small party of chosen friends were returning from an excursion round the bay their vessel skimmed lightly over the twilight waters whose lucid mirror was only broken by the dripping oars As the rest of the party conversed gaily with each other Glaucus lay at the feet of Ione and he would have looked up in her face but he did not dare Ione broke the pause between them My poor brother said she sighing how once he would have enjoyed this hour Your brother said Glaucus I have not seen him Occupied with you I have thought of nothing else or I should have asked if that was not your brother for whose companionship you left me at the Temple of Minerva in Neapolis It was And is he here He is At Pompeii and not constantly with you Impossible He has other duties answered Ione sadly he is a priest of Isis So young too and that priesthood in its laws at least so severe said the warm and bright hearted Greek in surprise and pity What could have been his inducement He was always enthusiastic and fervent in religious devotion and the eloquence of an Egyptian our friend and guardian kindled in him the pious desire to consecrate his life to the most mystic of our deities Perhaps in the intenseness of his zeal he found in the severity of that peculiar priesthood its peculiar attraction And he does not repent his choice I trust he is happy Ione sighed deeply and lowered her veil over her eyes I wish said she after a pause that he had not been so hasty Perhaps like all who expect too much he is revolted too easily Then he is not happy in his new condition And this Egyptian was he a priest himself was he interested in recruits to the sacred band No His main interest was in our happiness He thought he promoted that of my brother We were left orphans Like myself said Glaucus with a deep meaning in his voice Ione cast down her eyes as she resumed And Arbaces sought to supply the place of our parent You must know him He loves genius Arbaces I know him already at least we speak when we meet But for your praise I would not seek to know more of him My heart inclines readily to most of my kind But that dark Egyptian with his gloomy brow and icy smiles seems to me to sadden the very sun One would think that like Epimenides the Cretan he had spent forty years in a cave and had found something unnatural in the daylight ever afterwards Yet like Epimenides he is kind and wise and gentle answered Ione Oh happy that he has thy praise He needs no other virtues to make him dear to me His calm his coldness said Ione evasively pursuing the subject are perhaps but the exhaustion of past sufferings as yonder mountain and she pointed to Vesuvius which we see dark and tranquil in the distance once nursed the fires for ever quenched They both gazed on the mountain as Ione said these words the rest of the sky was bathed in rosy and tender hues but over that grey summit rising amidst the woods and vineyards that then clomb half way up the ascent there hung a black and ominous cloud the single frown of the landscape A sudden and unaccountable gloom came over each as they thus gazed and in that sympathy which love had already taught them and which bade them in the slightest shadows of emotion the faintest presentiment of evil turn for refuge to each other their gaze at the same moment left the mountain and full of unimaginable tenderness met What need had they of words to say they loved Chapter VI THE FOWLER SNARES AGAIN THE BIRD THAT HAD JUST ESCAPED AND SETS HIS NETS FOR A NEW VICTIM IN the history I relate the events are crowded and rapid as those of the drama I write of an epoch in which days sufficed to ripen the ordinary fruits of years Meanwhile Arbaces had not of late much frequented the house of Ione and when he had visited her he had not encountered Glaucus nor knew he as yet of that love which had so suddenly sprung up between himself and his designs In his interest for the brother of Ione he had been forced too a little while to suspend his interest in Ione herself His pride and his selfishness were aroused and alarmed at the sudden change which had come over the spirit of the youth He trembled lest he himself should lose a docile pupil and Isis an enthusiastic servant Apaecides had ceased to seek or to consult him He was rarely to be found he turned sullenly from the Egyptian nay he fled when he perceived him in the distance Arbaces was one of those haughty and powerful spirits accustomed to master others he chafed at the notion that one once his own should ever elude his grasp He swore inly that Apaecides should not escape him It was with this resolution that he passed through a thick grove in the city which lay between his house and that of Ione in his way to the latter and there leaning against a tree and gazing on the ground he came unawares on the young priest of Isis Apaecides said he and he laid his hand affectionately on the young man s shoulder The priest started and his first instinct seemed to be that of flight My son said the Egyptian what has chanced that you desire to shun me Apaecides remained silent and sullen looking down on the earth as his lips quivered and his breast heaved with emotion Speak to me my friend continued the Egyptian Speak Something burdens thy spirit What hast thou to reveal To thee nothing And why is it to me thou art thus unconfidential Because thou hast been my enemy Let us confer said Arbaces in a low voice and drawing the reluctant arm of the priest in his own he led him to one of the seats which were scattered within the grove They sat down and in those gloomy forms there was something congenial to the shade and solitude of the place Apaecides was in the spring of his years yet he seemed to have exhausted even more of life than the Egyptian his delicate and regular features were worn and colorless his eyes were hollow and shone with a brilliant and feverish glare his frame bowed prematurely and in his hands which were small to effeminacy the blue and swollen veins indicated the lassitude and weakness of the relaxed fibres You saw in his face a strong resemblance to Ione but the expression was altogether different from that majestic and spiritual calm which breathed so divine and classical a repose over his sister s beauty In her enthusiasm was visible but it seemed always suppressed and restrained this made the charm and sentiment of her countenance you longed to awaken a spirit which reposed but evidently did not sleep In Apaecides the whole aspect betokened the fervor and passion of his temperament and the intellectual portion of his nature seemed by the wild fire of the eyes the great breadth of the temples when compared with the height of the brow the trembling restlessness of the lips to be swayed and tyrannized over by the imaginative and ideal Fancy with the sister had stopped short at the golden goal of poetry with the brother less happy and less restrained it had wandered into visions more intangible and unembodied and the faculties which gave genius to the one threatened madness to the other You say I have been your enemy said Arbaces I know the cause of that unjust accusation I have placed you amidst the priests of Isis you are revolted at their trickeries and imposture you think that I too have deceived you the purity of your mind is offended you imagine that I am one of the deceitful You knew the jugglings of that impious craft answered Apaecides why did you disguise them from me When you excited my desire to devote myself to the office whose garb I bear you spoke to me of the holy life of men resigning themselves to knowledge you have given me for companions an ignorant and sensual herd who have no knowledge but that of the grossest frauds you spoke to me of men sacrificing the earthlier pleasures to the sublime cultivation of virtue you place me amongst men reeking with all the filthiness of vice you spoke to me of the friends the enlighteners of our common kind I see but their cheats and deluders Oh it was basely done you have robbed me of the glory of youth of the convictions of virtue of the sanctifying thirst after wisdom Young as I was rich fervent the sunny pleasures of earth before me I resigned all without a sign nay with happiness and exultation in the thought that I resigned them for the abstruse mysteries of diviner wisdom for the companionship of gods for the revelations of Heaven and now now Convulsive sobs checked the priest s voice he covered his face with his hands and large tears forced themselves through the wasted fingers and ran profusely down his vest What I promised to thee that will I give my friend my pupil these have been but trials to thy virtue it comes forth the brighter for thy novitiate think no more of those dull cheats assort no more with those menials of the goddess the atrienses of her hall you are worthy to enter into the penetralia I henceforth will be your priest your guide and you who now curse my friendship shall live to bless it The young man lifted up his head and gazed with a vacant and wondering stare upon the Egyptian Listen to me continued Arbaces in an earnest and solemn voice casting first his searching eyes around to see that they were still alone From Egypt came all the knowledge of the world from Egypt came the lore of Athens and the profound policy of Crete from Egypt came those early and mysterious tribes which long before the hordes of Romulus swept over the plains of Italy and in the eternal cycle of events drove back civilization into barbarism and darkness possessed all the arts of wisdom and the graces of intellectual life From Egypt came the rites and the grandeur of that solemn Caere whose inhabitants taught their iron vanquishers of Rome all that they yet know of elevated in religion and sublime in worship And how deemest thou young man that that Egypt the mother of countless nations achieved her greatness and soared to her cloud captain eminence of wisdom It was the result of a profound and holy policy Your modern nations owe their greatness to Egypt Egypt her greatness to her priests Rapt in themselves coveting a sway over the nobler part of man his soul and his belief those ancient ministers of God were inspired with the grandest thought that ever exalted mortals From the revolutions of the stars from the seasons of the earth from the round and unvarying circle of human destinies they devised an august allegory they made it gross and palpable to the vulgar by the signs of gods and goddesses and that which in reality was Government they named Religion Isis is a fable start not that for which Isis is a type is a reality an immortal being Isis is nothing Nature which she represents is the mother of all things dark ancient inscrutable save to the gifted few None among mortals hath ever lifted up my veil so saith the Isis that you adore but to the wise that veil hath been removed and we have stood face to face with the solemn loveliness of Nature The priests then were the benefactors the civilizers of mankind true they were also cheats impostors if you will But think you young man that if they had not deceived their kind they could have served them The ignorant and servile vulgar must be blinded to attain to their proper good they would not believe a maxim they revere an oracle The Emperor of Rome sways the vast and various tribes of earth and harmonizes the conflicting and disunited elements thence come peace order law the blessings of life Think you it is the man the emperor that thus sways no it is the pomp the awe the majesty that surround him these are his impostures his delusions our oracles and our divinations our rites and our ceremonies are the means of our sovereignty and the engines of our power They are the same means to the same end the welfare and harmony of mankind You listen to me rapt and intent the light begins to dawn upon you Apaecides remained silent but the changes rapidly passing over his speaking countenance betrayed the effect produced upon him by the words of the Egyptian words made tenfold more eloquent by the voice the aspect and the manner of the man While then resumed Arbaces our fathers of the Nile thus achieved the first elements by whose life chaos is destroyed namely the obedience and reverence of the multitude for the few they drew from their majestic and starred meditations that wisdom which was no delusion they invented the codes and regularities of law the arts and glories of existence They asked belief they returned the gift by civilization Were not their very cheats a virtue Trust me whosoever in yon far heavens of a diviner and more beneficent nature look down upon our world smile approvingly on the wisdom which has worked such ends But you wish me to apply these generalities to yourself I hasten to obey the wish The altars of the goddess of our ancient faith must be served and served too by others than the stolid and soulless things that are but as pegs and hooks whereon to hang the fillet and the robe Remember two sayings of Sextus the Pythagorean sayings borrowed from the lore of Egypt The first is Speak not of God to the multitude the second is The man worthy of God is a god among men As Genius gave to the ministers of Egypt worship that empire in late ages so fearfully decayed thus by Genius only can the dominion be restored I saw in you Apaecides a pupil worthy of my lessons a minister worthy of the great ends which may yet be wrought your energy your talents your purity of faith your earnestness of enthusiasm all fitted you for that calling which demands so imperiously high and ardent qualities I fanned therefore your sacred desires I stimulated you to the step you have taken But you blame me that I did not reveal to you the little souls and the juggling tricks of your companions Had I done so Apaecides I had defeated my own object your noble nature would have at once revolted and Isis would have lost her priest Apaecides groaned aloud The Egyptian continued without heeding the interruption I placed you therefore without preparation in the temple I left you suddenly to discover and to be sickened by all those mummeries which dazzle the herd I desired that you should perceive how those engines are moved by which the fountain that refreshes the world casts its waters in the air It was the trial ordained of old to all our priests They who accustom themselves to the impostures of the vulgar are left to practise them for those like you whose higher natures demand higher pursuit religion opens more god like secrets I am pleased to find in you the character I had expected You have taken the vows you cannot recede Advance I will be your guide And what wilt thou teach me O singular and fearful man New cheats new No I have thrown thee into the abyss of disbelief I will lead thee now to the eminence of faith Thou hast seen the false types thou shalt learn now the realities they represent There is no shadow Apaecides without its substance Come to me this night Your hand Impressed excited bewildered by the language of the Egyptian Apaecides gave him his hand and master and pupil parted It was true that for Apaecides there was no retreat He had taken the vows of celibacy he had devoted himself to a life that at present seemed to possess all the austerities of fanaticism without any of the consolations of belief It was natural that he should yet cling to a yearning desire to reconcile himself to an irrevocable career The powerful and profound mind of the Egyptian yet claimed an empire over his young imagination excited him with vague conjecture and kept him alternately vibrating between hope and fear Meanwhile Arbaces pursued his slow and stately way to the house of Ione As he entered the tablinum he heard a voice from the porticoes of the peristyle beyond which musical as it was sounded displeasingly on his ear it was the voice of the young and beautiful Glaucus and for the first time an involuntary thrill of jealousy shot through the breast of the Egyptian On entering the peristyle he found Glaucus seated by the side of Ione The fountain in the odorous garden cast up its silver spray in the air and kept a delicious coolness in the midst of the sultry noon The handmaids almost invariably attendant on Ione who with her freedom of life preserved the most delicate modesty sat at a little distance by the feet of Glaucus lay the lyre on which he had been playing to Ione one of the Lesbian airs The scene the group before Arbaces was stamped by that peculiar and refined ideality of poesy which we yet not erroneously imagine to be the distinction of the ancients the marble columns the vases of flowers the statue white and tranquil closing every vista and above all the two living forms from which a sculptor might have caught either inspiration or despair Arbaces pausing for a moment gazed on the pair with a brow from which all the usual stern serenity had fled he recovered himself by an effort and slowly approached them but with a step so soft and echoless that even the attendants heard him not much less Ione and her lover And yet said Glaucus it is only before we love that we imagine that our poets have truly described the passion the instant the sun rises all the stars that had shone in his absence vanish into air The poets exist only in the night of the heart they are nothing to us when we feel the full glory of the god A gentle and most glowing image noble Glaucus Both started and recognized behind the seat of Ione the cold and sarcastic face of the Egyptian You are a sudden guest said Glaucus rising and with a forced smile So ought all to be who know they are welcome returned Arbaces seating himself and motioning to Glaucus to do the same I am glad said Ione to see you at length together for you are suited to each other and you are formed to be friends Give me back some fifteen years of life replied the Egyptian before you can place me on an equality with Glaucus Happy should I be to receive his friendship but what can I give him in return Can I make to him the same confidences that he would repose in me of banquets and garlands of Parthian steeds and the chances of the dice these pleasures suit his age his nature his career they are not for mine So saying the artful Egyptian looked down and sighed but from the corner of his eye he stole a glance towards Ione to see how she received these insinuations of the pursuits of her visitor Her countenance did not satisfy him Glaucus slightly coloring hastened gaily to reply Nor was he perhaps without the wish in his turn to disconcert and abash the Egyptian You are right wise Arbaces said he we can esteem each other but we cannot be friends My banquets lack the secret salt which according to rumor gives such zest to your own And by Hercules when I have reached your age if I like you may think it wise to pursue the pleasures of manhood like you I shall be doubtless sarcastic on the gallantries of youth The Egyptian raised his eyes to Glaucus with a sudden and piercing glance I do not understand you said he coldly but it is the custom to consider that wit lies in obscurity He turned from Glaucus 
3557-8342-0091	train-other-500	as he spoke
none	none	 with a scarcely perceptible sneer of contempt and after a moment s pause addressed himself to Ione I have not beautiful Ione said he been fortunate enough to find you within doors the last two or three times that I have visited your vestibule The smoothness of the sea has tempted me much from home replied Ione with a little embarrassment The embarrassment did not escape Arbaces but without seeming to heed it he replied with a smile You know the old poet says that Women should keep within doors and there converse The poet was a cynic said Glaucus and hated women He spoke according to the customs of his country and that country is your boasted Greece To different periods different customs Had our forefathers known Ione they had made a different law Did you learn these pretty gallantries at Rome said Arbaces with ill suppressed emotion One certainly would not go for gallantries to Egypt retorted Glaucus playing carelessly with his chain Come come said Ione hastening to interrupt a conversation which she saw to her great distress was so little likely to cement the intimacy she had desired to effect between Glaucus and her friend Arbaces must not be so hard upon his poor pupil An orphan and without a mother s care I may be to blame for the independent and almost masculine liberty of life that I have chosen yet it is not greater than the Roman women are accustomed to it is not greater than the Grecian ought to be Alas is it only to be among men that freedom and virtue are to be deemed united Why should the slavery that destroys you be considered the only method to preserve us Ah believe me it has been the great error of men and one that has worked bitterly on their destinies to imagine that the nature of women is I will not say inferior that may be so but so different from their own in making laws unfavorable to the intellectual advancement of women Have they not in so doing made laws against their children whom women are to rear against the husbands of whom women are to be the friends nay sometimes the advisers Ione stopped short suddenly and her face was suffused with the most enchanting blushes She feared lest her enthusiasm had led her too far yet she feared the austere Arbaces less than the courteous Glaucus for she loved the last and it was not the custom of the Greeks to allow their women at least such of their women as they most honored the same liberty and the same station as those of Italy enjoyed She felt therefore a thrill of delight as Glaucus earnestly replied Ever mayst thou think thus Ione ever be your pure heart your unerring guide Happy it had been for Greece if she had given to the chaste the same intellectual charms that are so celebrated amongst the less worthy of her women No state falls from freedom from knowledge while your sex smile only on the free and by appreciating encourage the wise Arbaces was silent for it was neither his part to sanction the sentiment of Glaucus nor to condemn that of Ione and after a short and embarrassed conversation Glaucus took his leave of Ione When he was gone Arbaces drawing his seat nearer to the fair Neapolitan s said in those bland and subdued tones in which he knew so well how to veil the mingled art and fierceness of his character Think not my sweet pupil if so I may call you that I wish to shackle that liberty you adorn while you assume but which if not greater as you rightly observe than that possessed by the Roman women must at least be accompanied by great circumspection when arrogated by one unmarried Continue to draw crowds of the gay the brilliant the wise themselves to your feet continue to charm them with the conversation of an Aspasia the music of an Erinna but reflect at least on those censorious tongues which can so easily blight the tender reputation of a maiden and while you provoke admiration give I beseech you no victory to envy What mean you Arbaces said Ione in an alarmed and trembling voice I know you are my friend that you desire only my honour and my welfare What is it you would say Your friend ah how sincerely May I speak then as a friend without reserve and without offence I beseech you do so This young profligate this Glaucus how didst thou know him Hast thou seen him often And as Arbaces spoke he fixed his gaze steadfastly upon Ione as if he sought to penetrate into her soul Recoiling before that gaze with a strange fear which she could not explain the Neapolitan answered with confusion and hesitation He was brought to my house as a countryman of my father s and I may say of mine I have known him only within this last week or so but why these questions Forgive me said Arbaces I thought you might have known him longer Base insinuator that he is How what mean you Why that term It matters not let me not rouse your indignation against one who does not deserve so grave an honour I implore you speak What has Glaucus insinuated or rather in what do you suppose he has offended Smothering his resentment at the last part of Ione s question Arbaces continued You know his pursuits his companions his habits the comissatio and the alea the revel and the dice make his occupation and amongst the associates of vice how can he dream of virtue Still you speak riddles By the gods I entreat you say the worst at once Well then it must be so Know my Ione that it was but yesterday that Glaucus boasted openly yes in the public baths of your love to him He said it amused him to take advantage of it Nay I will do him justice he praised your beauty Who could deny it But he laughed scornfully when his Clodius or his Lepidus asked him if he loved you enough for marriage and when he purposed to adorn his door posts with flowers Impossible How heard you this base slander Nay would you have me relate to you all the comments of the insolent coxcombs with which the story has circled through the town Be assured that I myself disbelieved at first and that I have now painfully been convinced by several ear witnesses of the truth of what I have reluctantly told thee Ione sank back and her face was whiter than the pillar against which she leaned for support I own it vexed it irritated me to hear your name thus lightly pitched from lip to lip like some mere dancing girl s fame I hastened this morning to seek and to warn you I found Glaucus here I was stung from my self possession I could not conceal my feelings nay I was uncourteous in thy presence Canst thou forgive thy friend Ione Ione placed her hand in his but replied not Think no more of this said he but let it be a warning voice to tell thee how much prudence thy lot requires It cannot hurt thee Ione for a moment for a gay thing like this could never have been honored by even a serious thought from Ione These insults only wound when they come from one we love far different indeed is he whom the lofty Ione shall stoop to love Love muttered Ione with an hysterical laugh Ay indeed It is not without interest to observe in those remote times and under a social system so widely different from the modern the same small causes that ruffle and interrupt the course of love which operate so commonly at this day the same inventive jealousy the same cunning slander the same crafty and fabricated retailings of petty gossip which so often now suffice to break the ties of the truest love and counteract the tenor of circumstances most apparently propitious When the bark sails on over the smoothest wave the fable tells us of the diminutive fish that can cling to the keel and arrest its progress so is it ever with the great passions of mankind and we should paint life but ill if even in times the most prodigal of romance and of the romance of which we most largely avail ourselves we did not also describe the mechanism of those trivial and household springs of mischief which we see every day at work in our chambers and at our hearths It is in these the lesser intrigues of life that we mostly find ourselves at home with the past Most cunningly had the Egyptian appealed to Ione s ruling foible most dexterously had he applied the poisoned dart to her pride He fancied he had arrested what he hoped from the shortness of the time she had known Glaucus was at most but an incipient fancy and hastening to change the subject he now led her to talk of her brother Their conversation did not last long He left her resolved not again to trust so much to absence but to visit to watch her every day No sooner had his shadow glided from her presence than woman s pride her sex s dissimulation deserted his intended victim and the haughty Ione burst into passionate tears Chapter VII THE GAY LIFE OF THE POMPEIAN LOUNGER A MINIATURE LIKENESS OF THE ROMAN BATHS WHEN Glaucus left Ione he felt as if he trod upon air In the interview with which he had just been blessed he had for the first time gathered from her distinctly that his love was not unwelcome to and would not be unrewarded by her This hope filled him with a rapture for which earth and heaven seemed too narrow to afford a vent Unconscious of the sudden enemy he had left behind and forgetting not only his taunts but his very existence Glaucus passed through the gay streets repeating to himself in the wantonness of joy the music of the soft air to which Ione had listened with such intentness and now he entered the Street of Fortune with its raised footpath its houses painted without and the open doors admitting the view of the glowing frescoes within Each end of the street was adorned with a triumphal arch and as Glaucus now came before the Temple of Fortune the jutting portico of that beautiful fane which is supposed to have been built by one of the family of Cicero perhaps by the orator himself imparted a dignified and venerable feature to a scene otherwise more brilliant than lofty in its character That temple was one of the most graceful specimens of Roman architecture It was raised on a somewhat lofty podium and between two flights of steps ascending to a platform stood the altar of the goddess From this platform another flight of broad stairs led to the portico from the height of whose fluted columns hung festoons of the richest flowers On either side the extremities of the temple were placed statues of Grecian workmanship and at a little distance from the temple rose the triumphal arch crowned with an equestrian statue of Caligula which was flanked by trophies of bronze In the space before the temple a lively throng were assembled some seated on benches and discussing the politics of the empire some conversing on the approaching spectacle of the amphitheatre One knot of young men were lauding a new beauty another discussing the merits of the last play a third group more stricken in age were speculating on the chance of the trade with Alexandria and amidst these were many merchants in the Eastern costume whose loose and peculiar robes painted and gemmed slippers and composed and serious countenances formed a striking contrast to the tunicked forms and animated gestures of the Italians For that impatient and lively people had as now a language distinct from speech a language of signs and motions inexpressibly significant and vivacious their descendants retain it and the learned Jorio hath written a most entertaining work upon that species of hieroglyphical gesticulation Sauntering through the crowd Glaucus soon found himself amidst a group of his merry and dissipated friends Ah said Sallust it is a lustrum since I saw you And how have you spent the lustrum What new dishes have you discovered I have been scientific returned Sallust and have made some experiments in the feeding of lampreys I confess I despair of bringing them to the perfection which our Roman ancestors attained Miserable man and why Because returned Sallust with a sigh it is no longer lawful to give them a slave to eat I am very often tempted to make away with a very fat carptor butler whom I possess and pop him slily into the reservoir He would give the fish a most oleaginous flavor But slaves are not slaves nowadays and have no sympathy with their masters interest or Davus would destroy himself to oblige me What news from Rome said Lepidus as he languidly joined the group The emperor has been giving a splendid supper to the senators answered Sallust He is a good creature quoth Lepidus they say he never sends a man away without granting his request Perhaps he would let me kill a slave for my reservoir returned Sallust eagerly Not unlikely said Glaucus for he who grants a favor to one Roman must always do it at the expense of another Be sure that for every smile Titus has caused a hundred eyes have wept Long live Titus cried Pansa overhearing the emperor s name as he swept patronizingly through the crowd he has promised my brother a quaestorship because he had run through his fortune And wishes now to enrich himself among the people my Pansa said Glaucus Exactly so said Pansa That is putting the people to some use said Glaucus To be sure returned Pansa Well I must go and look after the aerarium it is a little out of repair and followed by a long train of clients distinguished from the rest of the throng by the togas they wore for togas once the sign of freedom in a citizen were now the badge of servility to a patron the aedile fidgeted fussily away Poor Pansa said Lepidus he never has time for pleasure Thank Heaven I am not an aedile Ah Glaucus how are you gay as ever said Clodius joining the group Are you come to sacrifice to Fortune said Sallust I sacrifice to her every night returned the gamester I do not doubt it No man has made more victims By Hercules a biting speech cried Glaucus laughing The dog s letter is never out of your mouth Sallust said Clodius angrily you are always snarling I may well have the dog s letter in my mouth since whenever I play with you I have the dog s throw in my hand returned Sallust Hist said Glaucus taking a rose from a flower girl who stood beside The rose is the token of silence replied Sallust but I love only to see it at the supper table Talking of that Diomed gives a grand feast next week said Sallust are you invited Glaucus Yes I received an invitation this morning And I too said Sallust drawing a square piece of papyrus from his girdle I see that he asks us an hour earlier than usual an earnest of something sumptuous Oh he is rich as Croesus said Clodius and his bill of fare is as long as an epic Well let us to the baths said Glaucus this is the time when all the world is there and Fulvius whom you admire so much is going to read us his last ode The young men assented readily to the proposal and they strolled to the baths Although the public thermae or baths were instituted rather for the poorer citizens than the wealthy for the last had baths in their own houses yet to the crowds of all ranks who resorted to them it was a favorite place for conversation and for that indolent lounging so dear to a gay and thoughtless people The baths at Pompeii differed of course in plan and construction from the vast and complicated thermae of Rome and indeed it seems that in each city of the empire there was always some slight modification of arrangement in the general architecture of the public baths This mightily puzzles the learned as if architects and fashion were not capricious before the nineteenth century Our party entered by the principal porch in the Street of Fortune At the wing of the portico sat the keeper of the baths with his two boxes before him one for the money he received one for the tickets he dispensed Round the walls of the portico were seats crowded with persons of all ranks while others as the regimen of the physicians prescribed were walking briskly to and fro the portico stopping every now and then to gaze on the innumerable notices of shows games sales exhibitions which were painted or inscribed upon the walls The general subject of conversation was however the spectacle announced in the amphitheatre and each new comer was fastened upon by a group eager to know if Pompeii had been so fortunate as to produce some monstrous criminal some happy case of sacrilege or of murder which would allow the aediles to provide a man for the jaws of the lion all other more common exhibitions seemed dull and tame when compared with the possibility of this fortunate occurrence For my part said one jolly looking man who was a goldsmith I think the emperor if he is as good as they say might have sent us a Jew Why not take one of the new sect of Nazarenes said a philosopher I am not cruel but an atheist one who denies Jupiter himself deserves no mercy I care not how many gods a man likes to believe in said the goldsmith but to deny all gods is something monstrous Yet I fancy said Glaucus that these people are not absolutely atheists I am told that they believe in a God nay in a future state Quite a mistake my dear Glaucus said the philosopher I have conferred with them they laughed in my face when I talked of Pluto and Hades O ye gods exclaimed the goldsmith in horror are there any of these wretches in Pompeii I know there are a few but they meet so privately that it is impossible to discover who they are As Glaucus turned away a sculptor who was a great enthusiast in his art looked after him admiringly Ah said he if we could get him on the arena there would be a model for you What limbs what a head he ought to have been a gladiator A subject a subject worthy of our art Why don t they give him to the lion Meanwhile Fulvius the Roman poet whom his contemporaries declared immortal and who but for this history would never have been heard of in our neglectful age came eagerly up to Glaucus Oh my Athenian my Glaucus you have come to hear my ode That is indeed an honour you a Greek to whom the very language of common life is poetry How I thank you It is but a trifle but if I secure your approbation perhaps I may get an introduction to Titus Oh Glaucus a poet without a patron is an amphora without a label the wine may be good but nobody will laud it And what says Pythagoras Frankincense to the gods but praise to man A patron then is the poet s priest he procures him the incense and obtains him his believers But all Pompeii is your patron and every portico an altar in your praise Ah the poor Pompeians are very civil they love to honour merit But they are only the inhabitants of a petty town spero meliora Shall we within Certainly we lose time till we hear your poem At this instant there was a rush of some twenty persons from the baths into the portico and a slave stationed at the door of a small corridor now admitted the poet Glaucus Clodius and a troop of the bard s other friends into the passage A poor place this compared with the Roman thermae said Lepidus disdainfully Yet is there some taste in the ceiling said Glaucus who was in a mood to be pleased with everything pointing to the stars which studded the roof Lepidus shrugged his shoulders but was too languid to reply They now entered a somewhat spacious chamber which served for the purposes of the apodyterium that is a place where the bathers prepared themselves for their luxurious ablutions The vaulted ceiling was raised from a cornice glowingly colored with motley and grotesque paintings the ceiling itself was paneled in white compartments bordered with rich crimson the unsullied and shining floor was paved with white mosaics and along the walls were ranged benches for the accommodation of the loiterers This chamber did not possess the numerous and spacious windows which Vitruvius attributes to his more magnificent frigidarium The Pompeians as all the southern Italians were fond of banishing the light of their sultry skies and combined in their voluptuous associations the idea of luxury with darkness Two windows of glass alone admitted the soft and shaded ray and the compartment in which one of these casements was placed was adorned with a large relief of the destruction of the Titans In this apartment Fulvius seated himself with a magisterial air and his audience gathering round him encouraged him to commence his recital The poet did not require much pressing He drew forth from his vest a roll of papyrus and after hemming three times as much to command silence as to clear his voice he began that wonderful ode of which to the great mortification of the author of this history no single verse can be discovered By the plaudits he received it was doubtless worthy of his fame and Glaucus was the only listener who did not find it excel the best odes of Horace The poem concluded those who took only the cold bath began to undress they suspended their garments on hooks fastened in the wall and receiving according to their condition either from their own slaves or those of the thermae loose robes in exchange withdrew into that graceful circular building which yet exists to shame the unlaving posterity of the south The more luxurious departed by another door to the tepidarium a place which was heated to a voluptuous warmth partly by a movable fireplace principally by a suspended pavement beneath which was conducted the caloric of the laconicum Here this portion of the intended bathers after unrobing themselves remained for some time enjoying the artificial warmth of the luxurious air And this room as befitted its important rank in the long process of ablution was more richly and elaborately decorated than the rest the arched roof was beautifully carved and painted the windows above of ground glass admitted but wandering and uncertain rays below the massive cornices were rows of figures in massive and bold relief the walls glowed with crimson the pavement was skillfully tessellated in white mosaics Here the habituated bathers men who bathed seven times a day would remain in a state of enervate and speechless lassitude either before or mostly after the water bath and many of these victims of the pursuit of health turned their listless eyes on the newcomers recognizing their friends with a nod but dreading the fatigue of conversation From this place the party again diverged according to their several fancies some to the sudatorium which answered the purpose of our vapor baths and thence to the warm bath itself those more accustomed to exercise and capable of dispensing with so cheap a purchase of fatigue resorted at once to the calidarium or water bath In order to complete this sketch and give to the reader an adequate notion of this the main luxury of the ancients we will accompany Lepidus who regularly underwent the whole process save only the cold bath which had gone lately out of fashion Being then gradually warmed in the tepidarium which has just been described the delicate steps of the Pompeian elegant were conducted to the sudatorium Here let the reader depict to himself the gradual process of the vapor bath accompanied by an exhalation of spicy perfumes After our bather had undergone this operation he was seized by his slaves who always awaited him at the baths and the dews of heat were removed by a kind of scraper which by the way a modern traveler has gravely declared to be used only to remove the dirt not one particle of which could ever settle on the polished skin of the practised bather Thence somewhat cooled he passed into the water bath over which fresh perfumes were profusely scattered and on emerging from the opposite part of the room a cooling shower played over his head and form Then wrapping himself in a light robe he returned once more to the tepidarium where he found Glaucus who had not encountered the sudatorium and now the main delight and extravagance of the bath commenced Their slaves anointed the bathers from vials of gold of alabaster or of crystal studded with profusest gems and containing the rarest unguents gathered from all quarters of the world The number of these smegmata used by the wealthy would fill a modern volume especially if the volume were printed by a fashionable publisher Amaracinum Megalium Nardum omne quod exit in um while soft music played in an adjacent chamber and such as used the bath in moderation refreshed and restored by the grateful ceremony conversed with all the zest and freshness of rejuvenated life Blessed be he who invented baths said Glaucus stretching himself along one of those bronze seats then covered with soft cushions which the visitor to Pompeii sees at this day in that same tepidarium Whether he were Hercules or Bacchus he deserved deification But tell me said a corpulent citizen who was groaning and wheezing under the operation of being rubbed down tell me O Glaucus evil chance to thy hands O slave why so rough tell me ugh ugh are the baths at Rome really so magnificent Glaucus turned and recognized Diomed though not without some difficulty so red and so inflamed were the good man s cheeks by the sudatory and the scraping he had so lately undergone I fancy they must be a great deal finer than these Eh Suppressing a smile Glaucus replied Imagine all Pompeii converted into baths and you will then form a notion of the size of the imperial thermae of Rome But a notion of the size only Imagine every entertainment for mind and body enumerate all the gymnastic games our fathers invented repeat all the books Italy and Greece have produced suppose places for all these games admirers for all these works add to this baths of the vastest size the most complicated construction intersperse the whole with gardens with theatres with porticoes with schools suppose in one word a city of the gods composed but of palaces and public edifices and you may form some faint idea of the glories of the great baths of Rome By Hercules said Diomed opening his eyes why it would take a man s whole life to bathe At Rome it often does so replied Glaucus gravely There are many who live only at the baths They repair there the first hour in which the doors are opened and remain till that in which the doors are closed They seem as if they knew nothing of the rest of Rome as if they despised all other existence By Pollux you amaze me Even those who bathe only thrice a day contrive to consume their lives in this occupation They take their exercise in the tennis court or the porticoes to prepare them for the first bath they lounge into the theatre to refresh themselves after it They take their prandium under the trees and think over their second bath By the time it is prepared the prandium is digested From the second bath they stroll into one of the peristyles to hear some new poet recite or into the library to sleep over an old one Then comes the supper which they still consider but a part of the bath and then a third time they bathe again as the best place to converse with their friends Per Hercle but we have their imitators at Pompeii Yes and without their excuse The magnificent voluptuaries of the Roman baths are happy they see nothing but gorgeousness and splendor they visit not the squalid parts of the city they know not that there is poverty in the world All Nature smiles for them and her only frown is the last one which sends them to bathe in Cocytus Believe me they are your only true philosophers While Glaucus was thus conversing Lepidus with closed eyes and scarce perceptible breath was undergoing all the mystic operations not one of which he ever suffered his attendants to omit After the perfumes and the unguents they scattered over him the luxurious powder which prevented any further accession of heat and this being rubbed away by the smooth surface of the pumice he began to indue not the garments he had put off but those more festive ones termed the synthesis with which the Romans marked their respect for the coming ceremony of supper if rather from its hour three o clock in our measurement of time it might not be more fitly denominated dinner This done he at length opened his eyes and gave signs of returning life At the same time too Sallust betokened by a long yawn the evidence of existence It is supper time said the epicure you Glaucus and Lepidus come and sup with me Recollect you are all three engaged to my house next week cried Diomed who was mightily proud of the acquaintance of men of fashion Ah ah we recollect said Sallust the seat of memory my Diomed is certainly in the stomach Passing now once again into the cooler air and so into the street our gallants of that day concluded the ceremony of a Pompeian bath Chapter VIII ARBACES COGS HIS DICE WITH PLEASURE AND WINS THE GAME THE evening darkened over the restless city as Apaecides took his way to the house of the Egyptian He avoided the more lighted and populous streets and as he strode onward with his head buried in his bosom and his arms folded within his robe there was something startling in the contrast which his solemn mien and wasted form presented to the thoughtless brows and animated air of those who occasionally crossed his path At length however a man of a more sober and staid demeanor and who had twice passed him with a curious but doubting look touched him on the shoulder Apaecides said he and he made a rapid sign with his hands it was the sign of the cross Well Nazarene replied the priest and his face grew paler what wouldst thou Nay returned the stranger I would not interrupt thy meditations but the last time we met I seemed not to be so unwelcome You are not unwelcome Olinthus but I am sad and weary nor am I able this evening to discuss with you those themes which are most acceptable to you O backward of heart said Olinthus with bitter fervor and art thou sad and weary and wilt thou turn from the very springs that refresh and heal O earth cried the young priest striking his breast passionately from what regions shall my eyes open to the true Olympus where thy gods really dwell Am I to believe with this man that none whom for so many centuries my fathers worshipped have a being or a name Am I to break down as something blasphemous and profane the very altars which I have deemed most sacred or am I to think with Arbaces what He paused and strode rapidly away in the impatience of a man who strives to get rid of himself But the Nazarene was one of those hardy vigorous and enthusiastic men by whom God in all times has worked the revolutions of earth and those above all in the establishment and in the reformation of His own religion men who were formed to convert because formed to endure It is men of this mould whom nothing discourages nothing dismays in the fervor of belief they are inspired and they inspire Their reason first kindles their passion but the passion is the instrument they use they force themselves into men s hearts while they appear only to appeal to their judgment Nothing is so contagious as enthusiasm it is the real allegory of the tale of Orpheus it moves stones it charms brutes Enthusiasm is the genius of sincerity and truth accomplishes no victories without it Olinthus did not then suffer Apaecides thus easily to escape him He overtook and addressed him thus I do not wonder Apaecides that I distress you that I shake all the elements of your mind that you are lost in doubt that you drift here and there in the vast ocean of uncertain and benighted thought I wonder not at this but bear with me a little watch and pray the darkness shall vanish the storm sleep and God Himself as He came of yore on the seas of Samaria shall walk over the lulled billows to the delivery of your soul Ours is a religion jealous in its demands but how infinitely prodigal in its gifts It troubles you for an hour it repays you by immortality Such promises said Apaecides sullenly are the tricks by which man is ever gulled Oh glorious were the promises which led me to the shrine of Isis But answered the Nazarene ask thy reason can that religion be sound which outrages all morality You are told to worship your gods What are those gods even according to yourselves What their actions what their attributes Are they not all represented to you as the blackest of criminals yet you are asked to serve them as the holiest of divinities Jupiter himself is a parricide and an adulterer What are the meaner deities but imitators of his vices You are told not to murder but you worship murderers you are told not to commit adultery and you make your prayers to an adulterer Oh what is this but a mockery of the holiest part of man s nature which is faith Turn now to the God the one the true God to whose shrine I would lead you If He seem to you too sublime two shadowy for those human associations those touching connections between Creator and creature to which the weak heart clings contemplate Him in His Son who put on mortality like ourselves His mortality is not indeed declared like that of your fabled gods by the vices of our nature but by the practice of all its virtues In Him are united the austerest morals with the tenderest affections If He were but a mere man He had been worthy to become a god You honour Socrates he has his sect his disciples his schools But what are the doubtful virtues of the Athenian to the bright the undisputed the active the unceasing the devoted holiness of Christ I speak to you now only of His human character He came in that as the pattern of future ages to show us the form of virtue which Plato thirsted to see embodied This was the true sacrifice that He made for man but the halo that encircled His dying hour not only brightened earth but opened to us the sight of heaven You are touched you are moved God works in your heart His Spirit is with you Come resist not the holy impulse come at once unhesitatingly A few of us are now assembled to expound the word of God Come let me guide you to them You are sad you are weary Listen then to the words of God Come to me saith He all ye that are heavy laden and I will give you rest I cannot now said Apaecides another time Now now exclaimed Olinthus earnestly and clasping him by the arm But Apaecides yet unprepared for the renunciation of that faith that life for which he had sacrificed so much and still haunted by the promises of the Egyptian extricated himself forcibly from the grasp and feeling an effort necessary to conquer the irresolution which the eloquence of the Christian had begun to effect in his heated and feverish mind he gathered up his robes and fled away with a speed that defied pursuit Breathless and exhausted he arrived at last in a remote and sequestered part of the city and the lone house of the Egyptian stood before him As he paused to recover himself the moon emerged from a silver cloud and shone full upon the walls of that mysterious habitation No other house was near the darksome vines clustered far and wide in front of the building and behind it rose a copse of lofty forest trees sleeping in the melancholy moonlight beyond stretched the dim outline of the distant hills and amongst them the quiet crest of Vesuvius not then so lofty as the traveler beholds it now Apaecides passed through the arching vines and arrived at the broad and spacious portico Before it on either side of the steps reposed the image of the Egyptian sphinx and the moonlight gave an additional and yet more solemn calm to those large and harmonious and passionless features in which the sculptors of that type of wisdom united so much of loveliness with awe half way up the extremities of the steps darkened the green and massive foliage of the aloe and the shadow of the eastern palm cast its long and unwaving boughs partially over the marble surface of the stairs Something there was in the stillness of the place and the strange aspect of the sculptured sphinxes which thrilled the blood of the priest with a nameless and ghostly fear and he longed even for an echo to his noiseless steps as he ascended to the threshold He knocked at the door over which was wrought an inscription in characters unfamiliar to his eyes it opened without a sound and a tall Ethiopian slave without question or salutation motioned to him to proceed The wide hall was lighted by lofty candelabra of elaborate bronze and round the walls were wrought vast hieroglyphics in dark and solemn colors which contrasted strangely with the bright hues and graceful shapes with which the inhabitants of Italy decorated their abodes At the extremity of the hall a slave whose countenance though not African was darker by many shades than the usual color of the south advanced to meet him I seek Arbaces said the priest but his voice trembled even in his own ear The slave bowed his head in silence and leading Apaecides to a wing without the hall conducted him up a narrow staircase and then traversing several rooms in which the stern and thoughtful beauty of the sphinx still made the chief and most impressive object of the priest s notice Apaecides found himself in a dim and half lighted chamber in the presence of the Egyptian Arbaces was seated before a small table on which lay unfolded several scrolls of papyrus impressed with the same character as that on the threshold of the mansion A small tripod stood at a little distance from the incense in which the smoke slowly rose Near this was a vast globe depicting the signs of heaven and upon another table lay several instruments of curious and quaint shape whose uses were unknown to Apaecides The farther extremity of the room was concealed by a curtain and the oblong window in the roof admitted the rays of the moon mingling sadly with the single lamp which burned in the apartment Seat yourself Apaecides said the Egyptian without rising The young man obeyed You ask me resumed Arbaces after a short pause in which he seemed absorbed in thought You ask me or would do so the mightiest secrets which the soul of man is fitted to receive it is the enigma of life itself that you desire me to solve Placed like children in the dark and but for a little while in this dim and confined existence we shape our spectres in the obscurity our thoughts now sink back into ourselves in terror now wildly plunge themselves into the guideless gloom guessing what it may contain stretching our helpless hands here and there lest blindly we stumble upon some hidden danger not knowing the limits of our boundary now feeling them suffocate us with compression now seeing them extend far away till they vanish into eternity In this state all wisdom consists necessarily in the solution of two questions What are we to believe and What are we to reject These questions you desire me to decide Apaecides bowed his head in assent Man must have some belief continued the Egyptian in a tone of sadness He must fasten his hope to something is our common nature that you inherit when aghast and terrified to see that in which you have been taught to place your faith swept away you float over a dreary and shoreless sea of incertitude you cry for help you ask for some plank to cling to some land however dim and distant to attain Well then have not forgotten our conversation of to day Forgotten I confessed to you that those deities for whom smoke so many altars were but inventions I confessed to you that our rites and ceremonies were but mummeries to delude and lure the herd to their proper good I explained to you that from those delusions came the bonds of society the harmony of the world the power of the wise that power is in the obedience of the vulgar Continue we then these salutary delusions if man must have some belief continue to him that which his fathers have made dear to him and which custom sanctifies and strengthens In seeking a subtler faith for us whose senses are too spiritual for the gross one let us leave others that support which crumbles from ourselves This is wise it is benevolent Proceed This being settled resumed the Egyptian the old landmarks being left uninjured for those whom we are about to desert we gird up our loins and depart to new climes of faith Dismiss at once from your recollection from your thought all that you have believed before Suppose the mind a blank an unwritten scroll fit to receive impressions for the first time Look round the world observe its order its regularity its design Something must have created it the design speaks a designer in that certainty we first touch land But what is that something A god you cry Stay no confused and confusing names Of that which created the world we know we can know nothing save these attributes power and unvarying regularity stern crushing relentless regularity heeding no individual cases rolling sweeping burning on no matter what scattered hearts severed from the general mass fall ground and scorched beneath its wheels The mixture of evil with good the existence of suffering and of crime in all times have perplexed the wise They created a god they supposed him benevolent How then came this evil why did he permit it nay why invent why perpetuate it To account for this the Persian creates a second spirit whose nature is evil and supposes a continual war between that and the god of good In our own shadowy and tremendous Typhon the Egyptians image a similar demon Perplexing blunder that yet more bewilders us folly that arose from the vain delusion that makes a palpable a corporeal a human being of this unknown power that clothes the Invisible with attributes and a nature similar to the Seen No to this designer let us give a name that does not command our bewildering associations and the mystery becomes more clear that name is NECESSITY Necessity say the Greeks compels the gods Then why the gods their agency becomes unnecessary dismiss them at once Necessity is the ruler of all we see power regularity these two qualities make its nature Would you ask more you can learn nothing whether it be eternal whether it compel us its creatures to new careers after that darkness which we call death we cannot tell There leave we this ancient unseen unfathomable power and come to that which to our eyes is the great minister of its functions This we can task more from this we can learn more its evidence is around us its name is NATURE The error of the sages has been to direct their researches to the attributes of necessity where all is gloom and blindness Had they confined their researches to Nature what of knowledge might we not already have achieved Here patience examination are never directed in vain We see what we explore our minds ascend a palpable ladder of causes and effects Nature is the great agent of the external universe and Necessity imposes upon it the laws by which it acts and imparts to us the powers by which we examine those powers are curiosity and memory their union is reason their perfection is wisdom Well then I examine by the help of these powers this inexhaustible Nature I examine the earth the air the ocean the heaven I find that all have a mystic sympathy with each other that the moon sways the tides that the air maintains the earth and is the medium of the life and sense of things that by the knowledge of the stars we measure the limits of the earth that we portion out the epochs of time that by their pale light we are guided into the abyss of the past that in their solemn lore we discern the destinies of the future And thus while we know not that which Necessity is we learn at least her decrees And now what morality do we glean from this religion for religion it is I believe in two deities Nature and Necessity I worship the last by reverence the first by investigation What is the morality my religion teaches This all things are subject but to general rules the sun shines for the joy of the many it may bring sorrow to the few the night sheds sleep on the multitude but it harbors murder as well as rest the forests adorn the earth but shelter the serpent and the lion the ocean supports a thousand barks but it engulfs the one It is only thus for the general and not for the universal benefit that Nature acts and Necessity speeds on her awful course This is the morality of the dread agents of the world it is mine who am their creature I would preserve the delusions of priestcraft for they are serviceable to the multitude I would impart to man the arts I discover the sciences I perfect I would speed the vast career of civilizing lore in this I serve the mass I fulfill the general law I execute the great moral that Nature preaches For myself I claim the individual exception I claim it for the wise satisfied that my individual actions are nothing in the great balance of good and evil satisfied that the product of my knowledge can give greater blessings to the mass than my desires can operate evil on the few for the first can extend to remotest regions and humanize nations yet unborn I give to the world wisdom to myself freedom I enlighten the lives of others and I enjoy my own Yes our wisdom is eternal but our life is short make the most of it while it lasts Surrender thy youth to pleasure and thy senses to delight Soon comes the hour when the wine cup is shattered and the garlands shall cease to bloom Enjoy while you may Be still O Apaecides my pupil and my follower I will teach thee the mechanism of Nature her darkest and her wildest secrets the lore which fools call magic and the mighty mysteries of the stars By this shalt thou discharge thy duty to the mass by this shalt thou enlighten thy race But I will lead thee also to pleasures of which the vulgar do not dream and the day which thou givest to men shall be followed by the sweet night which thou surrenderest to thyself As the Egyptian ceased there rose about around beneath the softest music that Lydia ever taught or Iona ever perfected It came like a stream of sound bathing the senses unawares enervating subduing with delight It seemed the melodies of invisible spirits such as the shepherd might have heard in the golden age floating through the vales of Thessaly or in the noontide glades of Paphos The words which had rushed to the lip of Apaecides in answer to the sophistries of the Egyptian died tremblingly away He felt it as a profanation to break upon that enchanted strain the susceptibility of his excited nature the Greek softness and ardour of his secret soul were swayed and captured by surprise He sank on the seat with parted lips and thirsting ear while in a chorus of voices bland and melting as those which waked Psyche in the halls of love rose the following song THE HYMN OF EROS By the cool banks where soft Cephisus flows A voice sail d trembling down the waves of air The leaves blushed brighter in the Teian s rose The doves couch d breathless in their summer lair While from their hands the purple flowerets fell The laughing Hours stood listening in the sky From Pan s green cave to AEgle s haunted cell Heaved the charm d earth in one delicious sigh Love sons of earth I am the Power of Love Eldest of all the gods with Chaos born My smile sheds light along the courts above My kisses wake the eyelids of the Morn Mine are the stars there ever as ye gaze Ye meet the deep spell of my haunting eyes Mine is the moon and mournful if her rays Tis that she lingers where her Carian lies The flowers are mine the blushes of the rose The violet charming Zephyr to the shade Mine the quick light that in the Maybeam glows And mine the day dream in the lonely glade Love sons of earth for love is earth s soft lore Look where ye will earth overflows with ME Learn from the waves that ever kiss the shore And the winds nestling on the heaving sea All teaches love The sweet voice like a dream Melted in light yet still the airs above The waving sedges and the whispering stream And the green forest rustling murmur d LOVE As the voices died away the Egyptian seized the hand of Apaecides and led him wandering intoxicated yet half reluctant across the chamber towards the curtain at the far end and now from behind that curtain there seemed to burst a thousand sparkling stars the veil itself hitherto dark was now lighted by these fires behind into the tenderest blue of heaven It represented heaven itself such a heaven as in the nights of June might have shone down over the streams of Castaly Here and there were painted rosy and aerial clouds from which smiled by the limner s art faces of divinest beauty and on which reposed the shapes of which Phidias and Apelles dreamed And the stars which studded the transparent azure rolled rapidly as they shone while the music that again woke with a livelier and lighter sound seemed to imitate the melody of the joyous spheres Oh what miracle is this Arbaces said Apaecides in faltering accents After having denied the gods art thou about to reveal to me Their pleasures interrupted Arbaces in a tone so different from its usual cold and tranquil harmony that Apaecides started and thought the Egyptian himself transformed and now as they neared the curtain a wild a loud an exulting melody burst from behind its concealment With that sound the veil was rent in twain it parted it seemed to vanish into air and a scene which no Sybarite ever more than rivalled broke upon the dazzled gaze of the youthful priest A vast banquet room stretched beyond blazing with countless lights which filled the warm air with the scents of frankincense of jasmine of violets of myrrh all that the most odorous flowers all that the most costly spices could distil seemed gathered into one ineffable and ambrosial essence from the light columns that sprang upwards to the airy roof hung draperies of white studded with golden stars At the extremities of the room two fountains cast up a spray which catching the rays of the roseate light glittered like countless diamonds In the centre of the room as they entered there rose slowly from the floor to the sound of unseen minstrelsy a table spread with all the viands which sense ever devoted to fancy and vases of that lost Myrrhine fabric so glowing in its colors so transparent in its material were crowned with the exotics of the East The couches to which this table was the centre were covered with tapestries of azure and gold and from invisible tubes the vaulted roof descended showers of fragrant waters that cooled the delicious air and contended with the lamps as if the spirits of wave and fire disputed which element could furnish forth the most delicious odorous And now from behind the snowy draperies trooped such forms as Adonis beheld when he lay on the lap of Venus They came some with garlands others with lyres they surrounded the youth they led his steps to the banquet They flung the chaplets round him in rosy chains The earth the thought of earth vanished from his soul He imagined himself in a dream and suppressed his breath lest he should wake too soon the senses to which he had never yielded as yet beat in his burning pulse and confused his dizzy and reeling sight And while thus amazed and lost once again but in brisk and Bacchic measures rose the magic strain ANACREONTIC In the veins of the calix foams and glows The blood of the mantling vine But oh in the bowl of Youth there glows A Lesbian more divine Bright bright As the liquid light Its waves through thine eyelids shine Fill up fill up to the sparkling brim The juice of the young Lyaeus The grape is the key that we owe to him From the gaol of the world to free us Drink drink What need to shrink When the lambs alone can see us Drink drink as I quaff from thine eyes The wine of a softer tree Give the smiles to the god of the grape thy sighs Beloved one give to me Turn turn My glances burn And thirst for a look from thee As the song ended a group of three maidens entwined with a chain of starred flowers and who while they imitated might have shamed the Graces advanced towards him in the gliding measures of the Ionian dance such as the Nereids wreathed in moonlight on the yellow sands of the AEgean wave such as Cytherea taught her handmaids in the marriage feast of Psyche and her son Now approaching they wreathed their chaplet round his head now kneeling the youngest of the three proffered him the bowl from which the wine of Lesbos foamed and sparkled The youth resisted no more he grasped the intoxicating cup the blood mantled fiercely through his veins He sank upon the breast of the nymph who sat beside him and turning with swimming eyes to seek for Arbaces whom he had lost in the whirl of his emotions he beheld him seated beneath a canopy at the upper end of the table and gazing upon him with a smile that encouraged him to pleasure He beheld him but not as he had hitherto seen with dark and sable garments with a brooding and solemn brow a robe that dazzled the sight so studded was its whitest surface with gold and gems blazed upon his majestic form white roses alternated with the emerald and the ruby and shaped tiara like crowned his raven locks He appeared like Ulysses to have gained the glory of a second youth his features seemed to have exchanged thought for beauty and he towered amidst the loveliness that surrounded him in all the beaming and relaxing benignity of the Olympian god Drink feast love my pupil said he blush not that thou art passionate and young That which thou art thou feelest in thy veins that which thou shalt be survey With this he pointed to a recess and the eyes of Apaecides following the gesture beheld on a pedestal placed between the statues of Bacchus and Idalia the form of a skeleton Start not resumed the Egyptian that friendly guest admonishes us but of the shortness of life From its jaws I hear a voice that summons us to ENJOY As he spoke a group of nymphs surrounded the statue they laid chaplets on its pedestal and while the cups were emptied and refilled at that glowing board they sang the following strain BACCHIC HYMNS TO THE IMAGE OF DEATH I Thou art in the land of the shadowy Host Thou that didst drink and love By the Solemn River a gliding ghost But thy thought is ours above If memory yet can fly Back to the golden sky And mourn the pleasures lost By the ruin d hall these flowers we lay Where thy soul once held its palace When the rose to thy scent and sight was gay And the smile was in the chalice And the cithara s voice Could bid thy heart rejoice When night eclipsed the day Here a new group advancing turned the tide of the music into a quicker and more joyous strain II Death death is the gloomy shore Where we all sail Soft soft thou gliding oar Blow soft sweet gale Chain with bright wreaths the Hours Victims if all Ever mid song and flowers Victims should fall Pausing for a moment yet quicker and quicker danced the silver footed music Since Life s so short we ll live to laugh Ah wherefore waste a minute If youth s the cup we yet can quaff Be love the pearl within it A third band now approached with brimming cups which they poured in libation upon that strange altar and once more slow and solemn rose the changeful melody III Thou art welcome Guest of gloom From the far and fearful sea When the last rose sheds its bloom Our board shall be spread with thee All hail dark Guest Who hath so fair a plea Our welcome Guest to be As thou whose solemn hall At last shall feast us all In the dim and dismal coast Long yet be we the Host And thou Dead Shadow thou All joyless though thy brow Thou but our passing GUEST At this moment she who sat beside Apaecides suddenly took up the song IV Happy is yet our doom The earth and the sun are ours And far from the dreary tomb Speed the wings of the rosy Hours Sweet is for thee the bowl Sweet are thy looks my love I fly to thy tender soul As bird to its mated dove Take me ah take Clasp d to thy guardian breast Soft let me sink to rest But wake me ah wake And tell me with words and sighs But more with thy melting eyes That my sun is not set That the Torch is not quench d at the Urn That we love and we breathe and burn Tell me thou lov saint me yet BOOK THE SECOND Chapter I A FLASH HOUSE IN POMPEII AND THE GENTLEMEN OF THE CLASSIC RING TO one of those parts of Pompeii which were tenanted not by the lords of pleasure but by its minions and its victims the haunt of gladiators and prize fighters of the vicious and the penniless of the savage and the obscene the Alsatia of an ancient city we are now transported It was a large room that opened at once on the confined and crowded lane Before the threshold was a group of men whose iron and well strung muscles whose short and Herculean necks whose hardy and reckless countenances indicated the champions of the arena On a shelf without the shop were ranged jars of wine and oil and right over this was inserted in the wall a coarse painting which exhibited gladiators drinking so ancient and so venerable is the custom of signs Within the room were placed several small tables arranged somewhat in the modern fashion of boxes and round these were seated several knots of men some drinking some playing at dice some at that more skilful game called duodecim scriptae which certain of the blundering learned have mistaken for chess though it rather perhaps resembled backgammon of the two and was usually though not always played by the assistance of dice The hour was in the early forenoon and nothing better perhaps than that unseasonable time itself denoted the habitual indolence of these tavern loungers Yet despite the situation of the house and the character of its inmates it indicated none of that sordid squalor which would have characterized a similar haunt in a modern city The gay disposition of all the Pompeians who sought at least to gratify the sense even where they neglected the mind was typified by the gaudy colors which decorated the walls and the shapes fantastic but not inelegant in which the lamps the drinking cups the commonest household utensils were wrought By Pollux said one of the gladiators as he leaned against the wall of the threshold the wine thou sellest us old Silenus and as he spoke he slapped a portly personage on the back is enough to thin the best blood in one s veins The man thus caressingly saluted and whose bared arms white apron and keys and napkin tucked carelessly within his girdle indicated him to be the host of the tavern was already passed into the autumn of his years but his form was still so robust and athletic that he might have shamed even the sinewy shapes beside him save that the muscles had seeded as it were into flesh that the cheeks were swelled and bloated and the increasing stomach threw into shade the vast and massive chest which rose above it None of thy scurrilous blusterings with me growled the gigantic landlord in the gentle semi roar of an insulted tiger my wine is good enough for a carcass which shall so soon soak the dust of the spoliarium Croakest thou thus old raven returned the gladiator laughing scornfully thou shalt live to hang thyself with despite when thou seest me win the palm crown and when I get the purse at the amphitheatre as I certainly shall my first vow to Hercules shall be to forswear thee and thy vile potations evermore Hear to him hear to this modest Pyrgopolinices He has certainly served under Bombochides Cluninstaridysarchides cried the host Sporus Niger Tetraides he declares he shall win the purse from you Why by the gods each of your muscles is strong enough to stifle all his body or I know nothing of the arena Ha said the gladiator coloring with rising fury our lanista would tell a different story What story could he tell against me vain Lydon said Tetraides frowning Or me who have conquered in fifteen fights said the gigantic Niger stalking up to the gladiator Or me grunted Sporus with eyes of fire Tush said Lydon folding his arms and regarding his rivals with a reckless air of defiance The time of trial will soon come keep your valor till then Ay do said the surly host and if I press down my thumb to save you may the Fates cut my thread Your rope you mean said Lydon sneeringly here is a sesterce to buy one The Titan wine vender seized the hand extended to him and griped it in so stern a vice that the blood spirted from the fingers ends over the garments of the bystanders They set up a savage laugh I will teach thee young braggart to play the Macedonian with me I am no puny Persian I warrant thee What man have I not fought twenty years in the ring and never lowered my arms once And have I not received the rod from the editor s own hand as a sign of victory and as a grace to retirement on my laurels And am I now to be lectured by a boy So saying he flung the hand from him in scorn Without changing a muscle but with the same smiling face with which he had previously taunted mine host did the gladiator brave the painful grasp he had undergone But no sooner was his hand released than crouching for one moment as a wild cat crouches you might see his hair bristle on his head and beard and with a fierce and shrill yell he sprang on the throat of the giant with an impetus that threw him vast and sturdy as he was from his balance and down with the crash of a falling rock he fell while over him fell also his ferocious foe Our host perhaps had had no need of the rope so kindly recommended to him by Lydon had he remained three minutes longer in that position But summoned to his assistance by the noise of his fall a woman who had hitherto kept in an inner apartment rushed to the scene of battle This new ally was in herself a match for the gladiator she was tall lean and with arms that could give other than soft embraces In fact the gentle helpmate of Burbo the wine seller had like himself fought in the lists nay under the emperor s eye And Burbo himself Burbo the unconquered in the field according to report now and then yielded the palm to his soft Stratonice This sweet creature no sooner saw the imminent peril that awaited her worse half than without other weapons than those with which Nature had provided her she darted upon the incumbent gladiator and clasping him round the waist with her long and snakelike arms lifted him by a sudden wrench from the body of her husband leaving only his hands still clinging to the throat of his foe So have we seen a dog snatched by the hind legs from the strife with a fallen rival in the arms of some envious groom so have we seen one half of him high in air passive and offenceless while the other half head teeth eyes claws seemed buried and engulfed in the mangled and prostrate enemy Meanwhile the gladiators lapped and pampered and glutted upon blood crowded delightedly round the combatants their nostrils distended their lips grinning their eyes gloatingly fixed on the bloody throat of the one and the indented talons of the other Habet he has got it habet cried they with a sort of yell rubbing their nervous hands Non habeo ye liars I have not got it shouted the host as with a mighty effort he wrenched himself from those deadly hands and rose to his feet breathless panting lacerated bloody and fronting with reeling eyes the glaring look and grinning teeth of his baffled foe now struggling but struggling with disdain in the gripe of the sturdy amazon Fair play cried the gladiators one to one and crowding round Lydon and the woman they separated our pleasing host from his courteous guest But Lydon feeling ashamed at his present position and endeavoring in vain to shake off the grasp of the virago slipped his hand into his girdle and drew forth a short knife So menacing was his look so brightly gleamed the blade that Stratonice who was used only to that fashion of battle which we moderns call the pugilistic started back in alarm O gods cried she the ruffian he has concealed weapons Is that fair Is that like a gentleman and a gladiator No indeed I scorn such fellows With that she contemptuously turned her back on the gladiator and hastened to examine the condition of her husband But he as much inured to the constitutional exercises as an English bull dog is to a contest with a more gentle antagonist had already recovered himself The purple hues receded from the crimson surface of his cheek the veins of the forehead retired into their wonted size He shook himself with a complacent grunt satisfied that he was still alive and then looking at his foe from head to foot with an air of more approbation than he had ever bestowed upon him before By Castor said he thou art a stronger fellow than I took thee for I see thou art a man of merit and virtue give me thy hand my hero Jolly old Burbo cried the gladiators applauding staunch to the backbone Give him thy hand Lydon Oh to be sure said the gladiator but now I have tasted his blood I long to lap the whole By Hercules returned the host quite unmoved that is the true gladiator feeling Pollux to think what good training may make a man why a beast could not be fiercer A beast O dullard we beat the beasts hollow cried Tetraides Well well said Stratonice who was now employed in smoothing her hair and adjusting her dress if ye are all good friends again I recommend you to be quiet and orderly for some young noblemen your patrons and backers have sent to say they will come here to pay you a visit they wish to see you more at their ease than at the schools before they make up their bets on the great fight at the amphitheatre So they always come to my house for that purpose they know we only receive the best gladiators in Pompeii our society is very select praised be the gods Yes continued Burbo drinking off a bowl or rather a pail of wine a man who has won my laurels can only encourage the brave Lydon drink my boy may you have an honorable old age like mine Come here said Stratonice drawing her husband to her affectionately by the ears in that caress which Tibullus has so prettily described Come here Not so hard she wolf thou art worse than the gladiator murmured the huge jaws of Burbo Hist said she whispering him Calenus has just stole in disguised by the back way I hope he has brought the sesterces Ho ho I will join him said Burbo meanwhile I say keep a sharp eye on the cups attend to the score Let them not cheat thee wife they are heroes to be sure but then they are arrant rogues Cacus was nothing to them Never fear me fool was the conjugal reply and Burbo satisfied with the dear assurance strode through the apartment and sought the penetralia of his house So those soft patrons are coming to look at our muscles said Niger Who sent to previse thee of it my mistress Lepidus He brings with him Clodius the surest better in Pompeii and the young Greek Glaucus A wager on a wager cried Tetraides Clodius bets on me for twenty sesterces What say you Lydon He bets on me said Lydon No on me grunted Sporus Dolts do you think he would prefer any of you to Niger said the athletic thus modestly naming himself Well well said Stratonice as she pierced a huge amphora for her guests who had now seated themselves before one of the tables great men and brave as ye all think yourselves which of you will fight the Numidian lion in case no malefactor should be found to deprive you of the option I who have escaped your arms stout Stratonice said Lydon might safely I think encounter the lion But tell me said Tetraides where is that pretty young slave of yours the blind girl with bright eyes I have not seen her a long time Oh she is too delicate for you my son of Neptune said the hostess and too nice even for us I think We send her into the town to sell flowers and sing to the ladies she makes us more money so than she would by waiting on you Besides she has often other employments which lie under the rose Other employments said Niger why she is too young for them Silence beast said Stratonice you think there is no play but the Corinthian If Nydia were twice the age she is at present she would be equally fit for Vesta poor girl But hark ye Stratonice said Lydon how didst thou come by so gentle and delicate a slave She were more meet for the handmaid of some rich matron of Rome than for thee That is true returned Stratonice and some day or other I shall make my fortune by selling her How came I by Nydia thou askest Ay Why thou seest my slave Staphyla thou rememberest Staphyla Niger Ay a large handed wench with a face like a comic mask How should I forget her by Pluto whose handmaid she doubtless is at this moment Tush brute Well Staphyla died one day and a great loss she was to me and I went into the market to buy me another slave But by the gods they were all grown so dear since I had bought poor Staphyla and money was so scarce that I was about to leave the place in despair when a merchant plucked me by the robe Mistress said he dost thou want a slave cheap I have a child to sell a bargain She is but little and almost an infant it is true but she is quick and quiet docile and clever sings well and is of good blood I assure you Of what country said I Thessalian Now I knew the Thessalians were acute and gentle so I said I would see the girl I found her just as you see her now scarcely smaller and scarcely younger in appearance She looked patient and resigned enough with her hands crossed on her bosom and her eyes downcast I asked the merchant his price it was moderate and I bought her at once The merchant brought her to my house and disappeared in an instant Well my friends guess my astonishment when I found she was blind Ha ha a clever fellow that merchant I ran at once to the magistrates but the rogue was already gone from Pompeii So I was forced to go home in a very ill humor I assure you and the poor girl felt the effects of it too But it was not her fault that she was blind for she had been so from her birth By degrees we got reconciled to our purchase True she had not the strength of Staphyla and was of very little use in the house but she could soon find her way about the town as well as if she had the eyes of Argus and when one morning she brought us home a handful of sesterces which she said she had got from selling some flowers she had gathered in our poor little garden we thought the gods had sent her to us So from that time we let her go out as she likes filling her basket with flowers which she wreathes into garlands after the Thessalian fashion which pleases the gallants and the great people seem to take a fancy to her for they always pay her more than they do any other flower girl and she brings all of it home to us which is more than any other slave would do So I work for myself but I shall soon afford from her earnings to buy me a second Staphyla doubtless the Thessalian kidnapper had stolen the blind girl from gentle parents Besides her skill in the garlands she sings and plays on the cithara which also brings money and lately but that is a secret That is a secret What cried Lydon art thou turned sphinx Sphinx no why sphinx Cease thy gabble good mistress and bring us our meat I am hungry said Sporus impatiently And I too echoed the grim Niger whetting his knife on the palm of his hand The amazon stalked away to the kitchen and soon returned with a tray laden with large pieces of meat half raw for so as now did the heroes of the prize fight imagine they best sustained their hardihood and ferocity they drew round the table with the eyes of famished wolves the meat vanished the wine flowed So leave we those important personages of classic life to follow the steps of Burbo Chapter II TWO WORTHIES IN the earlier times of Rome the priesthood was a profession not of lucre but of honour It was embraced by the noblest citizens it was forbidden to the plebeians Afterwards and long previous to the present date it was equally open to all ranks at least that part of the profession which embraced the flamens or priests not of religion generally but of peculiar gods Even the priest of Jupiter the Flamen Dialis preceded by a lictor and entitled by his office to the entrance of the senate at first the especial dignitary of the patricians was subsequently the choice of the people The less national and less honored deities were usually served by plebeian ministers and many embraced the profession as now the Roman Catholic Christians enter the monastic fraternity less from the impulse of devotion than the suggestions of a calculating poverty Thus Calenus the priest of Isis was of the lowest origin His relations though not his parents were freedmen He had received from them a liberal education and from his father a small patrimony which he had soon exhausted He embraced the priesthood as a last resource from distress Whatever the state emoluments of the sacred profession which at that time were probably small the officers of a popular temple could never complain of the profits of their calling There is no profession so lucrative as that which practises on the superstition of the multitude Calenus had but one surviving relative at Pompeii and that was Burbo Various dark and disreputable ties stronger than those of blood united together their hearts and interests and often the minister of Isis stole disguised and furtively from the supposed austerity of his devotions and gliding through the back door of the retired gladiator a man infamous alike by vices and by profession rejoiced to throw off the last rag of an hypocrisy which but for the dictates of avarice his ruling passion would at all time have sat clumsily upon a nature too brutal for even the mimicry of virtue Wrapped in one of those large mantles which came in use among the Romans in proportion as they dismissed the toga whose ample folds well concealed the form and in which a sort of hood attached to it afforded no less a security to the features Calenus now sat in the small and private chamber of the wine cellar whence a small passage ran at once to that back entrance with which nearly all the houses of Pompeii were furnished Opposite to him sat the sturdy Burbo carefully counting on a table between them a little pile of coins which the priest had just poured from his purse for purses were as common then as now with this difference they were usually better furnished You see said Calenus that we pay you handsomely and you ought to thank me for recommending you to so advantageous a market I do my cousin I do replied Burbo affectionately as he swept the coins into a leathern receptacle which he then deposited in his girdle drawing the buckle round his capacious waist more closely than he was wont to do in the lax hours of his domestic avocations And by Isis Pisis and Nisis or whatever other gods there may be in Egypt my little Nydia is a very Hesperides a garden of gold to me She sings well and plays like a muse returned Calenus those are virtues that he who employs me always pays liberally He is a god cried Burbo enthusiastically every rich man who is generous deserves to be worshipped But come a cup of wine old friend tell me more about it What does she do she is frightened talks of her oath and reveals nothing Nor will I by my right hand I too have taken that terrible oath of secrecy Oath what are oaths to men like us True oaths of a common fashion but this and the stalwart priest shuddered as he spoke Yet he continued in emptying a huge cup of unmixed wine I own to thee that it is not so much the oath that I dread as the vengeance of him who proposed it By the gods he is a mighty sorcerer and could draw my confession from the moon did I dare to make it to her Talk no more of this By Pollux wild as those banquets are which I enjoy with him I am never quite at my ease there I love my boy one jolly hour with thee and one of the plain unsophisticated laughing girls that I meet in this chamber all smoke dried though it be better than whole nights of those magnificent debauches Ho sayest thou so To morrow night please the gods we will have then a snug carousal With all my heart said the priest rubbing his hands and drawing himself nearer to the table At this moment they heard a slight noise at the door as of one feeling the handle The priest lowered the hood over his head Tush whispered the host it is but the blind girl as Nydia opened the door and entered the apartment Ho girl and how durst thou thou lookest pale thou hast kept late revels No matter the young must be always the young said Burbo encouragingly The girl made no answer but she dropped on one of the seats with an air of lassitude Her color went and came rapidly she beat the floor impatiently with her small feet then she suddenly raised her face and said with a determined voice Master you may starve me if you will you may beat me you may threaten me with death but I will go no more to that unholy place How fool said Burbo in a savage voice and his heavy brows met darkly over his fierce and bloodshot eyes how rebellious Take care I have said it said the poor girl crossing her hands on her breast What my modest one sweet vestal thou wilt go no more Very well thou shalt be carried I will raise the city with my cries said she passionately and the color mounted to her brow We will take care of that too thou shalt go gagged Then may the gods help me said Nydia rising I will appeal to the magistrates Thine oath remember said a hollow voice as for the first time Calenus joined in the dialogue At these words a trembling shook the frame of the unfortunate girl she clasped her hands imploringly Wretch that I am she cried and burst violently into sobs Whether or not it was the sound of that vehement sorrow which brought the gentle Stratonice to the spot her grisly form at this moment appeared in the chamber How now what hast thou been doing with my slave brute said she angrily to Burbo Be quiet wife said he in a tone half sullen half timid you want new girdles and fine clothes do you Well then take care of your slave or you may want them long Voe capiti tuo vengeance on thy head wretched one What is this said the hag looking from one to the other Nydia started as by a sudden impulse from the wall against which she had leaned she threw herself at the feet of Stratonice she embraced her knees and looking up at her with those sightless but touching eyes O my mistress sobbed she you are a woman you have had sisters you have been young like me feel for me save me I will go to those horrible feasts no more Stuff said the hag dragging her up rudely by one of those delicate hands fit for no harsher labor than that of weaving the flowers which made her pleasure or her trade stuff these fine scruples are not for slaves Hark ye said Burbo drawing forth his purse and chinking its contents you hear this music wife by Pollux if you do not break in yon colt with a tight rein you will hear it no more The girl is tired said Stratonice nodding to Calenus she will be more docile when you next want her You you who is here cried Nydia casting her eyes round the apartment with so fearful and straining a survey that Calenus rose in alarm from his seat She must see with those eyes muttered he Who is here Speak in heaven s name Ah if you were blind like me you would be less cruel said she and she again burst into tears Take her away said Burbo impatiently I hate these whimperings Come said Stratonice pushing the poor child by the shoulders Nydia drew herself aside with an air to which resolution gave dignity Hear me she said I have served you faithfully I who was brought up Ah my mother my poor mother didst thou dream I should come to this She dashed the tear from her eyes and proceeded Command me in aught else and I will obey but I tell you now hard stern inexorable as you are I tell you that I will go there no more or if I am forced there that I will implore the mercy of the praetor himself I have said it Hear me ye gods I swear The hag s eyes glowed with fire she seized the child by the hair with one hand and raised on high the other that formidable right hand the least blow of which seemed capable to crush the frail and delicate form that trembled in her grasp That thought itself appeared to strike her for she suspended the blow changed her purpose and dragging Nydia to the wall seized from a hook a rope often alas applied to a similar purpose and the next moment the shrill the agonized shrieks of the blind girl rang piercingly through the house Chapter III GLAUCUS MAKES A PURCHASE THAT AFTERWARDS COSTS HIM DEAR HOLLA my brave fellows said Lepidus stooping his head as he entered the low doorway of the house of Burbo We have come to see which of you most honors your lanista The gladiators rose from the table in respect to three gallants known to be among the gayest and richest youths of Pompeii and whose voices were therefore the dispensers of amphitheatrical reputation What fine animals said Clodius to Glaucus worthy to be gladiators It is a pity they are not warriors returned Glaucus A singular thing it was to see the dainty and fastidious Lepidus whom in a banquet a ray of daylight seemed to blind whom in the bath a breeze of air seemed to blast in whom Nature seemed twisted and perverted from every natural impulse and curdled into one dubious thing of effeminacy and art a singular thing was it to see this Lepidus now all eagerness and energy and life patting the vast shoulders of the gladiators with a blanched and girlish hand feeling with a mincing gripe their great brawn and iron muscles all lost in calculating admiration at that manhood which he had spent his life in carefully banishing from himself So have we seen at this day the beardless flutterers of the saloons of London thronging round the heroes of the Fives court so have we seen them admire and gaze and calculate a bet so have we seen them meet together in ludicrous yet in melancholy assemblage the two extremes of civilized society the patrons of pleasure and its slaves vilest of all slaves at once ferocious and mercenary male prostitutes who sell their strength as women their beauty beasts in act but baser than beasts in motive for the last at least do not mangle themselves for money Ha Niger how will you fight said Lepidus and with whom Sporus challenges me said the grim giant we shall fight to the death I hope Ah to be sure grunted Sporus with a twinkle of his small eye He takes the sword I the net and the trident it will be rare sport I hope the survivor will have enough to keep up the dignity of the crown Never fear we ll fill the purse my Hector said Clodius let me see you fight against Niger Glaucus a bet I back Niger I told you so cried Niger exultingly The noble Clodius knows me count yourself dead already my Sporus Clodius took out his tablet A bet ten sestertia What say you So be it said Glaucus But whom have we here I never saw this hero before and he glanced at Lydon whose limbs were slighter than those of his companions and who had something of grace and something even of nobleness in his face which his profession had not yet wholly destroyed It is Lydon a youngster practised only with the wooden sword as yet answered Niger condescendingly But he has the true blood in him and has challenged Tetraides He challenged me said Lydon I accept the offer And how do you fight asked Lepidus Chut my boy wait a while before you contend with Tetraides Lydon smiled disdainfully Is he a citizen or a slave said Clodius A citizen we are all citizens here quoth Niger Stretch out your arm my Lydon said Lepidus with the air of a connoisseur The gladiator with a significant glance at his companions extended an arm which if not so huge in its girth as those of his comrades was so firm in its muscles so beautifully symmetrical in its proportions that the three visitors uttered simultaneously an admiring exclamation Well man what is your weapon said Clodius tablet in hand We are to fight first with the cestus afterwards if both survive with swords returned Tetraides sharply and with an envious scowl With the cestus cried Glaucus there you are wrong Lydon the cestus is the Greek fashion I know it well You should have encouraged flesh for that contest you are far too thin for it avoid the cestus I cannot said Lydon And why I have said because he has challenged me But he will not hold you to the precise weapon My honour holds me returned Lydon proudly I bet on Tetraides two to one at the cestus said Clodius shall it be Lepidus even betting with swords If you give me three to one I will not take the odds said Lepidus Lydon will never come to the swords You are mighty courteous What say you Glaucus said Clodius I will take the odds three to one Ten sestertia to thirty Yes Clodius wrote the bet in his book Pardon me noble sponsor mine said Lydon in a low voice to Glaucus but how much think you the victor will gain How much why perhaps seven sestertia You are sure it will be as much At least But out on you a Greek would have thought of the honour and not the money O Italians everywhere ye are Italians A blush mantled over the bronzed cheek of the gladiator Do not wrong me noble Glaucus I think of both but I should never have been a gladiator but for the money Base mayest thou fall A miser never was a hero I am not a miser said Lydon haughtily and he withdrew to the other end of the room But I don t see Burbo where is Burbo I must talk with Burbo cried Clodius He is within said Niger pointing to the door at the extremity of the room And Stratonice the brave old lass where is she quoth Lepidus Why she was here just before you entered but she heard something that displeased her yonder and vanished Pollux old Burbo had perhaps caught hold of some girl in the back room I heard a female s voice crying out the old dame is as jealous as Juno Ho excellent cried Lepidus laughing Come Clodius let us go shares with Jupiter perhaps he has caught a Leda At this moment a loud cry of pain and terror startled the group Oh spare me spare me I am but a child I am blind is not that punishment enough O Pallas I know that voice it is my poor flower girl exclaimed Glaucus and he darted at once into the quarter whence the cry rose He burst the door he beheld Nydia writhing in the grasp of the infuriate hag the cord already dabbled with blood was raised in the air it was suddenly arrested Fury said Glaucus and with his left hand he caught Nydia from her grasp how dare you use thus a girl one of your own sex a child My Nydia my poor infant Oh is that you is that Glaucus exclaimed the flower girl in a tone almost of transport the tears stood arrested on her cheek she smiled she clung to his breast she kissed his robe as she clung And how dare you pert stranger interfere between a free woman and her slave By the gods despite your fine tunic and your filthy perfumes I doubt whether you are even a Roman citizen my mannikin Fair words mistress fair words said Clodius now entering with Lepidus This is my friend and sworn brother he must be put under shelter of your tongue sweet one it rains stones Give me my slave shrieked the virago placing her mighty grasp on the breast of the Greek Not if all your sister Furies could help you answered Glaucus Fear not sweet Nydia an Athenian never forsook distress Holla said Burbo rising reluctantly What turmoil is all this about a slave Let go the young gentleman wife let him go for his sake the pert thing shall be spared this once So saying he drew or rather dragged off his ferocious help mate Methought when we entered said Clodius there was another man present He is gone For the priest of Isis had indeed thought it high time to vanish Oh a friend of mine a brother cupman a quiet dog who does not love these snarlings said Burbo carelessly But go child you will tear the gentleman s tunic if you cling to him so tight go you are pardoned Oh do not do not forsake me cried Nydia clinging yet closer to the Athenian Moved by her forlorn situation her appeal to him her own innumerable and touching graces the Greek seated himself on one of the rude chairs He held her on his knees he wiped the blood from her shoulders with his long hair he kissed the tears from her cheeks he whispered to her a thousand of those soothing words with which we calm the grief of a child and so beautiful did he seem in his gentle and consoling task that even the fierce heart of Stratonice was touched His presence seemed to shed light over that base and obscene haunt young beautiful glorious he was the emblem of all that earth made most happy comforting one that earth had abandoned Well who could have thought our blind Nydia had been so honored said the virago wiping her heated brow Glaucus looked up at Burbo My good man said he this is your slave she sings well she is accustomed to the care of flowers I wish to make a present of such a slave to a lady Will you sell her to me As he spoke he felt the whole frame of the poor girl tremble with delight she started up she put her disheveled hair from her eyes she looked around as if alas she had the power to see Sell our Nydia no indeed said Stratonice gruffly Nydia sank back with a long sigh and again clasped the robe of her protector Nonsense said Clodius imperiously you must oblige me What man what old dame offend me and your trade is ruined Is not Burbo my kinsman Pansa s client Am I not the oracle of the amphitheatre and its heroes If I say the word break up your wine jars you sell no more Glaucus the slave is yours Burbo scratched his huge head in evident embarrassment The girl is worth her weight in gold to me Name your price I am rich said Glaucus The ancient Italians were like the modern there was nothing they would not sell much less a poor blind girl I paid six sestertia for her she is worth twelve now muttered Stratonice You shall have twenty come to the magistrates at once and then to my house for your money I would not have sold the dear girl for a hundred but to oblige noble Clodius said Burbo whiningly And you will speak to Pansa about the place of designator at the amphitheatre noble Clodius it would just suit me Thou shalt have it said Clodius adding in a whisper to Burbo Yon Greek can make your fortune money runs through him like a sieve mark to day with white chalk my Priam An dabis said Glaucus in the formal question of sale and barter Dabitur answered Burbo Then then I am to go with you with you O happiness murmured Nydia Pretty one yes and thy hardest task henceforth shall be to sing thy Grecian hymns to the loveliest lady in Pompeii The girl sprang from his clasp a change came over her whole face bright the instant before she sighed heavily and then once more taking his hand she said I thought I was to go to your house And so thou shalt for the present come we lose time Chapter IV THE RIVAL OF GLAUCUS PRESSES ONWARD IN THE RACE IONE was one of those brilliant characters which but once or twice flash across our career She united in the highest perfection the rarest of earthly gifts Genius and Beauty No one ever possessed superior intellectual qualities without knowing them the alliteration of modesty and merit is pretty enough but where merit is great the veil of that modesty you admire never disguises its extent from its possessor It is the proud consciousness of certain qualities that it cannot reveal to the everyday world that gives to genius that shy and reserved and troubled air which puzzles and flatters you when you encounter it Ione then knew her genius but with that charming versatility that belongs of right to women she had the faculty so few of a kindred genius in the less malleable sex can claim the faculty to bend and model her graceful intellect to all whom it encountered The sparkling fountain threw its waters alike upon the strand the cavern and the flowers it refreshed it smiled it dazzled everywhere That pride which is the necessary result of superiority she wore easily in her breast it concentred itself in independence She pursued thus her own bright and solitary path She asked no aged matron to direct and guide her she walked alone by the torch of her own unflickering purity She obeyed no tyrannical and absolute custom She moulded custom to her own will but this so delicately and with so feminine a grace so perfect an exemption from error that you could not say she outraged custom but commanded it The wealth of her graces was inexhaustible she beautified the commonest action a word a look from her seemed magic Love her and you entered into a new world you passed from this trite and commonplace earth You were in a land in which your eyes saw everything through an enchanted medium In her presence you felt as if listening to exquisite music you were steeped in that sentiment which has so little of earth in it and which music so well inspires that intoxication which refines and exalts which seizes it is true the senses but gives them the character of the soul She was peculiarly formed then to command and fascinate the less ordinary and the bolder natures of men to love her was to unite two passions that of love and of ambition you aspired when you adored her It was no wonder that she had completely chained and subdued the mysterious but burning soul of the Egyptian a man in whom dwelt the fiercest passions Her beauty and her soul alike enthralled him Set apart himself from the common world he loved that daringness of character which also made itself among common things aloof and alone He did not or he would not see that that very isolation put her yet more from him than from the vulgar Far as the poles far as the night from day his solitude was divided from hers He was solitary from his dark and solemn vices she from her beautiful fancies and her purity of virtue If it was not strange that Ione thus enthralled the Egyptian far less strange was it that she had captured as suddenly as irrevocably the bright and sunny heart of the Athenian The gladness of a temperament which seemed woven from the beams of light had led Glaucus into pleasure He obeyed no more vicious dictates when he wandered into the dissipations of his time than the exhilarating voices of youth and health He threw the brightness of his nature over every abyss and cavern through which he strayed His imagination dazzled him but his heart never was corrupted Of far more penetration than his companions deemed he saw that they sought to prey upon his riches and his youth but he despised wealth save as the means of enjoyment and youth was the great sympathy that united him to them He felt it is true the impulse of nobler thoughts and higher aims than in pleasure could be indulged but the world was one vast prison to which the Sovereign of Rome was the Imperial gaoler and the very virtues which in the free days of Athens would have made him ambitious in the slavery of earth made him inactive and supine For in that unnatural and bloated civilization all that was noble in emulation was forbidden Ambition in the regions of a despotic and luxurious court was but the contest of flattery and craft Avarice had become the sole ambition men desired praetorships and provinces only as the license to pillage and government was but the excuse of rapine It is in small states that glory is most active and pure the more confined the limits of the circle the more ardent the patriotism In small states opinion is concentrated and strong every eye reads your actions your public motives are blended with your private ties every spot in your narrow sphere is crowded with forms familiar since your childhood the applause of your citizens is like the caresses of your friends But in large states the city is but the court the provinces unknown to you unfamiliar in customs perhaps in language have no claim on your patriotism the ancestry of their inhabitants is not yours In the court you desire favor instead of glory at a distance from the court public opinion has vanished from you and self interest has no counterpoise Italy Italy while I write your skies are over me your seas flow beneath my feet listen not to the blind policy which would unite all your crested cities mourning for their republics into one empire false pernicious delusion your only hope of regeneration is in division Florence Milan Venice Genoa may be free once more if each is free But dream not of freedom for the whole while you enslave the parts the heart must be the centre of the system the blood must circulate freely everywhere and in vast communities you behold but a bloated and feeble giant whose brain is imbecile whose limbs are dead and who pays in disease and weakness the penalty of transcending the natural proportions of health and vigour Thus thrown back upon themselves the more ardent qualities of Glaucus found no vent save in that overflowing imagination which gave grace to pleasure and poetry to thought Ease was less despicable than contention with parasites and slaves and luxury could yet be refined though ambition could not be ennobled But all that was best and brightest in his soul woke at once when he knew Ione Here was an empire worthy of demigods to attain here was a glory which the reeking smoke of a foul society could not soil or dim Love in every time in every state can thus find space for its golden altars And tell me if there ever even in the ages most favorable to glory could be a triumph more exalted and elating than the conquest of one noble heart And whether it was that this sentiment inspired him his ideas glowed more brightly his soul seemed more awake and more visible in Ione s presence If natural to love her it was natural that she should return the passion Young brilliant eloquent enamoured and Athenian he was to her as the incarnation of the poetry of her father s land They were not like creatures of a world in which strife and sorrow are the elements they were like things to be seen only in the holiday of nature so glorious and so fresh were their youth their beauty and their love They seemed out of place in the harsh and every day earth they belonged of right to the Saturnian age and the dreams of demigod and nymph It was as if the poetry of life gathered and fed itself in them and in their hearts were concentrated the last rays of the sun of Delos and of Greece But if Ione was independent in her choice of life so was her modest pride proportionably vigilant and easily alarmed The falsehood of the Egyptian was invented by a deep knowledge of her nature The story of coarseness of indelicacy in Glaucus stung her to the quick She felt it a reproach upon her character and her career a punishment above all to her love she felt for the first time how suddenly she had yielded to that love she blushed with shame at a weakness the extent of which she was startled to perceive she imagined it was that weakness which had incurred the contempt of Glaucus she endured the bitterest curse of noble natures humiliation Yet her love perhaps was no less alarmed than her pride If one moment she murmured reproaches upon Glaucus if one moment she renounced she almost hated him at the next she burst into passionate tears her heart yielded to its softness and she said in the bitterness of anguish He despises me he does not love me From the hour the Egyptian had left her she had retired to her most secluded chamber she had shut out her handmaids she had denied herself to the crowds that besieged her door Glaucus was excluded with the rest he wondered but he guessed not why He never attributed to his Ione his queen his goddess that woman like caprice of which the love poets of Italy so unceasingly complain He imagined her in the majesty of her candour above all the arts that torture He was troubled but his hopes were not dimmed for he knew already that he loved and was beloved what more could he desire as an amulet against fear At deepest night then when the streets were hushed and the high moon only beheld his devotions he stole to that temple of his heart her home and wooed her after the beautiful fashion of his country He covered her threshold with the richest garlands in which every flower was a volume of sweet passion and he charmed the long summer night with the sound of the Lydian lute and verses which the inspiration of the moment sufficed to weave But the window above opened not no smile made yet more holy the shining air of night All was still and dark He knew not if his verse was welcome and his suit was heard Yet Ione slept not nor disdained to hear Those soft strains ascended to her chamber they soothed they subdued her While she listened she believed nothing against her lover but when they were stilled at last and his step departed the spell ceased and in the bitterness of her soul she almost conceived in that delicate flattery a new affront I said she was denied to all but there was one exception there was one person who would not be denied assuming over her actions and her house something like the authority of a parent Arbaces for himself claimed an exemption from all the ceremonies observed by others He entered the threshold with the license of one who feels that he is privileged and at home He made his way to her solitude and with that sort of quiet and unapologetic air which seemed to consider the right as a thing of course With all the independence of Ione s character his heart had enabled him to obtain a secret and powerful control over her mind She could not shake it off sometimes she desired to do so but she never actively struggled against it She was fascinated by his serpent eye He arrested he commanded her by the magic of a mind long accustomed to awe and to subdue Utterly unaware of his real character or his hidden love she felt for him the reverence which genius feels for wisdom and virtue for sanctity She regarded him as one of those mighty sages of old who attained to the mysteries of knowledge by an exemption from the passions of their kind She scarcely considered him as a being like herself of the earth but as an oracle at once dark and sacred She did not love him but she feared His presence was unwelcome to her it dimmed her spirit even in its brightest mood he seemed with his chilling and lofty aspect like some eminence which casts a shadow over the sun But she never thought of forbidding his visits She was passive under the influence which created in her breast not the repugnance but something of the stillness of terror Arbaces himself now resolved to exert all his arts to possess himself of that treasure he so burningly coveted He was cheered and elated by his conquests over her brother From the hour in which Apaecides fell beneath the voluptuous sorcery of that fete which we have described he felt his empire over the young priest triumphant and insured He knew that there is no victim so thoroughly subdued as a young and fervent man for the first time delivered to the thraldom of the senses When Apaecides recovered with the morning light from the profound sleep which succeeded to the delirium of wonder and of pleasure he was it is true ashamed terrified appalled His vows of austerity and celibacy echoed in his ear his thirst after holiness had it been quenched at so unhallowed a stream But Arbaces knew well the means by which to confirm his conquest From the arts of pleasure he led the young priest at once to those of his mysterious wisdom He bared to his amazed eyes the initiatory secrets of the sombre philosophy of the Nile those secrets plucked from the stars and the wild chemistry which in those days when Reason herself was but the creature of Imagination might well pass for the lore of a diviner magic He seemed to the young eyes of the priest as a being above mortality and endowed with supernatural gifts That yearning and intense desire for the knowledge which is not of earth which had burned from his boyhood in the heart of the priest was dazzled until it confused and mastered his clearer sense He gave himself to the art which thus addressed at once the two strongest of human passions that of pleasure and that of knowledge He was loth to believe that one so wise could err that one so lofty could stoop to deceive Entangled in the dark web of metaphysical moralities he caught at the excuse by which the Egyptian converted vice into a virtue His pride was insensibly flattered that Arbaces had deigned to rank him with himself to set him apart from the laws which bound the vulgar to make him an august participator both in the mystic studies and the magic fascinations of the Egyptian s solitude The pure and stern lessons of that creed to which Olinthus had sought to make him convert were swept away from his memory by the deluge of new passions And the Egyptian who was versed in the articles of that true faith and who soon learned from his pupil the effect which had been produced upon him by its believers sought not unskilfully to undo that effect by a tone of reasoning half sarcastic and half earnest This faith said he is but a borrowed plagiarism from one of the many allegories invented by our priests of old Observe he added pointing to a hieroglyphical scroll observe in these ancient figures the origin of the Christian s Trinity Here are also three gods the Deity the Spirit and the Son Observe that the epithet of the Son is Saviour observe that the sign by which his human qualities are denoted is the cross Note here too the mystic history of Osiris how he put on death how he lay in the grave and how thus fulfilling a solemn atonement he rose again from the dead In these stories we but design to paint an allegory from the operations of nature and the evolutions of the eternal heavens But the allegory unknown the types themselves have furnished to credulous nations the materials of many creeds They have travelled to the vast plains of India they have mixed themselves up in the visionary speculations of the Greek becoming more and more gross and embodied as they emerge farther from the shadows of their antique origin they have assumed a human and palpable form in this novel faith and the believers of Galilee are but the unconscious repeaters of one of the superstitions of the Nile This was the last argument which completely subdued the priest It was necessary to him as to all to believe in something and undivided and at last unreluctant he surrendered himself to that belief which Arbaces inculcated and which all that was human in passion all that was flattering in vanity all that was alluring in pleasure served to invite to and contributed to confirm This conquest thus easily made the Egyptian could now give himself wholly up to the pursuit of a far dearer and mightier object and he hailed in his success with the brother an omen of his triumph over the sister He had seen Ione on the day following the revel we have witnessed and which was also the day after he had poisoned her mind against his rival The next day and the next he saw her also and each time he laid himself out with consummate art partly to confirm her impression against Glaucus and principally to prepare her for the impressions he desired her to receive The proud Ione took care to conceal the anguish she endured and the pride of woman has an hypocrisy which can deceive the most penetrating and shame the most astute But Arbaces was no less cautious not to recur to a subject which he felt it was most politic to treat as of the lightest importance He knew that by dwelling much upon the fault of a rival you only give him dignity in the eyes of your mistress the wisest plan is neither loudly to hate nor bitterly to contemn the wisest plan is to lower him by an indifference of tone as if you could not dream that he could be loved Your safety is in concealing the wound to your own pride and imperceptibly alarming that of the umpire whose voice is fate Such in all times will be the policy of one who knows the science of the sex it was now the Egyptian s He recurred no more then to the presumption of Glaucus he mentioned his name but not more often than that of Clodius or of Lepidus He affected to class them together as things of a low and ephemeral species as things wanting nothing of the butterfly save its innocence and its grace Sometimes he slightly alluded to some invented debauch in which he declared them companions sometimes he adverted to them as the antipodes of those lofty and spiritual natures to whose order that of Ione belonged Blinded alike by the pride of Ione and perhaps by his own he dreamed not that she already loved but he dreaded lest she might have formed for Glaucus the first fluttering prepossessions that lead to love And secretly he ground his teeth in rage and jealousy when he reflected on the youth the fascinations and the brilliancy of that formidable rival whom he pretended to undervalue It was on the fourth day from the date of the close of the previous book that Arbaces and Ione sat together You wear your veil at home said the Egyptian that is not fair to those whom you honour with your friendship But to Arbaces answered Ione who indeed had cast the veil over her features to conceal eyes red with weeping to Arbaces who looks only to the mind what matters it that the face is concealed I do look only to the mind replied the Egyptian show me then your face for there I shall see it You grow gallant in the air of Pompeii said Ione with a forced tone of gaiety Do you think fair Ione that it is only at Pompeii that I have learned to value you The Egyptian s voice trembled he paused for a moment and then resumed There is a love beautiful Greek which is not the love only of the thoughtless and the young there is a love which sees not with the eyes which hears not with the ears but in which soul is enamoured of soul The countryman of thy ancestors the cave nursed Plato dreamed of such a love his followers have sought to imitate it but it is a love that is not for the herd to echo it is a love that only high and noble natures can conceive it hath nothing in common with the sympathies and ties of coarse affection wrinkles do not revolt it homeliness of feature does not deter it asks youth it is true but it asks it only in the freshness of the emotions it asks beauty it is true but it is the beauty of the thought and of the spirit Such is the love O Ione which is a worthy offering to thee from the cold and the austere Austere and cold thou deemest me such is the love that I venture to lay upon thy shrine thou canst receive it without a blush And its name is friendship replied Ione her answer was innocent yet it sounded like the reproof of one conscious of the design of the speaker Friendship said Arbaces vehemently No that is a word too often profaned to apply to a sentiment so sacred Friendship it is a tie that binds fools and profligates Friendship it is the bond that unites the frivolous hearts of a Glaucus and a Clodius Friendship no that is an affection of earth of vulgar habits and sordid sympathies the feeling of which I speak is borrowed from the stars it partakes of that mystic and ineffable yearning which we feel when we gaze on them it burns yet it purifies it is the lamp of naphtha in the alabaster vase glowing with fragrant odorous but shining only through the purest vessels No it is not love and it is not friendship that Arbaces feels for Ione Give it no name earth has no name for it it is not of earth why debase it with earthly epithets and earthly associations Never before had Arbaces ventured so far yet he felt his ground step by step he knew that he uttered a language which if at this day of affected platonisms it would speak unequivocally to the ears of beauty was at that time strange and unfamiliar to which no precise idea could be attached from which he could imperceptibly advance or recede as occasion suited as hope encouraged or fear deterred Ione trembled though she knew not why her veil hid her features and masked an expression which if seen by the Egyptian would have at once damped and enraged him in fact he never was more displeasing to her the harmonious modulation of the most suasive voice that ever disguised unhallowed thought fell discordantly on her ear Her whole soul was still filled with the image of Glaucus and the accent of tenderness from another only revolted and dismayed yet she did not conceive that any passion more ardent than that platonism which Arbaces expressed lurked beneath his words She thought that he in truth spoke only of the affection and sympathy of the soul but was it not precisely that affection and that sympathy which had made a part of those emotions she felt for Glaucus and could any other footstep than his approach the haunted adytum of her heart Anxious at once to change the conversation she replied therefore with a cold and indifferent voice Whomsoever Arbaces honors with the sentiment of esteem it is natural that his elevated wisdom should color that sentiment with its own hues it is natural that his friendship should be purer than that of others whose pursuits and errors he does not deign to share But tell me Arbaces hast thou seen my brother of late He has not visited me for several days and when I last saw him his manner disturbed and alarmed me much I fear lest he was too precipitate in the severe choice that he has adopted and that he repents an irrevocable step Be cheered Ione replied the Egyptian It is true that some little time since he was troubled and sad of spirit those doubts beset him which were likely to haunt one of that fervent temperament which ever ebbs and flows and vibrates between excitement and exhaustion But he Ione he came to me his anxieties and his distress he sought one who pitied me and loved him I have calmed his mind I have removed his doubts I have taken him from the threshold of Wisdom into its temple and before the majesty of the goddess his soul is hushed and soothed Fear not he will repent no more they who trust themselves to Arbaces never repent but for a moment You rejoice me answered Ione My dear brother in his contentment I am happy The conversation then turned upon lighter subjects the Egyptian exerted himself to please he condescended even to entertain the vast variety of his knowledge enabled him to adorn and light up every subject on which he touched and Ione forgetting the displeasing effect of his former words was carried away despite her sadness by the magic of his intellect Her manner became unrestrained and her language fluent and Arbaces who had waited his opportunity now hastened to seize it You have never seen said he the interior of my home it may amuse you to do so it contains some rooms that may explain to you what you have often asked me to describe the fashion of an Egyptian house not indeed that you will perceive in the poor and minute proportions of Roman architecture the massive strength the vast space the gigantic magnificence or even the domestic construction of the palaces of Thebes and Memphis but something there is here and there that may serve to express to you some notion of that antique civilization which has humanized the world Devote then to the austere friend of your youth one of these bright summer evenings and let me boast that my gloomy mansion has been honored with the presence of the admired Ione Unconscious of the pollutions of the mansion of the danger that awaited her Ione readily assented to the proposal The next evening was fixed for the visit and the Egyptian with a serene countenance and a heart beating with fierce and unholy joy departed Scarce had he gone when another visitor claimed admission But now we return to Glaucus Chapter V THE POOR TORTOISE NEW CHANGES FOR NYDIA THE morning sun shone over the small and odorous garden enclosed within the peristyle of the house of the Athenian He lay reclined sad and listlessly on the smooth grass which intersected the viridarium and a slight canopy stretched above broke the fierce rays of the summer sun When that fairy mansion was first disinterred from the earth they found in the garden the shell of a tortoise that had been its inmate That animal so strange a link in the creation to which Nature seems to have denied all the pleasure of life save life s passive and dream like perception had been the guest of the place for years before Glaucus purchased it for years indeed which went beyond the memory of man and to which tradition assigned an almost incredible date The house had been built and rebuilt its possessors had changed and fluctuated generations had flourished and decayed and still the tortoise dragged on its slow and unsympathizing existence In the earthquake which sixteen years before had overthrown many of the public buildings of the city and scared away the amazed inhabitants the house now inhabited by Glaucus had been terribly shattered The possessors deserted it for many days on their return they cleared away the ruins which encumbered the viridarium and found still the tortoise unharmed and unconscious of the surrounding destruction It seemed to bear a charmed life in its languid blood and imperceptible motions yet it was not so inactive as it seemed it held a regular and monotonous course inch by inch it traversed the little orbit of its domain taking months to accomplish the whole gyration It was a restless voyager that tortoise patiently and with pain did it perform its self appointed journeys evincing no interest in the things around it a philosopher concentrated in itself There was something grand in its solitary selfishness the sun in which it basked the waters poured daily over it the air which it insensibly inhaled were its sole and unfailing luxuries The mild changes of the season in that lovely clime affected it not It covered itself with its shell as the saint in his piety as the sage in his wisdom as the lover in his hope It was impervious to the shocks and mutations of time it was an emblem of time itself slow regular perpetual unwitting of the passions that fret themselves around of the wear and tear of mortality The poor tortoise nothing less than the bursting of volcanoes the convulsions of the riven world could have quenched its sluggish spark The inexorable Death that spared not pomp or beauty passed unheedingly by a thing to which death could bring so insignificant a change For this animal the mercurial and vivid Greek felt all the wonder and affection of contrast He could spend hours in surveying its creeping progress in moralizing over its mechanism He despised it in joy he envied it in sorrow Regarding it now as he lay along the sward its dull mass moving while it seemed motionless the Athenian murmured to himself The eagle dropped a stone from his talons thinking to break thy shell the stone crushed the head of a poet This is the allegory of Fate Dull thing Thou hadst a father and a mother perhaps ages ago thou thyself hadst a mate Did thy parents love or didst thou Did thy slow blood circulate more gladly when thou didst creep to the side of thy wedded one Wert thou capable of affection Could it distress thee if she were away from thy side Couldst thou feel when she was present What would I not give to know the history of thy mailed breast to gaze upon the mechanism of thy faint desires to mark what hair breadth difference separates thy sorrow from thy joy Yet methinks thou wouldst know if Ione were present Thou wouldst feel her coming like a happier air like a gladder sun I envy thee now for thou knowest not that she is absent and I would I could be like thee between the intervals of seeing her What doubt what presentiment haunts me why will she not admit me Days have passed since I heard her voice For the first time life grows flat to me I am as one who is left alone at a banquet the lights dead and the flowers faded Ah Ione couldst thou dream how I adore thee From these enamoured reveries Glaucus was interrupted by the entrance of Nydia She came with her light though cautious step along the marble tablinum She passed the portico and paused at the flowers which bordered the garden She had her water vase in her hand and she sprinkled the thirsting plants which seemed to brighten at her approach She bent to inhale their odor She touched them timidly and caressingly She felt along their stems if any withered leaf or creeping insect marred their beauty And as she hovered from flower to flower with her earnest and youthful countenance and graceful motions you could not have imagined a fitter handmaid for the goddess of the garden Nydia my child said Glaucus At the sound of his voice she paused at once listening blushing breathless with her lips parted her face upturned to catch the direction of the sound she laid down the vase she hastened to him and wonderful it was to see how unerringly she threaded her dark way through the flowers and came by the shortest path to the side of her new lord Nydia said Glaucus tenderly stroking back her long and beautiful hair it is now three days since thou hast been under the protection of my household gods Have they smiled on thee Art thou happy Ah so happy sighed the slave And now continued Glaucus that thou hast recovered somewhat from the hateful recollections of thy former state and now that they have fitted thee touching her broidered tunic with garments more meet for thy delicate shape and now sweet child that thou hast accustomed thyself to a happiness which may the gods grant thee ever I am about to pray at thy hands a boon Oh what can I do for thee said Nydia clasping her hands Listen said Glaucus and young as thou art thou shalt be my confidant Hast thou ever heard the name of Ione The blind girl gasped for breath and turning pale as one of the statues which shone upon them from the peristyle she answered with an effort and after a moment s pause Yes I have heard that she is of Neapolis and beautiful Beautiful her beauty is a thing to dazzle the day Neapolis nay she is Greek by origin Greece only could furnish forth such shapes Nydia I love her I thought so replied Nydia calmly I love and thou shalt tell her so I am about to send thee to her Happy Nydia thou wilt be in her chamber thou wilt drink the music of her voice thou wilt bask in the sunny air of her presence What what wilt thou send me from thee Thou wilt go to Ione answered Glaucus in a tone that said What more canst thou desire Nydia burst into tears Glaucus raising himself drew her towards him with the soothing caresses of a brother My child my Nydia thou weepest in ignorance of the happiness I bestow on thee She is gentle and kind and soft as the breeze of spring She will be a sister to thy youth she will appreciate thy winning talents she will love thy simple graces as none other could for they are like her own Weepest thou still fond fool I will not force thee sweet Wilt thou not do for me this kindness Well if I can serve thee command See I weep no longer I am calm That is my own Nydia continued Glaucus kissing her hand Go then to her if thou art disappointed in her kindness if I have deceived thee return when thou wilt I do not give thee to another I but lend My home ever be thy refuge sweet one Ah would it could shelter all the friendless and distressed But if my heart whispers truly I shall claim thee again soon my child My home and Ione s will become the same and thou shalt dwell with both A shiver passed through the slight frame of the blind girl but she wept no more she was resigned Go then my Nydia to Ione s house they shall show thee the way Take her the fairest flowers thou canst pluck the vase which contains them I will give thee thou must excuse its unworthiness Thou shalt take too with thee the lute that I gave thee yesterday and from which thou knowest so well to awaken the charming spirit Thou shalt give her also this letter in which after a hundred efforts I have embodied something of my thoughts Let thy ear catch every accent every modulation of her voice and tell me when we meet again if its music should flatter me or discourage It is now Nydia some days since I have been admitted to Ione there is something mysterious in this exclusion I am distracted with doubts and fears learn for thou art quick and thy care for me will sharpen tenfold thy acuteness learn the cause of this unkindness speak of me as often as thou canst let my name come ever to thy lips insinuate how I love rather than proclaim it watch if she sighs whilst thou speakest if she answer thee or if she reproves in what accents she reproves Be my friend plead for me and oh how vastly wilt thou overpay the little I have done for thee Thou comprehendest Nydia thou art yet a child have I said more than thou canst understand No And thou wilt serve me Yes Come to me when thou hast gathered the flowers and I will give thee the vase I speak of seek me in the chamber of Leda Pretty one thou dost not grieve now Glaucus I am a slave what business have I with grief or joy Sayest thou so No Nydia be free I give thee freedom enjoy it as thou wilt and pardon me that I reckoned on thy desire to serve me You are offended Oh I would not for that which no freedom can give offend you Glaucus My guardian my saviour my protector forgive the poor blind girl She does not grieve even in leaving thee if she can contribute to thy happiness May the gods bless this grateful heart said Glaucus greatly moved and unconscious of the fires he excited he repeatedly kissed her forehead Thou forgivest me said she and thou wilt talk no more of freedom my happiness is to be thy slave thou hast promised thou wilt not give me to another I have promised And now then I will gather the flowers Silently Nydia took from the hand of Glaucus the costly and jewelled vase in which the flowers vied with each other in hue and fragrance tearlessly she received his parting admonition She paused for a moment when his voice ceased she did not trust herself to reply she sought his hand she raised it to her lips dropped her veil over her face and passed at once from his presence She paused again as she reached the threshold she stretched her hands towards it and murmured Three happy days days of unspeakable delight have I known since I passed thee blessed threshold may peace dwell ever with thee when I am gone And now my heart tears itself from thee and the only sound it utters bids me die Chapter VI THE HAPPY BEAUTY AND THE BLIND SLAVE A SLAVE entered the chamber of Ione A messenger from Glaucus desired to be admitted Ione hesitated an instant She is blind that messenger said the slave she will do her commission to none but thee Base is that heart which does not respect affliction The moment she heard the messenger was blind Ione felt the impossibility of returning a chilling reply Glaucus had chosen a herald that was indeed sacred a herald that could not be denied What can he want with me what message can he send and the heart of Ione beat quick The curtain across the door was withdrawn a soft and echoless step fell upon the marble and Nydia led by one of the attendants entered with her precious gift She stood still a moment as if listening for some sound that might direct her Will the noble Ione said she in a soft and low voice deign to speak that I may know whither to steer these benighted steps and that I may lay my offerings at her feet Fair child said Ione touched and soothingly give not thyself the pain to cross these slippery floors my attendant will bring to me what thou hast to present and she motioned to the handmaid to take the vase I may give these flowers to none but thee answered Nydia and guided by her ear she walked slowly to the place where Ione sat and kneeling when she came before her proffered the vase Ione took it from her hand and placed it on the table at her side She then raised her gently and would have seated her on the couch but the girl modestly resisted I have not yet discharged my office said she and she drew the letter of Glaucus from her vest This will perhaps explain why he who sent me chose so unworthy a messenger to Ione The Neapolitan took the letter with a hand the trembling of which Nydia at once felt and sighed to feel With folded arms and downcast looks she stood before the proud and stately form of Ione no less proud perhaps in her attitude of submission Ione waved her hand and the attendants withdrew she gazed again upon the form of the young slave in surprise and beautiful compassion then retiring a little from her she opened and read the following letter Glaucus to Ione sends more than he dares to utter Is Ione ill thy slaves tell me No and that assurance comforts me Has Glaucus offended Ione ah that question I may not ask from them For five days I have been banished from thy presence Has the sun shone I know it not Has the sky smiled it has had no smile for me My sun and my sky are Ione Do I offend thee Am I too bold Do I say that on the tablet which my tongue has hesitated to breathe Alas it is in thine absence that I feel most the spells by which thou hast subdued me And absence that deprives me of joy brings me courage Thou wilt not see me thou hast banished also the common flatterers that flock around thee Canst thou confound me with them It is not possible Thou knowest too well that I am not of them that their clay is not mine For even were I of the humblest mould the fragrance of the rose has penetrated me and the spirit of thy nature hath passed within me to embalm to sanctify to inspire Have they slandered me to thee Ione Thou wilt not believe them Did the Delphic oracle itself tell me thou wert unworthy I would not believe it and am I less incredulous than thou I think of the last time we met of the song which I sang to thee of the look that thou gavest me in return Disguise it as thou wilt Ione there is something kindred between us and our eyes acknowledged it though our lips were silent Deign to see me to listen to me and after that exclude me if thou wilt I meant not so soon to say I loved But those words rush to my heart they will have way Accept then my homage and my vows We met first at the shrine of Pallas shall we not meet before a softer and a more ancient altar Beautiful adored Ione If my hot youth and my Athenian blood have misguided and allured me they have but taught my wanderings to appreciate the rest the haven they have attained I hang up my dripping robes on the Sea god s shrine I have escaped shipwreck I have found THEE Ione deign to see me thou art gentle to strangers wilt thou be less merciful to those of thine own land I await thy reply Accept the flowers which I send their sweet breath has a language more eloquent than words They take from the sun the odorous they return they are the emblem of the love that receives and repays tenfold the emblem of the heart that drunk thy rays and owes to thee the germ of the treasures that it proffers to thy smile I send these by one whom thou wilt receive for her own sake if not for mine She like us is a stranger her fathers ashes lie under brighter skies but less happy than we she is blind and a slave Poor Nydia I seek as much as possible to repair to her the cruelties of Nature and of Fate in asking permission to place her with thee She is gentle quick and docile She is skilled in music and the song and she is a very Chloris to the flowers She thinks Ione that thou wilt love her if thou dost not send her back to me One word more let me be bold Ione Why thinkest thou so highly of yon dark Egyptian he hath not about him the air of honest men We Greeks learn mankind from our cradle we are not the less profound in that we affect no sombre mien our lips smile but our eyes are grave they observe they note they study Arbaces is not one to be credulously trusted can it be that he hath wronged me to thee I think it for I left him with thee thou sawest how my presence stung him since then thou hast not admitted me Believe nothing that he can say to my disfavor if thou dost tell me so at once for this Ione owes to Glaucus Farewell this letter touches thy hand these characters meet thine eyes shall they be more blessed than he who is their author Once more farewell It seemed to Ione as she read this letter as if a mist had fallen from her eyes What had been the supposed offence of Glaucus that he had not really loved And now plainly and in no dubious terms he confessed that love From that moment his power was fully restored At every tender word in that letter so full of romantic and trustful passion her heart smote her And had she doubted his faith and had she believed another and had she not at least allowed to him the culprit s right to know his crime to plead in his defence the tears rolled down her cheeks she kissed the letter she placed it in her bosom and turning to Nydia who stood in the same place and in the same posture Wilt thou sit my child said she while I write an answer to this letter You will answer it then said Nydia coldly Well the slave that accompanied me will take back your answer For you said Ione stay with me trust me your service shall be light Nydia bowed her head What is your name fair girl They call me Nydia Your country The land of Olympus Thessaly Thou shalt be to me a friend said Ione caressingly as thou art already half a countrywoman Meanwhile I beseech thee stand not on these cold and glassy marbles There now that thou art seated I can leave thee for an instant Ione to Glaucus greeting Come to me Glaucus wrote Ione come to me to morrow I may have been unjust to thee but I will tell thee at least the fault that has been imputed to thy charge Fear not henceforth the Egyptian fear none Thou sayest thou hast expressed too much alas in these hasty words I have already done so Farewell As Ione reappeared with the letter which she did not dare to read after she had written Ah common rashness common timidity of love Nydia started from her seat You have written to Glaucus I have And will he thank the messenger who gives to him thy letter Ione forgot that her companion was blind she blushed from the brow to the neck and remained silent I mean this added Nydia in a calmer tone the lightest word of coldness from thee will sadden him the lightest kindness will rejoice If it be the first let the slave take back thine answer if it be the last let me I will return this evening And why Nydia asked Ione evasively Wouldst thou be the bearer of my letter It is so then said Nydia Ah how could it be otherwise who could be unkind to Glaucus My child said Ione a little more reservedly than before thou speakest warmly Glaucus then is amiable in thine eyes Noble Ione Glaucus has been that to me which neither fortune nor the gods have been a friend The sadness mingled with dignity with which Nydia uttered these simple words affected the beautiful Ione she bent down and kissed her Thou art grateful and deservedly so why should I blush to say that Glaucus is worthy of thy gratitude Go my Nydia take to him thyself this letter but return again If I am from home when thou returnest as this evening perhaps I shall be thy chamber shall be prepared next my own Nydia I have no sister wilt thou be one to me The Thessalian kissed the hand of Ione and then said with some embarrassment One favor fair Ione may I dare to ask it Thou canst not ask what I will not grant replied the Neapolitan They tell me said Nydia that thou art beautiful beyond the loveliness of earth Alas I cannot see that which gladdens the world Wilt thou suffer me then to pass my hand over thy face that is my sole criterion of beauty and I usually guess aright She did not wait for the answer of Ione but as she spoke gently and slowly passed her hand over the bending and half averted features of the Greek features which but one image in the world can yet depicture and recall that image is the mutilated but all wondrous statue in her native city her own Neapolis that Parian face before which all the beauty of the Florentine Venus is poor and earthly that aspect so full of harmony of youth of genius of the soul which modern critics have supposed the representation of Psyche Her touch lingered over the braided hair and polished brow over the downy and damask cheek over the dimpled lip the swan like and whitish neck I know now that thou art beautiful she said and I can picture thee to my darkness henceforth and for ever When Nydia left her Ione sank into a deep but delicious reverie Glaucus then loved her he owned it yes he loved her She drew forth again that dear confession she paused over every word she kissed every line she did not ask why he had been maligned she only felt assured that he had been so She wondered how she had ever believed a syllable against him she wondered how the Egyptian had been enabled to exercise a power against Glaucus she felt a chill creep over her as she again turned to his warning against Arbaces and her secret fear of that gloomy being darkened into awe She was awakened from these thoughts by her maidens who came to announce to her that the hour appointed to visit Arbaces was arrived she started she had forgotten the promise Her first impression was to renounce it her second was to laugh at her own fears of her eldest surviving friend She hastened to add the usual ornaments to her dress and doubtful whether she should yet question the Egyptian more closely with respect to his accusation of Glaucus or whether she should wait till without citing the authority she should insinuate to Glaucus the accusation itself she took her way to the gloomy mansion of Arbaces Chapter VII IONE ENTRAPPED THE MOUSE TRIES TO GNAW THE NET DEAREST Nydia exclaimed Glaucus as he read the letter of Ione whitest robed messenger that ever passed between earth and heaven how how shall I thank thee I am rewarded said the poor Thessalian To morrow to morrow how shall I while the hours till then The enamoured Greek would not let Nydia escape him though she sought several times to leave the chamber he made her recite to him over and over again every syllable of the brief conversation that had taken place between her and Ione a thousand times forgetting her misfortune he questioned her of the looks of the countenance of his beloved and then quickly again excusing his fault he bade her recommence the whole recital which he had thus interrupted The hours thus painful to Nydia passed rapidly and delightfully to him and the twilight had already darkened ere he once more dismissed her to Ione with a fresh letter and with new flowers Scarcely had she gone than Clodius and several of his gay companions broke in upon him they rallied him on his seclusion during the whole day and absence from his customary haunts they invited him to accompany them to the various resorts in that lively city which night and day proffered diversity to pleasure Then as now in the south for no land perhaps losing more of greatness has retained more of custom it was the delight of the Italians to assemble at the evening and under the porticoes of temples or the shade of the groves that interspersed the streets listening to music or the recitals of some inventive tale teller they hailed the rising moon with libations of wine and the melodies of song Glaucus was too happy to be unsocial he longed to cast off the exuberance of joy that oppressed him He willingly accepted the proposal of his comrades and laughingly they sallied out together down the populous and glittering streets In the meantime Nydia once more gained the house of Ione who had long left it she inquired indifferently whither Ione had gone The answer arrested and appalled her To the house of Arbaces of the Egyptian Impossible It is true my little one said the slave who had replied to her question She has known the Egyptian long Long ye gods yet Glaucus loves her murmured Nydia to herself And has asked she aloud has she often visited him before Never till now answered the slave If all the rumored scandal of Pompeii be true it would be better perhaps if she had not ventured there at present But she poor mistress mine hears nothing of that which reaches us the talk of the vestibulum reaches not to the peristyle Never till now repeated Nydia Art thou sure Sure pretty one but what is that to thee or to us Nydia hesitated a moment and then putting down the flowers with which she had been charged she called to the slave who had accompanied her and left the house without saying another word Not till she had got half way back to the house of Glaucus did she break silence and even then she only murmured inly She does not dream she cannot of the dangers into which she has plunged Fool that I am shall I save her yes for I love Glaucus better than myself When she arrived at the house of the Athenian she learnt that he had gone out with a party of his friends and none knew whither He probably would not be home before midnight The Thessalian groaned she sank upon a seat in the hall and covered her face with her hands as if to collect her thoughts There is no time to be lost thought she starting up She turned to the slave who had accompanied her Knowest thou said she if Ione has any relative any intimate friend at Pompeii Why by Jupiter answered the slave art thou silly enough to ask the question Every one in Pompeii knows that Ione has a brother who young and rich has been under the rose I speak so foolish as to become a priest of Isis A priest of Isis O Gods his name Apaecides I know it all muttered Nydia brother and sister then are to be both victims Apaecides yes that was the name I heard in Ha he well then knows the peril that surrounds his sister I will go to him She sprang up at that thought and taking the staff which always guided her steps she hastened to the neighboring shrine of Isis Till she had been under the guardianship of the kindly Greek that staff had sufficed to conduct the poor blind girl from corner to corner of Pompeii Every street every turning in the more frequented parts was familiar to her and as the inhabitants entertained a tender and half superstitious veneration for those subject to her infirmity the passengers had always given way to her timid steps Poor girl she little dreamed that she should ere many days were passed find her blindness her protection and a guide far safer than the keenest eyes But since she had been under the roof of Glaucus he had ordered a slave to accompany her always and the poor devil thus appointed who was somewhat of the fattest and who after having twice performed the journey to Ione s house now saw himself condemned to a third excursion whither the gods only knew hastened after her deploring his fate and solemnly assuring Castor and Pollux that he believed the blind girl had the talaria of Mercury as well as the infirmity of Cupid Nydia however required but little of his assistance to find her way to the popular temple of Isis the space before it was now deserted and she won without obstacle to the sacred rail There is no one here said the fat slave What dost thou want or whom Knowest thou not that the priests do not live in the temple Call out said she impatiently night and day there is always one flamen at least watching in the shrine of Isis The slave called no one appeared Seest thou no one No one Thou mistakest I hear a sigh look again The slave wondering and grumbling cast round his heavy eyes and before one of the altars whose remains still crowd the narrow space he beheld a form bending as in meditation I see a figure said he and by the white garments it is a priest O flamen of Isis cried Nydia servant of the Most Ancient hear me Who calls said a low and melancholy voice One who has no common tidings to impart to a member of your body I come to declare and not to ask oracles With whom wouldst thou confer This is no hour for thy conference depart disturb me not the night is sacred to the gods the day to men Methinks I know thy voice thou art he whom I seek yet I have heard thee speak but once before Art thou not the priest Apaecides I am that man replied the priest emerging from the altar and approaching the rail Thou art the gods be praised Waving her hand to the slave she bade him withdraw to a distance and he who naturally imagined some superstition connected perhaps with the safety of Ione could alone lead her to the temple obeyed and seated himself on the ground at a little distance Hush said she speaking quick and low art thou indeed Apaecides If thou knowest me canst thou not recall my features I am blind answered Nydia my eyes are in my ear and that recognizes thee yet swear that thou art he By the gods I swear it by my right hand and by the moon Hush speak low bend near give me thy hand knowest thou Arbaces Hast thou laid flowers at the feet of the dead Ah thy hand is cold hark yet hast thou taken the awful vow Who art thou whence comest thou pale maiden said Apaecides fearfully I know thee not thine is not the breast on which this head hath lain I have never seen thee before But thou hast heard my voice no matter those recollections it should shame us both to recall Listen thou hast a sister Speak speak what of her Thou knowest the banquets of the dead stranger it pleases thee perhaps to share them would it please thee to have thy sister a partaker Would it please thee that Arbaces was her host O gods he dare not Girl if thou mockest me tremble I will tear thee limb from limb I speak the truth and while I speak Ione is in the halls of Arbaces for the first time his guest Thou knowest if there be peril in that first time Farewell I have fulfilled my charge Stay stay cried the priest passing his wan hand over his brow If this be true what what can be done to save her They may not admit me I know not all the mazes of that intricate mansion O Nemesis justly am I punished I will dismiss yon slave be thou my guide and comrade I will lead thee to the private door of the house I will whisper to thee the word which admits Take some weapon it may be needful Wait an instant said Apaecides retiring into one of the cells that flank the temple and reappearing in a few moments wrapped in a large cloak which was then much worn by all classes and which concealed his sacred dress Now he said grinding his teeth if Arbaces hath dared to but he dare not he dare not Why should I suspect him Is he so base a villain I will not think it yet sophist dark bewilderer that he is O gods protect hush are there gods Yes there is one goddess at least whose voice I can command and that is Vengeance Muttering these disconnected thoughts Apaecides followed by his silent and sightless companion hastened through the most solitary paths to the house of the Egyptian The slave abruptly dismissed by Nydia shrugged his shoulders muttered an adjuration and nothing loath rolled off to his cubiculum Chapter VIII THE SOLITUDE AND SOLILOQUY OF THE EGYPTIAN HIS CHARACTER ANALYSED WE must go back a few hours in the progress of our story 
3557-8341-0000	train-other-500	At the first grey dawn of the day
none	none	 which Glaucus had already marked with white the Egyptian was seated 
3557-8341-0001	train-other-500	sleepless and alone on the summit of the lofty and pyramidal tower which flanked his house A tall parapet around it served as a wall and conspired
none	none	 with the height of the edifice and the gloomy trees that girded the mansion 
3557-8341-0002	train-other-500	to defy the prying eyes of curiosity or observation A table on which lay a scroll filled with mystic figures was before him On high the stars waxed dim and faint
3557-8341-0003	train-other-500	and the shades of night melted from the sterile mountain tops
none	none	 only above Vesuvius there rested a deep and massy cloud which for several days past had gathered darker and more solid over its summit 
3557-8341-0004	train-other-500	The struggle of night and day was more visible over the broad ocean which stretched calm like a gigantic lake bounded by the circling shores that covered with vines and foliage and gleaming here and there with the white walls of sleeping cities
none	none	 sloped to the scarce rippling waves 
3557-8341-0005	train-other-500	It was the hour above all others most sacred to the daring science of the Egyptian the science which would read our changeful destinies in the stars He had filled his scroll
none	none	 he had noted the moment and the sign and leaning upon his hand he had surrendered himself to the thoughts which his calculation excited 
3557-8341-0006	train-other-500	Again do the stars forewarn me Some danger then assuredly awaits me said he slowly some danger violent and sudden in its nature
3557-8341-0007	train-other-500	The stars wear for me the same mocking menace which if our chronicles do not err
none	none	 they once wore for Pyrrhus 
3557-8341-0008	train-other-500	for him doomed to strive for all things to enjoy none all attacking nothing gaining battles without fruit laurels without triumph fame without success at last made craven by his own superstitions
3557-8341-0009	train-other-500	and slain like a dog by a tile from the hand of an old woman Verily the stars flatter when they give me a type in this fool of war when they promise to the ardour of my wisdom the same results as to the madness of his ambition
none	none	 perpetual exercise no certain goal the Sisyphus task the mountain and the stone the stone a gloomy image it reminds me that I am threatened with somewhat of the same death as the Epirote 
3557-8341-0010	train-other-500	Let me look again Beware say the shining prophets how thou passest under ancient roofs or besieged walls
none	none	 or overhanging cliffs a stone hurled from above 
3557-8341-0011	train-other-500	is charged by the curses of destiny against thee And at no distant date from this comes the peril but I cannot of a certainty
none	none	 read the day and hour 
3557-8341-0012	train-other-500	Well if my glass runs low the sands shall sparkle to the last Yet if I escape this peril
none	none	 ay if I escape bright and clear as the moonlight track along the waters glows the rest of my existence 
3557-8341-0013	train-other-500	I see honors happiness success shining upon every billow of the dark gulf beneath which I must sink at last What then with such destinies beyond the peril shall I succumb to the peril
3557-8341-0014	train-other-500	My soul whispers hope it sweeps exultingly beyond the boding hour
none	none	 it revels in the future its own courage is its fittest omen If I were to perish so suddenly and so soon the shadow of death would darken over me and I should feel the icy presentiment of my doom My soul would express in sadness and in gloom its forecast of the dreary Orcus But it smiles it assures me of deliverance As he thus concluded his soliloquy the Egyptian involuntarily rose 
3557-8341-0015	train-other-500	He paced rapidly the narrow space of that star roofed floor and pausing at the parapet looked again upon the grey and melancholy heavens The chills of the faint dawn came refreshingly upon his brow
none	none	 and gradually his mind resumed its natural and collected calm He withdrew his gaze from the stars as one after one they receded into the depths of heaven and his eyes fell over the broad expanse below Dim in the silenced port of the city rose the masts of the galleys along that mart of luxury and of labor was stilled the mighty hum 
3557-8341-0016	train-other-500	No lights save here and there from before the columns of a temple
none	none	 or in the porticoes of the voiceless forum broke the wan and fluctuating light of the struggling morn From the heart of the torpid city so soon to vibrate with a thousand passions there came no sound 
3557-8341-0017	train-other-500	the streams of life circulated not they lay locked under the ice of sleep
none	none	 From the huge space of the amphitheatre 
3557-8341-0018	train-other-500	with its stony seats rising one above the other coiled and round as some slumbering monster rose a thin and ghastly mist which gathered darker and more dark over the scattered foliage that gloomed in its vicinity
3557-8341-0019	train-other-500	The city seemed as after the awful change of seventeen ages it seems now to the traveler a City of the Dead The ocean itself that serene and tideless sea
none	none	 lay scarce less hushed save that from its deep bosom came softened by the distance a faint and regular murmur like the breathing of its sleep and curving far as with outstretched arms into the green and beautiful land it seemed unconsciously to clasp to its breast the cities sloping to its margin 
3557-8341-0020	train-other-500	Stabiae and Herculaneum and Pompeii those children and darlings of the deep Ye slumber said the Egyptian
3557-8341-0021	train-other-500	as he scowled over the cities the boast and flower of Campania ye slumber
none	none	 would it were the eternal repose of death 
3557-8341-0022	train-other-500	As ye now jewels in the crown of empire so once were the cities of the Nile Their greatness hath perished from them they sleep amidst ruins their palaces and their shrines are tombs
3557-8341-0023	train-other-500	the serpent coils in the grass of their streets the lizard basks in their solitary halls By that mysterious law of Nature which humbles one to exalt the other
none	none	 ye have thriven upon their ruins 
3557-8341-0024	train-other-500	thou haughty Rome
none	none	 hast usurped the glories of Sesostris and Semiramis thou art a robber clothing thyself with their spoils And these slaves in thy triumph that I the last son of forgotten monarchs survey below reservoirs of thine all pervading power and luxury I curse as I behold 
3557-8341-0025	train-other-500	The time shall come when Egypt shall be avenged
none	none	 when the barbarian s steed shall make his manger in the Golden House of Nero and thou that hast sown the wind with conquest shalt reap the harvest in the whirlwind of desolation 
3557-8341-0026	train-other-500	As the Egyptian uttered a prediction which fate so fearfully fulfilled
none	none	 a more solemn and boding image of ill omen never occurred to the dreams of painter or of poet 
3557-8341-0027	train-other-500	The morning light which can pale so wanly even the young cheek of beauty gave his majestic and stately features almost the colors of the grave
none	none	 with the dark hair falling massively around them and the dark robes flowing long and loose and the arm outstretched from that lofty eminence 
3557-8341-0028	train-other-500	and the glittering eyes fierce with a savage gladness half prophet and half fiend
none	none	 He turned his gaze from the city and the ocean 
3557-8341-0029	train-other-500	before him lay the vineyards and meadows of the rich Campania The gate and walls ancient half Pelasgic of the city seemed not to bound its extent
3557-8341-0030	train-other-500	Villas and villages stretched on every side up the ascent of Vesuvius not nearly then so steep or so lofty as at present For as Rome itself is built on an exhausted volcano
3557-8341-0031	train-other-500	so in similar security the inhabitants of the South tenanted the green and vine clad places
none	none	 around a volcano whose fires they believed at rest for ever 
3557-8341-0032	train-other-500	From the gate stretched the long street of tombs various in size and architecture by which on that side the city is as yet approached Above all
3557-8341-0033	train-other-500	rode the cloud capped summit of the Dread Mountain with the shadows now dark now light betraying the mossy caverns and ashy rocks which testified the past conflagrations and might have prophesied
3557-8341-0034	train-other-500	but man is blind that which was to come Difficult was it then and there to guess the causes why the tradition of the place wore so gloomy and stern a hue why in those smiling plains
3557-8341-0035	train-other-500	for miles around to Baiae and Misenum
none	none	 the poets had imagined the entrance and thresholds of their hell their Acheron and their fabled Styx 
3557-8341-0036	train-other-500	why in those Phlegrae now laughing with the vine
none	none	 they placed the battles of the gods and supposed the daring Titans to have sought the victory of heaven 
3557-8341-0037	train-other-500	save indeed that yet in yon seared and blasted summit fancy might think to read the characters of the Olympian thunderbolt But it was neither the rugged height of the still volcano
none	none	 nor the fertility of the sloping fields 
3557-8341-0038	train-other-500	nor the melancholy avenue of tombs nor the glittering villas of a polished and luxurious people
none	none	 that now arrested the eye of the Egyptian On one part of the landscape the mountain of Vesuvius descended to the plain in a narrow and uncultivated ridge 
3557-8341-0039	train-other-500	broken here and there by jagged crags and copses of wild foliage At the base of this lay a marshy and unwholesome pool and the intent gaze of Arbaces caught the outline of some living form moving by the marshes
3557-8341-0040	train-other-500	and stooping ever and anon as if to pluck its rank produce Ho said he aloud I have then another companion in these unworldly night watches
none	none	 The witch of Vesuvius is abroad 
3557-8341-0041	train-other-500	What doth she too as the credulous imagine doth she too learn the lore of the great stars Hath she been uttering foul magic to the moon or culling
3557-8341-0042	train-other-500	as her pauses betoken foul herbs from the venomous marsh Well
none	none	 I must see this fellow laborer Whoever strives to know learns that no human lore is despicable Despicable only you ye fat and bloated things slaves of luxury sluggards in thought who cultivating nothing but the barren sense dream that its poor soil can produce alike the myrtle and the laurel No the wise only can enjoy to us only true luxury is given when mind brain invention experience thought learning imagination all contribute like rivers to swell the seas of SENSE Ione As Arbaces uttered that last and charmed word his thoughts sunk at once into a more deep and profound channel His steps paused he took not his eyes from the ground once or twice he smiled joyously and then as he turned from his place of vigil and sought his couch he muttered If death frowns so near I will say at least that I have lived Ione shall be mine The character of Arbaces was one of those intricate and varied webs in which even the mind that sat within it was sometimes confused and perplexed In him the son of a fallen dynasty the outcast of a sunken people was that spirit of discontented pride which ever rankles in one of a sterner mould who feels himself inexorably shut from the sphere in which his fathers shone and to which Nature as well as birth no less entitles himself This sentiment hath no benevolence it wars with society it sees enemies in mankind But with this sentiment did not go its common companion poverty Arbaces possessed wealth which equalled that of most of the Roman nobles and this enabled him to gratify to the utmost the passions which had no outlet in business or ambition Travelling from clime to clime and beholding still Rome everywhere he increased both his hatred of society and his passion for pleasure He was in a vast prison which however he could fill with the ministers of luxury He could not escape from the prison and his only object therefore was to give it the character of the palace The Egyptians from the earliest time were devoted to the joys of sense Arbaces inherited both their appetite for sensuality and the glow of imagination which struck light from its rottenness But still unsocial in his pleasures as in his graver pursuits and brooking neither superior nor equal he admitted few to his companionship save the willing slaves of his profligacy He was the solitary lord of a crowded harem but with all he felt condemned to that satiety which is the constant curse of men whose intellect is above their pursuits and that which once had been the impulse of passion froze down to the ordinance of custom From the disappointments of sense he sought to raise himself by the cultivation of knowledge but as it was not his object to serve mankind so he despised that knowledge which is practical and useful His dark imagination loved to exercise itself in those more visionary and obscure researches which are ever the most delightful to a wayward and solitary mind and to which he himself was invited by the daring pride of his disposition and the mysterious traditions of his clime Dismissing faith in the confused creeds of the heathen world he reposed the greatest faith in the power of human wisdom He did not know perhaps no one in that age distinctly did the limits which Nature imposes upon our discoveries Seeing that the higher we mount in knowledge the more wonders we behold he imagined that Nature not only worked miracles in her ordinary course but that she might by the cabala of some master soul be diverted from that course itself Thus he pursued science across her appointed boundaries into the land of perplexity and shadow From the truths of astronomy he wandered into astrological fallacy from the secrets of chemistry he passed into the spectral labyrinth of magic and he who could be sceptical as to the power of the gods was credulously superstitious as to the power of man The cultivation of magic carried at that day to a singular height among the would be wise was especially Eastern in its origin it was alien to the early philosophy of the Greeks nor had it been received by them with favor until Ostanes who accompanied the army of Xerxes introduced amongst the simple credulities of Hellas the solemn superstitions of Zoroaster Under the Roman emperors it had become however naturalized at Rome a meet subject for Juvenal s fiery wit Intimately connected with magic was the worship of Isis and the Egyptian religion was the means by which was extended the devotion to Egyptian sorcery The theurgic or benevolent magic the goetic or dark and evil necromancy were alike in pre eminent repute during the first century of the Christian era and the marvels of Faustus are not comparable to those of Apollonius Kings courtiers and sages all trembled before the professors of the dread science And not the least remarkable of his tribe was the most formidable and profound Arbaces His fame and his discoveries were known to all the cultivators of magic they even survived himself But it was not by his real name that he was honored by the sorcerer and the sage his real name indeed was unknown in Italy for Arbaces was not a genuinely Egyptian but a Median appellation which in the admixture and unsettlement of the ancient races had become common in the country of the Nile and there were various reasons not only of pride but of policy for in youth he had conspired against the majesty of Rome which induced him to conceal his true name and rank But neither by the name he had borrowed from the Mede nor by that which in the colleges of Egypt would have attested his origin from kings did the cultivators of magic acknowledge the potent master He received from their homage a more mystic appellation and was long remembered in Magna Graecia and the Eastern plain by the name of Hermes the Lord of the Flaming Belt His subtle speculations and boasted attributes of wisdom recorded in various volumes were among those tokens of the curious arts which the Christian converts most joyfully yet most fearfully burnt at Ephesus depriving posterity of the proofs of the cunning of the fiend The conscience of Arbaces was solely of the intellect it was awed by no moral laws If man imposed these checks upon the herd so he believed that man by superior wisdom could raise himself above them If he reasoned I have the genius to impose laws have I not the right to command my own creations Still more have I not the right to control to evade to scorn the fabrications of yet meaner intellects than my own Thus if he were a villain he justified his villainy by what ought to have made him virtuous namely the elevation of his capacities Most men have more or less the passion for power in Arbaces that passion corresponded exactly to his character It was not the passion for an external and brute authority He desired not the purple and the fasces the insignia of vulgar command His youthful ambition once foiled and defeated scorn had supplied its place his pride his contempt for Rome Rome which had become the synonym of the world Rome whose haughty name he regarded with the same disdain as that which Rome herself lavished upon the barbarian did not permit him to aspire to sway over others for that would render him at once the tool or creature of the emperor He the Son of the Great Race of Rameses he execute the orders of and receive his power from another the mere notion filled him with rage But in rejecting an ambition that coveted nominal distinctions he but indulged the more in the ambition to rule the heart Honoring mental power as the greatest of earthly gifts he loved to feel that power palpably in himself by extending it over all whom he encountered Thus had he ever sought the young thus had he ever fascinated and controlled them He loved to find subjects in men s souls to rule over an invisible and immaterial empire had he been less sensual and less wealthy he might have sought to become the founder of a new religion As it was his energies were checked by his pleasures Besides however the vague love of this moral sway vanity so dear to sages he was influenced by a singular and dreamlike devotion to all that belonged to the mystic Land his ancestors had swayed Although he disbelieved in her deities he believed in the allegories they represented or rather he interpreted those allegories anew He loved to keep alive the worship of Egypt because he thus maintained the shadow and the recollection of her power He loaded therefore the altars of Osiris and of Isis with regal donations and was ever anxious to dignify their priesthood by new and wealthy converts The vow taken the priesthood embraced he usually chose the comrades of his pleasures from those whom he made his victims partly because he thus secured to himself their secrecy partly because he thus yet more confirmed to himself his peculiar power Hence the motives of his conduct to Apaecides strengthened as these were in that instance by his passion for Ione He had seldom lived long in one place but as he grew older he grew more wearied of the excitement of new scenes and he had sojourned among the delightful cities of Campania for a period which surprised even himself In fact his pride somewhat crippled his choice of residence His unsuccessful conspiracy excluded him from those burning climes which he deemed of right his own hereditary possession and which now cowered supine and sunken under the wings of the Roman eagle Rome herself was hateful to his indignant soul nor did he love to find his riches rivalled by the minions of the court and cast into comparative poverty by the mighty magnificence of the court itself The Campanian cities proffered to him all that his nature craved the luxuries of an unequalled climate the imaginative refinements of a voluptuous civilization He was removed from the sight of a superior wealth he was without rivals to his riches he was free from the spies of a jealous court As long as he was rich none pried into his conduct He pursued the dark tenour of his way undisturbed and secure It is the curse of sensualists never to love till the pleasures of sense begin to pall their ardent youth is frittered away in countless desires their hearts are exhausted So ever chasing love and taught by a restless imagination to exaggerate perhaps its charms the Egyptian had spent all the glory of his years without attaining the object of his desires The beauty of to morrow succeeded the beauty of to day and the shadows bewildered him in his pursuit of the substance When two years before the present date he beheld Ione he saw for the first time one whom he imagined he could love He stood then upon that bridge of life from which man sees before him distinctly a wasted youth on the one side and the darkness of approaching age upon the other a time in which we are more than ever anxious perhaps to secure to ourselves ere it be yet too late whatever we have been taught to consider necessary to the enjoyment of a life of which the brighter half is gone With an earnestness and a patience which he had never before commanded for his pleasures Arbaces had devoted himself to win the heart of Ione It did not content him to love he desired to be loved In this hope he had watched the expanding youth of the beautiful Neapolitan and knowing the influence that the mind possesses over those who are taught to cultivate the mind he had contributed willingly to form the genius and enlighten the intellect of Ione in the hope that she would be thus able to appreciate what he felt would be his best claim to her affection viz a character which however criminal and perverted was rich in its original elements of strength and grandeur When he felt that character to be acknowledged he willingly allowed nay encouraged her to mix among the idle votaries of pleasure in the belief that her soul fitted for higher commune would miss the companionship of his own and that in comparison with others she would learn to love herself He had forgot that as the sunflower to the sun so youth turns to youth until his jealousy of Glaucus suddenly apprised him of his error From that moment though as we have seen he knew not the extent of his danger a fiercer and more tumultuous direction was given to a passion long controlled Nothing kindles the fire of love like the sprinkling of the anxieties of jealousy it takes then a wilder a more resistless flame it forgets its softness it ceases to be tender it assumes something of the intensity of the ferocity of hate Arbaces resolved to lose no further time upon cautious and perilous preparations he resolved to place an irrevocable barrier between himself and his rivals he resolved to possess himself of the person of Ione not that in his present love so long nursed and fed by hopes purer than those of passion alone he would have been contented with that mere possession He desired the heart the soul no less than the beauty of Ione but he imagined that once separated by a daring crime from the rest of mankind once bound to Ione by a tie that memory could not break she would be driven to concentrate her thoughts in him that his arts would complete his conquest and that according to the true moral of the Roman and the Sabine the empire obtained by force would be cemented by gentler means This resolution was yet more confirmed in him by his belief in the prophecies of the stars they had long foretold to him this year and even the present month as the epoch of some dread disaster menacing life itself He was driven to a certain and limited date He resolved to crowd monarch like on his funeral pyre all that his soul held most dear In his own words if he were to die he resolved to feel that he had lived and that Ione should be his own Chapter IX 
3557-8342-0000	train-other-500	WHAT BECOMES OF IONE IN THE HOUSE OF ARBACES
none	none	 THE FIRST SIGNAL OF THE WRATH OF THE DREAD FOE WHEN Ione entered the spacious hall of the Egyptian the same awe which had crept over her brother impressed itself also upon her there seemed to her as to him something ominous and warning in the still and mournful faces of those dread Theban monsters 
3557-8342-0001	train-other-500	whose majestic and passionless features the marble so well portrayed
none	none	 Their look with the reach of past ages was wise And the soul of eternity thought in their eyes The tall AEthiopian slave grinned as he admitted her and motioned to her to proceed Half way up the hall she was met by Arbaces himself in festive robes which glittered with jewels 
3557-8342-0003	train-other-500	Although it was broad day without the mansion
none	none	 according to the practice of the luxurious was artificially darkened and the lamps cast their still and odor giving light over the rich floors and ivory roofs 
3557-8342-0004	train-other-500	Beautiful Ione said Arbaces as he bent to touch her hand it is you that have eclipsed the day it is your eyes that light up the halls it is your breath which fills them with perfumes
3557-8342-0005	train-other-500	You must not talk to me thus said Ione smiling you forget that your lore has sufficiently instructed my mind to render these graceful flatteries to my person unwelcome It was you who taught me to disdain adulation
3557-8342-0006	train-other-500	will you unteach your pupil There was something so frank and charming in the manner of Ione
none	none	 as she thus spoke that the Egyptian was more than ever enamoured and more than ever disposed to renew the offence he had committed 
3557-8342-0007	train-other-500	he however
none	none	 answered quickly and gaily and hastened to renew the conversation 
3557-8342-0008	train-other-500	He led her through the various chambers of a house which seemed to contain to her eyes
none	none	 inexperienced to other splendor than the minute elegance of Campanian cities 
3557-8342-0009	train-other-500	the treasures of the world In the walls were set pictures of inestimable art the lights shone over statues of the noblest age of Greece Cabinets of gems each cabinet itself a gem
3557-8342-0010	train-other-500	filled up the interstices of the columns the most precious woods lined the thresholds and composed the doors
none	none	 gold and jewels seemed lavished all around 
3557-8342-0011	train-other-500	Sometimes they were alone in these rooms sometimes they passed through silent rows of slaves who kneeling as she passed
none	none	 proffered to her offerings of bracelets of chains 
3557-8342-0012	train-other-500	of gems which the Egyptian
none	none	 vainly entreated her to receive I have often heard 
3557-8342-0014	train-other-500	said she wonderingly that you were rich but I never dreamed of the amount of your wealth Would I could coin it all
none	none	 replied the Egyptian into one crown which I might place upon that snowy brow Alas the weight would crush me I should be a second Tarpeia answered Ione 
3557-8342-0015	train-other-500	laughingly But thou dost not disdain riches O Ione they know not what life is capable of who are not wealthy Gold is the great magician of earth it realizes our dreams
none	none	 it gives them the power of a god there is a grandeur a sublimity in its possession it is the mightiest yet the most obedient of our slaves The artful Arbaces sought to dazzle the young Neapolitan 
3557-8342-0016	train-other-500	by his treasures and his eloquence
none	none	 he sought to awaken in her the desire to be mistress of what she surveyed he hoped that she would confound the owner with the possessions and that the charms of his wealth would be reflected on himself Meanwhile Ione was secretly somewhat uneasy at the gallantries which escaped from those lips 
3557-8342-0018	train-other-500	which till lately had seemed to disdain the common homage we pay to beauty and with that delicate subtlety which woman alone possesses she sought to ward off shafts deliberately aimed and to laugh or to talk away the meaning from his warming language
3557-8342-0019	train-other-500	Nothing in the world is more pretty than that same species of defence
none	none	 it is the charm of the African necromancer who professed with a feather to turn aside the winds The Egyptian was intoxicated and subdued by her grace even more than by her beauty 
3557-8342-0020	train-other-500	it was with difficulty that he suppressed his emotions alas
none	none	 the feather was only powerful against the summer breezes it would be the sport of the storm 
3557-8342-0021	train-other-500	Suddenly as they stood in one hall
none	none	 which was surrounded by draperies of silver and white the Egyptian clapped his hands 
3557-8342-0022	train-other-500	and as if by enchantment a banquet rose from the floor a couch or throne
none	none	 with a crimson canopy 
3557-8342-0023	train-other-500	ascended simultaneously at the feet of Ione and at the same instant from behind the curtains swelled the invisible and softest music Arbaces placed himself at the feet of Ione and children
none	none	 young and beautiful as Loves ministered to the feast The feast was over 
3557-8342-0024	train-other-500	the music sank into a low and subdued strain and Arbaces thus addressed his beautiful guest Hast thou never in this dark and uncertain world hast thou never aspired my pupil to look beyond
none	none	 hast thou never wished to put aside the veil of futurity and to behold on the shores of Fate the shadowy images of things to be For it is not the past alone that has its ghosts 
3557-8342-0025	train-other-500	each event to come has also its spectrum its shade when the hour arrives life enters it the shadow becomes corporeal and walks the world Thus in the land beyond the grave
3557-8342-0026	train-other-500	are ever two impalpable and spiritual hosts
none	none	 the things to be the things that have been If by our wisdom we can penetrate that land 
3557-8342-0027	train-other-500	we see the one as the other and learn as I have learned not alone the mysteries of the dead but also the destiny of the living As thou hast learned Can wisdom attain so far
3557-8342-0028	train-other-500	Wilt thou prove my knowledge Ione and behold the representation of thine own fate
none	none	 It is a drama more striking than those of AEschylus it is one I have prepared for thee if thou wilt see the shadows perform their part 
3557-8342-0029	train-other-500	The Neapolitan trembled she thought of Glaucus and sighed as well as trembled were their destinies to be united Half incredulous half believing half awed
none	none	 half alarmed by the words of her strange host she remained for some moments silent and then answered 
3557-8342-0030	train-other-500	It may revolt it may terrify
none	none	 the knowledge of the future will perhaps only embitter the present 
3557-8342-0031	train-other-500	Not so Ione I have myself looked upon thy future lot and the ghosts of thy Future bask in the gardens of Elysium amidst the asphodel and the rose they prepare the garlands of thy sweet destiny
3557-8342-0032	train-other-500	and the Fates so harsh to others weave only for thee the web of happiness and love Wilt thou then come and behold thy doom so that thou mayest enjoy it beforehand
3557-8342-0033	train-other-500	Again the heart of Ione murmured Glaucus
none	none	 she uttered a half audible assent the Egyptian rose and taking her by the hand he led her across the banquet room 
3557-8342-0034	train-other-500	the curtains withdrew as by magic hands
none	none	 and the music broke forth in a louder and gladder strain they passed a row of columns on either side of which fountains cast aloft their fragrant waters 
3557-8342-0035	train-other-500	they descended by broad and easy steps into a garden
none	none	 The eve had commenced the moon was already high in heaven and those sweet flowers that sleep by day and fill with ineffable odorous the airs of night were thickly scattered amidst alleys cut through the star lit foliage 
3557-8342-0036	train-other-500	or gathered in baskets lay like offerings at the feet of the frequent statues that gleamed along their path Whither wouldst thou lead me Arbaces said Ione wonderingly
3557-8342-0037	train-other-500	But yonder said he
none	none	 pointing to a small building which stood at the end of the vista It is a temple consecrated to the Fates 
3557-8342-0038	train-other-500	our rites require such holy ground They passed into a narrow hall at the end of which hung a sable curtain Arbaces lifted it Ione entered and found herself in total darkness
none	none	 Be not alarmed said the Egyptian the light will rise instantly 
3557-8342-0039	train-other-500	While he so spoke a soft and warm and gradual light diffused itself around as it spread over each object
none	none	 Ione perceived that she was in an apartment of moderate size 
3557-8342-0040	train-other-500	hung everywhere with black
none	none	 a couch with draperies of the same hue was beside her In the centre of the room was a small altar 
3557-8342-0041	train-other-500	on which stood a tripod of bronze
none	none	 At one side upon a lofty column of granite 
3557-8342-0042	train-other-500	was a colossal head of the blackest marble which she perceived by the crown of wheat ears that encircled the brow represented the great Egyptian goddess Arbaces stood before the altar
3557-8342-0043	train-other-500	he had laid his garland on the shrine
none	none	 and seemed occupied with pouring into the tripod the contents of a brazen vase 
3557-8342-0044	train-other-500	suddenly from that tripod leaped into life a blue quick darting
none	none	 irregular flame the Egyptian drew back to the side of Ione and muttered some words in a language unfamiliar to her ear 
3557-8342-0045	train-other-500	the curtain at the back of the altar waved tremulously to and fro it parted slowly and in the aperture which was thus made Ione beheld an indistinct and pale landscape which gradually grew brighter
none	none	 and clearer as she gazed 
3557-8342-0046	train-other-500	at length she discovered plainly trees and rivers and meadows
none	none	 and all the beautiful diversity of the richest earth 
3557-8342-0047	train-other-500	At length before the landscape a dim shadow glided it rested opposite to Ione slowly the same charm seemed to operate upon it
none	none	 as over the rest of the scene it took form and shape and lo in its feature and in its form Ione beheld herself Then the scene behind the spectre faded away and was succeeded by the representation of a gorgeous palace a throne was raised in the centre of its hall the dim forms of slaves and guards were ranged around it and a pale hand held over the throne the likeness of a diadem A new actor now appeared he was clothed from head to foot in a dark robe his face was concealed he knelt at the feet of the shadowy Ione he clasped her hand he pointed to the throne 
3557-8342-0048	train-other-500	as if to invite her to ascend it The Neapolitan s heart beat violently Shall the shadow disclose itself whispered a voice beside her the voice of Arbaces
3557-8342-0049	train-other-500	Ah yes
none	none	 answered Ione 
3557-8342-0050	train-other-500	softly Arbaces raised his hand the spectre seemed to drop the mantle that concealed its form
none	none	 and Ione shrieked it was Arbaces himself that thus knelt before her 
3557-8342-0051	train-other-500	This is indeed thy fate
none	none	 whispered again the Egyptian s voice in her ear 
3557-8342-0052	train-other-500	And thou art destined to be the bride of Arbaces
none	none	 Ione started the black curtain closed over the phantasmagoria 
3557-8342-0053	train-other-500	and Arbaces himself the real the living Arbaces was at her feet Oh Ione said he passionately gazing upon her listen to one who has long struggled vainly with his love
none	none	 I adore thee The Fates do not lie thou art destined to be mine I have sought the world around and found none like thee From my youth upward I have sighed for such as thou art 
3557-8342-0054	train-other-500	I have dreamed till I saw thee I wake and I behold thee
none	none	 Turn not away from me Ione 
3557-8342-0055	train-other-500	think not of me as thou hast thought
none	none	 I am not that being 
3557-8342-0056	train-other-500	cold insensate and morose which I have seemed to thee Never woman had lover so devoted so passionate as I will be to Ione Do not struggle in my clasp see I release thy hand
3557-8342-0057	train-other-500	Take it from me if thou wilt well be it so But do not reject me Ione do not rashly reject judge of thy power over him whom thou canst thus transform I
3557-8342-0058	train-other-500	who never knelt to mortal being kneel to thee I who have commanded fate
none	none	 receive from thee my own 
3557-8342-0059	train-other-500	Ione tremble not thou art my queen my goddess be my bride All the wishes thou canst form shall be fulfilled The ends of the earth shall minister to thee pomp
3557-8342-0060	train-other-500	power luxury shall be thy slaves Arbaces shall have no ambition save the pride of obeying thee Ione turn upon me those eyes shed upon me thy smile Dark is my soul when thy face is hid from it
3557-8342-0061	train-other-500	shine over me my sun my heaven my daylight Ione Ione do not reject my love Alone and in the power of this singular and fearful man
none	none	 Ione was not yet terrified the respect of his language 
3557-8342-0062	train-other-500	the softness of his voice reassured her and in her own purity she felt protection But she was confused astonished
3557-8342-0063	train-other-500	it was some moments before she could recover the power of reply Rise Arbaces said she at length
none	none	 and she resigned to him once more her hand which she as quickly withdrew again when she felt upon it the burning pressure of his lips 
3557-8342-0064	train-other-500	Rise and if thou art serious if thy language be in earnest
none	none	 If 
3557-8342-0065	train-other-500	said he tenderly Well then listen to me you have been my guardian my friend my monitor
none	none	 for this new character I was not prepared think not she added quickly as she saw his dark eyes glitter with the fierceness of his passion think not that I scorn 
3557-8342-0067	train-other-500	that I am untouched that I am not honored by this homage but say canst thou hear me calmly Ay though thy words were lightning and could blast me
3557-8342-0068	train-other-500	I love another said Ione blushingly but in a firm voice By the gods by hell shouted Arbaces rising to his fullest height
3557-8342-0069	train-other-500	dare not tell me that dare not mock me it is impossible Whom hast thou seen whom known Oh Ione it is thy woman s invention thy woman s art that speaks
none	none	 thou wouldst gain time I have surprised I have terrified thee 
3557-8342-0070	train-other-500	Do with me as thou wilt say that thou lovest not me but say not that thou lovest another Alas began Ione and then appalled before his sudden and unlooked for violence
none	none	 she burst into tears 
3557-8342-0071	train-other-500	Arbaces came nearer to her his breath glowed fiercely on her cheek he wound his arms round her she sprang from his embrace In the struggle a tablet fell from her bosom on the ground
3557-8342-0072	train-other-500	Arbaces perceived and seized it it was the letter that morning received from Glaucus Ione sank upon the couch half dead with terror
3557-8342-0073	train-other-500	Rapidly the eyes of Arbaces ran over the writing the Neapolitan did not dare to gaze upon him she did not see the deadly paleness that came over his countenance
none	none	 she marked not his withering frown nor the quivering of his lip nor the convulsions that heaved his breast 
3557-8342-0074	train-other-500	He read it to the end and then as the letter fell from his hand he said
none	none	 in a voice of deceitful calmness 
3557-8342-0075	train-other-500	Is the writer of this the man thou lovest Ione sobbed but answered not Speak he rather shrieked than said It is it is
3557-8342-0076	train-other-500	And his name it is written here his name is Glaucus Ione clasping her hands looked round as for succour or escape
none	none	 Then hear me 
3557-8342-0077	train-other-500	said Arbaces sinking his voice into a whisper thou shalt go to thy tomb rather than to his arms What thinkest thou Arbaces will brook a rival such as this puny Greek What
3557-8342-0078	train-other-500	thinkest thou that he has watched the fruit ripen to yield it to another Pretty fool no Thou art mine all only mine and thus thus I seize and claim thee
none	none	 As he spoke he caught Ione in his arms and in that ferocious grasp 
3557-8342-0079	train-other-500	was all the energy less of love than of revenge
none	none	 But to Ione despair gave supernatural strength 
3557-8342-0080	train-other-500	she again tore herself from him
none	none	 she rushed to that part of the room by which she had entered 
3557-8342-0081	train-other-500	she half withdrew the curtain he had seized her again she broke away from him and fell
none	none	 exhausted and with a loud shriek at the base of the column which supported the head of the Egyptian goddess Arbaces paused for a moment 
3557-8342-0082	train-other-500	as if to regain his breath and thence once more darted upon his prey At that instant the curtain was rudely torn aside the Egyptian felt a fierce and strong grasp upon his shoulder
none	none	 He turned he beheld before him the flashing eyes of Glaucus 
3557-8342-0083	train-other-500	and the pale worn but menacing
none	none	 countenance of Apaecides 
3557-8342-0084	train-other-500	Ah he muttered as he glared from one to the other what Fury hath sent ye hither Ate
none	none	 answered Glaucus and he closed at once with the Egyptian Meanwhile Apaecides raised his sister 
3557-8342-0085	train-other-500	now lifeless from the ground his strength exhausted by a mind long overwrought did not suffice to bear her away light and delicate though her shape he placed her therefore on the couch
3557-8342-0086	train-other-500	and stood over her with a brandishing knife watching the contest between Glaucus and the Egyptian

WORLD WAS WROUGHT IT was early noon and the forum was crowded alike with the busy and the idle As at Paris at this day so at that time in the cities of Italy men lived almost wholly out of doors the public buildings the forum the porticoes the baths the temples themselves might be considered their real homes it was no wonder that they decorated so gorgeously these favorite places of resort they felt for them a sort of domestic affection as well as a public pride And animated was indeed the aspect of the forum of Pompeii at that time Along its broad pavement composed of large flags of marble were assembled various groups conversing in that energetic fashion which appropriates a gesture to every word and which is still the characteristic of the people of the south Here in seven stalls on one side the colonnade sat the money changers with their glittering heaps before them and merchants and seamen in various costumes crowding round their stalls On one side several men in long togas were seen bustling rapidly up to a stately edifice where the magistrates administered justice these were the lawyers active chattering joking and punning as you may find them at this day in Westminster In the centre of the space pedestals supported various statues of which the most remarkable was the stately form of Cicero Around the court ran a regular and symmetrical colonnade of Doric architecture and there several whose business drew them early to the place were taking the slight morning repast which made an Italian breakfast talking vehemently on the earthquake of the preceding night as they dipped pieces of bread in their cups of diluted wine In the open space too you might perceive various petty traders exercising the arts of their calling Here one man was holding out ribands to a fair dame from the country another man was vaunting to a stout farmer the excellence of his shoes a third a kind of stall restaurateur still so common in the Italian cities was supplying many a hungry mouth with hot messes from his small and itinerant stove while contrast strongly typical of the mingled bustle and intellect of the time close by a schoolmaster was expounding to his puzzled pupils the elements of the Latin grammar A gallery above the portico which was ascended by small wooden staircases had also its throng though as here the immediate business of the place was mainly carried on its groups wore a more quiet and serious air Every now and then the crowd below respectfully gave way as some senator swept along to the Temple of Jupiter which filled up one side of the forum and was the senators hall of meeting nodding with ostentatious condescension to such of his friends or clients as he distinguished amongst the throng Mingling amidst the gay dresses of the better orders you saw the hardy forms of the neighboring farmers as they made their way to the public granaries Hard by the temple you caught a view of the triumphal arch and the long street beyond swarming with inhabitants in one of the niches of the arch a fountain played cheerily sparkling in the sunbeams and above its cornice rose the bronzed and equestrian statue of Caligula strongly contrasting the gay summer skies Behind the stalls of the money changers was that building now called the Pantheon and a crowd of the poorer Pompeians passed through the small vestibule which admitted to the interior with panniers under their arms pressing on towards a platform placed between two columns where such provisions as the priests had rescued from sacrifice were exposed for sale At one of the public edifices appropriated to the business of the city workmen were employed upon the columns and you heard the noise of their labor every now and then rising above the hum of the multitude the columns are unfinished to this day All then united nothing could exceed in variety the costumes the ranks the manners the occupations of the crowd nothing could exceed the bustle the gaiety the animation where pleasure and commerce idleness and labor avarice and ambition mingled in one gulf their motley rushing yet harmonius streams Facing the steps of the Temple of Jupiter with folded arms and a knit and contemptuous brow stood a man of about fifty years of age His dress was remarkably plain not so much from its material as from the absence of all those ornaments which were worn by the Pompeians of every rank partly from the love of show partly also because they were chiefly wrought into those shapes deemed most efficacious in resisting the assaults of magic and the influence of the evil eye His forehead was high and bald the few locks that remained at the back of the head were concealed by a sort of cowl which made a part of his cloak to be raised or lowered at pleasure and was now drawn half way over the head as a protection from the rays of the sun The color of his garments was brown no popular hue with the Pompeians all the usual admixtures of scarlet or purple seemed carefully excluded His belt or girdle contained a small receptacle for ink which hooked on to the girdle a stilus or implement of writing and tablets of no ordinary size What was rather remarkable the cincture held no purse which was the almost indispensable appurtenance of the girdle even when that purse had the misfortune to be empty It was not often that the gay and egotistical Pompeians busied themselves with observing the countenances and actions of their neighbors but there was that in the lip and eye of this bystander so remarkably bitter and disdainful as he surveyed the religious procession sweeping up the stairs of the temple that it could not fail to arrest the notice of many Who is yon cynic asked a merchant of his companion a jeweller It is Olinthus replied the jeweller a reputed Nazarene The merchant shuddered A dread sect said he in a whispered and fearful voice It is said that when they meet at nights they always commence their ceremonies by the murder of a new born babe they profess a community of goods too the wretches A community of goods What would become of merchants or jewellers either if such notions were in fashion That is very true said the jeweller besides they wear no jewels they mutter imprecations when they see a serpent and at Pompeii all our ornaments are serpentine Do but observe said a third who was a fabricant of bronze how yon Nazarene scowls at the piety of the sacrificial procession He is murmuring curses on the temple be sure Do you know Celcinus that this fellow passing by my shop the other day and seeing me employed on a statue of Minerva told me with a frown that had it been marble he would have broken it but the bronze was too strong for him Break a goddess said I A goddess answered the atheist it is a demon an evil spirit Then he passed on his way cursing Are such things to be borne What marvel that the earth heaved so fearfully last night anxious to reject the atheist from her bosom An atheist do I say worse still a scorner of the Fine Arts Woe to us fabricants of bronze if such fellows as this give the law to society These are the incendiaries that burnt Rome under Nero groaned the jeweller While such were the friendly remarks provoked by the air and faith of the Nazarene Olinthus himself became sensible of the effect he was producing he turned his eyes round and observed the intent faces of the accumulating throng whispering as they gazed and surveying them for a moment with an expression first of defiance and afterwards of compassion he gathered his cloak round him and passed on muttering audibly Deluded idolaters did not last night s convulsion warn ye Alas how will ye meet the last day The crowd that heard these boding words gave them different interpretations according to their different shades of ignorance and of fear all however concurred in imagining them to convey some awful imprecation They regarded the Christian as the enemy of mankind the epithets they lavished upon him of which Atheist was the most favored and frequent may serve perhaps to warn us believers of that same creed now triumphant how we indulge the persecution of opinion Olinthus then underwent and how we apply to those whose notions differ from our own the terms at that day lavished on the fathers of our faith As Olinthus stalked through the crowd and gained one of the more private places of egress from the forum he perceived gazing upon him a pale and earnest countenance which he was not slow to recognize Wrapped in a pallium that partially concealed his sacred robes the young Apaecides surveyed the disciple of that new and mysterious creed to which at one time he had been half a convert Is he too an impostor Does this man so plain and simple in life in garb in mien does he too like Arbaces make austerity the robe of the sensualist Does the veil of Vesta hide the vices of the prostitute Olinthus accustomed to men of all classes and combining with the enthusiasm of his faith a profound experience of his kind guessed perhaps by the index of the countenance something of what passed within the breast of the priest He met the survey of Apaecides with a steady eye and a brow of serene and open candour Peace be with thee said he saluting Apaecides Peace echoed the priest in so hollow a tone that it went at once to the heart of the Nazarene In that wish continued Olinthus all good things are combined without virtue thou canst not have peace Like the rainbow Peace rests upon the earth but its arch is lost in heaven Heaven bathes it in hues of light it springs up amidst tears and clouds it is a reflection of the Eternal Sun it is an assurance of calm it is the sign of a great covenant between Man and God Such peace O young man is the smile of the soul it is an emanation from the distant orb of immortal light PEACE be with you Alas began Apaecides when he caught the gaze of the curious loiterers inquisitive to know what could possibly be the theme of conversation between a reputed Nazarene and a priest of Isis He stopped short and then added in a low tone We cannot converse here I will follow thee to the banks of the river there is a walk which at this time is usually deserted and solitary Olinthus bowed assent He passed through the streets with a hasty step but a quick and observant eye Every now and then he exchanged a significant glance a slight sign with some passenger whose garb usually betokened the wearer to belong to the humbler classes for Christianity was in this the type of all other and less mighty revolutions the grain of mustard seed was in the heart of the lowly Amidst the huts of poverty and labor the vast stream which afterwards poured its broad waters beside the cities and palaces of earth took its neglected source Chapter II THE NOONDAY EXCURSION ON THE CAMPANIAN SEAS BUT tell me Glaucus said Ione as they glided down the rippling Sarnus in their boat of pleasure how camest thou with Apaecides to my rescue from that bad man Ask Nydia yonder answered the Athenian pointing to the blind girl who sat at a little distance from them leaning pensively over her lyre she must have thy thanks not we It seems that she came to my house and finding me from home sought thy brother in his temple he accompanied her to Arbaces on their way they encountered me with a company of friends whom thy kind letter had given me a spirit cheerful enough to join Nydia s quick ear detected my voice a few words sufficed to make me the companion of Apaecides I told not my associates why I left them could I trust thy name to their light tongues and gossiping opinion Nydia led us to the garden gate by which we afterwards bore thee we entered and were about to plunge into the mysteries of that evil house when we heard thy cry in another direction Thou knowest the rest Ione blushed deeply She then raised her eyes to those of Glaucus and he felt all the thanks she could not utter Come hither my Nydia said she tenderly to the Thessalian Did I not tell thee that thou shouldst be my sister and friend Hast thou not already been more my guardian my preserver It is nothing answered Nydia coldly and without stirring Ah I forgot continued Ione I should come to thee and she moved along the benches till she reached the place where Nydia sat and flinging her arms caressingly round her covered her cheeks with kisses Nydia was that morning paler than her wont and her countenance grew even more wan and colorless as she submitted to the embrace of the beautiful Neapolitan But how camest thou Nydia whispered Ione to surmise so faithfully the danger I was exposed to Didst thou know aught of the Egyptian Yes I knew of his vices And how Noble Ione I have been a slave to the vicious those whom I served were his minions And thou hast entered his house since thou knewest so well that private entrance I have played on my lyre to Arbaces answered the Thessalian with embarrassment And thou hast escaped the contagion from which thou hast saved Ione returned the Neapolitan in a voice too low for the ear of Glaucus Noble Ione I have neither beauty nor station I am a child and a slave and blind The despicable are ever safe It was with a pained and proud and indignant tone that Nydia made this humble reply and Ione felt that she only wounded Nydia by pursuing the subject She remained silent and the bark now floated into the sea Confess that I was right Ione said Glaucus in prevailing on thee not to waste this beautiful noon in thy chamber confess that I was right Thou wert right Glaucus said Nydia abruptly The dear child speaks for thee returned the Athenian But permit me to move opposite to thee or our light boat will be over balanced So saying he took his seat exactly opposite to Ione and leaning forward he fancied that it was her breath and not the winds of summer that flung fragrance over the sea Thou wert to tell me said Glaucus why for so many days thy door was closed to me Oh think of it no more answered Ione quickly I gave my ear to what I now know was the malice of slander And my slanderer was the Egyptian Ione s silence assented to the question His motives are sufficiently obvious Talk not of him said Ione covering her face with her hands as if to shut out his very thought Perhaps he may be already by the banks of the slow Styx resumed Glaucus yet in that case we should probably have heard of his death Thy brother methinks hath felt the dark influence of his gloomy soul When we arrived last night at thy house he left me abruptly Will he ever vouchsafe to be my friend He is consumed with some secret care answered Ione tearfully Would that we could lure him from himself Let us join in that tender office He shall be my brother returned the Greek How calmly said Ione rousing herself from the gloom into which her thoughts of Apaecides had plunged her how calmly the clouds seem to repose in heaven and yet you tell me for I knew it not myself that the earth shook beneath us last night It did and more violently they say than it has done since the great convulsion sixteen years ago the land we live in yet nurses mysterious terror and the reign of Pluto which spreads beneath our burning fields seems rent with unseen commotion Didst thou not feel the earth quake Nydia where thou wert seated last night and was it not the fear that it occasioned thee that made thee weep I felt the soil creep and heave beneath me like some monstrous serpent answered Nydia but as I saw nothing I did not fear I imagined the convulsion to be a spell of the Egyptian s They say he has power over the elements Thou art a Thessalian my Nydia replied Glaucus and hast a national right to believe in magic Magic who doubts it answered Nydia simply dost thou Until last night when a necromantic prodigy did indeed appal me methinks I was not credulous in any other magic save that of love said Glaucus in a tremulous voice and fixing his eyes on Ione Ah said Nydia with a sort of shiver and she awoke mechanically a few pleasing notes from her lyre the sound suited well the tranquility of the waters and the sunny stillness of the noon Play to us dear Nydia said Glaucus play and give us one of thine old Thessalian songs whether it be of magic or not as thou wilt let it at least be of love Of love repeated Nydia raising her large wandering eyes that ever thrilled those who saw them with a mingled fear and pity you could never familiarize yourself to their aspect so strange did it seem that those dark wild orbs were ignorant of the day and either so fixed was their deep mysterious gaze or so restless and perturbed their glance that you felt when you encountered them that same vague and chilling and half preternatural impression which comes over you in the presence of the insane of those who having a life outwardly like your own have a life within life dissimilar unsearchable unguessed Will you that I should sing of love said she fixing those eyes upon Glaucus Yes replied he looking down She moved a little way from the arm of Ione still cast round her as if that soft embrace embarrassed and placing her light and graceful instrument on her knee after a short prelude she sang the following strain NYDIA S LOVE SONG I The Wind and the Beam loved the Rose And the Rose loved one For who recks the wind where it blows Or loves not the sun II None knew whence the humble Wind stole Poor sport of the skies None dreamt that the Wind had a soul In its mournful sighs III Oh happy Beam how canst thou prove That bright love of thine In thy light is the proof of thy love Thou hast but to shine IV How its love can the Wind reveal Unwelcome its sigh Mute mute to its Rose let it steal Its proof is to die Thou singest but sadly sweet girl said Glaucus thy youth only feels as yet the dark shadow of Love far other inspiration doth he wake when he himself bursts and brightens upon us I sing as I was taught replied Nydia sighing Thy master was love crossed then try thy hand at a gayer air Nay girl give the instrument to me As Nydia obeyed her hand touched his and with that slight touch her breast heaved her cheek flushed Ione and Glaucus occupied with each other perceived not those signs of strange and premature emotions which preyed upon a heart that nourished by imagination dispensed with hope And now broad blue bright before them spread that halcyon sea fair as at this moment seventeen centuries from that date I behold it rippling on the same divinest shores Clime that yet enervates with a soft and Circean spell that moulds us insensibly mysteriously into harmony with thyself banishing the thought of austerer labor the voices of wild ambition the contests and the roar of life filling us with gentle and subduing dreams making necessary to our nature that which is its least earthly portion so that the very air inspires us with the yearning and thirst of love Whoever visits thee seems to leave earth and its harsh cares behind to enter by the Ivory gate into the Land of Dreams The young and laughing Hours of the PRESENT the Hours those children of Saturn which he hungers ever to devour seem snatched from his grasp The past the future are forgotten we enjoy but the breathing time Flower of the world s garden Fountain of Delight Italy of Italy beautiful benign Campania vain were indeed the Titans if on this spot they yet struggled for another heaven Here if God meant this working day life for a perpetual holiday who would not sigh to dwell for ever asking nothing hoping nothing fearing nothing while thy skies shine over him while thy seas sparkle at his feet while thine air brought him sweet messages from the violet and the orange and while the heart resigned to beating with but one emotion could find the lips and the eyes which flatter it vanity of vanities that love can defy custom and be eternal It was then in this clime on those seas that the Athenian gazed upon a face that might have suited the nymph the spirit of the place feeding his eyes on the changeful roses of that softest cheek happy beyond the happiness of common life loving and knowing himself beloved In the tale of human passion in past ages there is something of interest even in the remoteness of the time We love to feel within us the bond which unites the most distant era men nations customs perish THE AFFECTIONS ARE IMMORTAL they are the sympathies which unite the ceaseless generations The past lives again when we look upon its emotions it lives in our own That which was ever is The magician s gift that revives the dead that animates the dust of forgotten graves is not in the author s skill it is in the heart of the reader Still vainly seeking the eyes of Ione as half downcast half averted they shunned his own the Athenian in a low and soft voice thus expressed the feelings inspired by happier thoughts than those which had colored the song of Nydia THE SONG OF GLAUCUS I As the bark floateth on o er the summer lit sea Floats my heart o er the deeps of its passion for thee All lost in the space without terror it glides For bright with thy soul is the face of the tides Now heaving now hush d is that passionate ocean As it catches thy smile or thy sighs And the twin stars that shine on the wanderer s devotion Its guide and its god are thine eyes II The bark may go down should the cloud sweep above For its being is bound to the light of thy love As thy faith and thy smile are its life and its joy So thy frown or thy change are the storms that destroy Ah sweeter to sink while the sky is serene If time hath a change for thy heart If to live be to weep over what thou hast been Let me die while I know what thou art As the last words of the song trembled over the sea Ione raised her looks they met those of her lover Happy Nydia happy in thy affliction that thou couldst not see that fascinated and charmed gaze that said so much that made the eye the voice of the soul that promised the impossibility of change But though the Thessalian could not detect that gaze she divined its meaning by their silence by their sighs She pressed her hands lightly across her breast as if to keep down its bitter and jealous thoughts and then she hastened to speak for that silence was intolerable to her After all O Glaucus said she there is nothing very mirthful in your strain Yet I meant it to be so when I took up thy lyre pretty one Perhaps happiness will not permit us to be mirthful How strange is it said Ione changing a conversation which oppressed her while it charmed that for the last several days yonder cloud has hung motionless over Vesuvius Yet not indeed motionless for sometimes it changes its form and now methinks it looks like some vast giant with an arm outstretched over the city Dost thou see the likeness or is it only to my fancy Fair Ione I see it also It is astonishingly distinct The giant seems seated on the brow of the mountain the different shades of the cloud appear to form a white robe that sweeps over its vast breast and limbs it seems to gaze with a steady face upon the city below to point with one hand as thou sayest over its glittering streets and to raise the other dost thou note it towards the higher heaven It is like the ghost of some huge Titan brooding over the beautiful world he lost sorrowful for the past yet with something of menace for the future Could that mountain have any connection with the last night s earthquake They say that ages ago almost in the earliest era of tradition it gave forth fires as AEtna still Perhaps the flames yet lurk and dart beneath It is possible said Glaucus musingly Thou sayest thou art slow to believe in magic said Nydia suddenly I have heard that a potent witch dwells amongst the scorched caverns of the mountain and yon cloud may be the dim shadow of the demon she confers with Thou art full of the romance of thy native Thessaly said Glaucus and a strange mixture of sense and all conflicting superstitions We are ever superstitious in the dark replied Nydia Tell me she added after a slight pause tell me O Glaucus do all that are beautiful resemble each other They say you are beautiful and Ione also Are your faces then the same I fancy not yet it ought to be so Fancy no such grievous wrong to Ione answered Glaucus laughing But we do not alas resemble each other as the homely and the beautiful sometimes do Ione s hair is dark mine light Ione s eyes are what color Ione I cannot see turn them to me Oh are they black no they are too soft Are they blue no they are too deep they change with every ray of the sun I know not their color but mine sweet Nydia are grey and bright only when Ione shines on them Ione s cheek is I do not understand one word of thy description interrupted Nydia peevishly I comprehend only that you do not resemble each other and I am glad of it Why Nydia said Ione Nydia colored slightly Because she replied coldly I have always imagined you under different forms and one likes to know one is right And what hast thou imagined Glaucus to resemble asked Ione softly Music replied Nydia looking down Thou art right thought Ione And what likeness hast thou ascribed to Ione I cannot tell yet answered the blind girl I have not yet known her long enough to find a shape and sign for my guesses I will tell thee then said Glaucus passionately she is like the sun that warms like the wave that refreshes The sun sometimes scorches and the wave sometimes drowns answered Nydia Take then these roses said Glaucus let their fragrance suggest to thee Ione Alas the roses will fade said the Neapolitan archly Thus conversing they wore away the hours the lovers conscious only of the brightness and smiles of love the blind girl feeling only its darkness its tortures the fierceness of jealousy and its woe And now as they drifted on Glaucus once more resumed the lyre and woke its strings with a careless hand to a strain so wildly and gladly beautiful that even Nydia was aroused from her reverie and uttered a cry of admiration Thou seest my child cried Glaucus that I can yet redeem the character of love s music and that I was wrong in saying happiness could not be gay Listen Nydia listen dear Ione and hear THE BIRTH OF LOVE I Like a Star in the seas above Like a Dream to the waves of sleep Up up THE INCARNATE LOVE She rose from the charmed deep And over the Cyprian Isle The skies shed their silent smile And the Forest s green heart was rife With the stir of the gushing life The life that had leap d to birth In the veins of the happy earth Hail oh hail The dimmest sea cave below thee The farthest sky arch above In their innermost stillness know thee And heave with the Birth of Love Gale soft Gale Thou comest on thy silver winglets From thy home in the tender west Now fanning her golden ringlets Now hush d on her heaving breast And afar on the murmuring sand The Seasons wait hand in hand To welcome thee Birth Divine To the earth which is henceforth thine II Behold how she kneels in the shell Bright pearl in its floating cell Behold how the shell s rose hues The cheek and the breast of snow And the delicate limbs suffuse Like a blush with a bashful glow Sailing on slowly sailing O er the wild water All hail as the fond light is hailing Her daughter All hail We are thine all thine evermore Not a leaf on the laughing shore Not a wave on the heaving sea Nor a single sigh In the boundless sky But is vow d evermore to thee III And thou my beloved one thou As I gaze on thy soft eyes now Methinks from their depths I view The Holy Birth born anew Thy lids are the gentle cell Where the young Love blushing lies See she breaks from the mystic shell She comes from thy tender eyes Hail all hail She comes as she came from the sea To my soul as it looks on thee She comes she comes She comes as she came from the sea To my soul as it looks on thee Hail all hail Chapter III THE CONGREGATION FOLLOWED by Apaecides the Nazarene gained the side of the Sarnus that river which now has shrunk into a petty stream then rushed gaily into the sea covered with countless vessels and reflecting on its waves the gardens the vines the palaces and the temples of Pompeii From its more noisy and frequented banks Olinthus directed his steps to a path which ran amidst a shady vista of trees at the distance of a few paces from the river This walk was in the evening a favorite resort of the Pompeians but during the heat and business of the day was seldom visited save by some groups of playful children some meditative poet or some disputative philosophers At the side farthest from the river frequent copses of box interspersed the more delicate and evanescent foliage and these were cut into a thousand quaint shapes sometimes into the forms of fauns and satyrs sometimes into the mimicry of Egyptian pyramids sometimes into the letters that composed the name of a popular or eminent citizen Thus the false taste is equally ancient as the pure and the retired traders of Hackney and Paddington a century ago were little aware perhaps that in their tortured yews and sculptured box they found their models in the most polished period of Roman antiquity in the gardens of Pompeii and the villas of the fastidious Pliny This walk now as the noonday sun shone perpendicularly through the chequered leaves was entirely deserted at least no other forms than those of Olinthus and the priest infringed upon the solitude They sat themselves on one of the benches placed at intervals between the trees and facing the faint breeze that came languidly from the river whose waves danced and sparkled before them a singular and contrasted pair the believer in the latest the priest of the most ancient worship of the world Since thou leftst me so abruptly said Olinthus hast thou been happy has thy heart found contentment under these priestly robes hast thou still yearning for the voice of God heard it whisper comfort to thee from the oracles of Isis That sigh that averted countenance give me the answer my soul predicted Alas answered Apaecides sadly thou seest before thee a wretched and distracted man From my childhood upward I have idolized the dreams of virtue I have envied the holiness of men who in caves and lonely temples have been admitted to the companionship of beings above the world my days have been consumed with feverish and vague desires my nights with mocking but solemn visions Seduced by the mystic prophecies of an impostor I have indued these robes my nature I confess it to thee frankly my nature has revolted at what I have seen and been doomed to share in Searching after truth I have become but the minister of falsehoods On the evening in which we last met I was buoyed by hopes created by that same impostor whom I ought already to have better known I have no matter no matter suffice it I have added perjury and sin to rashness and to sorrow The veil is now rent for ever from my eyes I behold a villain where I obeyed a demigod the earth darkens in my sight I am in the deepest abyss of gloom I know not if there be gods above if we are the things of chance if beyond the bounded and melancholy present there is annihilation or an hereafter tell me then thy faith solve me these doubts if thou hast indeed the power I do not marvel answered the Nazarene that thou hast thus erred or that thou art thus sceptic Eighty years ago there was no assurance to man of God or of a certain and definite future beyond the grave New laws are declared to him who has ears a heaven a true Olympus is revealed to him who has eyes heed then and listen And with all the earnestness of a man believing ardently himself and zealous to convert the Nazarene poured forth to Apaecides the assurances of Scriptural promise He spoke first of the sufferings and miracles of Christ he wept as he spoke he turned next to the glories of the Saviour s Ascension to the clear predictions of Revelation He described that pure and unsensual heaven destined to the virtuous those fires and torments that were the doom of guilt The doubts which spring up to the mind of later reasoners in the immensity of the sacrifice of God to man were not such as would occur to an early heathen He had been accustomed to believe that the gods had lived upon earth and taken upon themselves the forms of men had shared in human passions in human labours and in human misfortunes What was the travail of his own Alcmena s son whose altars now smoked with the incense of countless cities but a toil for the human race Had not the great Dorian Apollo expiated a mystic sin by descending to the grave Those who were the deities of heaven had been the lawgivers or benefactors on earth and gratitude had led to worship It seemed therefore to the heathen a doctrine neither new nor strange that Christ had been sent from heaven that an immortal had indued mortality and tasted the bitterness of death And the end for which He thus toiled and thus suffered how far more glorious did it seem to Apaecides than that for which the deities of old had visited the nether world and passed through the gates of death Was it not worthy of a God to descend to these dim valleys in order to clear up the clouds gathered over the dark mount beyond to satisfy the doubts of sages to convert speculation into certainty by example to point out the rules of life by revelation to solve the enigma of the grave and to prove that the soul did not yearn in vain when it dreamed of an immortality In this last was the great argument of those lowly men destined to convert the earth As nothing is more flattering to the pride and the hopes of man than the belief in a future state so nothing could be more vague and confused than the notions of the heathen sages upon that mystic subject Apaecides had already learned that the faith of the philosophers was not that of the herd that if they secretly professed a creed in some diviner power it was not the creed which they thought it wise to impart to the community He had already learned that even the priest ridiculed what he preached to the people that the notions of the few and the many were never united But in this new faith it seemed to him that philosopher priest and people the expounders of the religion and its followers were alike accordant they did not speculate and debate upon immortality they spoke of as a thing certain and assured the magnificence of the promise dazzled him its consolations soothed For the Christian faith made its early converts among sinners many of its fathers and its martyrs were those who had felt the bitterness of vice and who were therefore no longer tempted by its false aspect from the paths of an austere and uncompromising virtue All the assurances of this healing faith invited to repentance they were peculiarly adapted to the bruised and sore of spirit the very remorse which Apaecides felt for his late excesses made him incline to one who found holiness in that remorse and who whispered of the joy in heaven over one sinner that repenteth Come said the Nazarene as he perceived the effect he had produced come to the humble hall in which we meet a select and a chosen few listen there to our prayers note the sincerity of our repentant tears mingle in our simple sacrifice not of victims nor of garlands but offered by white robed thoughts upon the altar of the heart The flowers that we lay there are imperishable they bloom over us when we are no more nay they accompany us beyond the grave they spring up beneath our feet in heaven they delight us with an eternal odor for they are of the soul they partake of its nature these offerings are temptations overcome and sins repented Come oh come lose not another moment prepare already for the great the awful journey from darkness to light from sorrow to bliss from corruption to immortality This is the day of the Lord the Son a day that we have set apart for our devotions Though we meet usually at night yet some amongst us are gathered together even now What joy what triumph will be with us all if we can bring one stray lamb into the sacred fold There seemed to Apaecides so naturally pure of heart something ineffably generous and benign in that spirit of conversation which animated Olinthus a spirit that found its own bliss in the happiness of others that sought in its wide sociality to make companions for eternity He was touched softened and subdued He was not in that mood which can bear to be left alone curiosity too mingled with his purer stimulants he was anxious to see those rites of which so many dark and contradictory rumours were afloat He paused a moment looked over his garb thought of Arbaces shuddered with horror lifted his eyes to the broad brow of the Nazarene intent anxious watchful but for his benefits for his salvation He drew his cloak round him so as wholly to conceal his robes and said Lead on I follow thee Olinthus pressed his hand joyfully and then descending to the river side hailed one of the boats that plyed there constantly they entered it an awning overhead while it sheltered them from the sun screened also their persons from observation they rapidly skimmed the wave From one of the boats that passed them floated a soft music and its prow was decorated with flowers it was gliding towards the sea So said Olinthus sadly unconscious and mirthful in their delusions sail the votaries of luxury into the great ocean of storm and shipwreck we pass them silent and unnoticed to gain the land Apaecides lifting his eyes caught through the aperture in the awning a glimpse of the face of one of the inmates of that gay bark it was the face of Ione The lovers were embarked on the excursion at which we have been made present The priest sighed and once more sunk back upon his seat They reached the shore where in the suburbs an alley of small and mean houses stretched towards the bank they dismissed the boat landed and Olinthus preceding the priest threaded the labyrinth of lanes and arrived at last at the closed door of a habitation somewhat larger than its neighbors He knocked thrice the door was opened and closed again as Apaecides followed his guide across the threshold They passed a deserted atrium and gained an inner chamber of moderate size which when the door was closed received its only light from a small window cut over the door itself But halting at the threshold of this chamber and knocking at the door Olinthus said Peace be with you A voice from within returned Peace with whom The Faithful answered Olinthus and the door opened twelve or fourteen persons were sitting in a semicircle silent and seemingly absorbed in thought and opposite to a crucifix rudely carved in wood They lifted up their eyes when Olinthus entered without speaking the Nazarene himself before he accosted them knelt suddenly down and by his moving lips and his eyes fixed steadfastly on the crucifix Apaecides saw that he prayed inly This rite performed Olinthus turned to the congregation Men and brethren said he start not to behold amongst you a priest of Isis he hath sojourned with the blind but the Spirit hath fallen on him he desires to see to hear and to understand Let him said one of the assembly and Apaecides beheld in the speaker a man still younger than himself of a countenance equally worn and pallid of an eye which equally spoke of the restless and fiery operations of a working mind Let him repeated a second voice and he who thus spoke was in the prime of manhood his bronzed skin and Asiatic features bespoke him a son of Syria he had been a robber in his youth Let him said a third voice and the priest again turning to regard the speaker saw an old man with a long grey beard whom he recognized as a slave to the wealthy Diomed Let him repeated simultaneously the rest men who with two exceptions were evidently of the inferior ranks In these exceptions Apaecides noted an officer of the guard and an Alexandrian merchant We do not recommenced Olinthus we do not bind you to secrecy we impose on you no oaths as some of our weaker brethren would do not to betray us It is true indeed that there is no absolute law against us but the multitude more savage than their rulers thirst for our lives So my friends when Pilate would have hesitated it was the people who shouted Christ to the cross But we bind you not to our safety no Betray us to the crowd impeach calumniate malign us if you will we are above death we should walk cheerfully to the den of the lion or the rack of the torturer we can trample down the darkness of the grave and what is death to a criminal is eternity to the Christian A low and applauding murmur ran through the assembly Thou comest amongst us as an examiner mayest thou remain a convert Our religion you behold it Yon cross our sole image yon scroll the mysteries of our Caere and Eleusis Our morality it is in our lives sinners we all have been who now can accuse us of a crime we have baptized ourselves from the past Think not that this is of us it is of God Approach Medon beckoning to the old slave who had spoken third for the admission of Apaecides thou art the sole man amongst us who is not free But in heaven the last shall be first so with us Unfold your scroll read and explain Useless would it be for us to accompany the lecture of Medon or the comments of the congregation Familiar now are those doctrines then strange and new Eighteen centuries have left us little to expound upon the lore of Scripture or the life of Christ To us too there would seem little congenial in the doubts that occurred to a heathen priest and little learned in the answers they receive from men uneducated rude and simple possessing only the knowledge that they were greater than they seemed There was one thing that greatly touched the Neapolitan when the lecture was concluded they heard a very gentle knock at the door the password was given and replied to the door opened and two young children the eldest of whom might have told its seventh year entered timidly they were the children of the master of the house that dark and hardy Syrian whose youth had been spent in pillage and bloodshed The eldest of the congregation it was that old slave opened to them his arms they fled to the shelter they crept to his breast and his hard features smiled as he caressed them And then these bold and fervent men nursed in vicissitude beaten by the rough winds of life men of mailed and impervious fortitude ready to affront a world prepared for torment and armed for death men who presented all imaginable contrast to the weak nerves the light hearts the tender fragility of childhood crowded round the infants smoothing their rugged brows and composing their bearded lips to kindly and fostering smiles and then the old man opened the scroll and he taught the infants to repeat after him that beautiful prayer which we still dedicate to the Lord and still teach to our children and then he told them in simple phrase of God s love to the young and how not a sparrow falls but His eye sees it This lovely custom of infant initiation was long cherished by the early Church in memory of the words which said Suffer little children to come unto me and forbid them not and was perhaps the origin of the superstitious calumny which ascribed to the Nazarenes the crime which the Nazarenes when victorious attributed to the Jew viz the decoying children to hideous rites at which they were secretly immolated And the stern paternal penitent seemed to feel in the innocence of his children a return into early life life ere yet it sinned he followed the motion of their young lips with an earnest gaze he smiled as they repeated with hushed and reverent looks the holy words and when the lesson was done and they ran released and gladly to his knee he clasped them to his breast kissed them again and again and tears flowed fast down his cheek tears of which it would have been impossible to trace the source so mingled they were with joy and sorrow penitence and hope remorse for himself and love for them Something I say there was in this scene which peculiarly affected Apaecides and in truth it is difficult to conceive a ceremony more appropriate to the religion of benevolence more appealing to the household and everyday affections striking a more sensitive chord in the human breast It was at this time that an inner door opened gently and a very old man entered the chamber leaning on a staff At his presence the whole congregation rose there was an expression of deep affectionate respect upon every countenance and Apaecides gazing on his countenance felt attracted towards him by an irresistible sympathy No man ever looked upon that face without love for there had dwelt the smile of the Deity the incarnation of divinest love and the glory of the smile had never passed away My children God be with you said the old man stretching his arms and as he spoke the infants ran to his knee He sat down and they nestled fondly to his bosom It was beautiful to see that mingling of the extremes of life the rivers gushing from their early source the majestic stream gliding to the ocean of eternity As the light of declining day seems to mingle earth and heaven making the outline of each scarce visible and blending the harsh mountain tops with the sky even so did the smile of that benign old age appear to hallow the aspect of those around to blend together the strong distinctions of varying years and to diffuse over infancy and manhood the light of that heaven into which it must so soon vanish and be lost Father said Olinthus thou on whose form the miracle of the Redeemer worked thou who wert snatched from the grave to become the living witness of His mercy and His power behold a stranger in our meeting a new lamb gathered to the fold Let me bless him said the old man the throng gave way Apaecides approached him as by an instinct he fell on his knees before him the old man laid his hand on the priest s head and blessed him but not aloud As his lips moved his eyes were upturned and tears those tears that good men only shed in the hope of happiness to another flowed fast down his cheeks The children were on either side of the convert his heart was theirs he had become as one of them to enter into the kingdom of Heaven Chapter IV THE STREAM OF LOVE RUNS ON WHITHER DAYS are like years in the love of the young when no bar no obstacle is between their hearts when the sun shines and the course runs smooth when their love is prosperous and confessed Ione no longer concealed from Glaucus the attachment she felt for him and their talk now was only of their love Over the rapture of the present the hopes of the future glowed like the heaven above the gardens of spring They went in their trustful thoughts far down the stream of time they laid out the chart of their destiny to come they suffered the light of to day to suffuse the morrow In the youth of their hearts it seemed as if care and change and death were as things unknown Perhaps they loved each other the more because the condition of the world left to Glaucus no aim and no wish but love because the distractions common in free states to men s affections existed not for the Athenian because his country wooed him not to the bustle of civil life because ambition furnished no counterpoise to love and therefore over their schemes and projects love only reigned In the iron age they imagined themselves of the golden doomed only to live and to love To the superficial observer who interests himself only in characters strongly marked and broadly colored both the lovers may seem of too slight and commonplace a mould in the delineation of characters purposely subdued the reader sometimes imagines that there is a want of character perhaps indeed I wrong the real nature of these two lovers by not painting more impressively their stronger individualities But in dwelling so much on their bright and birdlike existence I am influenced almost insensibly by the forethought of the changes that await them and for which they were so ill prepared It was this very softness and gaiety of life that contrasted most strongly the vicissitudes of their coming fate For the oak without fruit or blossom whose hard and rugged heart is fitted for the storm there is less fear than for the delicate branches of the myrtle and the laughing clusters of the vine They had now advanced far into August the next month their marriage was fixed and the threshold of Glaucus was already wreathed with garlands and nightly by the door of Ione he poured forth the rich libations He existed no longer for his gay companions he was ever with Ione In the mornings they beguiled the sun with music in the evenings they forsook the crowded haunts of the gay for excursions on the water or along the fertile and vine clad plains that lay beneath the fatal mount of Vesuvius The earth shook no more the lively Pompeians forgot even that there had gone forth so terrible a warning of their approaching doom Glaucus imagined that convulsion in the vanity of his heathen religion an especial interposition of the gods less in behalf of his own safety than that of Ione He offered up the sacrifices of gratitude at the temples of his faith and even the altar of Isis was covered with his votive garlands as to the prodigy of the animated marble he blushed at the effect it had produced on him He believed it indeed to have been wrought by the magic of man but the result convinced him that it betokened not the anger of a goddess Of Arbaces they heard only that he still lived stretched on the bed of suffering he recovered slowly from the effect of the shock he had sustained he left the lovers unmolested but it was only to brood over the hour and the method of revenge Alike in their mornings at the house of Ione and in their evening excursions Nydia was usually their constant and often their sole companion They did not guess the secret fires which consumed her the abrupt freedom with which she mingled in their conversation her capricious and often her peevish moods found ready indulgence in the recollection of the service they owed her and their compassion for her affliction They felt an interest in her perhaps the greater and more affectionate from the very strangeness and waywardness of her nature her singular alternations of passion and softness the mixture of ignorance and genius of delicacy and rudeness of the quick humors of the child and the proud calmness of the woman Although she refused to accept of freedom she was constantly suffered to be free she went where she listed no curb was put either on her words or actions they felt for one so darkly fated and so susceptible of every wound the same pitying and compliant indulgence the mother feels for a spoiled and sickly child dreading to impose authority even where they imagined it for her benefit She availed herself of this license by refusing the companionship of the slave whom they wished to attend her With the slender staff by which she guided her steps she went now as in her former unprotected state along the populous streets it was almost miraculous to perceive how quickly and how dexterously she threaded every crowd avoiding every danger and could find her benighted way through the most intricate windings of the city But her chief delight was still in visiting the few feet of ground which made the garden of Glaucus in tending the flowers that at least repaid her love Sometimes she entered the chamber where he sat and sought a conversation which she nearly always broke off abruptly for conversation with Glaucus only tended to one subject Ione and that name from his lips inflicted agony upon her Often she bitterly repented the service she had rendered to Ione often she said inly If she had fallen Glaucus could have loved her no longer and then dark and fearful thoughts crept into her breast She had not experienced fully the trials that were in store for her when she had been thus generous She had never before been present when Glaucus and Ione were together she had never heard that voice so kind to her so much softer to another The shock that crushed her heart with the tidings that Glaucus loved had at first only saddened and benumbed by degrees jealousy took a wilder and fiercer shape it partook of hatred it whispered revenge As you see the wind only agitate the green leaf upon the bough while the leaf which has lain withered and seared on the ground bruised and trampled upon till the sap and life are gone is suddenly whirled aloft now here now there without stay and without rest so the love which visits the happy and the hopeful hath but freshness on its wings its violence is but sportive But the heart that hath fallen from the green things of life that is without hope that hath no summer in its fibres is torn and whirled by the same wind that but caresses its brethren it hath no bough to cling to it is dashed from path to path till the winds fall and it is crushed into the mire for ever The friendless childhood of Nydia had hardened prematurely her character perhaps the heated scenes of profligacy through which she had passed seemingly unscathed had ripened her passions though they had not sullied her purity The orgies of Burbo might only have disgusted the banquets of the Egyptian might only have terrified at the moment but the winds that pass unheeded over the soil leave seeds behind them As darkness too favors the imagination so perhaps her very blindness contributed to feed with wild and delirious visions the love of the unfortunate girl The voice of Glaucus had been the first that had sounded musically to her ear his kindness made a deep impression upon her mind when he had left Pompeii in the former year she had treasured up in her heart every word he had uttered and when any one told her that this friend and patron of the poor flower girl was the most brilliant and the most graceful of the young revellers of Pompeii she had felt a pleasing pride in nursing his recollection Even the task which she imposed upon herself of tending his flowers served to keep him in her mind she associated him with all that was most charming to her impressions and when she had refused to express what image she fancied Ione to resemble it was partly perhaps that whatever was bright and soft in nature she had already combined with the thought of Glaucus If any of my readers ever loved at an age which they would now smile to remember an age in which fancy forestalled the reason let them say whether that love among all its strange and complicated delicacies was not above all other and later passions susceptible of jealousy I seek not here the cause I know that it is commonly the fact When Glaucus returned to Pompeii Nydia had told another year of life that year with its sorrows its loneliness its trials had greatly developed her mind and heart and when the Athenian drew her unconsciously to his breast deeming her still in soul as in years a child when he kissed her smooth cheek and wound his arm round her trembling frame Nydia felt suddenly and as by revelation that those feelings she had long and innocently cherished were of love Doomed to be rescued from tyranny by Glaucus doomed to take shelter under his roof doomed to breathe but for so brief a time the same air and doomed in the first rush of a thousand happy grateful delicious sentiments of an overflowing heart to hear that he loved another to be commissioned to that other the messenger the minister to feel all at once that utter nothingness which she was which she ever must be but which till then her young mind had not taught her that utter nothingness to him who was all to her what wonder that in her wild and passionate soul all the elements jarred discordant that if love reigned over the whole it was not the love which is born of the more sacred and soft emotions Sometimes she dreaded only lest Glaucus should discover her secret sometimes she felt indignant that it was not suspected it was a sign of contempt could he imagine that she presumed so far Her feelings to Ione ebbed and flowed with every hour now she loved her because he did now she hated him for the same cause There were moments when she could have murdered her unconscious mistress moments when she could have laid down life for her These fierce and tremulous alternations of passion were too severe to be borne long Her health gave way though she felt it not her cheek paled her step grew feebler tears came to her eyes more often and relieved her less One morning when she repaired to her usual task in the garden of the Athenian she found Glaucus under the columns of the peristyle with a merchant of the town he was selecting jewels for his destined bride He had already fitted up her apartment the jewels he bought that day were placed also within it they were never fated to grace the fair form of Ione they may be seen at this day among the disinterred treasures of Pompeii in the chambers of the studio at Naples Come hither Nydia put down thy vase and come hither Thou must take this chain from me stay there I have put it on There Servilius does it not become her Wonderfully answered the jeweller for jewellers were well bred and flattering men even at that day But when these ear rings glitter in the ears of the noble Ione then by Bacchus you will see whether my art adds anything to beauty Ione repeated Nydia who had hitherto acknowledged by smiles and blushes the gift of Glaucus Yes replied the Athenian carelessly toying with the gems I am choosing a present for Ione but there are none worthy of her He was startled as he spoke by an abrupt gesture of Nydia she tore the chain violently from her neck and dashed it on the ground How is this What Nydia dost thou not like the bauble art thou offended You treat me ever as a slave and as a child replied the Thessalian with ill suppressed sobs and she turned hastily away to the opposite corner of the garden Glaucus did not attempt to follow or to soothe he was offended he continued to examine the jewels and to comment on their fashion to object to this and to praise that and finally to be talked by the merchant into buying all the safest plan for a lover and a plan that any one will do right to adopt provided always that he can obtain an Ione When he had completed his purchase and dismissed the jeweller he retired into his chamber dressed mounted his chariot and went to Ione He thought no more of the blind girl or her offence he had forgotten both the one and the other He spent the forenoon with his beautiful Neapolitan repaired thence to the baths supped if as we have said before we can justly so translate the three o clock coena of the Romans alone and abroad for Pompeii had its restaurateurs and returning home to change his dress ere he again repaired to the house of Ione he passed the peristyle but with the absorbed reverie and absent eyes of a man in love and did not note the form of the poor blind girl bending exactly in the same place where he had left her But though he saw her not her ear recognized at once the sound of his step She had been counting the moments to his return He had scarcely entered his favorite chamber which opened on the peristyle and seated himself musingly on his couch when he felt his robe timorously touched and turning he beheld Nydia kneeling before him and holding up to him a handful of flowers a gentle and appropriate peace offering her eyes darkly upheld to his own streamed with tears I have offended thee said she sobbing and for the first time I would die rather than cause thee a moment s pain say that thou wilt forgive me See I have taken up the chain I have put it on I will never part from it it is thy gift My dear Nydia returned Glaucus and raising her he kissed her forehead think of it no more But why my child wert thou so suddenly angry I could not divine the cause Do not ask said she coloring violently I am a thing full of faults and humors you know I am but a child you say so often is it from a child that you can expect a reason for every folly But prettiest you will soon be a child no more and if you would have us treat you as a woman you must learn to govern these singular impulses and gales of passion Think not I chide no it is for your happiness only I speak It is true said Nydia I must learn to govern myself I must bide I must suppress my heart This is a woman s task and duty methinks her virtue is hypocrisy Self control is not deceit my Nydia returned the Athenian and that is the virtue necessary alike to man and to woman it is the true senatorial toga the badge of the dignity it covers Self control self control Well well what you say is right When I listen to you Glaucus my wildest thoughts grow calm and sweet and a delicious serenity falls over me Advise ah guide me ever my preserver Thy affectionate heart will be thy best guide Nydia when thou hast learned to regulate its feelings Ah that will be never sighed Nydia wiping away her tears Say not so the first effort is the only difficult one I have made many first efforts answered Nydia innocently But you my Mentor do you find it so easy to control yourself Can you conceal can you even regulate your love for Ione Love dear Nydia ah that is quite another matter answered the young preceptor I thought so returned Nydia with a melancholy smile Glaucus wilt thou take my poor flowers Do with them as thou wilt thou canst give them to Ione added she with a little hesitation Nay Nydia answered Glaucus kindly divining something of jealousy in her language though he imagined it only the jealousy of a vain and susceptible child I will not give thy pretty flowers to any one Sit here and weave them into a garland I will wear it this night it is not the first those delicate fingers have woven for me The poor girl delightedly sat down beside Glaucus She drew from her girdle a ball of the many colored threads or rather slender ribands used in the weaving of garlands and which for it was her professional occupation she carried constantly with her and began quickly and gracefully to commence her task Upon her young cheeks the tears were already dried a faint but happy smile played round her lips childlike indeed she was sensible only of the joy of the present hour she was reconciled to Glaucus he had forgiven her she was beside him he played caressingly with her silken hair his breath fanned her cheek Ione the cruel Ione was not by none other demanded divided his care Yes she was happy and forgetful it was one of the few moments in her brief and troubled life that it was sweet to treasure to recall As the butterfly allured by the winter sun basks for a little in the sudden light ere yet the wind awakes and the frost comes on which shall blast it before the eve she rested beneath a beam which by contrast with the wonted skies was not chilling and the instinct which should have warned her of its briefness bade her only gladden in its smile Thou hast beautiful locks said Glaucus They were once I ween well a mother s delight Nydia sighed it would seem that she had not been born a slave but she ever shunned the mention of her parentage and whether obscure or noble certain it is that her birth was never known by her benefactors nor by any one in those distant shores even to the last The child of sorrow and of mystery she came and went as some bird that enters our chamber for a moment we see it flutter for a while before us we know not whence it flew or to what region it escapes Nydia sighed and after a short pause without answering the remark said But do I weave too many roses in my wreath Glaucus They tell me it is thy favorite flower And ever favored my Nydia be it by those who have the soul of poetry it is the flower of love of festival it is also the flower we dedicate to silence and to death it blooms on our brows in life while life be worth the having it is scattered above our sepulchre when we are no more Ah would said Nydia instead of this perishable wreath that I could take thy web from the hand of the Fates and insert the roses there Pretty one thy wish is worthy of a voice so attuned to song it is uttered in the spirit of song and whatever my doom I thank thee Whatever thy doom is it not already destined to all things bright and fair My wish was vain The Fates will be as tender to thee as I should It might not be so Nydia were it not for love While youth lasts I may forget my country for a while But what Athenian in his graver manhood can think of Athens as she was and be contented that he is happy while she is fallen fallen and for ever And why for ever As ashes cannot be rekindled as love once dead can never revive so freedom departed from a people is never regained But talk we not of these matters unsuited to thee To me oh thou errest I too have my sighs for Greece my cradle was rocked at the foot of Olympus the gods have left the mountain but their traces may be seen seen in the hearts of their worshippers seen in the beauty of their clime they tell me it is beautiful and I have felt its airs to which even these are harsh its sun to which these skies are chill Oh talk to me of Greece Poor fool that I am I can comprehend thee and methinks had I yet lingered on those shores had I been a Grecian maid whose happy fate it was to love and to be loved I myself could have armed my lover for another Marathon a new Plataea Yes the hand that now weaves the roses should have woven thee the olive crown If such a day could come said Glaucus catching the enthusiasm of the blind Thessalian and half rising But no the sun has set and the night only bids us be forgetful and in forgetfulness be gay weave still the roses But it was with a melancholy tone of forced gaiety that the Athenian uttered the last words and sinking into a gloomy reverie he was only wakened from it a few minutes afterwards by the voice of Nydia as she sang in a low tone the following words which he had once taught her THE APOLOGY FOR PLEASURE I Who will assume the bays That the hero wore Wreaths on the Tomb of Days Gone evermore Who shall disturb the brave Or one leaf on their holy grave The laurel is vowed to them Leave the bay on its sacred stem But this the rose the fading rose Alike for slave and freeman grows II If Memory sit beside the dead With tombs her only treasure If Hope is lost and Freedom fled The more excuse for Pleasure Come weave the wreath the roses weave The rose at least is ours To feeble hearts our fathers leave In pitying scorn the flowers III On the summit worn and hoary Of Phyle s solemn hill The tramp of the brave is still And still in the saddening Mart The pulse of that mighty heart Whose very blood was glory Glaucopis forsakes her own The angry gods forget us But yet the blue streams along Walk the feet of the silver Song And the night bird wakes the moon And the bees in the blushing noon Haunt the heart of the old Hymettus We are fallen but not forlorn If something is left to cherish As Love was the earliest born So Love is the last to perish IV Wreathe then the roses wreathe The BEAUTIFUL still is ours While the stream shall flow and the sky shall glow The BEAUTIFUL still is ours Whatever is fair or soft or bright In the lap of day or the arms of night Whispers our soul of Greece of Greece And hushes our care with a voice of peace Wreathe then the roses wreathe They tell me of earlier hours And I hear the heart of my Country breathe From the lips of the Stranger s flowers Chapter V NYDIA ENCOUNTERS JULIA INTERVIEW OF THE HEATHEN SISTER AND CONVERTED BROTHER AN ATHENIAN S NOTION OF CHRISTIANITY WHAT happiness to Ione what bliss to be ever by the side of Glaucus to hear his voice And she too can see him Such was the soliloquy of the blind girl as she walked alone and at twilight to the house of her new mistress whither Glaucus had already preceded her Suddenly she was interrupted in her fond thoughts by a female voice Blind flower girl whither goest thou There is no pannier under thine arm hast thou sold all thy flowers The person thus accosting Nydia was a lady of a handsome but a bold and unmaidenly countenance it was Julia the daughter of Diomed Her veil was half raised as she spoke she was accompanied by Diomed himself and by a slave carrying a lantern before them the merchant and his daughter were returning home from a supper at one of their neighbors Dost thou not remember my voice continued Julia I am the daughter of Diomed the wealthy Ah forgive me yes I recall the tones of your voice No noble Julia I have no flowers to sell I heard that thou wert purchased by the beautiful Greek Glaucus is that true pretty slave asked Julia I serve the Neapolitan Ione replied Nydia evasively Ah and it is true then Come come interrupted Diomed with his cloak up to his mouth the night grows cold I cannot stay here while you prate to that blind girl come let her follow you home if you wish to speak to her Do child said Julia with the air of one not accustomed to be refused I have much to ask of thee come I cannot this night it grows late answered Nydia I must be at home I am not free noble Julia What the meek Ione will chide thee Ay I doubt not she is a second Thalestris But come then to morrow do remember I have been thy friend of old I will obey thy wishes answered Nydia and Diomed again impatiently summoned his daughter she was obliged to proceed with the main question she had desired to put to Nydia unasked Meanwhile we return to Ione The interval of time that had elapsed that day between the first and second visit of Glaucus had not been too gaily spent she had received a visit from her brother Since the night he had assisted in saving her from the Egyptian she had not before seen him Occupied with his own thoughts thoughts of so serious and intense a nature the young priest had thought little of his sister in truth men perhaps of that fervent order of mind which is ever aspiring above earth are but little prone to the earthlier affections and it had been long since Apaecides had sought those soft and friendly interchanges of thought those sweet confidences which in his earlier youth had bound him to Ione and which are so natural to that endearing connection which existed between them Ione however had not ceased to regret his estrangement she attributed it at present to the engrossing duties of his severe fraternity And often amidst all her bright hopes and her new attachment to her betrothed often when she thought of her brother s brow prematurely furrowed his unsmiling lip and bended frame she sighed to think that the service of the gods could throw so deep a shadow over that earth which the gods created But this day when he visited her there was a strange calmness on his features a more quiet and self possessed expression in his sunken eyes than she had marked for years This apparent improvement was but momentary it was a false calm which the least breeze could ruffle May the gods bless thee my brother said she embracing him The gods Speak not thus vaguely perchance there is but one God My brother What if the sublime faith of the Nazarene be true What if God be a monarch One Invisible Alone What if these numerous countless deities whose altars fill the earth be but evil demons seeking to wean us from the true creed This may be the case Ione Alas can we believe it or if we believed would it not be a melancholy faith answered the Neapolitan What all this beautiful world made only human mountain disenchanted of its Oread the waters of their Nymph that beautiful prodigality of faith which makes everything divine consecrating the meanest flowers bearing celestial whispers in the faintest breeze wouldst thou deny this and make the earth mere dust and clay No Apaecides all that is brightest in our hearts is that very credulity which peoples the universe with gods Ione answered as a believer in the poesy of the old mythology would answer We may judge by that reply how obstinate and hard the contest which Christianity had to endure among the heathens The Graceful Superstition was never silent every the most household action of their lives was entwined with it it was a portion of life itself as the flowers are a part of the thyrsus At every incident they recurred to a god every cup of wine was prefaced by a libation the very garlands on their thresholds were dedicated to some divinity their ancestors themselves made holy presided as Lares over their hearth and hall So abundant was belief with them that in their own climes at this hour idolatry has never thoroughly been outrooted it changes but its objects of worship it appeals to innumerable saints where once it resorted to divinities and it pours its crowds in listening reverence to oracles at the shrines of saint Januarius or saint Stephen instead of to those of Isis or Apollo But these superstitions were not to the early Christians the object of contempt so much as of horror They did not believe with the quiet scepticism of the heathen philosopher that the gods were inventions of the priests nor even with the vulgar that according to the dim light of history they had been mortals like themselves They imagined the heathen divinities to be evil spirits they transplanted to Italy and to Greece the gloomy demons of India and the East and in Jupiter or in Mars they shuddered at the representative of Moloch or of Satan Apaecides had not yet adopted formally the Christian faith but he was already on the brink of it He already participated the doctrines of Olinthus he already imagined that the lively imaginations of the heathen were the suggestions of the arch enemy of mankind The innocent and natural answer of Ione made him shudder He hastened to reply vehemently and yet so confusedly that Ione feared for his reason more than she dreaded his violence Ah my brother said she these hard duties of thine have shattered thy very sense Come to me Apaecides my brother my own brother give me thy hand let me wipe the dew from thy brow chide me not now I understand thee not think only that Ione could not offend thee Ione said Apaecides drawing her towards him and regarding her tenderly can I think that this beautiful form this kind heart may be destined to an eternity of torment Dii meliora the gods forbid said Ione in the customary form of words by which her contemporaries thought an omen might be averted The words and still more the superstition they implied wounded the ear of Apaecides He rose muttering to himself turned from the chamber then stopping half way gazed wistfully on Ione and extended his arms Ione flew to them in joy he kissed her earnestly and then he said Farewell my sister when we next meet thou mayst be to me as nothing take thou then this embrace full yet of all the tender reminiscences of childhood when faith and hope creeds customs interests objects were the same to us Now the tie is to be broken With these strange words he left the house The great and severest trial of the primitive Christians was indeed this their conversion separated them from their dearest bonds They could not associate with beings whose commonest actions whose commonest forms of speech were impregnated with idolatry They shuddered at the blessing of love to their ears it was uttered in a demon s name This their misfortune was their strength if it divided them from the rest of the world it was to unite them proportionally to each other They were men of iron who wrought forth the Word of God and verily the bonds that bound them were of iron also Glaucus found Ione in tears he had already assumed the sweet privilege to console He drew from her a recital of her interview with her brother but in her confused account of language itself so confused to one not prepared for it he was equally at a loss with Ione to conceive the intentions or the meaning of Apaecides Hast thou ever heard much asked she of this new sect of the Nazarenes of which my brother spoke I have often heard enough of the votaries returned Glaucus but of their exact tenets know I naught save that in their doctrine there seemeth something preternaturally chilling and morose They live apart from their kind they affect to be shocked even at our simple uses of garlands they have no sympathies with the cheerful amusements of life they utter awful threats of the coming destruction of the world they appear in one word to have brought their unsmiling and gloomy creed out of the cave of Trophonius Yet continued Glaucus after a slight pause they have not wanted men of great power and genius nor converts even among the Areopagites of Athens Well do I remember to have heard my father speak of one strange guest at Athens many years ago methinks his name was PAUL My father was amongst a mighty crowd that gathered on one of our immemorial hills to hear this sage of the East expound through the wide throng there rang not a single murmur the jest and the roar with which our native orators are received were hushed for him and when on the loftiest summit of that hill raised above the breathless crowd below stood this mysterious visitor his mien and his countenance awed every heart even before a sound left his lips He was a man I have heard my father say of no tall stature but of noble and impressive mien his robes were dark and ample the declining sun for it was evening shone aslant upon his form as it rose aloft motionless and commanding his countenance was much worn and marked as of one who had braved alike misfortune and the sternest vicissitude of many climes but his eyes were bright with an almost unearthly fire and when he raised his arm to speak it was with the majesty of a man into whom the Spirit of a God hath rushed Men of Athens he is reported to have said I find amongst ye an altar with this inscription TO THE UNKNOWN GOD Ye worship in ignorance the same Deity I serve To you unknown till now to you be it now revealed Then declared that solemn man how this great Maker of all things who had appointed unto man his several tribes and his various homes the Lord of earth and the universal heaven dwelt not in temples made with hands that His presence His spirit were in the air we breathed our life and our being were with Him Think you he cried that the Invisible is like your statues of gold and marble Think you that He needeth sacrifice from you He who made heaven and earth Then spoke he of fearful and coming times of the end of the world of a second rising of the dead whereof an assurance had been given to man in the resurrection of the mighty Being whose religion he came to preach When he thus spoke the long pent murmur went forth and the philosophers that were mingled with the people muttered their sage contempt there might you have seen the chilling frown of the Stoic and the Cynic s sneer and the Epicurean who believeth not even in our own Elysium muttered a pleasant jest and swept laughing through the crowd but the deep heart of the people was touched and thrilled and they trembled though they knew not why for verily the stranger had the voice and majesty of a man to whom The Unknown God had committed the preaching of His faith Ione listened with wrapt attention and the serious and earnest manner of the narrator betrayed the impression that he himself had received from one who had been amongst the audience that on the hill of the heathen Mars had heard the first tidings of the word of Christ Chapter VI THE PORTER THE GIRL AND THE GLADIATOR THE door of Diomed s house stood open and Medon the old slave sat at the bottom of the steps by which you ascended to the mansion That luxurious mansion of the rich merchant of Pompeii is still to be seen just without the gates of the city at the commencement of the Street of Tombs it was a gay neighborhood despite the dead On the opposite side but at some yards nearer the gate was a spacious hostelry at which those brought by business or by pleasure to Pompeii often stopped to refresh themselves In the space before the entrance of the inn now stood wagons and carts and chariots some just arrived some just quitting in all the bustle of an animated and popular resort of public entertainment Before the door some farmers seated on a bench by a small circular table were talking over their morning cups on the affairs of their calling On the side of the door itself was painted gaily and freshly the eternal sign of the chequers By the roof of the inn stretched a terrace on which some females wives of the farmers above mentioned were some seated some leaning over the railing and conversing with their friends below In a deep recess at a little distance was a covered seat in which some two or three poorer travellers were resting themselves and shaking the dust from their garments On the other side stretched a wide space originally the burial ground of a more ancient race than the present denizens of Pompeii and now converted into the Ustrinum or place for the burning of the dead Above this rose the terraces of a gay villa half hid by trees The tombs themselves with their graceful and varied shapes the flowers and the foliage that surrounded them made no melancholy feature in the prospect Hard by the gate of the city in a small niche stood the still form of the well disciplined Roman sentry the sun shining brightly on his polished crest and the lance on which he leaned The gate itself was divided into three arches the centre one for vehicles the others for the foot passengers and on either side rose the massive walls which girt the city composed patched repaired at a thousand different epochs according as war time or the earthquake had shattered that vain protection At frequent intervals rose square towers whose summits broke in picturesque rudeness the regular line of the wall and contrasted well with the modern buildings gleaming whitely by The curving road which in that direction leads from Pompeii to Herculaneum wound out of sight amidst hanging vines above which frowned the sullen majesty of Vesuvius Hast thou heard the news old Medon said a young woman with a pitcher in her hand as she paused by Diomed s door to gossip a moment with the slave ere she repaired to the neighboring inn to fill the vessel and coquet with the travellers The news what news said the slave raising his eyes moodily from the ground Why there passed through the gate this morning no doubt ere thou wert well awake such a visitor to Pompeii Ay said the slave indifferently Yes a present from the noble Pomponianus A present I thought thou saidst a visitor It is both visitor and present Know O dull and stupid that it is a most beautiful young tiger for our approaching games in the amphitheatre Hear you that Medon Oh what pleasure I declare I shall not sleep a wink till I see it they say it has such a roar Poor fool said Medon sadly and cynically Fool me no fool old churl It is a pretty thing a tiger especially if we could but find somebody for him to eat We have now a lion and a tiger only consider that Medon and for want of two good criminals perhaps we shall be forced to see them eat each other By the by your son is a gladiator a handsome man and a strong can you not persuade him to fight the tiger Do now you would oblige me mightily nay you would be a benefactor to the whole town Vah vah said the slave with great asperity think of thine own danger ere thou thus pratest of my poor boy s death My own danger said the girl frightened and looking hastily around Avert the omen let thy words fall on thine own head And the girl as she spoke touched a talisman suspended round her neck Thine own danger what danger threatens me Had the earthquake but a few nights since no warning said Medon Has it not a voice Did it not say to us all Prepare for death the end of all things is at hand Bah stuff said the young woman settling the folds of her tunic Now thou talkest as they say the Nazarenes talked methinks thou art one of them Well I can prate with thee grey croaker no more thou growest worse and worse Vale O Hercules send us a man for the lion and another for the tiger Ho ho for the merry merry show With a forest of faces in every row Lo the swordsmen bold as the son of Alcmena Sweep side by side o er the hushed arena Talk while you may you will hold your breath When they meet in the grasp of the glowing death Tramp tramp how gaily they go Ho ho for the merry merry show Chanting in a silver and clear voice this feminine ditty and holding up her tunic from the dusty road the young woman stepped lightly across to the crowded hostelry My poor son said the slave half aloud is it for things like this thou art to be butchered Oh faith of Christ I could worship thee in all sincerity were it but for the horror which thou inspirest for these bloody lists The old man s head sank dejectedly on his breast He remained silent and absorbed but every now and then with the corner of his sleeve he wiped his eyes His heart was with his son he did not see the figure that now approached from the gate with a quick step and a somewhat fierce and reckless gait and carriage He did not lift his eyes till the figure paused opposite the place where he sat and with a soft voice addressed him by the name of Father My boy my Lydon is it indeed thou said the old man joyfully Ah thou wert present to my thoughts I am glad to hear it my father said the gladiator respectfully touching the knees and beard of the slave and soon may I be always present with thee not in thought only Yes my son but not in this world replied the slave mournfully Talk not thus O my sire look cheerfully for I feel so I am sure that I shall win the day and then the gold I gain buys thy freedom Oh my father it was but a few days since that I was taunted by one too whom I would gladly have undeceived for he is more generous than the rest of his equals He is not Roman he is of Athens by him I was taunted with the lust of gain when I demanded what sum was the prize of victory Alas he little knew the soul of Lydon My boy my boy said the old slave as slowly ascending the steps he conducted his son to his own little chamber communicating with the entrance hall which in this villa was the peristyle not the atrium you may see it now it is the third door to the right on entering The first door conducts to the staircase the second is but a false recess in which there stood a statue of bronze Generous affectionate pious as are thy motives said Medon when they were thus secured from observation thy deed itself is guilt thou art to risk thy blood for thy father s freedom that might be forgiven but the prize of victory is the blood of another Oh that is a deadly sin no object can purify it Forbear forbear rather would I be a slave for ever than purchase liberty on such terms Hush my father replied Lydon somewhat impatiently thou hast picked up in this new creed of thine of which I pray thee not to speak to me for the gods that gave me strength denied me wisdom and I understand not one word of what thou often preachest to me thou hast picked up I say in this new creed some singular fantasies of right and wrong Pardon me if I offend thee but reflect Against whom shall I contend Oh couldst thou know those wretches with whom for thy sake I assort thou wouldst think I purified earth by removing one of them Beasts whose very lips drop blood things all savage unprincipled in their very courage ferocious heartless senseless no tie of life can bind them they know not fear it is true but neither know they gratitude nor charity nor love they are made but for their own career to slaughter without pity to die without dread Can thy gods whosoever they be look with wrath on a conflict with such as these and in such a cause Oh My father wherever the powers above gaze down on earth they behold no duty so sacred so sanctifying as the sacrifice offered to an aged parent by the piety of a grateful son The poor old slave himself deprived of the lights of knowledge and only late a convert to the Christian faith knew not with what arguments to enlighten an ignorance at once so dark and yet so beautiful in its error His first impulse was to throw himself on his son s breast his next to start away to wring his hands and in the attempt to reprove his broken voice lost itself in weeping And if resumed Lydon if thy Deity methinks thou wilt own but one be indeed that benevolent and pitying Power which thou assertest Him to be He will know also that thy very faith in Him first confirmed me in that determination thou blamest How what mean you said the slave Why thou knowest that I sold in my childhood as a slave was set free at Rome by the will of my master whom I had been fortunate enough to please I hastened to Pompeii to see thee I found thee already aged and infirm under the yoke of a capricious and pampered lord thou hadst lately adopted this new faith and its adoption made thy slavery doubly painful to thee it took away all the softening charm of custom which reconciles us so often to the worst Didst thou not complain to me that thou wert compelled to offices that were not odious to thee as a slave but guilty as a Nazarene Didst thou not tell me that thy soul shook with remorse when thou wert compelled to place even a crumb of cake before the Lares that watch over yon impluvium that thy soul was torn by a perpetual struggle Didst thou not tell me that even by pouring wine before the threshold and calling on the name of some Grecian deity thou didst fear thou wert incurring penalties worse than those of Tantalus an eternity of tortures more terrible than those of the Tartarian fields Didst thou not tell me this I wondered I could not comprehend nor by Hercules can I now but I was thy son and my sole task was to compassionate and relieve Could I hear thy groans could I witness thy mysterious horrors thy constant anguish and remain inactive No by the immortal gods the thought struck me like light from Olympus I had no money but I had strength and youth these were thy gifts I could sell these in my turn for thee I learned the amount of thy ransom I learned that the usual prize of a victorious gladiator would doubly pay it I became a gladiator I linked myself with those accursed men scorning loathing while I joined I acquired their skill blessed be the lesson it shall teach me to free my father Oh that thou couldst hear Olinthus sighed the old man more and more affected by the virtue of his son but not less strongly convinced of the criminality of his purpose I will hear the whole world talk if thou wilt answered the gladiator gaily but not till thou art a slave no more Beneath thy own roof my father thou shalt puzzle this dull brain all day long ay and all night too if it give thee pleasure Oh such a spot as I have chalked out for thee it is one of the nine hundred and ninety nine shops of old Julia Felix in the sunny part of the city where thou mayst bask before the door in the day and I will sell the oil and the wine for thee my father and then please Venus or if it does not please her since thou lovest not her name it is all one to Lydon then I say perhaps thou mayst have a daughter too to tend thy grey hairs and hear shrill voices at thy knee that shall call thee Lydon s father Ah we shall be so happy the prize can purchase all Cheer thee cheer up my sire And now I must away day wears the lanista waits me Come thy blessing As Lydon thus spoke he had already quitted the dark chamber of his father and speaking eagerly though in a whispered tone they now stood at the same place in which we introduced the porter at his post O bless thee bless thee my brave boy said Medon fervently and may the great Power that reads all hearts see the nobleness of thine and forgive its error The tall shape of the gladiator passed swiftly down the path the eyes of the slave followed its light but stately steps till the last glimpse was gone and then sinking once more on his seat his eyes again fastened themselves on the ground His form mute and unmoving as a thing of stone His heart who in our happier age can even imagine its struggles its commotion May I enter said a sweet voice Is thy mistress Julia within The slave mechanically motioned to the visitor to enter but she who addressed him could not see the gesture she repeated her question timidly but in a louder voice Have I not told thee said the slave peevishly enter Thanks said the speaker plaintively and the slave roused by the tone looked up and recognized the blind flower girl Sorrow can sympathize with affliction he raised himself and guided her steps to the head of the adjacent staircase by which you descended to Julia s apartment where summoning a female slave he consigned to her the charge of the blind girl Chapter VII THE DRESSING ROOM OF A POMPEIAN BEAUTY IMPORTANT CONVERSATION BETWEEN JULIA AND NYDIA THE elegant Julia sat in her chamber with her slaves around her like the cubiculum which adjoined it the room was small but much larger than the usual apartments appropriated to sleep which were so diminutive that few who have not seen the bed chambers even in the gayest mansions can form any notion of the petty pigeon holes in which the citizens of Pompeii evidently thought it desirable to pass the night But in fact bed with the ancients was not that grave serious and important part of domestic mysteries which it is with us The couch itself was more like a very narrow and small sofa light enough to be transported easily and by the occupant himself from place to place and it was no doubt constantly shifted from chamber to chamber according to the caprice of the inmate or the changes of the season for that side of the house which was crowded in one month might perhaps be carefully avoided in the next There was also among the Italians of that period a singular and fastidious apprehension of too much daylight their darkened chambers which first appear to us the result of a negligent architecture were the effect of the most elaborate study In their porticoes and gardens they courted the sun whenever it so pleased their luxurious tastes In the interior of their houses they sought rather the coolness and the shade Julia s apartment at that season was in the lower part of the house immediately beneath the state rooms above and looking upon the garden with which it was on a level The wide door which was glazed alone admitted the morning rays yet her eye accustomed to a certain darkness was sufficiently acute to perceive exactly what colors were the most becoming what shade of the delicate rouge gave the brightest beam to her dark glance and the most youthful freshness to her cheek On the table before which she sat was a small and circular mirror of the most polished steel round which in precise order were ranged the cosmetics and the unguents the perfumes and the paints the jewels and combs the ribands and the gold pins which were destined to add to the natural attractions of beauty the assistance of art and the capricious allurements of fashion Through the dimness of the room glowed brightly the vivid and various colourings of the wall in all the dazzling frescoes of Pompeian taste Before the dressing table and under the feet of Julia was spread a carpet woven from the looms of the East Near at hand on another table was a silver basin and ewer an extinguished lamp of most exquisite workmanship in which the artist had represented a Cupid reposing under the spreading branches of a myrtle tree and a small roll of papyrus containing the softest elegies of Tibullus Before the door which communicated with the cubiculum hung a curtain richly broidered with gold flowers Such was the dressing room of a beauty eighteen centuries ago The fair Julia leaned indolently back on her seat while the ornatrix i e hairdresser slowly piled one above the other a mass of small curls dexterously weaving the false with the true and carrying the whole fabric to a height that seemed to place the head rather at the centre than the summit of the human form Her tunic of a deep amber which well set off her dark hair and somewhat embrowned complexion swept in ample folds to her feet which were cased in slippers fastened round the slender ankle by white thongs while a profusion of pearls were embroidered in the slipper itself which was of purple and turned slightly upward as do the Turkish slippers at this day An old slave skilled by long experience in all the arcana of the toilet stood beside the hairdresser with the broad and studded girdle of her mistress over her arm and giving from time to time mingled with judicious flattery to the lady herself instructions to the mason of the ascending pile Put that pin rather more to the right lower stupid one Do you not observe how even those beautiful eyebrows are One would think you were dressing Corinna whose face is all of one side Now put in the flowers what fool not that dull pink you are not suiting colors to the dim cheek of Chloris it must be the brightest flowers that can alone suit the cheek of the young Julia Gently said the lady stamping her small foot violently you pull my hair as if you were plucking up a weed Dull thing continued the directress of the ceremony Do you not know how delicate is your mistress you are not dressing the coarse horsehair of the widow Fulvia Now then the riband that s right Fair Julia look in the mirror saw you ever anything so lovely as yourself When after innumerable comments difficulties and delays the intricate tower was at length completed the next preparation was that of giving to the eyes the soft languish produced by a dark powder applied to the lids and brows a small patch cut in the form of a crescent skillfully placed by the rosy lips attracted attention to their dimples and to the teeth to which already every art had been applied in order to heighten the dazzle of their natural whiteness To another slave hitherto idle was now consigned the charge of arranging the jewels the ear rings of pearl two to each ear the massive bracelets of gold the chain formed of rings of the same metal to which a talisman cut in crystals was attached the graceful buckle on the left shoulder in which was set an exquisite cameo of Psyche the girdle of purple riband richly wrought with threads of gold and clasped by interlacing serpents and lastly the various rings fitted to every joint of the white and slender fingers The toilet was now arranged according to the last mode of Rome The fair Julia regarded herself with a last gaze of complacent vanity and reclining again upon her seat she bade the youngest of her slaves in a listless tone read to her the enamoured couplets of Tibullus This lecture was still proceeding when a female slave admitted Nydia into the presence of the lady of the place Salve Julia said the flower girl arresting her steps within a few paces from the spot where Julia sat and crossing her arms upon her breast I have obeyed your commands You have done well flower girl answered the lady Approach you may take a seat One of the slaves placed a stool by Julia and Nydia seated herself Julia looked hard at the Thessalian for some moments in rather an embarrassed silence She then motioned her attendants to withdraw and to close the door When they were alone she said looking mechanically from Nydia and forgetful that she was with one who could not observe her countenance You serve the Neapolitan Ione I am with her at present answered Nydia Is she as handsome as they say I know not replied Nydia How can I judge Ah I should have remembered But thou hast ears if not eyes Do thy fellow slaves tell thee she is handsome Slaves talking with one another forget to flatter even their mistress They tell me that she is beautiful Hem say they that she is tall Yes Why so am I Dark haired I have heard so So am I And doth Glaucus visit her much Daily returned Nydia with a half suppressed sigh Daily indeed Does he find her handsome I should think so since they are so soon to be wedded Wedded cried Julia turning pale even through the false roses on her cheek and starting from her couch Nydia did not of course perceive the emotion she had caused Julia remained a long time silent but her heaving breast and flashing eyes would have betrayed to one who could have seen the wound her vanity had sustained They tell me thou art a Thessalian said she at last breaking silence And truly Thessaly is the land of magic and of witches of talismans and of love philtres said Julia It has ever been celebrated for its sorcerers returned Nydia timidly Knowest thou then blind Thessalian of any love charms I said the flower girl coloring I how should I No assuredly not The worse for thee I could have given thee gold enough to have purchased thy freedom hadst thou been more wise But what asked Nydia can induce the beautiful and wealthy Julia to ask that question of her servant Has she not money and youth and loveliness Are they not love charms enough to dispense with magic To all but one person in the world answered Julia haughtily but methinks thy blindness is infectious and But no matter And that one person said Nydia eagerly Is not Glaucus replied Julia with the customary deceit of her sex Glaucus no Nydia drew her breath more freely and after a short pause Julia recommenced But talking of Glaucus and his attachment to this Neapolitan reminded me of the influence of love spells which for ought I know or care she may have exercised upon him Blind girl I love and shall Julia live to say it am loved not in return This humbles nay not humbles but it stings my pride I would see this ingrate at my feet not in order that I might raise but that I might spurn him When they told me thou wert Thessalian I imagined thy young mind might have learned the dark secrets of thy clime Alas no murmured Nydia would it had Thanks at least for that kindly wish said Julia unconscious of what was passing in the breast of the flower girl But tell me thou hearest the gossip of slaves always prone to these dim beliefs always ready to apply to sorcery for their own low loves hast thou ever heard of any Eastern magician in this city who possesses the art of which thou art ignorant No vain chiromancer no juggler of the market place but some more potent and mighty magician of India or of Egypt Of Egypt yes said Nydia shuddering What Pompeian has not heard of Arbaces Arbaces true replied Julia grasping at the recollection They say he is a man above all the petty and false impostures of dull pretenders that he is versed in the learning of the stars and the secrets of the ancient Nox why not in the mysteries of love If there be one magician living whose art is above that of others it is that dread man answered Nydia and she felt her talisman while she spoke He is too wealthy to divine for money continued Julia sneeringly Can I not visit him It is an evil mansion for the young and the beautiful replied Nydia I have heard too that he languishes in An evil mansion said Julia catching only the first sentence Why so The orgies of his midnight leisure are impure and polluted at least so says rumor By Ceres by Pan and by Cybele thou dost but provoke my curiosity instead of exciting my fears returned the wayward and pampered Pompeian I will seek and question him of his lore If to these orgies love be admitted why the more likely that he knows its secrets Nydia did not answer I will seek him this very day resumed Julia nay why not this very hour At daylight and in his present state thou hast assuredly the less to fear answered Nydia yielding to her own sudden and secret wish to learn if the dark Egyptian were indeed possessed of those spells to rivet and attract love of which the Thessalian had so often heard And who dare insult the rich daughter of Diomed said Julia haughtily I will go May I visit thee afterwards to learn the result asked Nydia anxiously Kiss me for thy interest in Julia s honour answered the lady Yes assuredly This eve we sup abroad come hither at the same hour to morrow and thou shalt know all I may have to employ thee too but enough for the present Stay take this bracelet for the new thought thou hast inspired me with remember if thou servest Julia she is grateful and she is generous I cannot take thy present said Nydia putting aside the bracelet but young as I am I can sympathize unbought with those who love and love in vain Sayest thou so returned Julia Thou speakest like a free woman and thou shalt yet be free farewell Chapter VIII JULIA SEEKS ARBACES THE RESULT OF THAT INTERVIEW ARBACES was seated in a chamber which opened on a kind of balcony or portico that fronted his garden His cheek was pale and worn with the sufferings he had endured but his iron frame had already recovered from the severest effects of that accident which had frustrated his fell designs in the moment of victory The air that came fragrantly to his brow revived his languid senses and the blood circulated more freely than it had done for days through his shrunken veins So then thought he the storm of fate has broken and blown over the evil which my lore predicted threatening life itself has chanced and yet I live It came as the stars foretold and now the long bright and prosperous career which was to succeed that evil if I survived it smiles beyond I have passed I have subdued the latest danger of my destiny Now I have but to lay out the gardens of my future fate unterrified and secure First then of all my pleasures even before that of love shall come revenge This boy Greek who has crossed my passion thwarted my designs baffled me even when the blade was about to drink his accursed blood shall not a second time escape me But for the method of my vengeance Of that let me ponder well Oh Ate if thou art indeed a goddess fill me with thy direst Inspiration The Egyptian sank into an intent reverie which did not seem to present to him any clear or satisfactory suggestions He changed his position restlessly as he revolved scheme after scheme which no sooner occurred than it was dismissed several times he struck his breast and groaned aloud with the desire of vengeance and a sense of his impotence to accomplish it While thus absorbed a boy slave timidly entered the chamber A female evidently of rank from her dress and that of the single slave who attended her waited below and sought an audience with Arbaces A female his heart beat quick Is she young Her face is concealed by her veil but her form is slight yet round as that of youth Admit her said the Egyptian for a moment his vain heart dreamed the stranger might be Ione The first glance of the visitor now entering the apartment sufficed to undeceive so erring a fancy True she was about the same height as Ione and perhaps the same age true she was finely and richly formed but where was that undulating and ineffable grace which accompanied every motion of the peerless Neapolitan the chaste and decorous garb so simple even in the care of its arrangement the dignified yet bashful step the majesty of womanhood and its modesty Pardon me that I rise with pain said Arbaces gazing on the stranger I am still suffering from recent illness Do not disturb thyself O great Egyptian returned Julia seeking to disguise the fear she already experienced beneath the ready resort of flattery and forgive an unfortunate female who seeks consolation from thy wisdom Draw near fair stranger said Arbaces and speak without apprehension or reserve Julia placed herself on a seat beside the Egyptian and wonderingly gazed around an apartment whose elaborate and costly luxuries shamed even the ornate enrichment of her father s mansion fearfully too she regarded the hieroglyphical inscriptions on the walls the faces of the mysterious images which at every corner gazed upon her the tripod at a little distance and above all the grave and remarkable countenance of Arbaces himself a long white robe like a veil half covered his raven locks and flowed to his feet his face was made even more impressive by its present paleness and his dark and penetrating eyes seemed to pierce the shelter of her veil and explore the secrets of her vain and unfeminine soul And what said his low deep voice brings thee O maiden to the house of the Eastern stranger His fame replied Julia In what said he with a strange and slight smile Canst thou ask O wise Arbaces Is not thy knowledge the very gossip theme of Pompeii Some little lore have I indeed treasured up replied Arbaces but in what can such serious and sterile secrets benefit the ear of beauty Alas said Julia a little cheered by the accustomed accents of adulation does not sorrow fly to wisdom for relief and they who love unrequitedly are not they the chosen victims of grief Ha said Arbaces can unrequited love be the lot of so fair a form whose modelled proportions are visible even beneath the folds of thy graceful robe Deign O maiden to lift thy veil that I may see at least if the face correspond in loveliness with the form Not unwilling perhaps to exhibit her charms and thinking they were likely to interest the magician in her fate Julia after some slight hesitation raised her veil and revealed a beauty which but for art had been indeed attractive to the fixed gaze of the Egyptian Thou comest to me for advice in unhappy love said he well turn that face on the ungrateful one what other love charm can I give thee Oh cease these courtesies said Julia it is a love charm indeed that I would ask from thy skill Fair stranger replied Arbaces somewhat scornfully love spells are not among the secrets I have wasted the midnight oil to attain Is it indeed so Then pardon me great Arbaces and farewell Stay said Arbaces who despite his passion for Ione was not unmoved by the beauty of his visitor and had he been in the flush of a more assured health might have attempted to console the fair Julia by other means than those of supernatural wisdom Stay although I confess that I have left the witchery of philtres and potions to those whose trade is in such knowledge yet am I myself not so dull to beauty but that in earlier youth I may have employed them in my own behalf I may give thee advice at least if thou wilt be candid with me Tell me then first art thou unmarried as thy dress betokens Yes said Julia And being unblest with fortune wouldst thou allure some wealthy suitor I am richer than he who disdains me Strange and more strange And thou lovest him who loves not thee I know not if I love him answered Julia haughtily but I know that I would see myself triumph over a rival I would see him who rejected me my suitor I would see her whom he has preferred in her turn despised A natural ambition and a womanly said the Egyptian in a tone too grave for irony Yet more fair maiden wilt thou confide to me the name of thy lover Can he be Pompeian and despise wealth even if blind to beauty He is of Athens answered Julia looking down Ha cried the Egyptian impetuously as the blood rushed to his cheek there is but one Athenian young and noble in Pompeii Can it be Glaucus of whom thou speakest Ah betray me not so indeed they call him The Egyptian sank back gazing vacantly on the averted face of the merchant s daughter and muttering inly to himself this conference with which he had hitherto only trifled amusing himself with the credulity and vanity of his visitor might it not minister to his revenge I see thou canst assist me not said Julia offended by his continued silence guard at least my secret Once more farewell Maiden said the Egyptian in an earnest and serious tone thy suit hath touched me I will minister to thy will Listen to me I have not myself dabbled in these lesser mysteries but I know one who hath At the base of Vesuvius less than a league from the city there dwells a powerful witch beneath the rank dews of the new moon she has gathered the herbs which possess the virtue to chain Love in eternal fetters Her art can bring thy lover to thy feet Seek her and mention to her the name of Arbaces she fears that name and will give thee her most potent philtres Alas answered Julia I know not the road to the home of her whom thou speakest of the way short though it be is long to traverse for a girl who leaves unknown the house of her father The country is entangled with wild vines and dangerous with precipitous caverns I dare not trust to mere strangers to guide me the reputation of women of my rank is easily tarnished and though I care not who knows that I love Glaucus I would not have it imagined that I obtained his love by a spell Were I but three days advanced in health said the Egyptian rising and walking as if to try his strength across the chamber but with irregular and feeble steps I myself would accompany thee Well thou must wait But Glaucus is soon to wed that hated Neapolitan Wed Yes in the early part of next month So soon Art thou well advised of this From the lips of her own slave It shall not be said the Egyptian impetuously Fear nothing Glaucus shall be thine Yet how when thou obtainest it canst thou administer to him this potion My father has invited him and I believe the Neapolitan also to a banquet on the day following to morrow I shall then have the opportunity to administer it So be it said the Egyptian with eyes flashing such fierce joy that Julia s gaze sank trembling beneath them To morrow eve then order thy litter thou hast one at thy command Surely yes returned the purse proud Julia Order thy litter at two miles distance from the city is a house of entertainment frequented by the wealthier Pompeians from the excellence of its baths and the beauty of its gardens There canst thou pretend only to shape thy course there ill or dying I will meet thee by the statue of Silenus in the copse that skirts the garden and I myself will guide thee to the witch Let us wait till with the evening star the goats of the herdsmen are gone to rest when the dark twilight conceals us and none shall cross our steps Go home and fear not By Hades swears Arbaces the sorcerer of Egypt that Ione shall never wed with Glaucus And that Glaucus shall be mine added Julia filling up the incompleted sentence Thou hast said it replied Arbaces and Julia half frightened at this unhallowed appointment but urged on by jealousy and the pique of rivalship even more than love resolved to fulfill it Left alone Arbaces burst forth Bright stars that never lie ye already begin the execution of your promises success in love and victory over foes for the rest of my smooth existence In the very hour when my mind could devise no clue to the goal of vengeance have ye sent this fair fool for my guide He paused in deep thought Yes said he again but in a calmer voice I could not myself have given to her the poison that shall be indeed a philtre his death might be thus tracked to my door But the witch ay there is the fit the natural agent of my designs He summoned one of his slaves bade him hasten to track the steps of Julia and acquaint himself with her name and condition This done he stepped forth into the portico The skies were serene and clear but he deeply read in the signs of their various change beheld in one mass of cloud far on the horizon which the wind began slowly to agitate that a storm was brooding above It is like my vengeance said he as he gazed the sky is clear but the cloud moves on Chapter IX STORM IN THE SOUTH THE WITCH S CAVERN IT was when the heats of noon died gradually away from the earth that Glaucus and Ione went forth to enjoy the cooled and grateful air At that time various carriages were in use among the Romans the one most used by the richer citizens when they required no companion in their excursion was the biga already described in the early portion of this work that appropriated to the matrons was termed carpentum which had commonly two wheels the ancients used also a sort of litter a vast sedan chair more commodiously arranged than the modern inasmuch as the occupant thereof could lie down at ease instead of being perpendicularly and stiffly jostled up and down There was another carriage used both for travelling and for excursions in the country it was commodious containing three or four persons with ease having a covering which could be raised at pleasure and in short answering very much the purpose of though very different in shape from the modern britska It was a vehicle of this description that the lovers accompanied by one female slave of Ione now used in their excursion About ten miles from the city there was at that day an old ruin the remains of a temple evidently Grecian and as for Glaucus and Ione everything Grecian possessed an interest they had agreed to visit these ruins it was thither they were now bound Their road lay among vines and olive groves till winding more and more towards the higher ground of Vesuvius the path grew rugged the mules moved slowly and with labor and at every opening in the wood they beheld those grey and horrent caverns indenting the parched rock which Strabo has described but which the various revolutions of time and the volcano have removed from the present aspect of the mountain The sun sloping towards his descent cast long and deep shadows over the mountain here and there they still heard the rustic reed of the shepherd amongst copses of the beechwood and wild oak Sometimes they marked the form of the silk haired and graceful capella with its wreathing horn and bright grey eye which still beneath Ausonian skies recalls the eclogues of Maro browsing half way up the hills and the grapes already purple with the smiles of the deepening summer glowed out from the arched festoons which hung pendent from tree to tree Above them light clouds floated in the serene heavens sweeping so slowly athwart the firmament that they scarcely seemed to stir while on their right they caught ever and anon glimpses of the waveless sea with some light bark skimming its surface and the sunlight breaking over the deep in those countless and softest hues so peculiar to that delicious sea How beautiful said Glaucus in a half whispered tone is that expression by which we call Earth our Mother With what a kindly equal love she pours her blessings upon her children and even to those sterile spots to which Nature has denied beauty she yet contrives to dispense her smiles witness the arbutus and the vine which she wreathes over the arid and burning soil of yon extinct volcano Ah in such an hour and scene as this well might we imagine that the Faun should peep forth from those green festoons or that we might trace the steps of the Mountain Nymph through the thickest mazes of the glade But the Nymphs ceased beautiful Ione when thou wert created There is no tongue that flatters like a lover s and yet in the exaggeration of his feelings flattery seems to him commonplace Strange and prodigal exuberance which soon exhausts itself by overflowing They arrived at the ruins they examined them with that fondness with which we trace the hallowed and household vestiges of our own ancestry they lingered there till Hesperus appeared in the rosy heavens and then returning homeward in the twilight they were more silent than they had been for in the shadow and beneath the stars they felt more oppressively their mutual love It was at this time that the storm which the Egyptian had predicted began to creep visibly over them At first a low and distant thunder gave warning of the approaching conflict of the elements and then rapidly rushed above the dark ranks of the serried clouds The suddenness of storms in that climate is something almost preternatural and might well suggest to early superstition the notion of a divine agency a few large drops broke heavily among the boughs that half overhung their path and then swift and intolerably bright the forked lightning darted across their very eyes and was swallowed up by the increasing darkness Swifter good Carrucarius cried Glaucus to the driver the tempest comes on apace The slave urged on the mules they went swift over the uneven and stony road the clouds thickened near and more near broke the thunder and fast rushed the dashing rain Dost thou fear whispered Glaucus as he sought excuse in the storm to come nearer to Ione Not with thee said she softly At that instant the carriage fragile and ill contrived as despite their graceful shapes were for practical uses most of such inventions at that time struck violently into a deep rut over which lay a log of fallen wood the driver with a curse stimulated his mules yet faster for the obstacle the wheel was torn from the socket and the carriage suddenly overset Glaucus quickly extricating himself from the vehicle hastened to assist Ione who was fortunately unhurt with some difficulty they raised the carruca or carriage and found that it ceased any longer even to afford them shelter the springs that fastened the covering were snapped asunder and the rain poured fast and fiercely into the interior In this dilemma what was to be done They were yet some distance from the city no house no aid seemed near There is said the slave a smith about a mile off I could seek him and he might fasten at least the wheel to the carruca but Jupiter how the rain beats my mistress will be wet before I come back Run thither at least said Glaucus we must find the best shelter we can till you return The lane was overshadowed with trees beneath the amplest of which Glaucus drew Ione He endeavored by stripping his own cloak to shield her yet more from the rapid rain but it descended with a fury that broke through all puny obstacles and suddenly while Glaucus was yet whispering courage to his beautiful charge the lightning struck one of the trees immediately before them and split with a mighty crash its huge trunk in twain This awful incident apprised them of the danger they braved in their present shelter and Glaucus looked anxiously round for some less perilous place of refuge We are now said he half way up the ascent of Vesuvius there ought to be some cavern or hollow in the vine clad rocks could we but find it in which the deserting Nymphs have left a shelter While thus saying he moved from the trees and looking wistfully towards the mountain discovered through the advancing gloom a red and tremulous light at no considerable distance That must come said he from the hearth of some shepherd or vine dresser it will guide us to some hospitable retreat Wilt thou stay here while I yet no that would be to leave thee to danger I will go with you cheerfully said Ione Open as the space seems it is better than the treacherous shelter of these boughs Half leading half carrying Ione Glaucus accompanied by the trembling female slave advanced towards the light which yet burned red and steadfastly At length the space was no longer open wild vines entangled their steps and hid from them save by imperfect intervals the guiding beam But faster and fiercer came the rain and the lightning assumed its most deadly and blasting form they were still therefore impelled onward hoping at last if the light eluded them to arrive at some cottage or some friendly cavern The vines grew more and more intricate the light was entirely snatched from them but a narrow path which they trod with labor and pain guided only by the constant and long lingering flashes of the storm continued to lead them towards its direction The rain ceased suddenly precipitous and rough crags of scorched lava frowned before them rendered more fearful by the lightning that illumined the dark and dangerous soil Sometimes the blaze lingered over the iron grey heaps of scoria covered in part with ancient mosses or stunted trees as if seeking in vain for some gentler product of earth more worthy of its ire and sometimes leaving the whole of that part of the scene in darkness the lightning broad and sheeted hung redly over the ocean tossing far below until its waves seemed glowing into fire and so intense was the blaze that it brought vividly into view even the sharp outline of the more distant windings of the bay from the eternal Misenum with its lofty brow to the beautiful Sorrentum and the giant hills behind Our lovers stopped in perplexity and doubt when suddenly as the darkness that gloomed between the fierce flashes of lightning once more wrapped them round they saw near but high before them the mysterious light Another blaze in which heaven and earth were reddened made visible to them the whole expanse no house was near but just where they had beheld the light they thought they saw in the recess of the cavern the outline of a human form The darkness once more returned the light no longer paled beneath the fires of heaven burned forth again they resolved to ascend towards it they had to wind their way among vast fragments of stone here and there overhung with wild bushes but they gained nearer and nearer to the light and at length they stood opposite the mouth of a kind of cavern apparently formed by huge splinters of rock that had fallen transversely athwart each other and looking into the gloom each drew back involuntarily with a superstitious fear and chill A fire burned in the far recess of the cave and over it was a small cauldron on a tall and thin column of iron stood a rude lamp over that part of the wall at the base of which burned the fire hung in many rows as if to dry a profusion of herbs and weeds A fox couched before the fire gazed upon the strangers with its bright and red eye its hair bristling and a low growl stealing from between its teeth in the centre of the cave was an earthen statue which had three heads of a singular and fantastic cast they were formed by the real skulls of a dog a horse and a boar a low tripod stood before this wild representation of the popular Hecate But it was not these appendages and appliances of the cave that thrilled the blood of those who gazed fearfully therein it was the face of its inmate Before the fire with the light shining full upon her features sat a woman of considerable age Perhaps in no country are there seen so many hags as in Italy in no country does beauty so awfully change in age to hideousness the most appalling and revolting But the old woman now before them was not one of these specimens of the extreme of human ugliness on the contrary her countenance betrayed the remains of a regular but high and aquiline order of feature with stony eyes turned upon them with a look that met and fascinated theirs they beheld in that fearful countenance the very image of a corpse the same the glazed and lustreless regard the blue and shrunken lips the drawn and hollow jaw the dead lank hair of a pale grey the livid green ghastly skin which seemed all surely tinged and tainted by the grave It is a dead thing said Glaucus Nay it stirs it is a ghost or larva faltered Ione as she clung to the Athenian s breast Oh away away groaned the slave it is the Witch of Vesuvius Who are ye said a hollow and ghostly voice And what do ye here The sound terrible and deathlike as it was suiting well the countenance of the speaker and seeming rather the voice of some bodiless wanderer of the Styx than living mortal would have made Ione shrink back into the pitiless fury of the storm but Glaucus though not without some misgiving drew her into the cavern We are storm beaten wanderers from the neighboring city said he and decoyed hither by yon light we crave shelter and the comfort of your hearth As he spoke the fox rose from the ground and advanced towards the strangers showing from end to end its white teeth and deepening in its menacing growl Down slave said the witch and at the sound of her voice the beast dropped at once covering its face with its brush and keeping only its quick vigilant eye fixed upon the invaders of its repose Come to the fire if ye will said she turning to Glaucus and his companions I never welcome living thing save the owl the fox the toad and the viper so I cannot welcome ye but come to the fire without welcome why stand upon form The language in which the hag addressed them was a strange and barbarous Latin interlarded with many words of some more rude and ancient dialect She did not stir from her seat but gazed stonily upon them as Glaucus now released Ione of her outer wrapping garments and making her place herself on a log of wood which was the only other seat he perceived at hand fanned with his breath the embers into a more glowing flame The slave encouraged by the boldness of her superiors divested herself also of her long palla and crept timorously to the opposite corner of the hearth We disturb you I fear said the silver voice of Ione in conciliation The witch did not reply she seemed like one who has awakened for a moment from the dead and has then relapsed once more into the eternal slumber Tell me said she suddenly and after a long pause are ye brother and sister No said Ione blushing Are ye married Not so replied Glaucus Ho lovers ha ha ha and the witch laughed so loud and so long that the caverns rang again The heart of Ione stood still at that strange mirth Glaucus muttered a rapid counterspell to the omen and the slave turned as pale as the cheek of the witch herself Why dost thou laugh old crone said Glaucus somewhat sternly as he concluded his invocation Did I laugh said the hag absently She is in her dotage whispered Glaucus as he said this he caught the eye of the hag fixed upon him with a malignant and vivid glare Thou liest said she abruptly Thou art an uncourteous welcomer returned Glaucus Hush provoke her not dear Glaucus whispered Ione I will tell thee why I laughed when I discovered ye were lovers said the old woman It was because it is a pleasure to the old and withered to look upon young hearts like yours and to know the time will come when you will loathe each other loathe loathe ha ha ha It was now Ione s turn to pray against the unpleasing prophecy The gods forbid said she Yet poor woman thou knowest little of love or thou wouldst know that it never changes Was I young once think ye returned the hag quickly and am I old and hideous and deathly now Such as is the form so is the heart With these words she sank again into a stillness profound and fearful as if the cessation of life itself Hast thou dwelt here long said Glaucus after a pause feeling uncomfortably oppressed beneath a silence so appalling Ah long yes It is but a drear abode Ha thou mayst well say that Hell is beneath us replied the hag pointing her bony finger to the earth And I will tell thee a secret the dim things below are preparing wrath for ye above you the young and the thoughtless and the beautiful Thou utterest but evil words ill becoming the hospitable said Glaucus and in future I will brave the tempest rather than thy welcome Thou wilt do well None should ever seek me save the wretched And why the wretched asked the Athenian I am the witch of the mountain replied the sorceress with a ghastly grin my trade is to give hope to the hopeless for the crossed in love I have philtres for the avaricious promises of treasure for the malicious potions of revenge for the happy and the good I have only what life has curses Trouble me no more With this the grim tenant of the cave relapsed into a silence so obstinate and sullen that Glaucus in vain endeavored to draw her into farther conversation She did not evince by any alteration of her locked and rigid features that she even heard him Fortunately however the storm which was brief as violent began now to relax the rain grew less and less fierce and at last as the clouds parted the moon burst forth in the purple opening of heaven and streamed clear and full into that desolate abode Never had she shone perhaps on a group more worthy of the painter s art The young the all beautiful Ione seated by that rude fire her lover already forgetful of the presence of the hag at her feet gazing upward to her face and whispering sweet words the pale and affrighted slave at a little distance and the ghastly hag resting her deadly eyes upon them yet seemingly serene and fearless for the companionship of love hath such power were these beautiful beings things of another sphere in that dark and unholy cavern with its gloomy quaintness of appurtenance The fox regarded them from his corner with his keen and fiery eye and as Glaucus now turned towards the witch he perceived for the first time just under her seat the bright gaze and crested head of a large snake whether it was that the vivid coloring of the Athenian s cloak thrown over the shoulders of Ione attracted the reptile s anger its crest began to glow and rise as if menacing and preparing itself to spring upon the Neapolitan Glaucus caught quickly at one of the half burned logs upon the hearth and as if enraged at the action the snake came forth from its shelter and with a loud hiss raised itself on end till its height nearly approached that of the Greek Witch cried Glaucus command thy creature or thou wilt see it dead It has been despoiled of its venom said the witch aroused at his threat but ere the words had left her lip the snake had sprung upon Glaucus quick and watchful the agile Greek leaped lightly aside and struck so fell and dexterous a blow on the head of the snake that it fell prostrate and writhing among the embers of the fire The hag sprung up and stood confronting Glaucus with a face which would have befitted the fiercest of the Furies so utterly dire and wrathful was its expression yet even in horror and ghastliness preserving the outline and trace of beauty and utterly free from that coarse grotesque at which the imaginations of the North have sought the source of terror Thou hast said she in a slow and steady voice which belied the expression of her face so much was it passionless and calm thou hast had shelter under my roof and warmth at my hearth thou hast returned evil for good thou hast smitten and haply slain the thing that loved me and was mine nay more the creature above all others consecrated to gods and deemed venerable by man now hear thy punishment By the moon who is the guardian of the sorceress by Orcus who is the treasurer of wrath I curse thee and thou art cursed May thy love be blasted may thy name be blackened may the infernals mark thee may thy heart wither and scorch may thy last hour recall to thee the prophet voice of the Saga of Vesuvius And thou she added turning sharply towards Ione and raising her right arm when Glaucus burst impetuously on her speech Hag cried he forbear Me thou hast cursed and I commit myself to the gods I defy and scorn thee but breathe but one word against yon maiden and I will convert the oath on thy foul lips to thy dying groan Beware I have done replied the hag laughing wildly for in thy doom is she who loves thee accursed And not the less that I heard her lips breathe thy name and know by what word to commend thee to the demons Glaucus thou art doomed So saying the witch turned from the Athenian and kneeling down beside her wounded favorite which she dragged from the hearth she turned to them her face no more O Glaucus said Ione greatly terrified what have we done Let us hasten from this place the storm has ceased Good mistress forgive him recall thy words he meant but to defend himself accept this peace offering to unsay the said and Ione stooping placed her purse on the hag s lap Away said she bitterly away The oath once woven the Fates only can untie Away Come dearest said Glaucus impatiently Thinkest thou that the gods above us or below hear the impotent ravings of dotage Come Long and loud rang the echoes of the cavern with the dread laugh of the Saga she deigned no further reply The lovers breathed more freely when they gained the open air yet the scene they had witnessed the words and the laughter of the witch still fearfully dwelt with Ione and even Glaucus could not thoroughly shake off the impression they bequeathed The storm had subsided save now and then a low thunder muttered at the distance amidst the darker clouds or a momentary flash of lightning affronted the sovereignty of the moon With some difficulty they regained the road where they found the vehicle already sufficiently repaired for their departure and the carrucarius calling loudly upon Hercules to tell him where his charge had vanished Glaucus vainly endeavored to cheer the exhausted spirits of Ione and scarce less vainly to recover the elastic tone of his own natural gaiety They soon arrived before the gate of the city as it opened to them a litter borne by slaves impeded the way It is too late for egress cried the sentinel to the inmate of the litter Not so said a voice which the lovers started to hear it was a voice they well recognized I am bound to the villa of Marcus Polybius I shall return shortly I am Arbaces the Egyptian The scruples of him at the gate were removed and the litter passed close beside the carriage that bore the lovers Arbaces at this hour scarce recovered too methinks Whither and for what can he leave the city said Glaucus Alas replied Ione bursting into tears my soul feels still more and more the omen of evil Preserve us O ye Gods or at least she murmured inly preserve my Glaucus Chapter X THE LORD OF THE BURNING BELT AND HIS MINION FATE WRITES HER PROPHECY IN RED LETTERS BUT WHO SHALL READ THEM ARBACES had tarried only till the cessation of the tempest allowed him under cover of night to seek the Saga of Vesuvius Borne by those of his trustier slaves in whom in all more secret expeditions he was accustomed to confide he lay extended along his litter and resigning his sanguine heart to the contemplation of vengeance gratified and love possessed The slaves in so short a journey moved very little slower than the ordinary pace of mules and Arbaces soon arrived at the commencement of a narrow path which the lovers had not been fortunate enough to discover but which skirting the thick vines led at once to the habitation of the witch Here he rested the litter and bidding his slaves conceal themselves and the vehicle among the vines from the observation of any chance passenger he mounted alone with steps still feeble but supported by a long staff the drear and sharp ascent Not a drop of rain fell from the tranquil heaven but the moisture dripped mournfully from the laden boughs of the vine and now and then collected in tiny pools in the crevices and hollows of the rocky way Strange passions these for a philosopher thought Arbaces that lead one like me just new from the bed of death and lapped even in health amidst the roses of luxury across such nocturnal paths as this but Passion and Vengeance treading to their goal can make an Elysium of a Tartarus High clear and melancholy shone the moon above the road of that dark wayfarer glossing herself in every pool that lay before him and sleeping in shadow along the sloping mount He saw before him the same light that had guided the steps of his intended victims but no longer contrasted by the blackened clouds it shone less redly clear He paused as at length he approached the mouth of the cavern to recover breath and then with his wonted collected and stately mien he crossed the unhallowed threshold The fox sprang up at the ingress of this newcomer and by a long howl announced another visitor to his mistress The witch had resumed her seat and her aspect of gravelike and grim repose By her feet upon a bed of dry weeds which half covered it lay the wounded snake but the quick eye of the Egyptian caught its scales glittering in the reflected light of the opposite fire as it writhed now contracting now lengthening its folds in pain and unsated anger Down slave said the witch as before to the fox and as before the animal dropped to the ground mute but vigilant Rise servant of Nox and Erebus said Arbaces commandingly a superior in thine art salutes thee rise and welcome him At these words the hag turned her gaze upon the Egyptian s towering form and dark features She looked long and fixedly upon him as he stood before her in his Oriental robe and folded arms and steadfast and haughty brow Who art thou she said at last that callest thyself greater in art than the Saga of the Burning Fields and the daughter of the perished Etrurian race I am he answered Arbaces from whom all cultivators of magic from north to south from east to west from the Ganges and the Nile to the vales of Thessaly and the shores of the yellow Tiber have stooped to learn There is but one such man in these places answered the witch whom the men of the outer world unknowing his loftier attributes and more secret fame call Arbaces the Egyptian to us of a higher nature and deeper knowledge his rightful appellation is Hermes of the Burning Girdle Look again returned Arbaces I am he As he spoke he drew aside his robe and revealed a cincture seemingly of fire that burned around his waist clasped in the centre by a plate whereon was engraven some sign apparently vague and unintelligible but which was evidently not unknown to the Saga She rose hastily and threw herself at the feet of Arbaces I have seen then said she in a voice of deep humility the Lord of the Mighty Girdle vouchsafe my homage Rise said the Egyptian I have need of thee So saying he placed himself on the same log of wood on which Ione had rested before and motioned to the witch to resume her seat Thou sayest said he as she obeyed that thou art a daughter of the ancient Etrurian tribes the mighty walls of whose rock built cities yet frown above the robber race that hath seized upon their ancient reign Partly came those tribes from Greece partly were they exiles from a more burning and primeval soil In either case art thou of Egyptian lineage for the Grecian masters of the aboriginal helot were among the restless sons whom the Nile banished from her bosom Equally then O Saga thy descent is from ancestors that swore allegiance to mine own By birth as by knowledge art thou the subject of Arbaces Hear me then and obey The witch bowed her head Whatever art we possess in sorcery continued Arbaces we are sometimes driven to natural means to attain our object The ring and the crystal and the ashes and the herbs do not give unerring divinations neither do the higher mysteries of the moon yield even the possessor of the girdle a dispensation from the necessity of employing ever and anon human measures for a human object Mark me then thou art deeply skilled methinks in the secrets of the more deadly herbs thou knowest those which arrest life which burn and scorch the soul from out her citadel or freeze the channels of young blood into that ice which no sun can melt Do I overrate thy skill Speak and truly Mighty Hermes such lore is indeed mine own Deign to look at these ghostly and corpse like features they have waned from the hues of life merely by watching over the rank herbs which simmer night and day in yon cauldron The Egyptian moved his seat from so unblessed or so unhealthful a vicinity as the witch spoke It is well said he thou hast learned that maxim of all the deeper knowledge which saith Despise the body to make wise the mind But to thy task There cometh to thee by to morrow s starlight a vain maiden seeking of thine art a love charm to fascinate from another the eyes that should utter but soft tales to her own instead of thy philtres give the maiden one of thy most powerful poisons Let the lover breathe his vows to the Shades The witch trembled from head to foot Oh pardon pardon dread master said she falteringly but this I dare not The law in these cities is sharp and vigilant they will seize they will slay me For what purpose then thy herbs and thy potions vain Saga said Arbaces sneeringly The witch hid her loathsome face with her hands Oh years ago said she in a voice unlike her usual tones so plaintive was it and so soft I was not the thing that I am now I loved I fancied myself beloved And what connection hath thy love witch with my commands said Arbaces impetuously Patience resumed the witch patience I implore I loved another and less fair than I yes by Nemesis less fair allured from me my chosen I was of that dark Etrurian tribe to whom most of all were known the secrets of the gloomier magic My mother was herself a saga she shared the resentment of her child from her hands I received the potion that was to restore me his love and from her also the poison that was to destroy my rival Oh crush me dread walls my trembling hands mistook the phials my lover fell indeed at my feet but dead dead dead Since then what has been life to me I became suddenly old I devoted myself to the sorceries of my race still by an irresistible impulse I curse myself with an awful penance still I seek the most noxious herbs still I concoct the poisons still I imagine that I am to give them to my hated rival still I pour them into the phial still I fancy that they shall blast her beauty to the dust still I wake and see the quivering body the foaming lips the glazing eyes of my Aulus murdered and by me The skeleton frame of the witch shook beneath strong convulsions Arbaces gazed upon her with a curious though contemptuous eye And this foul thing has yet human emotions thought he still she cowers over the ashes of the same fire that consumes Arbaces Such are we all Mystic is the tie of those mortal passions that unite the greatest and the least He did not reply till she had somewhat recovered herself and now sat rocking to and fro in her seat with glassy eyes fixed on the opposite flame and large tears rolling down her livid cheeks A grievous tale is thine in truth said Arbaces But these emotions are fit only for our youth age should harden our hearts to all things but ourselves as every year adds a scale to the shell fish so should each year wall and incrust the heart Think of those frenzies no more And now listen to me again By the revenge that was dear to thee I command thee to obey me it is for vengeance that I seek thee This youth whom I would sweep from my path has crossed me despite my spells this thing of purple and broidery of smiles and glances soulless and mindless with no charm but that of beauty accursed be it this insect this Glaucus I tell thee by Orcus and by Nemesis he must die And working himself up at every word the Egyptian forgetful of his debility of his strange companion of everything but his own vindictive rage strode with large and rapid steps the gloomy cavern Glaucus saidst thou mighty master said the witch abruptly and her dim eye glared at the name with all that fierce resentment at the memory of small affronts so common amongst the solitary and the shunned Ay so he is called but what matters the name Let it not be heard as that of a living man three days from this date Hear me said the witch breaking from a short reverie into which she was plunged after this last sentence of the Egyptian Hear me I am thy thing and thy slave spare me If I give to the maiden thou speakest of that which would destroy the life of Glaucus I shall be surely detected the dead ever find avengers Nay dread man if thy visit to me be tracked if thy hatred to Glaucus be known thou mayest have need of thy archest magic to protect thyself Ha said Arbaces stopping suddenly short and as a proof of that blindness with which passion darkens the eyes even of the most acute this was the first time when the risk that he himself ran by this method of vengeance had occurred to a mind ordinarily wary and circumspect But continued the witch if instead of that which shall arrest the heart I give that which shall sear and blast the brain which shall make him who quaffs it unfit for the uses and career of life an abject raving benighted thing smiting sense to drivelling youth to dotage will not thy vengeance be equally sated thy object equally attained Oh witch no longer the servant but the sister the equal of Arbaces how much brighter is woman s wit even in vengeance than ours how much more exquisite than death is such a doom And continued the hag gloating over her fell scheme in this is but little danger for by ten thousand methods which men forbear to seek can our victim become mad He may have been among the vines and seen a nymph or the vine itself may have had the same effect ha ha they never inquire too scrupulously into these matters in which the gods may be agents And let the worst arrive let it be known that it is a love charm why madness is a common effect of philtres and even the fair she that gave it finds indulgence in the excuse Mighty Hermes have I ministered to thee cunningly Thou shalt have twenty years longer date for this returned Arbaces I will write anew the epoch of thy fate on the face of the pale stars thou shalt not serve in vain the Master of the Flaming Belt And here Saga carve thee out by these golden tools a warmer cell in this dreary cavern one service to me shall countervail a thousand divinations by sieve and shears to the gaping rustics So saying he cast upon the floor a heavy purse which clinked not unmusically to the ear of the hag who loved the consciousness of possessing the means to purchase comforts she disdained Farewell said Arbaces fail not outwatch the stars in concocting thy beverage thou shalt lord it over thy sisters at the Walnut tree when thou tellest them that thy patron and thy friend is Hermes the Egyptian To morrow night we meet again He stayed not to hear the valediction or the thanks of the witch with a quick step he passed into the moonlit air and hastened down the mountain The witch who followed his steps to the threshold stood at the entrance of the cavern gazing fixedly on his receding form and as the sad moonlight streamed over her shadowy form and deathlike face emerging from the dismal rocks it seemed as if one gifted indeed by supernatural magic had escaped from the dreary Orcus and the foremost of its ghostly throng stood at its black portals vainly summoning his return or vainly sighing to rejoin him The hag then slowly re entering the cave groaningly picked up the heavy purse took the lamp from its stand and passing to the remotest depth of her cell a black and abrupt passage which was not visible save at a near approach closed round as it was with jutting and sharp crags yawned before her she went several yards along this gloomy path which sloped gradually downwards as if towards the bowels of the earth and lifting a stone deposited her treasure in a hole beneath which as the lamp pierced its secrets seemed already to contain coins of various value wrung from the credulity or gratitude of her visitors I love to look at you said she apostrophising the moneys for when I see you I feel that I am indeed of power And I am to have twenty years longer life to increase your store O thou great Hermes She replaced the stone and continued her path onward for some paces when she stopped before a deep irregular fissure in the earth Here as she bent strange rumbling hoarse and distant sounds might be heard while ever and anon with a loud and grating noise which to use a homely but faithful simile seemed to resemble the grinding of steel upon wheels volumes of streaming and dark smoke issued forth and rushed spirally along the cavern The Shades are noisier than their wont said the hag shaking her grey locks and looking into the cavity she beheld far down glimpses of a long streak of light intensely but darkly red Strange she said shrinking back it is only within the last two days that dull deep light hath been visible what can it portend The fox who had attended the steps of his fell mistress uttered a dismal howl and ran cowering back to the inner cave a cold shuddering seized the hag herself at the cry of the animal which causeless as it seemed the superstitions of the time considered deeply ominous She muttered her placatory charm and tottered back into her cavern where amidst her herbs and incantations she prepared to execute the orders of the Egyptian He called me dotard said she as the smoke curled from the hissing cauldron when the jaws drop and the grinders fall and the heart scarce beats it is a pitiable thing to dote but when she added with a savage and exulting grin the young and the beautiful and the strong are suddenly smitten into idiocy ah that is terrible Burn flame simmer herb swelter toad I cursed him and he shall be cursed On that night and at the same hour which witnessed the dark and unholy interview between Arbaces and the Saga Apaecides was baptized Chapter XI PROGRESS OF EVENTS THE PLOT THICKENS THE WEB IS WOVEN BUT THE NET CHANGES HANDS AND you have the courage then Julia to seek the Witch of Vesuvius this evening in company too with that fearful man Why Nydia replied Julia timidly dost thou really think there is anything to dread These old hags with their enchanted mirrors their trembling sieves and their moon gathered herbs are I imagine but crafty impostors who have learned perhaps nothing but the very charm for which I apply to their skill and which is drawn but from the knowledge of the field s herbs and simples Wherefore should I dread Dost thou not fear thy companion What Arbaces By Dian I never saw lover more courteous than that same magician And were he not so dark he would be even handsome Blind as she was Nydia had the penetration to perceive that Julia s mind was not one that the gallantries of Arbaces were likely to terrify She therefore dissuaded her no more but nursed in her excited heart the wild and increasing desire to know if sorcery had indeed a spell to fascinate love to love Let me go with thee noble Julia said she at length my presence is no protection but I should like to be beside thee to the last Thine offer pleases me much replied the daughter of Diomed Yet how canst thou contrive it we may not return until late they will miss thee Ione is indulgent replied Nydia If thou wilt permit me to sleep beneath thy roof I will say that thou an early patroness and friend hast invited me to pass the day with thee and sing thee my Thessalian songs her courtesy will readily grant to thee so light a boon Nay ask for thyself said the haughty Julia I stoop to request no favor from the Neapolitan Well be it so I will take my leave now make my request which I know will be readily granted and return shortly Do so and thy bed shall be prepared in my own chamber With that Nydia left the fair Pompeian On her way back to Ione she was met by the chariot of Glaucus on whose fiery and curveting steeds was riveted the gaze of the crowded street He kindly stopped for a moment to speak to the flower girl Blooming as thine own roses my gentle Nydia and how is thy fair mistress recovered I trust from the effects of the storm I have not seen her this morning answered Nydia but But what draw back the horses are too near thee But think you Ione will permit me to pass the day with Julia the daughter of Diomed She wishes it and was kind to me when I had few friends The gods bless thy grateful heart I will answer for Ione s permission Then I may stay over the night and return to morrow said Nydia shrinking from the praise she so little merited As thou and fair Julia please Commend me to her and hark ye Nydia when thou hearest her speak note the contrast of her voice with that of the silver toned Ione Vale His spirits entirely recovered from the effect of the past night his locks waving in the wind his joyous and elastic heart bounding with every spring of his Parthian steeds a very prototype of his country s god full of youth and of love Glaucus was borne rapidly to his mistress Enjoy while ye may the present who can read the future As the evening darkened Julia reclined within her litter which was capacious enough also to admit her blind companion took her way to the rural baths indicated by Arbaces To her natural levity of disposition her enterprise brought less of terror than of pleasurable excitement above all she glowed at the thought of her coming triumph over the hated Neapolitan A small but gay group was collected round the door of the villa as her litter passed by it to the private entrance of the baths appropriated to the women Methinks by this dim light said one of the bystanders I recognize the slaves of Diomed True Clodius said Sallust it is probably the litter of his daughter Julia She is rich my friend why dost thou not proffer thy suit to her Why I had once hoped that Glaucus would have married her She does not disguise her attachment and then as he gambles freely and with ill success The sesterces would have passed to thee wise Clodius A wife is a good thing when it belongs to another man But continued Clodius as Glaucus is I understand to wed the Neapolitan I think I must even try my chance with the dejected maid After all the lamp of Hymen will be gilt and the vessel will reconcile one to the odor of the flame I shall only protest my Sallust against Diomed s making thee trustee to his daughter s fortune Ha ha let us within my comissator the wine and the garlands wait us Dismissing her slaves to that part of the house set apart for their entertainment Julia entered the baths with Nydia and declining the offers of the attendants passed by a private door into the garden behind She comes by appointment be sure said one of the slaves What is that to thee said a superintendent sourly she pays for the baths and does not waste the saffron Such appointments are the best part of the trade Hark do you not hear the widow Fulvia clapping her hands Run fool run Julia and Nydia avoiding the more public part of the garden arrived at the place specified by the Egyptian In a small circular plot of grass the stars gleamed upon the statue of Silenus the merry god reclined upon a fragment of rock the lynx of Bacchus at his feet and over his mouth he held with extended arm a bunch of grapes which he seemingly laughed to welcome ere he devoured I see not the magician said Julia looking round when as she spoke the Egyptian slowly emerged from the neighboring foliage and the light fell palely over his sweeping robes Salve sweet maiden But ha whom hast thou here we must have no companions It is but the blind flower girl wise magician replied Julia herself a Thessalian Oh Nydia said the Egyptian I know her well Nydia drew back and shuddered Thou hast been at my house methinks said he approaching his voice to Nydia s ear thou knowest the oath Silence and secrecy now as then or beware Yet he added musingly to himself why confide more than is necessary even in the blind Julia canst thou trust thyself alone with me Believe me the magician is less formidable than he seems As he spoke he gently drew Julia aside The witch loves not many visitors at once said he leave Nydia here till your return she can be of no assistance to us and for protection your own beauty suffices your own beauty and your own rank yes Julia I know thy name and birth Come trust thyself with me fair rival of the youngest of the Naiads The vain Julia was not as we have seen easily affrighted she was moved by the flattery of Arbaces and she readily consented to suffer Nydia to await her return nor did Nydia press her presence At the sound of the Egyptian s voice all her terror of him returned she felt a sentiment of pleasure at learning she was not to travel in his companionship She returned to the Bath house and in one of the private chambers waited their return Many and bitter were the thoughts of this wild girl as she sat there in her eternal darkness She thought of her own desolate fate far from her native land far from the bland cares that once assuaged the April sorrows of childhood deprived of the light of day with none but strangers to guide her steps accursed by the one soft feeling of her heart loving and without hope save the dim and unholy ray which shot across her mind as her Thessalian fancies questioned of the force of spells and the gifts of magic Nature had sown in the heart of this poor girl the seeds of virtue never destined to ripen The lessons of adversity are not always salutary sometimes they soften and amend but as often they indurate and pervert If we consider ourselves more harshly treated by fate than those around us and do not acknowledge in our own deeds the justice of the severity we become too apt to deem the world our enemy to case ourselves in defiance to wrestle against our softer self and to indulge the darker passions which are so easily fermented by the sense of injustice Sold early into slavery sentenced to a sordid taskmaster exchanging her situation only yet more to embitter her lot the kindlier feelings naturally profuse in the breast of Nydia were nipped and blighted Her sense of right and wrong was confused by a passion to which she had so madly surrendered herself and the same intense and tragic emotions which we read of in the women of the classic age a Myrrha a Medea and which hurried and swept away the whole soul when once delivered to love ruled and rioted in her breast Time passed a light step entered the chamber where Nydia yet indulged her gloomy meditations Oh thanked be the immortal gods said Julia I have returned I have left that terrible cavern Come Nydia let us away forthwith It was not till they were seated in the litter that Julia again spoke Oh said she tremblingly such a scene such fearful incantations and the dead face of the hag But let us talk not of it I have obtained the potion she pledges its effect My rival shall be suddenly indifferent to his eye and I I alone the idol of Glaucus Glaucus exclaimed Nydia Ay I told thee girl at first that it was not the Athenian whom I loved but I see now that I may trust thee wholly it is the beautiful Greek What then were Nydia s emotions she had connived she had assisted in tearing Glaucus from Ione but only to transfer by all the power of magic his affections yet more hopelessly to another Her heart swelled almost to suffocation she gasped for breath in the darkness of the vehicle Julia did not perceive the agitation of her companion she went on rapidly dilating on the promised effect of her acquisition and on her approaching triumph over Ione every now and then abruptly digressing to the horror of the scene she had quitted the unmoved mien of Arbaces and his authority over the dreadful Saga Meanwhile Nydia recovered her self possession a thought flashed across her she slept in the chamber of Julia she might possess herself of the potion They arrived at the house of Diomed and descended to Julia s apartment where the night s repast awaited them Drink Nydia thou must be cold the air was chill to night as for me my veins are yet ice And Julia unhesitatingly quaffed deep draughts of the spiced wine Thou hast the potion said Nydia let me hold it in my hands How small the phial is of what color is the draught Clear as crystal replied Julia as she retook the philtre thou couldst not tell it from this water The witch assures me it is tasteless Small though the phial it suffices for a life s fidelity it is to be poured into any liquid and Glaucus will only know what he has quaffed by the effect Exactly like this water in appearance Yes sparkling and colorless as this How bright it seems it is as the very essence of moonlit dews Bright thing how thou shinest on my hopes through thy crystal vase And how is it sealed But by one little stopper I withdraw it now the draught gives no odor Strange that that which speaks to neither sense should thus command all Is the effect instantaneous Usually but sometimes it remains dormant for a few hours Oh how sweet is this perfume said Nydia suddenly as she took up a small bottle on the table and bent over its fragrant contents Thinkest thou so the bottle is set with gems of some value Thou wouldst not have the bracelet yestermorn wilt thou take the bottle It ought to be such perfumes as these that should remind one who cannot see of the generous Julia If the bottle be not too costly Oh I have a thousand costlier ones take it child Nydia bowed her gratitude and placed the bottle in her vest And the draught would be equally efficacious whoever administers it If the most hideous hag beneath the sun bestowed it such is its asserted virtue that Glaucus would deem her beautiful and none but her Julia warmed by wine and the reaction of her spirits was now all animation and delight she laughed loud and talked on a hundred matters nor was it till the night had advanced far towards morning that she summoned her slaves and undressed When they were dismissed she said to Nydia I will not suffer this holy draught to quit my presence till the hour comes for its use Lie under my pillow bright spirit and give me happy dreams So saying she placed the potion under her pillow Nydia s heart beat violently Why dost thou drink that unmixed water Nydia Take the wine by its side I am fevered replied the blind girl and the water cools me I will place this bottle by my bedside it refreshes in these summer nights when the dews of sleep fall not on our lips Fair Julia I must leave thee very early so Ione bids perhaps before thou art awake accept therefore now my congratulations Thanks when next we meet you may find Glaucus at my feet They had retired to their couches and Julia worn out by the excitement of the day soon slept But anxious and burning thoughts rolled over the mind of the wakeful Thessalian She listened to the calm breathing of Julia and her ear accustomed to the finest distinctions of sound speedily assured her of the deep slumber of her companion Now befriend me Venus said she softly She rose gently and poured the perfume from the gift of Julia upon the marble floor she rinsed it several times carefully with the water that was beside her and then easily finding the bed of Julia for night to her was as day she pressed her trembling hand under the pillow and seized the potion Julia stirred not her breath regularly fanned the burning cheek of the blind girl Nydia then opening the phial poured its contents into the bottle which easily contained them and then refilling the former reservoir of the potion with that limpid water which Julia had assured her it so resembled she once more placed the phial in its former place She then stole again to her couch and waited with what thoughts the dawning day The sun had risen Julia slept still Nydia noiselessly dressed herself placed her treasure carefully in her vest took up her staff and hastened to quit the house The porter Medon saluted her kindly as she descended the steps that led to the street she heard him not her mind was confused and lost in the whirl of tumultuous thoughts each thought a passion She felt the pure morning air upon her cheek but it cooled not her scorching veins Glaucus she murmured all the love charms of the wildest magic could not make thee love me as I love thee Ione ah away hesitation away remorse Glaucus my fate is in thy smile and thine hope O joy O transport thy fate is in these hands BOOK THE FOURTH Chapter I REFLECTIONS ON THE ZEAL OF THE EARLY CHRISTIANS TWO MEN COME TO A PERILOUS RESOLVE WALLS HAVE EARS PARTICULARLY SACRED WALLS WHOEVER regards the early history of Christianity will perceive how necessary to its triumph was that fierce spirit of zeal which fearing no danger accepting no compromise inspired its champions and sustained its martyrs In a dominant Church the genius of intolerance betrays its cause in a weak and persecuted Church the same genius mainly supports It was necessary to scorn to loathe to abhor the creeds of other men in order to conquer the temptations which they presented it was necessary rigidly to believe not only that the Gospel was the true faith but the sole true faith that saved in order to nerve the disciple to the austerity of its doctrine and to encourage him to the sacred and perilous chivalry of converting the Polytheist and the Heathen The sectarian sternness which confined virtue and heaven to a chosen few which saw demons in other gods and the penalties of hell in other religions made the believer naturally anxious to convert all to whom he felt the ties of human affection and the circle thus traced by benevolence to man was yet more widened by a desire for the glory of God It was for the honour of the Christian faith that the Christian boldly forced its tenets upon the scepticism of some the repugnance of others the sage contempt of the philosopher the pious shudder of the people his very intolerance supplied him with his fittest instruments of success and the soft Heathen began at last to imagine there must indeed be something holy in a zeal wholly foreign to his experience which stopped at no obstacle dreaded no danger and even at the torture or on the scaffold referred a dispute far other than the calm differences of speculative philosophy to the tribunal of an Eternal Judge It was thus that the same fervor which made the Churchman of the middle age a bigot without mercy made the Christian of the early days a hero without fear Of these more fiery daring and earnest natures not the least ardent was Olinthus No sooner had Apaecides been received by the rites of baptism into the bosom of the Church than the Nazarene hastened to make him conscious of the impossibility to retain the office and robes of priesthood He could not it was evident profess to worship God and continue even outwardly to honour the idolatrous altars of the Fiend Nor was this all the sanguine and impetuous mind of Olinthus beheld in the power of Apaecides the means of divulging to the deluded people the juggling mysteries of the oracular Isis He thought Heaven had sent this instrument of his design in order to disabuse the eyes of the crowd and prepare the way perchance for the conversion of a whole city He did not hesitate then to appeal to all the new kindled enthusiasm of Apaecides to arouse his courage and to stimulate his zeal They met according to previous agreement the evening after the baptism of Apaecides in the grove of Cybele which we have before described At the next solemn consultation of the oracle said Olinthus as he proceeded in the warmth of his address advance yourself to the railing proclaim aloud to the people the deception they endure invite them to enter to be themselves the witness of the gross but artful mechanism of imposture thou hast described to me Fear not the Lord who protected Daniel shall protect thee we the community of Christians will be amongst the crowd we will urge on the shrinking and in the first flush of the popular indignation and shame I myself upon those very altars will plant the palm branch typical of the Gospel and to my tongue shall descend the rushing Spirit of the living God Heated and excited as he was this suggestion was not unpleasing to Apaecides He was rejoiced at so early an opportunity of distinguishing his faith in his new sect and to his holier feelings were added those of a vindictive loathing at the imposition he had himself suffered and a desire to avenge it In that sanguine and elastic overbound of obstacles the rashness necessary to all who undertake venturous and lofty actions neither Olinthus nor the proselyte perceived the impediments to the success of their scheme which might be found in the reverent superstition of the people themselves who would probably be loth before the sacred altars of the great Egyptian goddess to believe even the testimony of her priest against her power Apaecides then assented to this proposal with a readiness which delighted Olinthus They parted with the understanding that Olinthus should confer with the more important of his Christian brethren on his great enterprise should receive their advice and the assurances of their support on the eventful day It so chanced that one of the festivals of Isis was to be held on the second day after this conference The festival proffered a ready occasion for the design They appointed to meet once more on the next evening at the same spot and in that meeting were finally to be settled the order and details of the disclosure for the following day It happened that the latter part of this conference had been held near the sacellum or small chapel which I have described in the early part of this work and so soon as the forms of the Christian and the priest had disappeared from the grove a dark and ungainly figure emerged from behind the chapel I have tracked you with some effect my brother flamen soliloquised the eavesdropper you the priest of Isis have not for mere idle discussion conferred with this gloomy Christian Alas that I could not hear all your precious plot enough I find at least that you meditate revealing the sacred mysteries and that to morrow you meet again at this place to plan the how and the when May Osiris sharpen my ears then to detect the whole of your unheard of audacity When I have learned more I must confer at once with Arbaces We will frustrate you my friends deep as you think yourselves At present my breast is a locked treasury of your secret Thus muttering Calenus for it was he wrapped his robe round him and strode thoughtfully homeward Chapter II A CLASSIC HOST COOK AND KITCHEN APAECIDES SEEKS IONE THEIR CONVERSATION IT was then the day for Diomed s banquet to the most select of his friends The graceful Glaucus the beautiful Ione the official Pansa the high born Clodius the immortal Fulvius the exquisite Lepidus the epicurean Sallust were not the only honourers of his festival He expected also an invalid senator from Rome a man of considerable repute and favor at court and a great warrior from Herculaneum who had fought with Titus against the Jews and having enriched himself prodigiously in the wars was always told by his friends that his country was eternally indebted to his disinterested exertions The party however extended to a yet greater number for although critically speaking it was at one time thought inelegant among the Romans to entertain less than three or more than nine at their banquets yet this rule was easily disregarded by the ostentatious And we are told indeed in history that one of the most splendid of these entertainers usually feasted a select party of three hundred Diomed however more modest contented himself with doubling the number of the Muses His party consisted of eighteen no unfashionable number in the present day It was the morning of Diomed s banquet and Diomed himself though he greatly affected the gentleman and the scholar retained enough of his mercantile experience to know that a master s eye makes a ready servant Accordingly with his tunic ungirdled on his portly stomach his easy slippers on his feet a small wand in his hand wherewith he now directed the gaze and now corrected the back of some duller menial he went from chamber to chamber of his costly villa He did not disdain even a visit to that sacred apartment in which the priests of the festival prepare their offerings On entering the kitchen his ears were agreeably stunned by the noise of dishes and pans of oaths and commands Small as this indispensable chamber seems to have been in all the houses of Pompeii it was nevertheless usually fitted up with all that amazing variety of stoves and shapes stew pans and saucepans cutters and moulds without which a cook of spirit no matter whether he be an ancient or a modern declares it utterly impossible that he can give you anything to eat And as fuel was then as now dear and scarce in those regions great seems to have been the dexterity exercised in preparing as many things as possible with as little fire An admirable contrivance of this nature may be still seen in the Neapolitan Museum viz a portable kitchen about the size of a folio volume containing stoves for four dishes and an apparatus for heating water or other beverages Across the small kitchen flitted many forms which the quick eye of the master did not recognize Oh oh grumbled he to himself that cursed Congrio hath invited a whole legion of cooks to assist him They won t serve for nothing and this is another item in the total of my day s expenses By Bacchus thrice lucky shall I be if the slaves do not help themselves to some of the drinking vessels ready alas are their hands capacious are their tunics Me miserum The cooks however worked on seemingly heedless of the apparition of Diomed Ho Euclio your egg pan What is this the largest it only holds thirty three eggs in the houses I usually serve the smallest egg pan holds fifty if need be The unconscionable rogue thought Diomed he talks of eggs as if they were a sesterce a hundred By Mercury cried a pert little culinary disciple scarce in his novitiate whoever saw such antique sweetmeat shapes as these It is impossible to do credit to one s art with such rude materials Why Sallust s commonest sweetmeat shape represents the whole siege of Troy Hector and Paris and Helen with little Astyanax and the Wooden Horse into the bargain Silence fool said Congrio the cook of the house who seemed to leave the chief part of the battle to his allies My master Diomed is not one of those expensive good for noughts who must have the last fashion cost what it will Thou liest base slave cried Diomed in a great passion and thou costest me already enough to have ruined Lucullus himself Come out of thy den I want to talk to thee The slave with a sly wink at his confederates obeyed the command Man of three letters said Diomed with his face of solemn anger how didst thou dare to invite all those rascals into my house I see thief written in every line of their faces Yet I assure you master that they are men of most respectable character the best cooks of the place it is a great favor to get them But for my sake Thy sake unhappy Congrio interrupted Diomed and by what purloined moneys of mine by what reserved filchings from marketing by what goodly meats converted into grease and sold in the suburbs by what false charges for bronzes marred and earthenware broken hast thou been enabled to make them serve thee for thy sake Nay master do not impeach my honesty May the gods desert me if Swear not again interrupted the choleric Diomed for then the gods will smite thee for a perjurer and I shall lose my cook on the eve of dinner But enough of this at present keep a sharp eye on thy ill favored assistants and tell me no tales to morrow of vases broken and cups miraculously vanished or thy whole back shall be one pain And hark thee thou knowest thou hast made me pay for those Phrygian attagens enough by Hercules to have feasted a sober man for a year together see that they be not one iota over roasted The last time O Congrio that I gave a banquet to my friends when thy vanity did so boldly undertake the becoming appearance of a Melian crane thou knowest it came up like a stone from AEtna as if all the fires of Phlegethon had been scorching out its juices Be modest this time Congrio wary and modest Modesty is the nurse of great actions and in all other things as in this if thou wilt not spare thy master s purse at least consult thy master s glory There shall not be such a coena seen at Pompeii since the days of Hercules Softly softly thy cursed boasting again But I say Congrio yon homunculus yon pigmy assailant of my cranes yon pert tongued neophyte of the kitchen was there aught but insolence on his tongue when he maligned the comeliness of my sweetmeat shapes I would not be out of the fashion Congrio It is but the custom of us cooks replied Congrio gravely to undervalue our tools in order to increase the effect of our art The sweetmeat shape is a fair shape and a lovely but I would recommend my master at the first occasion to purchase some new ones of a That will suffice exclaimed Diomed who seemed resolved never to allow his slave to finish his sentences Now resume thy charge shine eclipse thyself Let men envy Diomed his cook let the slaves of Pompeii style thee Congrio the great Go yet stay thou hast not spent all the moneys I gave thee for the marketing All alas the nightingales tongues and the Roman tomacula and the oysters from Britain and sundry other things too numerous now to recite are yet left unpaid for But what matter every one trusts the Archimagirus of Diomed the wealthy Oh unconscionable prodigal what waste what profusion I am ruined But go hasten inspect taste perform surpass thyself Let the Roman senator not despise the poor Pompeian Away slave and remember the Phrygian attagens The chief disappeared within his natural domain and Diomed rolled back his portly presence to the more courtly chambers All was to his liking the flowers were fresh the fountains played briskly the mosaic pavements were as smooth as mirrors Where is my daughter Julia he asked At the bath Ah that reminds me time wanes and I must bathe also Our story returns to Apaecides On awaking that day from the broken and feverish sleep which had followed his adoption of a faith so strikingly and sternly at variance with that in which his youth had been nurtured the young priest could scarcely imagine that he was not yet in a dream he had crossed the fatal river the past was henceforth to have no sympathy with the future the two worlds were distinct and separate that which had been from that which was to be To what a bold and adventurous enterprise he had pledged his life to unveil the mysteries in which he had participated to desecrate the altars he had served to denounce the goddess whose ministering robe he wore Slowly he became sensible of the hatred and the horror he should provoke amongst the pious even if successful if frustrated in his daring attempt what penalties might he not incur for an offence hitherto unheard of for which no specific law derived from experience was prepared and which for that very reason precedents dragged from the sharpest armoury of obsolete and inapplicable legislation would probably be distorted to meet His friends the sister of his youth could he expect justice though he might receive compassion from them This brave and heroic act would by their heathen eyes be regarded perhaps as a heinous apostasy at the best as a pitiable madness He dared he renounced everything in this world in the hope of securing that eternity in the next which had so suddenly been revealed to him While these thoughts on the one hand invaded his breast on the other hand his pride his courage and his virtue mingled with reminiscences of revenge for deceit of indignant disgust at fraud conspired to raise and to support him The conflict was sharp and keen but his new feelings triumphed over his old and a mighty argument in favor of wrestling with the sanctities of old opinions and hereditary forms might be found in the conquest over both achieved by that humble priest Had the early Christians been more controlled by the solemn plausibilities of custom less of democrats in the pure and lofty acceptation of that perverted word Christianity would have perished in its cradle As each priest in succession slept several nights together in the chambers of the temple the term imposed on Apaecides was not yet completed and when he had risen from his couch attired himself as usual in his robes and left his narrow chamber he found himself before the altars of the temple In the exhaustion of his late emotions he had slept far into the morning and the vertical sun already poured its fervid beams over the sacred place Salve Apaecides said a voice whose natural asperity was smoothed by long artifice into an almost displeasing softness of tone Thou art late abroad has the goddess revealed herself to thee in visions Could she reveal her true self to the people Calenus how incenseless would be these altars That replied Calenus may possibly be true but the deity is wise enough to hold commune with none but priests A time may come when she will be unveiled without her own acquiescence It is not likely she has triumphed for countless ages And that which has so long stood the test of time rarely succumbs to the lust of novelty But hark ye young brother these sayings are indiscreet It is not for thee to silence them replied Apaecides haughtily So hot yet I will not quarrel with thee Why my Apaecides has not the Egyptian convinced thee of the necessity of our dwelling together in unity Has he not convinced thee of the wisdom of deluding the people and enjoying ourselves If not oh brother he is not that great magician he is esteemed Thou then hast shared his lessons said Apaecides with a hollow smile Ay but I stood less in need of them than thou Nature had already gifted me with the love of pleasure and the desire of gain and power Long is the way that leads the voluptuary to the severities of life but it is only one step from pleasant sin to sheltering hypocrisy Beware the vengeance of the goddess if the shortness of that step be disclosed Beware thou the hour when the tomb shall be rent and the rottenness exposed returned Apaecides solemnly Vale With these words he left the flamen to his meditations When he got a few paces from the temple he turned to look back Calenus had already disappeared in the entry room of the priests for it now approached the hour of that repast which called prandium by the ancients answers in point of date to the breakfast of the moderns The white and graceful fane gleamed brightly in the sun Upon the altars before it rose the incense and bloomed the garlands The priest gazed long and wistfully upon the scene it was the last time that it was ever beheld by him He then turned and pursued his way slowly towards the house of Ione for before possibly the last tie that united them was cut in twain before the uncertain peril of the next day was incurred he was anxious to see his last surviving relative his fondest as his earliest friend He arrived at her house and found her in the garden with Nydia This is kind Apaecides said Ione joyfully and how eagerly have I wished to see thee what thanks do I not owe thee How churlish hast thou been to answer none of my letters to abstain from coming hither to receive the expressions of my gratitude Oh thou hast assisted to preserve thy sister from dishonour What what can she say to thank thee now thou art come at last My sweet Ione thou owest me no gratitude for thy cause was mine Let us avoid that subject let us recur not to that impious man how hateful to both of us I may have a speedy opportunity to teach the world the nature of his pretended wisdom and hypocritical severity But let us sit down my sister I am wearied with the heat of the sun let us sit in yonder shade and for a little while longer be to each other what we have been Beneath a wide plane tree with the cistus and the arbutus clustering round them the living fountain before the greensward beneath their feet the gay cicada once so dear to Athens rising merrily ever and anon amidst the grass the butterfly beautiful emblem of the soul dedicated to Psyche and which has continued to furnish illustrations to the Christian bard rich in the glowing colors caught from Sicilian skies hovering about the sunny flowers itself like a winged flower in this spot and this scene the brother and the sister sat together for the last time on earth You may tread now on the same place but the garden is no more the columns are shattered the fountain has ceased to play Let the traveler search amongst the ruins of Pompeii for the house of Ione Its remains are yet visible but I will not betray them to the gaze of commonplace tourists He who is more sensitive than the herd will discover them easily when he has done so let him keep the secret They sat down and Nydia glad to be alone retired to the farther end of the garden Ione my sister said the young convert place your hand upon my brow let me feel your cool touch Speak to me too for your gentle voice is like a breeze that hath freshness as well as music Speak to me but forbear to bless me Utter not one word of those forms of speech which our childhood was taught to consider sacred Alas and what then shall I say Our language of affection is so woven with that of worship that the words grow chilled and trite if I banish from them allusion to our gods Our gods murmured Apaecides with a shudder thou slightest my request already Shall I speak then to thee only of Isis The Evil Spirit No rather be dumb for ever unless at least thou canst but away away this talk Not now will we dispute and cavil not now will we judge harshly of each other Thou regarding me as an apostate and I all sorrow and shame for thee as an idolater No my sister let us avoid such topics and such thoughts In thy sweet presence a calm falls over my spirit For a little while I forget As I thus lay my temples on thy bosom as I thus feel thy gentle arm embrace me I think that we are children once more and that the heaven smiles equally upon both For oh if hereafter I escape no matter what peril and it be permitted me to address thee on one sacred and awful subject should I find thine ear closed and thy heart hardened what hope for myself could countervail the despair for thee In thee my sister I behold a likeness made beautiful made noble of myself Shall the mirror live for ever and the form itself be broken as the potter s clay Ah no no thou wilt listen to me yet Dost thou remember how we went into the fields by Baiae hand in hand together to pluck the flowers of spring Even so hand in hand shall we enter the Eternal Garden and crown ourselves with imperishable asphodel Wondering and bewildered by words she could not comprehend but excited even to tears by the plaintiveness of their tone Ione listened to these outpourings of a full and oppressed heart In truth Apaecides himself was softened much beyond his ordinary mood which to outward seeming was usually either sullen or impetuous For the noblest desires are of a jealous nature they engross they absorb the soul and often leave the splenetic humors stagnant and unheeded at the surface Unheeding the petty things around us we are deemed morose impatient at earthly interruption to the diviner dreams we are thought irritable and churlish For as there is no chimera vainer than the hope that one human heart shall find sympathy in another so none ever interpret us with justice and none no not our nearest and our dearest ties forbear with us in mercy When we are dead and repentance comes too late both friend and foe may wonder to think how little there was in us to forgive I will talk to thee then of our early years said Ione Shall yon blind girl sing to thee of the days of childhood Her voice is sweet and musical and she hath a song on that theme which contains none of those allusions it pains thee to hear Dost thou remember the words my sister asked Apaecides Methinks yes for the tune which is simple fixed them on my memory Sing to me then thyself My ear is not in unison with unfamiliar voices and thine Ione full of household associations has ever been to me more sweet than all the hireling melodies of Lycia or of Crete Sing to me Ione beckoned to a slave that stood in the portico and sending for her lute sang when it arrived to a tender and simple air the following verses REGRETS FOR CHILDHOOD I It is not that our earlier Heaven Escapes its April showers Or that to childhood s heart is given No snake amidst the flowers Ah twined with grief Each brightest leaf That s wreath d us by the Hours Young though we be the Past may sting The present feed its sorrow But hope shines bright on every thing That waits us with the morrow Like sun lit glades The dimmest shades Some rosy beam can borrow II It is not that our later years Of cares are woven wholly But smiles less swiftly chase the tears And wounds are healed more slowly And Memory s vow To lost ones now Makes joys too bright unholy And ever fled the Iris bow That smiled when clouds were o er us If storms should burst uncheered we go A drearier waste before us And with the toys Of childish joys We ve broke the staff that bore us Wisely and delicately had Ione chosen that song sad though its burthen seemed for when we are deeply mournful discordant above all others is the voice of mirth the fittest spell is that borrowed from melancholy itself for dark thoughts can be softened down when they cannot be brightened and so they lose the precise and rigid outline of their truth and their colors melt into the ideal As the leech applies in remedy to the internal sore some outward irritation which by a gentler wound draws away the venom of that which is more deadly thus in the rankling festers of the mind our art is to divert to a milder sadness on the surface the pain that gnaweth at the core And so with Apaecides yielding to the influence of the silver voice that reminded him of the past and told but of half the sorrow born to the present he forgot his more immediate and fiery sources of anxious thought He spent hours in making Ione alternately sing to and converse with him and when he rose to leave her it was with a calmed and lulled mind Ione said he as he pressed her hand should you hear my name blackened and maligned will you credit the aspersion Never my brother never Dost thou not imagine according to thy belief that the evil doer is punished hereafter and the good rewarded Can you doubt it Dost thou think then that he who is truly good should sacrifice every selfish interest in his zeal for virtue He who doth so is the equal of the gods And thou believest that according to the purity and courage with which he thus acts shall be his portion of bliss beyond the grave So we are taught to hope Kiss me my sister One question more Thou art to be wedded to Glaucus perchance that marriage may separate us more hopelessly but not of this speak I now thou art to be married to Glaucus dost thou love him Nay my sister answer me by words Yes murmured Ione blushing Dost thou feel that for his sake thou couldst renounce pride brave dishonour and incur death I have heard that when women really love it is to that excess My brother all this could I do for Glaucus and feel that it were not a sacrifice There is no sacrifice to those who love in what is borne for the one we love Enough shall woman feel thus for man and man feel less devotion to his God He spoke no more His whole countenance seemed instinct and inspired with a divine life his chest swelled proudly his eyes glowed on his forehead was writ the majesty of a man who can dare to be noble He turned to meet the eyes of Ione earnest wistful fearful he kissed her fondly strained her warmly to his breast and in a moment more he had left the house Long did Ione remain in the same place mute and thoughtful The maidens again and again came to warn her of the deepening noon and her engagement to Diomed s banquet At length she woke from her reverie and prepared not with the pride of beauty but listless and melancholy for the festival one thought alone reconciled her to the promised visit she should meet Glaucus she could confide to him her alarm and uneasiness for her brother Chapter III A FASHIONABLE PARTY AND A DINNER A LA MODE IN POMPEII MEANWHILE Sallust and Glaucus were slowly strolling towards the house of Diomed Despite the habits of his life Sallust was not devoid of many estimable qualities He would have been an active friend a useful citizen in short an excellent man if he had not taken it into his head to be a philosopher Brought up in the schools in which Roman plagiarism worshipped the echo of Grecian wisdom he had imbued himself with those doctrines by which the later Epicureans corrupted the simple maxims of their great master He gave himself altogether up to pleasure and imagined there was no sage like a boon companion Still however he had a considerable degree of learning wit and good nature and the hearty frankness of his very vices seemed like virtue itself beside the utter corruption of Clodius and the prostrate effeminacy of Lepidus and therefore Glaucus liked him the best of his companions and he in turn appreciating the nobler qualities of the Athenian loved him almost as much as a cold muraena or a bowl of the best Falernian This is a vulgar old fellow this Diomed said Sallust but he has some good qualities in his cellar And some charming ones in his daughter True Glaucus but you are not much moved by them methinks I fancy Clodius is desirous to be your successor He is welcome At the banquet of Julia s beauty no guest be sure is considered a musca You are severe but she has indeed something of the Corinthian about her they will be well matched after all What good natured fellows we are to associate with that gambling good for nought Pleasure unites strange varieties answered Glaucus He amuses me And flatters but then he pays himself well He powders his praise with gold dust You often hint that he plays unfairly think you so really My dear Glaucus a Roman noble has his dignity to keep up dignity is very expensive Clodius must cheat like a scoundrel in order to live like a gentleman Ha ha well of late I have renounced the dice Ah Sallust when I am wedded to Ione I trust I may yet redeem a youth of follies We are both born for better things than those in which we sympathize now born to render our worship in nobler temples than the stye of Epicurus Alas returned Sallust in rather a melancholy tone what do we know more than this life is short beyond the grave all is dark There is no wisdom like that which says enjoy By Bacchus I doubt sometimes if we do enjoy the utmost of which life is capable I am a moderate man returned Sallust and do not ask the utmost We are like malefactors and intoxicate ourselves with wine and myrrh as we stand on the brink of death but if we did not do so the abyss would look very disagreeable I own that I was inclined to be gloomy until I took so heartily to drinking that is a new life my Glaucus Yes but it brings us next morning to a new death Why the next morning is unpleasant I own but then if it were not so one would never be inclined to read I study betimes because by the gods I am generally unfit for anything else till noon Fie Scythian Pshaw the fate of Pentheus to him who denies Bacchus Well Sallust with all your faults you are the best profligate I ever met and verily if I were in danger of life you are the only man in all Italy who would stretch out a finger to save me Perhaps I should not if it were in the middle of supper But in truth we Italians are fearfully selfish So are all men who are not free said Glaucus with a sigh Freedom alone makes men sacrifice to each other Freedom then must be a very fatiguing thing to an Epicurean answered Sallust But here we are at our host s As Diomed s villa is one of the most considerable in point of size of any yet discovered at Pompeii and is moreover built much according to the specific instructions for a suburban villa laid down by the Roman architect it may not be uninteresting briefly to describe the plan of the apartments through which our visitors passed They entered then by the same small vestibule at which we have before been presented to the aged Medon and passed at once into a colonnade technically termed the peristyle for the main difference between the suburban villa and the town mansion consisted in placing in the first the said colonnade in exactly the same place as that which in the town mansion was occupied by the atrium In the centre of the peristyle was an open court which contained the impluvium From this peristyle descended a staircase to the offices another narrow passage on the opposite side communicated with a garden various small apartments surrounded the colonnade appropriated probably to country visitors Another door to the left on entering communicated with a small triangular portico which belonged to the baths and behind was the wardrobe in which were kept the vests of the holiday suits of the slaves and perhaps of the master Seventeen centuries afterwards were found those relics of ancient finery calcined and crumbling kept longer alas than their thrifty lord foresaw Return we to the peristyle and endeavor now to present to the reader a coup d oeil of the whole suite of apartments which immediately stretched before the steps of the visitors Let him then first imagine the columns of the portico hung with festoons of flowers the columns themselves in the lower part painted red and the walls around glowing with various frescoes then looking beyond a curtain three parts drawn aside the eye caught the tablinum or saloon which was closed at will by glazed doors now slid back into the walls On either side of this tablinum were small rooms one of which was a kind of cabinet of gems and these apartments as well as the tablinum communicated with a long gallery which opened at either end upon terraces and between the terraces and communicating with the central part of the gallery was a hall in which the banquet was that day prepared All these apartments though almost on a level with the street were one story above the garden and the terraces communicating with the gallery were continued into corridors raised above the pillars which to the right and left skirted the garden below Beneath and on a level with the garden ran the apartments we have already described as chiefly appropriated to Julia In the gallery then just mentioned Diomed received his guests The merchant affected greatly the man of letters and therefore he also affected a passion for everything Greek he paid particular attention to Glaucus You will see my friend said he with a wave of his hand that I am a little classical here a little Cecropian eh The hall in which we shall sup is borrowed from the Greeks It is an OEcus Cyzicene Noble Sallust they have not I am told this sort of apartment in Rome Oh replied Sallust with a half smile you Pompeians combine all that is most eligible in Greece and in Rome may you Diomed combine the viands as well as the architecture You shall see you shall see my Sallust replied the merchant We have a taste at Pompeii and we have also money They are two excellent things replied Sallust But behold the lady Julia The main difference as I have before remarked in the manner of life observed among the Athenians and Romans was that with the first the modest women rarely or never took part in entertainments with the latter they were the common ornaments of the banquet but when they were present at the feast it usually terminated at an early hour Magnificently robed in white interwoven with pearls and threads of gold the handsome Julia entered the apartment Scarcely had she received the salutation of the two guests ere Pansa and his wife Lepidus Clodius and the Roman senator entered almost simultaneously then came the widow Fulvia then the poet Fulvius like to the widow in name if in nothing else the warrior from Herculaneum accompanied by his umbra next stalked in afterwards the less eminent of the guests Ione yet tarried It was the mode among the courteous ancients to flatter whenever it was in their power accordingly it was a sign of ill breeding to seat themselves immediately on entering the house of their host After performing the salutation which was usually accomplished by the same cordial shake of the right hand which we ourselves retain and sometimes by the yet more familiar embrace they spent several minutes in surveying the apartment and admiring the bronzes the pictures or the furniture with which it was adorned a mode very impolite according to our refined English notions which place good breeding in indifference We would not for the world express much admiration of another man s house for fear it should be thought we had never seen anything so fine before A beautiful statue this of Bacchus said the Roman senator A mere trifle replied Diomed What charming paintings said Fulvia Mere trifles answered the owner Exquisite candelabra cried the warrior Exquisite echoed his umbra Trifles trifles reiterated the merchant Meanwhile Glaucus found himself by one of the windows of the gallery which communicated with the terraces and the fair Julia by his side Is it an Athenian virtue Glaucus said the merchant s daughter to shun those whom we once sought Fair Julia no Yet methinks it is one of the qualities of Glaucus Glaucus never shuns a friend replied the Greek with some emphasis on the last word May Julia rank among the number of his friends It would be an honour to the emperor to find a friend in one so lovely You evade my question returned the enamoured Julia But tell me is it true that you admire the Neapolitan Ione Does not beauty constrain our admiration Ah subtle Greek still do you fly the meaning of my words But say shall Julia be indeed your friend If she will so favor me blessed be the gods The day in which I am thus honored shall be ever marked in white Yet even while you speak your eye is resting your color comes and goes you move away involuntarily you are impatient to join Ione For at that moment Ione had entered and Glaucus had indeed betrayed the emotion noticed by the jealous beauty Can admiration to one woman make me unworthy the friendship of another Sanction not so O Julia the libels of the poets on your sex Well you are right or I will learn to think so Glaucus yet one moment You are to wed Ione is it not so If the Fates permit such is my blessed hope Accept then from me in token of our new friendship a present for your bride Nay it is the custom of friends you know always to present to bride and bridegroom some such little marks of their esteem and favoring wishes Julia I cannot refuse any token of friendship from one like you I will accept the gift as an omen from Fortune herself Then after the feast when the guests retire you will descend with me to my apartment and receive it from my hands Remember said Julia as she joined the wife of Pansa and left Glaucus to seek Ione The widow Fulvia and the spouse of the aedile were engaged in high and grave discussion O Fulvia I assure you that the last account from Rome declares that the frizzling mode of dressing the hair is growing antiquated they only now wear it built up in a tower like Julia s or arranged as a helmet the Galerian fashion like mine you see it has a fine effect I think I assure you Vespius Vespius was the name of the Herculaneum hero admires it greatly And nobody wears the hair like yon Neapolitan in the Greek way What parted in front with the knot behind Oh no how ridiculous it is it reminds one of the statue of Diana Yet this Ione is handsome eh So the men say but then she is rich she is to marry the Athenian I wish her joy He will not be long faithful I suspect those foreigners are very faithless Oh Julia said Fulvia as the merchant s daughter joined them have you seen the tiger yet No Why all the ladies have been to see him He is so handsome I hope we shall find some criminal or other for him and the lion replied Julia Your husband turning to Pansa s wife is not so active as he should be in this matter Why really the laws are too mild replied the dame of the helmet There are so few offences to which the punishment of the arena can be awarded and then too the gladiators are growing effeminate The stoutest bestiarii declare they are willing enough to fight a boar or a bull but as for a lion or a tiger they think the game too much in earnest They are worthy of a mitre replied Julia in disdain Oh have you seen the new house of Fulvius the dear poet said Pansa s wife No is it handsome Very such good taste But they say my dear that he has such improper pictures He won t show them to the women how ill bred Those poets are always odd said the widow But he is an interesting man what pretty verses he writes We improve very much in poetry it is impossible to read the old stuff now I declare I am of your opinion returned the lady of the helmet There is so much more force and energy in the modern school The warrior sauntered up to the ladies It reconciles me to peace said he when I see such faces Oh you heroes are ever flatterers returned Fulvia hastening to appropriate the compliment specially to herself By this chain which I received from the emperor s own hand replied the warrior playing with a short chain which hung round the neck like a collar instead of descending to the breast according to the fashion of the peaceful By this chain you wrong me I am a blunt man a soldier should be so How do you find the ladies of Pompeii generally said Julia By Venus most beautiful They favor me a little it is true and that inclines my eyes to double their charms We love a warrior said the wife of Pansa I see it by Hercules it is even disagreeable to be too celebrated in these cities At Herculaneum they climb the roof of my atrium to catch a glimpse of me through the compluvium the admiration of one s citizens is pleasant at first but burthensome afterwards True true O Vespius cried the poet joining the group I find it so myself You said the stately warrior scanning the small form of the poet with ineffable disdain In what legion have you served You may see my spoils my exuviae in the forum itself returned the poet with a significant glance at the women I have been among the tent companions the contubernales of the great Mantuan himself I know no general from Mantua said the warrior gravely What campaign have you served That of Helicon I never heard of it Nay Vespius he does but joke said Julia laughing Joke By Mars am I a man to be joked Yes Mars himself was in love with the mother of jokes said the poet a little alarmed Know then O Vespius that I am the poet Fulvius It is I who make warriors immortal The gods forbid whispered Sallust to Julia If Vespius were made immortal what a specimen of tiresome braggadocio would be transmitted to posterity The soldier looked puzzled when to the infinite relief of himself and his companions the signal for the feast was given As we have already witnessed at the house of Glaucus the ordinary routine of a Pompeian entertainment the reader is spared any second detail of the courses and the manner in which they were introduced Diomed who was rather ceremonious had appointed a nomenclator or appointer of places to each guest The reader understands that the festive board was composed of three tables one at the centre and one at each wing It was only at the outer side of these tables that the guests reclined the inner space was left untenanted for the greater convenience of the waiters or ministri The extreme corner of one of the wings was appropriated to Julia as the lady of the feast that next her to Diomed At one corner of the centre table was placed the aedile at the opposite corner the Roman senator these were the posts of honour The other guests were arranged so that the young gentleman or lady should sit next each other and the more advanced in years be similarly matched An agreeable provision enough but one which must often have offended those who wished to be thought still young The chair of Ione was next to the couch of Glaucus The seats were veneered with tortoiseshell and covered with quilts stuffed with feathers and ornamented with costly embroideries The modern ornaments of epergne or plateau were supplied by images of the gods wrought in bronze ivory and silver The sacred salt cellar and the familiar Lares were not forgotten Over the table and the seats a rich canopy was suspended from the ceiling At each corner of the table were lofty candelabra for though it was early noon the room was darkened while from tripods placed in different parts of the room distilled the odor of myrrh and frankincense and upon the abacus or sideboard large vases and various ornaments of silver were ranged much with the same ostentation but with more than the same taste that we find displayed at a modern feast The custom of grace was invariably supplied by that of libations to the gods and Vesta as queen of the household gods usually received first that graceful homage This ceremony being performed the slaves showered flowers upon the couches and the floor and crowned each guest with rosy garlands intricately woven with ribands tied by the rind of the linden tree and each intermingled with the ivy and the amethyst supposed preventives against the effect of wine the wreaths of the women only were exempted from these leaves for it was not the fashion for them to drink wine in public It was then that the president Diomed thought it advisable to institute a basileus or director of the feast an important office sometimes chosen by lot sometimes as now by the master of the entertainment Diomed was not a little puzzled as to his election The invalid senator was too grave and too infirm for the proper fulfilment of his duty the aedile Pansa was adequate enough to the task but then to choose the next in official rank to the senator was an affront to the senator himself While deliberating between the merits of the others he caught the mirthful glance of Sallust and by a sudden inspiration named the jovial epicure to the rank of director or arbiter bibendi Sallust received the appointment with becoming humility I shall be a merciful king said he to those who drink deep to a recusant Minos himself shall be less inexorable Beware The slaves handed round basins of perfumed water by which lavation the feast commenced and now the table groaned under the initiatory course The conversation at first desultory and scattered allowed Ione and Glaucus to carry on those sweet whispers which are worth all the eloquence in the world Julia watched them with flashing eyes How soon shall her place be mine thought she But Clodius who sat in the centre table so as to observe well the countenance of Julia guessed her pique and resolved to profit by it He addressed her across the table in set phrases of gallantry and as he was of high birth and of a showy person the vain Julia was not so much in love as to be insensible to his attentions The slaves in the interim were constantly kept upon the alert by the vigilant Sallust who chased one cup by another with a celerity which seemed as if he were resolved upon exhausting those capacious cellars which the reader may yet see beneath the house of Diomed The worthy merchant began to repent his choice as amphora after amphora was pierced and emptied The slaves all under the age of manhood the youngest being about ten years old it was they who filled the wine the eldest some five years older mingled it with water seemed to share in the zeal of Sallust and the face of Diomed began to glow as he watched the provoking complacency with which they seconded the exertions of the king of the feast Pardon me O senator said Sallust I see you flinch your purple hem cannot save you drink By the gods said the senator coughing my lungs are already on fire you proceed with so miraculous a swiftness that Phaeton himself was nothing to you I am infirm O pleasant Sallust you must exonerate me Not I by Vesta I am an impartial monarch drink The poor senator compelled by the laws of the table was forced to comply Alas every cup was bringing him nearer and nearer to the Stygian pool Gently gently my king groaned Diomed we already begin to Treason interrupted Sallust no stern Brutus here no interference with royalty But our female guests Love a toper Did not Ariadne dote upon Bacchus The feast proceeded the guests grew more talkative and noisy the dessert or last course was already on the table and the slaves bore round water with myrrh and hyssop for the finishing lavation At the same time a small circular table that had been placed in the space opposite the guests suddenly and as by magic seemed to open in the centre and cast up a fragrant shower sprinkling the table and the guests while as it ceased the awning above them was drawn aside and the guests perceived that a rope had been stretched across the ceiling and that one of those nimble dancers for which Pompeii was so celebrated and whose descendants add so charming a grace to the festivities of Astley s or Vauxhall was now treading his airy measures right over their heads This apparition removed but by a cord from one s pericranium and indulging the most vehement leaps apparently with the intention of alighting upon that cerebral region would probably be regarded with some terror by a party in May Fair but our Pompeian revellers seemed to behold the spectacle with delighted curiosity and applauded in proportion as the dancer appeared with the most difficulty to miss falling upon the head of whatever guest he particularly selected to dance above He paid the senator indeed the peculiar compliment of literally falling from the rope and catching it again with his hand just as the whole party imagined the skull of the Roman was as much fractured as ever that of the poet whom the eagle took for a tortoise At length to the great relief of at least Ione who had not much accustomed herself to this entertainment the dancer suddenly paused as a strain of music was heard from without He danced again still more wildly the air changed the dancer paused again no it could not dissolve the charm which was supposed to possess him He represented one who by a strange disorder is compelled to dance and whom only a certain air of music can cure At length the musician seemed to hit on the right tune the dancer gave one leap swung himself down from the rope alighted on the floor and vanished One art now yielded to another and the musicians who were stationed without on the terrace struck up a soft and mellow air to which were sung the following words made almost indistinct by the barrier between and the exceeding lowness of the minstrelsy FESTIVE MUSIC SHOULD BE LOW I Hark through these flowers our music sends its greeting To your loved halls where Psilas shuns the day When the young god his Cretan nymph was meeting He taught Pan s rustic pipe this gliding lay Soft as the dews of wine Shed in this banquet hour The rich libation of Sound s stream divine O reverent harp to Aphrodite pour II Wild rings the trump o er ranks to glory marching Music s sublimer bursts for war are meet But sweet lips murmuring under wreaths o er arching Find the low whispers like their own most sweet Steal my lull d music steal Like womans s half heard tone So that whoe er shall hear shall think to feel In thee the voice of lips that love his own At the end of that song Ione s cheek blushed more deeply than before and Glaucus had contrived under cover of the table to steal her hand It is a pretty song said Fulvius patronizingly Ah if you would oblige us murmured the wife of Pansa Do you wish Fulvius to sing asked the king of the feast who had just called on the assembly to drink the health of the Roman senator a cup to each letter of his name Can you ask said the matron with a complimentary glance at the poet Sallust snapped his fingers and whispering the slave who came to learn his orders the latter disappeared and returned in a few moments with a small harp in one hand and a branch of myrtle in the other The slave approached the poet and with a low reverence presented to him the harp Alas I cannot play said the poet Then you must sing to the myrtle It is a Greek fashion Diomed loves the Greeks I love the Greeks you love the Greeks we all love the Greeks and between you and me this is not the only thing we have stolen from them However I introduce this custom I the king sing subject sing The poet with a bashful smile took the myrtle in his hands and after a short prelude sang as follows in a pleasant and well tuned voice THE CORONATION OF THE LOVES I The merry Loves one holiday Were all at gambols madly But Loves too long can seldom play Without behaving sadly They laugh d they toy d they romp d about And then for change they all fell out Fie fie how can they quarrel so My Lesbia ah for shame love Methinks tis scarce an hour ago When we did just the same love II The Loves tis thought were free till then They had no king or laws dear But gods like men should subject be Say all the ancient saws dear And so our crew resolved for quiet To choose a king to curb their riot A kiss ah what a grievous thing For both methinks twould be child If I should take some prudish king And cease to be so free child III Among their toys a Casque they found It was the helm of Ares With horrent plumes the crest was crown d It frightened all the Lares So fine a king was never known They placed the helmet on the throne My girl since Valor wins the world They chose a mighty master But thy sweet flag of smiles unfurled Would win the world much faster IV The Casque soon found the Loves too wild A troop for him to school them For warriors know how one such child Has aye contrived to fool them They plagued him so that in despair He took a wife the plague to share If kings themselves thus find the strife Of earth unshared severe girl Why just to halve the ills of life Come take your partner here girl V Within that room the Bird of Love The whole affair had eyed then The monarch hail d the royal dove And placed her by his side then What mirth amidst the Loves was seen Long live they cried our King and Queen Ah Lesbia would that thrones were mine And crowns to deck that brow love And yet I know that heart of thine For me is throne enow love VI The urchins hoped to tease the mate As they had teased the hero But when the Dove in judgment sate They found her worse than Nero Each look a frown each word a law The little subjects shook with awe In thee I find the same deceit Too late alas a learner For where a mien more gently sweet And where a tyrant sterner This song which greatly suited the gay and lively fancy of the Pompeians was received with considerable applause and the widow insisted on crowning her namesake with the very branch of myrtle to which he had sung It was easily twisted into a garland and the immortal Fulvius was crowned amidst the clapping of hands and shouts of Io triumphe The song and the harp now circulated round the party a new myrtle branch being handed about stopping at each person who could be prevailed upon to sing The sun began now to decline though the revellers who had worn away several hours perceived it not in their darkened chamber and the senator who was tired and the warrior who had to return to Herculaneum rising to depart gave the signal for the general dispersion Tarry yet a moment my friends said Diomed if you will go so soon you must at least take a share in our concluding game So saying he motioned to one of the ministri and whispering him the slave went out and presently returned with a small bowl containing various tablets carefully sealed and apparently exactly similar Each guest was to purchase one of these at the nominal price of the lowest piece of silver and the sport of this lottery which was the favorite diversion of Augustus who introduced it consisted in the inequality and sometimes the incongruity of the prizes the nature and amount of which were specified within the tablets For instance the poet with a wry face drew one of his own poems no physician ever less willingly swallowed his own draught the warrior drew a case of bodkins which gave rise to certain novel witticisms relative to Hercules and the distaff the widow Fulvia obtained a large drinking cup Julia a gentleman s buckle and Lepidus a lady s patch box The most appropriate lot was drawn by the gambler Clodius who reddened with anger on being presented to a set of cogged dice A certain damp was thrown upon the gaiety which these various lots created by an accident that was considered ominous Glaucus drew the most valuable of all the prizes a small marble statue of Fortune of Grecian workmanship on handing it to him the slave suffered it to drop and it broke in pieces A shiver went round the assembly and each voice cried spontaneously on the gods to avert the omen Glaucus alone though perhaps as superstitious as the rest affected to be unmoved Sweet Neapolitan whispered he tenderly to Ione who had turned pale as the broken marble itself I accept the omen It signifies that in obtaining thee Fortune can give no more she breaks her image when she blesses me with thine In order to divert the impression which this incident had occasioned in an assembly which considering the civilization of the guests would seem miraculously superstitious if at the present day in a country party we did not often see a lady grow hypochondriacal on leaving a room last of thirteen Sallust now crowning his cup with flowers gave the health of their host This was followed by a similar compliment to the emperor and then with a parting cup to Mercury to send them pleasant slumbers they concluded the entertainment by a last libation and broke up the party Carriages and litters were little used in Pompeii partly owing to the extreme narrowness of the streets partly to the convenient smallness of the city Most of the guests replacing their sandals which they had put off in the banquet room and induing their cloaks left the house on foot attended by their slaves Meanwhile having seen Ione depart Glaucus turning to the staircase which led down to the rooms of Julia was conducted by a slave to an apartment in which he found the merchant s daughter already seated Glaucus said she looking down I see that you really love Ione she is indeed beautiful Julia is charming enough to be generous replied the Greek Yes I love Ione amidst all the youth who court you may you have one worshipper as sincere I pray the gods to grant it See Glaucus these pearls are the present I destine to your bride may Juno give her health to wear them So saying she placed a case in his hand containing a row of pearls of some size and price It was so much the custom for persons about to be married to receive these gifts that Glaucus could have little scruple in accepting the necklace though the gallant and proud Athenian inly resolved to requite the gift by one of thrice its value Julia then stopping short his thanks poured forth some wine into a small bowl You have drunk many toasts with my father said she smiling one now with me Health and fortune to your bride She touched the cup with her lips and then presented it to Glaucus The customary etiquette required that Glaucus should drain the whole contents he accordingly did so Julia unknowing the deceit which Nydia had practised upon her watched him with sparkling eyes although the witch had told her that the effect might not be immediate she yet sanguinely trusted to an expeditious operation in favor of her charms She was disappointed when she found Glaucus coldly replace the cup and converse with her in the same unmoved but gentle tone as before And though she detained him as long as she decorously could do no change took place in his manner But to morrow thought she exultingly recovering her disappointment to morrow alas for Glaucus Alas for him indeed Chapter IV THE STORY HALTS FOR A MOMENT AT AN EPISODE RESTLESS and anxious Apaecides consumed the day in wandering through the most sequestered walks in the vicinity of the city The sun was slowly setting as he paused beside a lonely part of the Sarnus ere yet it wound amidst the evidences of luxury and power Only through openings in the woods and vines were caught glimpses of the white and gleaming city in which was heard in the distance no din no sound nor busiest hum of men Amidst the green banks crept the lizard and the grasshopper and here and there in the brake some solitary bird burst into sudden song as suddenly stifled There was deep calm around but not the calm of night the air still breathed of the freshness and life of day the grass still moved to the stir of the insect horde and on the opposite bank the graceful and white capella passed browsing through the herbage and paused at the wave to drink As Apaecides stood musingly gazing upon the waters he heard beside him the low bark of a dog Be still poor friend said a voice at hand the stranger s step harms not thy master The convert recognized the voice and turning he beheld the old mysterious man whom he had seen in the congregation of the Nazarenes The old man was sitting upon a fragment of stone covered with ancient mosses beside him were his staff and scrip at his feet lay a small shaggy dog the companion in how many a pilgrimage perilous and strange The face of the old man was as balm to the excited spirit of the neophyte he approached and craving his blessing sat down beside him Thou art provided as for a journey father said he wilt thou leave us yet My son replied the old man the days in store for me on earth are few and scanty I employ them as becomes me travelling from place to place comforting those whom God has gathered together in His name and proclaiming the glory of His Son as testified to His servant Thou hast looked they tell me on the face of Christ And the face revived me from the dead Know young proselyte to the true faith that I am he of whom thou readest in the scroll of the Apostle In the far Judea and in the city of Nain there dwelt a widow humble of spirit and sad of heart for of all the ties of life one son alone was spared to her And she loved him with a melancholy love for he was the likeness of the lost And the son died The reed on which she leaned was broken the oil was dried up in the widow s cruse They bore the dead upon his bier and near the gate of the city where the crowd were gathered there came a silence over the sounds of woe for the Son of God was passing by The mother who followed the bier wept not noisily but all who looked upon her saw that her heart was crushed And the Lord pitied her and he touched the bier and said I SAY UNTO THEE ARISE And the dead man woke and looked upon the face of the Lord Oh that calm and solemn brow that unutterable smile that careworn and sorrowful face lighted up with a God s benignity it chased away the shadows of the grave I rose I spoke I was living and in my mother s arms yes I am the dead revived The people shouted the funeral horns rung forth merrily there was a cry God has visited His people I heard them not I felt I saw nothing but the face of the Redeemer The old man paused deeply moved and the youth felt his blood creep and his hair stir He was in the presence of one who had known the Mystery of Death Till that time renewed the widow s son I had been as other men thoughtless not abandoned taking no heed but of the things of love and life nay I had inclined to the gloomy faith of the earthly Sadducee But raised from the dead from awful and desert dreams that these lips never dare reveal recalled upon earth to testify the powers of Heaven once more mortal the witness of immortality I drew a new being from the grave O faded O lost Jerusalem Him from whom came my life I beheld adjudged to the agonized and parching death Far in the mighty crowd I saw the light rest and glimmer over the cross I heard the hooting mob I cried aloud I raved I threatened none heeded me I was lost in the whirl and the roar of thousands But even then in my agony and His own methought the glazing eye of the Son of Man sought me out His lip smiled as when it conquered death it hushed me and I became calm He who had defied the grave for another what was the grave to him The sun shone aslant the pale and powerful features and then died away Darkness fell over the earth how long it endured I know not A loud cry came through the gloom a sharp and bitter cry and all was silent But who shall tell the terrors of the night I walked along the city the earth reeled to and fro and the houses trembled to their base theliving had deserted the streets but not the Dead through the gloom I saw them glide the dim and ghastly shapes in the cerements of the grave with horror and woe and warning on their unmoving lips and lightless eyes they swept by me as I passed they glared upon me I had been their brother and they bowed their heads in recognition they had risen to tell the living that the dead can rise Again the old man paused and when he resumed it was in a calmer tone From that night I resigned all earthly thought but that of serving HIM A preacher and a pilgrim I have traversed the remotest corners of the earth proclaiming His Divinity and bringing new converts to His fold I come as the wind and as the wind depart sowing as the wind sows the seeds that enrich the world Son on earth we shall meet no more Forget not this hour what are the pleasures and the pomps of life As the lamp shines so life glitters for an hour but the soul s light is the star that burns for ever in the heart of inimitable space It was then that their conversation fell upon the general and sublime doctrines of immortality it soothed and elevated the young mind of the convert which yet clung to many of the damps and shadows of that cell of faith which he had so lately left it was the air of heaven breathing on the prisoner released at last There was a strong and marked distinction between the Christianity of the old man and that of Olinthus that of the first was more soft more gentle more divine The heroism of Olinthus had something in it fierce and intolerant it was necessary to the part he was destined to play it had in it more of the courage of the martyr than the charity of the saint It aroused it excited it nerved rather than subdued and softened But the whole heart of that divine old man was bathed in love the smile of the Deity had burned away from it the leaven of earthlier and coarser passions and left to the energy of the hero all the meekness of the child And now said he rising at length as the sun s last ray died in the west now in the cool of twilight I pursue my way towards the Imperial Rome There yet dwell some holy men who like me have beheld the face of Christ and them would I see before I die But the night is chill for thine age my father and the way is long and the robber haunts it rest thee till to morrow Kind son what is there in this scrip to tempt the robber And the Night and the Solitude these make the ladder round which angels cluster and beneath which my spirit can dream of God Oh none can know what the pilgrim feels as he walks on his holy course nursing no fear and dreading no danger for God is with him He hears the winds murmur glad tidings the woods sleep in the shadow of Almighty wings the stars are the Scriptures of Heaven the tokens of love and the witnesses of immortality Night is the Pilgrim s day With these words the old man pressed Apaecides to his breast and taking up his staff and scrip the dog bounded cheerily before him and with slow steps and downcast eyes he went his way The convert stood watching his bended form till the trees shut the last glimpse from his view and then as the stars broke forth he woke from the musings with a start reminded of his appointment with Olinthus Chapter V THE PHILTRE ITS EFFECT WHEN Glaucus arrived at his own home he found Nydia seated under the portico of his garden In fact she had sought his house in the mere chance that he might return at an early hour anxious fearful anticipative she resolved upon seizing the earliest opportunity of availing herself of the love charm while at the same time she half hoped the opportunity might be deferred It was then in that fearful burning mood her heart beating her cheek flushing that Nydia awaited the possibility of Glaucus s return before the night He crossed the portico just as the first stars began to rise and the heaven above had assumed its most purple robe Ho my child wait you for me Nay I have been tending the flowers and did but linger a little while to rest myself It has been warm said Glaucus placing himself also on one of the seats beneath the colonnade Very Wilt thou summon Davus The wine I have drunk heats me and I long for some cooling drink Here at once suddenly and unexpectedly the very opportunity that Nydia awaited presented itself of himself at his own free choice he afforded to her that occasion She breathed quick I will prepare for you myself said she the summer draught that Ione loves of honey and weak wine cooled in snow Thanks said the unconscious Glaucus If Ione love it enough it would be grateful were it poison Nydia frowned and then smiled she withdrew for a few moments and returned with the cup containing the beverage Glaucus took it from her hand What would not Nydia have given then for one hour s prerogative of sight to have watched her hopes ripening to effect to have seen the first dawn of the imagined love to have worshipped with more than Persian adoration the rising of that sun which her credulous soul believed was to break upon her dreary night Far different as she stood then and there were the thoughts the emotions of the blind girl from those of the vain Pompeian under a similar suspense In the last what poor and frivolous passions had made up the daring whole What petty pique what small revenge what expectation of a paltry triumph had swelled the attributes of that sentiment she dignified with the name of love but in the wild heart of the Thessalian all was pure uncontrolled unmodified passion erring unwomanly frenzied but debased by no elements of a more sordid feeling Filled with love as with life itself how could she resist the occasion of winning love in return She leaned for support against the wall and her face before so flushed was now white as snow and with her delicate hands clasped convulsively together her lips apart her eyes on the ground she waited the next words Glaucus should utter Glaucus had raised the cup to his lips he had already drained about a fourth of its contents when his eye suddenly glancing upon the face of Nydia he was so forcibly struck by its alteration by its intense and painful and strange expression that he paused abruptly and still holding the cup near his lips exclaimed Why Nydia Nydia I say art thou ill or in pain Nay thy face speaks for thee What ails my poor child As he spoke he put down the cup and rose from his seat to approach her when a sudden pang shot coldly to his heart and was followed by a wild confused dizzy sensation at the brain The floor seemed to glide from under him his feet seemed to move on air a mighty and unearthly gladness rushed upon his spirit he felt too buoyant for the earth he longed for wings nay it seemed in the buoyancy of his new existence as if he possessed them He burst involuntarily into a loud and thrilling laugh He clapped his hands he bounded aloft he was as a Pythoness inspired suddenly as it came this preternatural transport passed though only partially away He now felt his blood rushing loudly and rapidly through his veins it seemed to swell to exult to leap along as a stream that has burst its bounds and hurries to the ocean It throbbed in his ear with a mighty sound he felt it mount to his brow he felt the veins in the temples stretch and swell as if they could no longer contain the violent and increasing tide then a kind of darkness fell over his eyes darkness but not entire for through the dim shade he saw the opposite walls glow out and the figures painted thereon seemed ghost like to creep and glide What was most strange he did not feel himself ill he did not sink or quail beneath the dread frenzy that was gathering over him The novelty of the feelings seemed bright and vivid he felt as if a younger health had been infused into his frame He was gliding on to madness and he knew it not Nydia had not answered his first question she had not been able to reply his wild and fearful laugh had roused her from her passionate suspense she could not see his fierce gesture she could not mark his reeling and unsteady step as he paced unconsciously to and fro but she heard the words broken incoherent insane that gushed from his lips She became terrified and appalled she hastened to him feeling with her arms until she touched his knees and then falling on the ground she embraced them weeping with terror and excitement Oh speak to me speak you do not hate me speak speak By the bright goddess a beautiful land this Cyprus Ho how they fill us with wine instead of blood now they open the veins of the Faun yonder to show how the tide within bubbles and sparkles Come hither jolly old god thou ridest on a goat eh what long silky hair he has He is worth all the coursers of Parthia But a word with thee this wine of thine is too strong for us mortals Oh beautiful the boughs are at rest the green waves of the forest have caught the Zephyr and drowned him Not a breath stirs the leaves and I view the Dreams sleeping with folded wings upon the motionless elm and I look beyond and I see a blue stream sparkle in the silent noon a fountain a fountain springing aloft Ah my fount thou wilt not put out rays of my Grecian sun though thou triest ever so hard with thy nimble and silver arms And now what form steals yonder through the boughs she glides like a moonbeam she has a garland of oak leaves on her head In her hand is a vase upturned from which she pours pink and tiny shells and sparkling water Oh look on yon face Man never before saw its like See we are alone only I and she in the wide forest There is no smile upon her lips she moves grave and sweetly sad Ha fly it is a nymph it is one of the wild Napaeae Whoever sees her becomes mad fly see she discovers me Oh Glaucus Glaucus do you not know me Rave not so wildly or thou wilt kill me with a word A new change seemed now to operate upon the jarring and disordered mind of the unfortunate Athenian He put his hand upon Nydia s silken hair he smoothed the locks he looked wistfully upon her face and then as in the broken chain of thought one or two links were yet unsevered it seemed that her countenance brought its associations of Ione and with that remembrance his madness became yet more powerful and it swayed and tinged by passion as he burst forth I swear by Venus by Diana and by Juno that though I have now the world on my shoulders as my countryman Hercules ah dull Rome whoever was truly great was of Greece why you would be godless if it were not for us I say as my countryman Hercules had before me I would let it fall into chaos for one smile from Ione Ah Beautiful Adored he added in a voice inexpressibly fond and plaintive thou lovest me not Thou art unkind to me The Egyptian hath belied me to thee thou knowest not what hours I have spent beneath thy casement thou knowest not how I have outwatched the stars thinking thou my sun wouldst rise at last and thou lovest me not thou forsakest me Oh do not leave me now I feel that my life will not be long let me gaze on thee at least unto the last I am of the bright land of thy fathers I have trod the heights of Phyle I have gathered the hyacinth and rose amidst the olive groves of Ilyssus Thou shouldst not desert me for thy fathers were brothers to my own And they say this land is lovely and these climes serene but I will bear thee with me Ho dark form why risest thou like a cloud between me and mine Death sits calmly dread upon thy brow on thy lip is the smile that slays thy name is Orcus but on earth men call thee Arbaces See I know thee fly dim shadow thy spells avail not Glaucus Glaucus murmured Nydia releasing her hold and falling beneath the excitement of her dismay remorse and anguish insensible on the floor Who calls said he in a loud voice Ione it is she they have borne her off we will save her where is my stilus Ha I have it I come Ione to thy rescue I come I come So saying the Athenian with one bound passed the portico he traversed the house and rushed with swift but vacillating steps and muttering audibly to himself down the starlit streets The direful potion burnt like fire in his veins for its effect was made perhaps still more sudden from the wine he had drunk previously Used to the excesses of nocturnal revellers the citizens with smiles and winks gave way to his reeling steps they naturally imagined him under the influence of the Bromian god not vainly worshipped at Pompeii but they who looked twice upon his face started in a nameless fear and the smile withered from their lips He passed the more populous streets and pursuing mechanically the way to Ione s house he traversed a more deserted quarter and entered now the lonely grove of Cybele in which Apaecides had held his interview with Olinthus Chapter VI A REUNION OF DIFFERENT ACTORS STREAMS THAT FLOWED APPARENTLY APART RUSH INTO ONE GULF IMPATIENT to learn whether the fell drug had yet been administered by Julia to his hated rival and with what effect Arbaces resolved as the evening came on to seek her house and satisfy his suspense It was customary as I have before said for men at that time to carry abroad with them the tablets and the stilus attached to their girdle and with the girdle they were put off when at home In fact under the appearance of a literary instrument the Romans carried about with them in that same stilus a very sharp and formidable weapon It was with his stilus that Cassius stabbed Caesar in the senate house Taking then his girdle and his cloak Arbaces left his house supporting his steps which were still somewhat feeble though hope and vengeance had conspired greatly with his own medical science which was profound to restore his natural strength by his long staff Arbaces took his way to the villa of Diomed And beautiful is the moonlight of the south In those climes the night so quickly glides into the day that twilight scarcely makes a bridge between them One moment of darker purple in the sky of a thousand rose hues in the water of shade half victorious over light and then burst forth at once the countless stars the moon is up night has resumed her reign Brightly then and softly bright fell the moonbeams over the antique grove consecrated to Cybele the stately trees whose date went beyond tradition cast their long shadows over the soil while through the openings in their boughs the stars shone still and frequent The whiteness of the small sacellum in the centre of the grove amidst the dark foliage had in it something abrupt and startling it recalled at once the purpose to which the wood was consecrated its holiness and solemnity With a swift and stealthy pace Calenus gliding under the shade of the trees reached the chapel and gently putting back the boughs that completely closed around its rear settled himself in his concealment a concealment so complete what with the fane in front and the trees behind that no unsuspicious passenger could possibly have detected him Again all was apparently solitary in the grove afar off you heard faintly the voices of some noisy revellers or the music that played cheerily to the groups that then as now in those climates during the nights of summer lingered in the streets and enjoyed in the fresh air and the liquid moonlight a milder day From the height on which the grove was placed you saw through the intervals of the trees the broad and purple sea rippling in the distance the white villas of Stabiae in the curving shore and the dim Lectiarian hills mingling with the delicious sky Presently the tall figure of Arbaces in his way to the house of Diomed entered the extreme end of the grove and at the same instant Apaecides also bound to his appointment with Olinthus crossed the Egyptian s path Hem Apaecides said Arbaces recognizing the priest at a glance when last we met you were my foe I have wished since then to see you for I would have you still my pupil and my friend Apaecides started at the voice of the Egyptian and halting abruptly gazed upon him with a countenance full of contending bitter and scornful emotions Villain and impostor said he at length thou hast recovered then from the jaws of the grave But think not again to weave around me thy guilty meshes Retiarius I am armed against thee Hush said Arbaces in a very low voice but his pride which in that descendant of kings was great betrayed the wound it received from the insulting epithets of the priest in the quiver of his lip and the flush of his tawny brow Hush more low thou mayest be overheard and if other ears than mine had drunk those sounds why Dost thou threaten what if the whole city had heard me The manes of my ancestors would not have suffered me to forgive thee But hold and hear me Thou art enraged that I would have offered violence to thy sister Nay peace peace but one instant I pray thee Thou art right it was the frenzy of passion and of jealousy I have repented bitterly of my madness Forgive me I who never implored pardon of living man beseech thee now to forgive me Nay I will atone the insult I ask thy sister in marriage start not consider what is the alliance of yon holiday Greek compared to mine Wealth unbounded birth that in its far antiquity leaves your Greek and Roman names the things of yesterday science but that thou knowest Give me thy sister and my whole life shall atone a moment s error Egyptian were even I to consent my sister loathes the very air thou breathest but I have my own wrongs to forgive I may pardon thee that thou hast made me a tool to thy deceits but never that thou hast seduced me to become the abettor of thy vices a polluted and a perjured man Tremble even now I prepare the hour in which thou and thy false gods shall be unveiled Thy lewd and Circean life shall be dragged to day thy mumming oracles disclosed the fane of the idol Isis shall be a byword and a scorn the name of Arbaces a mark for the hisses of execration Tremble The flush on the Egyptian s brow was succeeded by a livid paleness He looked behind before around to feel assured that none were by and then he fixed his dark and dilating eye on the priest with such a gaze of wrath and menace that one perhaps less supported than Apaecides by the fervent daring of a divine zeal could not have faced with unflinching look that lowering aspect As it was however the young convert met it unmoved and returned it with an eye of proud defiance Apaecides said the Egyptian in a tremulous and inward tone beware What is it thou wouldst meditate Speakest thou reflect pause before thou repliest from the hasty influences of wrath as yet divining no settled purpose or from some fixed design I speak from the inspiration of the True God whose servant I now am answered the Christian boldly and in the knowledge that by His grace human courage has already fixed the date of thy hypocrisy and thy demon s worship ere thrice the sun has dawned thou wilt know all Dark sorcerer tremble and farewell All the fierce and lurid passions which he inherited from his nation and his clime at all times but ill concealed beneath the blandness of craft and the coldness of philosophy were released in the breast of the Egyptian Rapidly one thought chased another he saw before him an obstinate barrier to even a lawful alliance with Ione the fellow champion of Glaucus in the struggle which had baffled his designs the reviler of his name the threatened desecrator of the goddess he served while he disbelieved the avowed and approaching revealer of his own impostures and vices His love his repute nay his very life might be in danger the day and hour seemed even to have been fixed for some design against him He knew by the words of the convert that Apaecides had adopted the Christian faith he knew the indomitable zeal which led on the proselytes of that creed Such was his enemy he grasped his stilus that enemy was in his power They were now before the chapel one hasty glance once more he cast around he saw none near silence and solitude alike tempted him Die then in thy rashness he muttered away obstacle to my rushing fates And just as the young Christian had turned to depart Arbaces raised his hand high over the left shoulder of Apaecides and plunged his sharp weapon twice into his breast Apaecides fell to the ground pierced to the heart he fell mute without even a groan at the very base of the sacred chapel Arbaces gazed upon him for a moment with the fierce animal joy of conquest over a foe But presently the full sense of the danger to which he was exposed flashed upon him he wiped his weapon carefully in the long grass and with the very garments of his victim drew his cloak round him and was about to depart when he saw coming up the path right before him the figure of a young man whose steps reeled and vacillated strangely as he advanced the quiet moonlight streamed full upon his face which seemed by the whitening ray colorless as marble The Egyptian recognized the face and form of Glaucus The unfortunate and benighted Greek was chanting a disconnected and mad song composed from snatches of hymns and sacred odes all jarringly woven together Ha thought the Egyptian instantaneously divining his state and its terrible cause so then the hell draught works and destiny hath sent thee hither to crush two of my foes at once Quickly even ere this thought occurred to him he had withdrawn on one side of the chapel and concealed himself amongst the boughs from that lurking place he watched as a tiger in his lair the advance of his second victim He noted the wandering and restless fire in the bright and beautiful eyes of the Athenian the convulsions that distorted his statue like features and writhed his hueless lip He saw that the Greek was utterly deprived of reason Nevertheless as Glaucus came up to the dead body of Apaecides from which the dark red stream flowed slowly over the grass so strange and ghastly a spectacle could not fail to arrest him benighted and erring as was his glimmering sense He paused placed his hand to his brow as if to collect himself and then saying What ho Endymion sleepest thou so soundly What has the moon said to thee Thou makest me jealous it is time to wake he stooped down with the intention of lifting up the body Forgetting feeling not his own debility the Egyptian sprung from his hiding place and as the Greek bent struck him forcibly to the ground over the very body of the Christian then raising his powerful voice to its highest pitch he shouted Ho citizens oh help me run hither hither A murder a murder before your very fane Help or the murderer escapes As he spoke he placed his foot on the breast of Glaucus an idle and superfluous precaution for the potion operating with the fall the Greek lay there motionless and insensible save that now and then his lips gave vent to some vague and raving sounds As he there stood awaiting the coming of those his voice still continued to summons perhaps some remorse some compunctious visitings for despite his crimes he was human haunted the breast of the Egyptian the defenceless state of Glaucus his wandering words his shattered reason smote him even more than the death of Apaecides and he said half audibly to himself Poor clay poor human reason where is the soul now I could spare thee O my rival rival never more But destiny must be obeyed my safety demands thy sacrifice With that as if to drown compunction he shouted yet more loudly and drawing from the girdle of Glaucus the stilus it contained he steeped it in the blood of the murdered man and laid it beside the corpse And now fast and breathless several of the citizens came thronging to the place some with torches which the moon rendered unnecessary but which flared red and tremulously against the darkness of the trees they surrounded the spot Lift up yon corpse said the Egyptian and guard well the murderer They raised the body and great was their horror and sacred indignation to discover in that lifeless clay a priest of the adored and venerable Isis but still greater perhaps was their surprise when they found the accused in the brilliant and admired Athenian Glaucus cried the bystanders with one accord is it even credible I would sooner whispered one man to his neighbor believe it to be the Egyptian himself Here a centurion thrust himself into the gathering crowd with an air of authority How blood spilt who the murderer The bystanders pointed to Glaucus He by Mars he has rather the air of being the victim Who accuses him I said Arbaces drawing himself up haughtily and the jewels which adorned his dress flashing in the eyes of the soldier instantly convinced that worthy warrior of the witness s respectability Pardon me your name said he Arbaces it is well known methinks in Pompeii Passing through the grove I beheld before me the Greek and the priest in earnest conversation I was struck by the reeling motions of the first his violent gestures and the loudness of his voice he seemed to me either drunk or mad Suddenly I saw him raise his stilus I darted forward too late to arrest the blow He had twice stabbed his victim and was bending over him when in my horror and indignation I struck the murderer to the ground He fell without a struggle which makes me yet more suspect that he was not altogether in his senses when the crime was perpetrated for recently recovered from a severe illness my blow was comparatively feeble and the frame of Glaucus as you see is strong and youthful His eyes are open now his lips move said the soldier Speak prisoner what sayest thou to the charge The charge ha ha Why it was merrily done when the old hag set her serpent at me and Hecate stood by laughing from ear to ear what could I do But I am ill I faint the serpent s fiery tongue hath bitten me Bear me to bed and send for your physician old AEsculapius himself will attend me if you let him know that I am Greek Oh mercy mercy I burn marrow and brain I burn And with a thrilling and fierce groan the Athenian fell back in the arms of the bystanders He raves said the officer compassionately and in his delirium he has struck the priest Hath any one present seen him to day I said one of the spectators beheld him in the morning He passed my shop and accosted me He seemed well and sane as the stoutest of us And I saw him half an hour ago said another passing up the streets muttering to himself with strange gestures and just as the Egyptian has described A corroboration of the witness it must be too true He must at all events to the praetor a pity so young and so rich But the crime is dreadful a priest of Isis in his very robes too and at the base itself of our most ancient chapel At these words the crowd were reminded more forcibly than in their excitement and curiosity they had yet been of the heinousness of the sacrilege They shuddered in pious horror No wonder the earth has quaked said one when it held such a monster Away with him to prison away cried they all And one solitary voice was heard shrilly and joyously above the rest The beasts will not want a gladiator now Ho ho for the merry merry show It was the voice of the young woman whose conversation with Medon has been repeated True true it chances in season for the games cried several and at that thought all pity for the accused seemed vanished His youth his beauty but fitted him better for the purpose of the arena Bring hither some planks or if at hand a litter to bear the dead said Arbaces a priest of Isis ought scarcely to be carried to his temple by vulgar hands like a butchered gladiator At this the bystanders reverently laid the corpse of Apaecides on the ground with the face upwards and some of them went in search of some contrivance to bear the body untouched by the profane It was just at that time that the crowd gave way to right and left as a sturdy form forced itself through and Olinthus the Christian stood immediately confronting the Egyptian But his eyes at first only rested with inexpressible grief and horror on that gory side and upturned face on which the agony of violent death yet lingered Murdered he said Is it thy zeal that has brought thee to this Have they detected thy noble purpose and by death prevented their own shame He turned his head abruptly and his eyes fell full on the solemn features of the Egyptian As he looked you might see in his face and even the slight shiver of his frame the repugnance and aversion which the Christian felt for one whom he knew to be so dangerous and so criminal It was indeed the gaze of the bird upon the basilisk so silent was it and so prolonged But shaking off the sudden chill that had crept over him Olinthus extended his right arm towards Arbaces and said in a deep and loud voice Murder hath been done upon this corpse Where is the murderer Stand forth Egyptian For as the Lord liveth I believe thou art the man An anxious and perturbed change might for one moment be detected on the dusky features of Arbaces but it gave way to the frowning expression of indignation and scorn as awed and arrested by the suddenness and vehemence of the charge the spectators pressed nearer and nearer upon the two more prominent actors I know said Arbaces proudly who is my accuser and I guess wherefore he thus arraigns me Men and citizens know this man for the most bitter of the Nazarenes if that or Christians be their proper name What marvel that in his malignity he dares accuse even an Egyptian of the murder of a priest of Egypt I know him I know the dog shouted several voices It is Olinthus the Christian or rather the Atheist he denies the gods Peace brethren said Olinthus with dignity and hear me This murdered priest of Isis before his death embraced the Christian faith he revealed to me the dark sins the sorceries of yon Egyptian the mummeries and delusions of the fane of Isis He was about to declare them publicly He a stranger unoffending without enemies who should shed his blood but one of those who feared his witness Who might fear that testimony the most Arbaces the Egyptian You hear him said Arbaces you hear him he blasphemes Ask him if he believes in Isis Do I believe in an evil demon returned Olinthus boldly A groan and shudder passed through the assembly Nothing daunted for prepared at every time for peril and in the present excitement losing all prudence the Christian continued Back idolaters this clay is not for your vain and polluting rites it is to us to the followers of Christ that the last offices due to a Christian belong I claim this dust in the name of the great Creator who has recalled the spirit With so solemn and commanding a voice and aspect the Christian spoke these words that even the crowd forbore to utter aloud the execration of fear and hatred which in their hearts they conceived And never perhaps since Lucifer and the Archangel contended for the body of the mighty Lawgiver was there a more striking subject for the painter s genius than that scene exhibited The dark trees the stately fane the moon full on the corpse of the deceased the torches tossing wildly to and fro in the rear the various faces of the motley audience the insensible form of the Athenian supported in the distance and in the foreground and above all the forms of Arbaces and the Christian the first drawn to its full height far taller than the herd around his arms folded his brow knit his eyes fixed his lip slightly curled in defiance and disdain The last bearing on a brow worn and furrowed the majesty of an equal command the features stern yet frank the aspect bold yet open the quiet dignity of the whole form impressed with an ineffable earnestness hushed as it were in a solemn sympathy with the awe he himself had created His left hand pointing to the corpse his right hand raised to heaven The centurion pressed forward again In the first place hast thou Olinthus or whatever be thy name any proof of the charge thou hast made against Arbaces beyond thy vague suspicions Olinthus remained silent the Egyptian laughed contemptuously Dost thou claim the body of a priest of Isis as one of the Nazarene or Christian sect I do Swear then by yon fane yon statue of Cybele by yon most ancient sacellum in Pompeii that the dead man embraced your faith Vain man I disown your idols I abhor your temples How can I swear by Cybele then Away away with the Atheist away the earth will swallow us if we suffer these blasphemers in a sacred grove away with him to death To the beasts added a female voice in the centre of the crowd we shall have one a piece now for the lion and tiger If O Nazarene thou disbelievest in Cybele which of our gods dost thou own resumed the soldier unmoved by the cries around None Hark to him hark cried the crowd O vain and blind continued the Christian raising his voice can you believe in images of wood and stone Do you imagine that they have eyes to see or ears to hear or hands to help ye Is yon mute thing carved by man s art a goddess hath it made mankind alas by mankind was it made Lo convince yourself of its nothingness of your folly And as he spoke he strode across to the fane and ere any of the bystanders were aware of his purpose he in his compassion or his zeal struck the statue of wood from its pedestal See cried he your goddess cannot avenge herself Is this a thing to worship Further words were denied to him so gross and daring a sacrilege of one too of the most sacred of their places of worship filled even the most lukewarm with rage and horror With one accord the crowd rushed upon him seized and but for the interference of the centurion they would have torn him to pieces Peace said the soldier authoritatively refer we this insolent blasphemer to the proper tribunal time has been already wasted Bear we both the culprits to the magistrates place the body of the priest on the litter carry it to his own home At this moment a priest of Isis stepped forward I claim these remains according to the custom of the priesthood The flamen be obeyed said the centurion How is the murderer Insensible or asleep Were his crimes less I could pity him On Arbaces as he turned met the eye of that priest of Isis it was Calenus and something there was in that glance so significant and sinister that the Egyptian muttered to himself Could he have witnessed the deed A girl darted from the crowd and gazed hard on the face of Olinthus By Jupiter a stout knave I say we shall have a man for the tiger now one for each beast Ho shouted the mob a man for the lion and another for the tiger What luck Io Paean Chapter VII IN WHICH THE READER LEARNS THE CONDITION OF GLAUCUS FRIENDSHIP TESTED ENMITY SOFTENED LOVE THE SAME BECAUSE THE ONE LOVING IS BLIND THE night was somewhat advanced and the gay lounging places of the Pompeians were still crowded You might observe in the countenances of the various idlers a more earnest expression than usual They talked in large knots and groups as if they sought by numbers to divide the half painful half pleasurable anxiety which belonged to the subject on which they conversed it was a subject of life and death A young man passed briskly by the graceful portico of the Temple of Fortune so briskly indeed that he came with no slight force full against the rotund and comely form of that respectable citizen Diomed who was retiring homeward to his suburban villa Holloa groaned the merchant recovering with some difficulty his equilibrium have you no eyes or do you think I have no feeling By Jupiter you have well nigh driven out the divine particle such another shock and my soul will be in Hades Ah Diomed is it you forgive my inadvertence I was absorbed in thinking of the reverses of life Our poor friend Glaucus eh who could have guessed it Well but tell me Clodius is he really to be tried by the senate Yes they say the crime is of so extraordinary a nature that the senate itself must adjudge it and so the lictors are to induct him formally He has been accused publicly then To be sure where have you been not to hear that Why I have only just returned from Neapolis whither I went on business the very morning after his crime so shocking and at my house the same night that it happened There is no doubt of his guilt said Clodius shrugging his shoulders and as these crimes take precedence of all little undignified peccadilloes they will hasten to finish the sentence previous to the games The games Good gods replied Diomed with a slight shudder can they adjudge him to the beasts so young so rich True but then he is a Greek Had he been a Roman it would have been a thousand pities These foreigners can be borne with in their prosperity but in adversity we must not forget that they are in reality slaves However we of the upper classes are always tender hearted and he would certainly get off tolerably well if he were left to us for between ourselves what is a paltry priest of Isis what Isis herself But the common people are superstitious they clamor for the blood of the sacrilegious one It is dangerous not to give way to public opinion And the blasphemer the Christian or Nazarene or whatever else he be called Oh poor dog if he will sacrifice to Cybele or Isis he will be pardoned if not the tiger has him At least so I suppose but the trial will decide We talk while the urn s still empty And the Greek may yet escape the deadly Theta of his own alphabet But enough of this gloomy subject How is the fair Julia Well I fancy Commend me to her But hark the door yonder creaks on its hinges it is the house of the praetor Who comes forth By Pollux it is the Egyptian What can he want with our official friend Some conference touching the murder doubtless replied Diomed but what was supposed to be the inducement to the crime Glaucus was to have married the priest s sister Yes some say Apaecides refused the alliance It might have been a sudden quarrel Glaucus was evidently drunk nay so much so as to have been quite insensible when taken up and I hear is still delirious whether with wine terror remorse the Furies or the Bacchanals I cannot say Poor fellow he has good counsel The best Caius Pollio an eloquent fellow enough Pollio has been hiring all the poor gentlemen and well born spendthrifts of Pompeii to dress shabbily and sneak about swearing their friendship to Glaucus who would not have spoken to them to be made emperor I will do him justice he was a gentleman in his choice of acquaintance and trying to melt the stony citizens into pity But it will not do Isis is mightily popular just at this moment And by the by I have some merchandise at Alexandria Yes Isis ought to be protected True so farewell old gentleman we shall meet soon if not we must have a friendly bet at the Amphitheatre All my calculations are confounded by this cursed misfortune of Glaucus He had bet on Lydon the gladiator I must make up my tablets elsewhere Vale Leaving the less active Diomed to regain his villa Clodius strode on humming a Greek air and perfuming the night with the odorous that steamed from his snowy garments and flowing locks If thought he Glaucus feed the lion Julia will no longer have a person to love better than me she will certainly doat on me and so I suppose I must marry By the gods the twelve lines begin to fail men look suspiciously at my hand when it rattles the dice That infernal Sallust insinuates cheating and if it be discovered that the ivory is clogged why farewell to the merry supper and the perfumed billet Clodius is undone Better marry then while I may renounce gaming and push my fortune or rather the gentle Julia s at the imperial court Thus muttering the schemes of his ambition if by that high name the projects of Clodius may be called the gamester found himself suddenly accosted he turned and beheld the dark brow of Arbaces Hail noble Clodius pardon my interruption and inform me I pray you which is the house of Sallust It is but a few yards hence wise Arbaces But does Sallust entertain to night I know not answered the Egyptian nor am I perhaps one of those whom he would seek as a boon companion But thou knowest that his house holds the person of Glaucus the murderer Ay he good hearted epicure believes in the Greek s innocence You remind me that he has become his surety and therefore till the trial is responsible for his appearance Well Sallust s house is better than a prison especially that wretched hole in the forum But for what can you seek Glaucus Why noble Clodius if we could save him from execution it would be well The condemnation of the rich is a blow upon society itself I should like to confer with him for I hear he has recovered his senses and ascertain the motives of his crime they may be so extenuating as to plead in his defence You are benevolent Arbaces Benevolence is the duty of one who aspires to wisdom replied the Egyptian modestly Which way lies Sallust s mansion I will show you said Clodius if you will suffer me to accompany you a few steps But pray what has become of the poor girl who was to have wed the Athenian the sister of the murdered priest Alas well nigh insane Sometimes she utters imprecations on the murderer then suddenly stops short then cries But why curse Oh my brother Glaucus was not thy murderer never will I believe it Then she begins again and again stops short and mutters awfully to herself Yet if it were indeed he Unfortunate Ione But it is well for her that those solemn cares to the dead which religion enjoins have hitherto greatly absorbed her attention from Glaucus and herself and in the dimness of her senses she scarcely seems aware that Glaucus is apprehended and on the eve of trial When the funeral rites due to Apaecides are performed her apprehension will return and then I fear me much that her friends will be revolted by seeing her run to succour and aid the murderer of her brother Such scandal should be prevented I trust I have taken precautions to that effect I am her lawful guardian and have just succeeded in obtaining permission to escort her after the funeral of Apaecides to my own house there please the gods she will be secure You have done well sage Arbaces And now yonder is the house of Sallust The gods keep you Yet hark you Arbaces why so gloomy and unsocial Men say you can be gay why not let me initiate you into the pleasures of Pompeii I flatter myself no one knows them better I thank you noble Clodius under your auspices I might venture I think to wear the philyra but at my age I should be an awkward pupil Oh never fear I have made converts of fellows of seventy The rich too are never old You flatter me At some future time I will remind you of your promise You may command Marcus Clodius at all times and so vale Now said the Egyptian soliloquising I am not wantonly a man of blood I would willingly save this Greek if by confessing the crime he will lose himself for ever to Ione and for ever free me from the chance of discovery and I can save him by persuading Julia to own the philtre which will be held his excuse But if he do not confess the crime why Julia must be shamed from the confession and he must die die lest he prove my rival with the living die that he may be my proxy with the dead Will he confess can he not be persuaded that in his delirium he struck the blow To me it would give far greater safety than even his death Hem we must hazard the experiment Sweeping along the narrow street Arbaces now approached the house of Sallust when he beheld a dark form wrapped in a cloak and stretched at length across the threshold of the door So still lay the figure and so dim was its outline that any other than Arbaces might have felt a superstitious fear lest he beheld one of those grim lemures who above all other spots haunted the threshold of the homes they formerly possessed But not for Arbaces were such dreams Rise said he touching the figure with his foot thou obstructest the way Ha who art thou cried the form in a sharp tone and as she raised herself from the ground the starlight fell full on the pale face and fixed but sightless eyes of Nydia the Thessalian Who art thou I know the burden of thy voice Blind girl what dost thou here at this late hour Fie is this seeming thy sex or years Home girl I know thee said Nydia in a low voice thou art Arbaces the Egyptian then as if inspired by some sudden impulse she flung herself at his feet and clasping his knees exclaimed in a wild and passionate tone Oh dread and potent man save him save him He is not guilty it is I He lies within ill dying and I I am the hateful cause And they will not admit me to him they spurn the blind girl from the hall Oh heal him thou knowest some herb some spell some countercharm for it is a potion that hath wrought this frenzy Hush child I know all thou forgettest that I accompanied Julia to the saga s home Doubtless her hand administered the draught but her reputation demands thy silence Reproach not thyself what must be must meanwhile I seek the criminal he may yet be saved Away Thus saying Arbaces extricated himself from the clasp of the despairing Thessalian and knocked loudly at the door In a few moments the heavy bars were heard suddenly to yield and the porter half opening the door demanded who was there Arbaces important business to Sallust relative to Glaucus I come from the praetor The porter half yawning half groaning admitted the tall form of the Egyptian Nydia sprang forward How is he she cried tell me tell me Ho mad girl is it thou still for shame Why they say he is sensible The gods be praised and you will not admit me Ah I beseech thee Admit thee no A pretty salute I should prepare for these shoulders were I to admit such things as thou Go home The door closed and Nydia with a deep sigh laid herself down once more on the cold stones and wrapping her cloak round her face resumed her weary vigil Meanwhile Arbaces had already gained the triclinium where Sallust with his favorite freedman sat late at supper What Arbaces and at this hour Accept this cup Nay gentle Sallust it is on business not pleasure that I venture to disturb thee How doth thy charge they say in the town that he has recovered sense Alas and truly replied the good natured but thoughtless Sallust wiping the tear from his eyes but so shattered are his nerves and frame that I scarcely recognize the brilliant and gay carouser I was wont to know Yet strange to say he cannot account for the cause of the sudden frenzy that seized him he retains but a dim consciousness of what hath passed and despite thy witness wise Egyptian solemnly upholds his innocence of the death of Apaecides Sallust said Arbaces gravely there is much in thy friend s case that merits a peculiar indulgence and could we learn from his lips the confession and the cause of his crime much might be yet hoped from the mercy of the senate for the senate thou knowest hath the power either to mitigate or to sharpen the law Therefore it is that I have conferred with the highest authority of the city and obtained his permission to hold a private conference this night with the Athenian Tomorrow thou knowest the trial comes on Well said Sallust thou wilt be worthy of thy Eastern name and fame if thou canst learn aught from him but thou mayst try Poor Glaucus and he had such an excellent appetite He eats nothing now The benevolent epicure was moved sensibly at this thought He sighed and ordered his slaves to refill his cup Night wanes said the Egyptian suffer me to see thy ward now Sallust nodded assent and led the way to a small chamber guarded without by two dozing slaves The door opened at the request of Arbaces Sallust withdrew the Egyptian was alone with Glaucus One of those tall and graceful candelabra common to that day supporting a single lamp burned beside the narrow bed Its rays fell palely over the face of the Athenian and Arbaces was moved to see how sensibly that countenance had changed The rich color was gone the cheek was sunk the lips were convulsed and pallid fierce had been the struggle between reason and madness life and death The youth the strength of Glaucus had conquered but the freshness of blood and soul the life of life its glory and its zest were gone for ever The Egyptian seated himself quietly beside the bed Glaucus still lay mute and unconscious of his presence At length after a considerable pause Arbaces thus spoke Glaucus we have been enemies I come to thee alone and in the dead of night thy friend perhaps thy saviour As the steed starts from the path of the tiger Glaucus sprang up breathless alarmed panting at the abrupt voice the sudden apparition of his foe Their eyes met and neither for some moments had power to withdraw his gaze The flush went and came over the face of the Athenian and the bronzed cheek of the Egyptian grew a shade more pale At length with an inward groan Glaucus turned away drew his hand across his brow sunk back and muttered Am I still dreaming No Glaucus thou art awake By this right hand and my father s head thou seest one who may save thy life Hark I know what thou hast done but I know also its excuse of which thou thyself art ignorant Thou hast committed murder it is true a sacrilegious murder frown not start not these eyes saw it But I can save thee I can prove how thou wert bereaved of sense and made not a free thinking and free acting man But in order to save thee thou must confess thy crime Sign but this paper acknowledging thy hand in the death of Apaecides and thou shalt avoid the fatal urn What words are these Murder and Apaecides Did I not see him stretched on the ground bleeding and a corpse and wouldst thou persuade me that I did the deed Man thou liest Away Be not rash Glaucus be not hasty the deed is proved Come come thou mayst well be excused for not recalling the act of thy delirium and which thy sober senses would have shunned even to contemplate But let me try to refresh thy exhausted and weary memory Thou knowest thou wert walking with the priest disputing about his sister thou knowest he was intolerant and half a Nazarene and he sought to convert thee and ye had hot words and he calumniated thy mode of life and swore he would not marry Ione to thee and then in thy wrath and thy frenzy thou didst strike the sudden blow Come come you can recollect this read this papyrus it runs to that effect sign it and thou art saved Barbarian give me the written lie that I may tear it I the murderer of Ione s brother I confess to have injured one hair of the head of him she loved Let me rather perish a thousand times Beware said Arbaces in a low and hissing tone there is but one choice thy confession and thy signature or the amphitheatre and the lion s maw As the Egyptian fixed his eyes upon the sufferer he hailed with joy the signs of evident emotion that seized the latter at these words A slight shudder passed over the Athenian s frame his lip fell an expression of sudden fear and wonder betrayed itself in his brow and eye Great gods he said in a low voice what reverse is this It seems but a little day since life laughed out from amidst roses Ione mine youth health love lavishing on me their treasures and now pain madness shame death And for what What have I done Oh I am mad still Sign and be saved said the soft sweet voice of the Egyptian Tempter never cried Glaucus in the reaction of rage Thou knowest me not thou knowest not the haughty soul of an Athenian The sudden face of death might appal me for a moment but the fear is over Dishonour appals for ever Who will debase his name to save his life who exchange clear thoughts for sullen days who will belie himself to shame and stand blackened in the eyes of love If to earn a few years of polluted life there be so base a coward dream not dull barbarian of Egypt to find him in one who has trod the same sod as Harmodius and breathed the same air as Socrates Go leave me to live without self reproach or to perish without fear Bethink thee well the lion s fangs the hoots of the brutal mob the vulgar gaze on thy dying agony and mutilated limbs thy name degraded thy corpse unburied the shame thou wouldst avoid clinging to thee for aye and ever Thou ravest thou art the madman shame is not in the loss of other men s esteem it is in the loss of our own Wilt thou go my eyes loathe the sight of thee hating ever I despise thee now I go said Arbaces stung and exasperated but not without some pitying admiration of his victim I go we meet twice again once at the Trial once at the Death Farewell The Egyptian rose slowly gathered his robes about him and left the chamber He sought Sallust for a moment whose eyes began to reel with the vigils of the cup He is still unconscious or still obstinate there is no hope for him Say not so replied Sallust who felt but little resentment against the Athenian s accuser for he possessed no great austerity of virtue and was rather moved by his friend s reverses than persuaded of his innocence say not so my Egyptian so good a drinker shall be saved if possible Bacchus against Isis We shall see said the Egyptian Suddenly the bolts were again withdrawn the door unclosed Arbaces was in the open street and poor Nydia once more started from her long watch Wilt thou save him she cried clasping her hands Child follow me home I would speak to thee it is for his sake I ask it And thou wilt save him No answer came forth to the thirsting ear of the blind girl Arbaces had already proceeded far up the street she hesitated a moment and then followed his steps in silence I must secure this girl said he musingly lest she give evidence of the philtre as to the vain Julia she will not betray herself Chapter VIII A CLASSIC FUNERAL WHILE Arbaces had been thus employed Sorrow and Death were in the house of Ione It was the night preceding the morn in which the solemn funeral rites were to be decreed to the remains of the murdered Apaecides The corpse had been removed from the temple of Isis to the house of the nearest surviving relative and Ione had heard in the same breath the death of her brother and the accusation against her betrothed That first violent anguish which blunts the sense to all but itself and the forbearing silence of her slaves had prevented her learning minutely the circumstances attendant on the fate of her lover His illness his frenzy and his approaching trial were unknown to her She learned only the accusation against him and at once indignantly rejected it nay on hearing that Arbaces was the accuser she required no more to induce her firmly and solemnly to believe that the Egyptian himself was the criminal But the vast and absorbing importance attached by the ancients to the performance of every ceremonial connected with the death of a relation had as yet confined her woe and her convictions to the chamber of the deceased Alas it was not for her to perform that tender and touching office which obliged the nearest relative to endeavor to catch the last breath the parting soul of the beloved one but it was hers to close the straining eyes the distorted lips to watch by the consecrated clay as fresh bathed and anointed it lay in festive robes upon the ivory bed to strew the couch with leaves and flowers and to renew the solemn cypress branch at the threshold of the door And in these sad offices in lamentation and in prayer Ione forgot herself It was among the loveliest customs of the ancients to bury the young at the morning twilight for as they strove to give the softest interpretation to death so they poetically imagined that Aurora who loved the young had stolen them to her embrace and though in the instance of the murdered priest this fable could not appropriately cheat the fancy the general custom was still preserved The stars were fading one by one from the grey heavens and night slowly receding before the approach of morn when a dark group stood motionless before Ione s door High and slender torches made paler by the unmellowed dawn cast their light over various countenances hushed for the moment in one solemn and intent expression And now there arose a slow and dismal music which accorded sadly with the rite and floated far along the desolate and breathless streets while a chorus of female voices the Praeficae so often cited by the Roman poets accompanying the Tibicen and the Mysian flute woke the following strain THE FUNERAL DIRGE O er the sad threshold where the cypress bough Supplants the rose that should adorn thy home On the last pilgrimage on earth that now Awaits thee wanderer to Cocytus come Darkly we woo and weeping we invite Death is thy host his banquet asks thy soul Thy garlands hang within the House of Night And the black stream alone shall fill thy bowl No more for thee the laughter and the song The jocund night the glory of the day The Argive daughters at their labours long The hell bird swooping on its Titan prey The false AEolides upheaving slow O er the eternal hill the eternal stone The crowned Lydian in his parching woe And green Callirrhoe s monster headed son These shalt thou see dim shadowed through the dark Which makes the sky of Pluto s dreary shore Lo where thou stand saint pale gazing on the bark That waits our rite to bear thee trembling o er Come then no more delay the phantom pines Amidst the Unburied for its latest home O er the grey sky the torch impatient shines Come mourner forth the lost one bids thee come As the hymn died away the group parted in twain and placed upon a couch spread with a purple pall the corpse of Apaecides was carried forth with the feet foremost The designator or marshal of the sombre ceremonial accompanied by his torch bearers clad in black gave the signal and the procession moved dreadly on First went the musicians playing a slow march the solemnity of the lower instruments broken by many a louder and wilder burst of the funeral trumpet next followed the hired mourners chanting their dirges to the dead and the female voices were mingled with those of boys whose tender years made still more striking the contrast of life and death the fresh leaf and the withered one But the players the buffoons the archimimus whose duty it was to personate the dead these the customary attendants at ordinary funerals were banished from a funeral attended with so many terrible associations The priests of Isis came next in their snowy garments barefooted and supporting sheaves of corn while before the corpse were carried the images of the deceased and his many Athenian forefathers And behind the bier followed amidst her women the sole surviving relative of the dead her head bare her locks disheveled her face paler than marble but composed and still save ever and anon as some tender thought awakened by the music flashed upon the dark lethargy of woe she covered that countenance with her hands and sobbed unseen for hers were not the noisy sorrow the shrill lament the ungoverned gesture which characterized those who honored less faithfully In that age as in all the channel of deep grief flowed hushed and still And so the procession swept on till it had traversed the streets passed the city gate and gained the Place of Tombs without the wall which the traveler yet beholds Raised in the form of an altar of unpolished pine amidst whose interstices were placed preparations of combustible matter stood the funeral pyre and around it drooped the dark and gloomy cypresses so consecrated by song to the tomb As soon as the bier was placed upon the pile the attendants parting on either side Ione passed up to the couch and stood before the unconscious clay for some moments motionless and silent The features of the dead had been composed from the first agonized expression of violent death Hushed for ever the terror and the doubt the contest of passion the awe of religion the struggle of the past and present the hope and the horror of the future of all that racked and desolated the breast of that young aspirant to the Holy of Life what trace was visible in the awful serenity of that impenetrable brow and unbreathing lip The sister gazed and not a sound was heard amidst the crowd there was something terrible yet softening also in the silence and when it broke it broke sudden and abrupt it broke with a loud and passionate cry the vent of long smothered despair My brother my brother cried the poor orphan falling upon the couch thou whom the worm on thy path feared not what enemy couldst thou provoke Oh is it in truth come to this Awake awake We grew together Are we thus torn asunder Thou art not dead thou sleepest Awake awake The sound of her piercing voice aroused the sympathy of the mourners and they broke into loud and rude lament This startled this recalled Ione she looked up hastily and confusedly as if for the first time sensible of the presence of those around Ah she murmured with a shiver we are not then alone With that after a brief pause she rose and her pale and beautiful countenance was again composed and rigid With fond and trembling hands she unclosed the lids of the deceased but when the dull glazed eye no longer beaming with love and life met hers she shrieked aloud as if she had seen a spectre Once more recovering herself she kissed again and again the lids the lips the brow and with mechanic and unconscious hand received from the high priest of her brother s temple the funeral torch The sudden burst of music the sudden song of the mourners announced the birth of the sanctifying flame HYMN TO THE WIND I On thy couch of cloud reclined Wake O soft and sacred Wind Soft and sacred will we name thee Whosoe er the sire that claim thee Whether old Auster s dusky child Or the loud son of Eurus wild Or his who o er the darkling deeps From the bleak North in tempest sweeps Still shalt thou seem as dear to us As flowery crowned Zephyrus When through twilight s starry dew Trembling he hastes his nymph to woo II Lo our silver censers swinging Perfumes o er thy path are flinging Ne er o er Tempe s breathless valleys Ne er o er Cypria s cedarn alleys Or the Rose isle s moonlit sea Floated sweets more worthy thee Lo around our vases sending Myrrh and nard with cassia blending Paving air with odorous meet For thy silver sandall d feet III August and everlasting air The source of all that breathe and be From the mute clay before thee bear The seeds it took from thee Aspire bright Flame aspire Wild wind awake awake Thine own O solemn Fire O Air thine own retake IV It comes it comes Lo it sweeps The Wind we invoke the while And crackles and darts and leaps The light on the holy pile It rises its wings interweave With the flames how they howl and heave Toss d whirl d to and fro How the flame serpents glow Rushing higher and higher On on fearful Fire Thy giant limbs twined With the arms of the Wind Lo the elements meet on the throne Of death to reclaim their own V Swing swing the censer round Tune the strings to a softer sound From the chains of thy earthly toil From the clasp of thy mortal coil From the prison where clay confined thee The hands of the flame unbind thee O Soul thou art free all free As the winds in their ceaseless chase When they rush o er their airy sea Thou mayst speed through the realms of space No fetter is forged for thee Rejoice o er the sluggard tide Of the Styx thy bark can glide And thy steps evermore shall rove Through the glades of the happy grove Where far from the loath d Cocytus The loved and the lost invite us Thou art slave to the earth no more O soul thou art freed and we Ah when shall our toil be o er Ah when shall we rest with thee And now high and far into the dawning skies broke the fragrant fire it flushed luminously across the gloomy cypresses it shot above the massive walls of the neighboring city and the early fisherman started to behold the blaze reddening on the waves of the creeping sea But Ione sat down apart and alone and leaning her face upon her hands saw not the flame nor heard the lamentation of the music she felt only one sense of loneliness she had not yet arrived to that hallowing sense of comfort when we know that we are not alone that the dead are with us The breeze rapidly aided the effect of the combustibles placed within the pile By degrees the flame wavered lowered dimmed and slowly by fits and unequal starts died away emblem of life itself where just before all was restlessness and flame now lay the dull and smouldering ashes The last sparks were extinguished by the attendants the embers were collected Steeped in the rarest wine and the costliest odorous the remains were placed in a silver urn which was solemnly stored in one of the neighboring sepulchres beside the road and they placed within it the vial full of tears and the small coin which poetry still consecrated to the grim boatman And the sepulchre was covered with flowers and chaplets and incense kindled on the altar and the tomb hung round with many lamps But the next day when the priest returned with fresh offerings to the tomb he found that to the relics of heathen superstition some unknown hands had added a green palm branch He suffered it to remain unknowing that it was the sepulchral emblem of Christianity When the above ceremonies were over one of the Praeficae three times sprinkled the mourners from the purifying branch of laurel uttering the last word Ilicet Depart and the rite was done But first they paused to utter weepingly and many times the affecting farewell Salve Eternum And as Ione yet lingered they woke the parting strain SALVE ETERNUM I Farewell O soul departed Farewell O sacred urn Bereaved and broken hearted To earth the mourners turn To the dim and dreary shore Thou art gone our steps before But thither the swift Hours lead us And thou dost but a while precede us Salve salve Loved urn and thou solemn cell Mute ashes farewell farewell Salve salve II Ilicet ire licet Ah vainly would we part Thy tomb is the faithful heart About evermore we bear thee For who from the heart can tear thee Vainly we sprinkle o er us The drops of the cleansing stream And vainly bright before us The lustral fire shall beam For where is the charm expelling Thy thought from its sacred dwelling Our griefs are thy funeral feast And Memory thy mourning priest Salve salve III Ilicet ire licet The spark from the hearth is gone Wherever the air shall bear it The elements take their own The shadows receive thy spirit It will soothe thee to feel our grief As thou glid saint by the Gloomy River If love may in life be brief In death it is fixed for ever Salve salve In the hall which our feasts illume The rose for an hour may bloom But the cypress that decks the tomb The cypress is green for ever Salve salve Chapter IX IN WHICH AN ADVENTURE HAPPENS TO IONE WHILE some stayed behind to share with the priests the funeral banquet Ione and her handmaids took homeward their melancholy way And now the last duties to her brother performed her mind awoke from its absorption and she thought of her allianced and the dread charge against him Not as we have before said attaching even a momentary belief to the unnatural accusation but nursing the darkest suspicion against Arbaces she felt that justice to her lover and to her murdered relative demanded her to seek the praetor and communicate her impression unsupported as it might be Questioning her maidens who had hitherto kindly anxious as I have said to save her the additional agony refrained from informing her of the state of Glaucus she learned that he had been dangerously ill that he was in custody under the roof of Sallust that the day of his trial was appointed Averting gods she exclaimed and have I been so long forgetful of him Have I seemed to shun him O let me hasten to do him justice to show that I the nearest relative of the dead believe him innocent of the charge Quick quick let us fly Let me soothe tend cheer him and if they will not believe me if they will not lead to my conviction if they sentence him to exile or to death let me share the sentence with him Instinctively she hastened her pace confused and bewildered scarce knowing whither she went now designing first to seek the praetor and now to rush to the chamber of Glaucus She hurried on she passed the gate of the city she was in the long street leading up the town The houses were opened but none were yet astir in the streets the life of the city was scarce awake when lo she came suddenly upon a small knot of men standing beside a covered litter A tall figure stepped from the midst of them and Ione shrieked aloud to behold Arbaces Fair Ione said he gently and appearing not to heed her alarm my ward my pupil forgive me if I disturb thy pious sorrows but the praetor solicitous of thy honour and anxious that thou mayest not rashly be implicated in the coming trial knowing the strange embarrassment of thy state seeking justice for thy brother but dreading punishment to thy betrothed sympathizing too with thy unprotected and friendless condition and deeming it harsh that thou shouldst be suffered to act unguided and mourn alone hath wisely and paternally confided thee to the care of thy lawful guardian Behold the writing which intrusts thee to my charge Dark Egyptian cried Ione drawing herself proudly aside begone It is thou that hast slain my brother Is it to thy care thy hands yet reeking with his blood that they will give the sister Ha thou turnest pale thy conscience smites thee thou tremblest at the thunderbolt of the avenging god Pass on and leave me to my woe Thy sorrows unstring thy reason Ione said Arbaces attempting in vain his usual calmness of tone I forgive thee Thou wilt find me now as ever thy surest friend But the public streets are not the fitting place for us to confer for me to console thee Approach slaves Come my sweet charge the litter awaits thee The amazed and terrified attendants gathered round Ione and clung to her knees Arbaces said the eldest of the maidens this is surely not the law For nine days after the funeral is it not written that the relatives of the deceased shall not be molested in their homes or interrupted in their solitary grief Woman returned Arbaces imperiously waving his hand to place a ward under the roof of her guardian is not against the funeral laws I tell thee I have the fiat of the praetor This delay is indecorous Place her in the litter So saying he threw his arm firmly round the shrinking form of Ione She drew back gazed earnestly in his face and then burst into hysterical laughter Ha ha this is well well Excellent guardian paternal law Ha ha And startled herself at the dread echo of that shrill and maddened laughter she sunk as it died away lifeless upon the ground A minute more and Arbaces had lifted her into the litter The bearers moved swiftly on and the unfortunate Ione was soon borne from the sight of her weeping handmaids Chapter X WHAT BECOMES OF NYDIA IN THE HOUSE OF ARBACES THE EGYPTIAN FEELS COMPASSION FOR GLAUCUS COMPASSION IS OFTEN A VERY USELESS VISITOR TO THE GUILTY

3547-8363-0001	train-other-500	and conversing there with her he learned from the confession of her despair and remorse that her hand and not Julia s had administered to Glaucus the fatal potion
3547-8363-0002	train-other-500	At another time the Egyptian might have conceived a philosophical interest in sounding the depths and origin
none	none	 of the strange and absorbing passion which 
3547-8363-0003	train-other-500	in blindness and in slavery this singular girl had dared to cherish but at present he spared no thought from himself As after her confession the poor Nydia threw herself on her knees before him
3547-8363-0004	train-other-500	and besought him to restore the health and save the life of Glaucus for in her youth and ignorance she imagined the dark magician all powerful to effect both
none	none	 Arbaces with unheeding ears was noting only the new expediency of detaining Nydia 
3547-8363-0005	train-other-500	a prisoner until the trial and fate of Glaucus were decided
none	none	 For if 
3547-8363-0006	train-other-500	when he judged her merely the accomplice of Julia in obtaining the philtre he had felt it was dangerous to the full success of his vengeance to allow her to be at large to appear perhaps as a witness
none	none	 to avow the manner in which the sense of Glaucus had been darkened and thus win indulgence to the crime of which he was accused how much more was she likely to volunteer her testimony when she herself had administered the draught 
3547-8363-0007	train-other-500	and inspired by love would be only anxious at any expense of shame to retrieve her error and preserve her beloved Besides how unworthy of the rank and repute of Arbaces
3547-8363-0008	train-other-500	to be implicated in the disgrace of pandering to the passion of Julia and assisting in the unholy rites of the Saga of Vesuvius
none	none	 Nothing less indeed than his desire to induce Glaucus to own the murder of Apaecides as a policy evidently the best both for his own permanent safety and his successful suit with Ione 
3547-8363-0009	train-other-500	could ever have led him to contemplate the confession of Julia As for Nydia who was necessarily cut off by her blindness from much of the knowledge of active life and who a slave and a stranger was naturally ignorant of the perils of the Roman law
none	none	 she thought rather of the illness and delirium of her Athenian 
3547-8363-0010	train-other-500	than the crime of which she had vaguely heard him accused or the chances of the impending trial Poor wretch that she was whom none addressed none cared for what did she know of the senate and the sentence the hazard of the law
3547-8363-0011	train-other-500	the ferocity of the people the arena and the lion s den She was accustomed only to associate with the thought of Glaucus everything that was prosperous and lofty she could not imagine that any peril save from the madness of her love
none	none	 could menace that sacred head He seemed to her set apart for the blessings of life She only had disturbed the current of his felicity she knew not she dreamed not that the stream once so bright was dashing on to darkness and to death 
3547-8363-0012	train-other-500	It was therefore to restore the brain that she had marred to save the life that she had endangered that she implored the assistance of the great Egyptian Daughter said Arbaces waking from his reverie
none	none	 thou must rest here it is not meet for thee to wander along the streets and be spurned from the threshold by the rude feet of slaves I have compassion on thy soft crime I will do all to remedy it 
3547-8363-0013	train-other-500	Wait here patiently for some days and Glaucus shall be restored So saying and without waiting for her reply he hastened from the room drew the bolt across the door and consigned the care and wants of his prisoner
3547-8363-0014	train-other-500	to the slave who had the charge of that part of the mansion Alone then and musingly he waited the morning light and with it repaired
none	none	 as we have seen to possess himself of the person of Ione 
3547-8363-0015	train-other-500	His primary object with respect to the unfortunate
none	none	 Neapolitan was that which he had really stated to Clodius viz 
3547-8363-0016	train-other-500	to prevent her interesting herself actively in the trial of Glaucus and also to guard against her accusing him which she would doubtless have done of his former act of perfidy and violence towards her his ward
3547-8363-0017	train-other-500	denouncing his causes for vengeance against Glaucus unveiling the hypocrisy of his character and casting any doubt upon his veracity in the charge which he had made against the Athenian Not till he had encountered her that morning
3547-8363-0018	train-other-500	not till he had heard her loud denunciations was he aware that he had also another danger to apprehend
none	none	 in her suspicion of his crime He hugged himself now at the thought that these ends were effected 
3547-8363-0019	train-other-500	that one at once the object of his passion and his fear was in his power
none	none	 He believed more than ever the flattering promises of the stars and when he sought Ione in that chamber in the inmost recesses of his mysterious mansion 
3547-8363-0020	train-other-500	to which he had consigned her when he found her overpowered by blow upon blow and passing from fit to fit from violence to torpor
none	none	 in all the alternations of hysterical disease he thought more of the loveliness which no frenzy 
3547-8363-0021	train-other-500	could distort than of the woe which he had brought upon her
none	none	 In that sanguine vanity common to men who through life have been invariably successful 
3547-8363-0022	train-other-500	whether in fortune or love he flattered himself that when Glaucus had perished when his name was solemnly blackened by the award of a legal judgment his title to her love for ever forfeited by condemnation
3547-8363-0023	train-other-500	to death for the murder of her own brother her affection would be changed to horror and that his tenderness and his passion assisted by all the arts with which he well knew how to dazzle woman s imagination
3547-8363-0024	train-other-500	might elect him to that throne in her heart from which his rival would be so awfully expelled This was his hope but should it fail his unholy and fervid passion whispered At the worst now she is in my power Yet withal
none	none	 he felt that uneasiness and apprehension 
3547-8363-0025	train-other-500	which attended upon the chance of detection even when the criminal is insensible to the voice of conscience that vague terror of the consequences of crime which is often mistaken for remorse at the crime itself The buoyant air of Campania
3547-8363-0026	train-other-500	weighed heavily upon his breast he longed to hurry from a scene where danger might not sleep eternally with the dead and
none	none	 having Ione now in his possession he secretly resolved as soon as he had witnessed the last agony of his rival to transport his wealth and her the costliest treasure of all to some distant shore Yes said he striding to and fro his solitary chamber yes the law that gave me the person of my ward 
3547-8363-0027	train-other-500	gives me the possession of my bride
none	none	 Far across the broad main will we sweep on our search 
3547-8363-0028	train-other-500	after novel luxuries and inexperienced pleasures Cheered by my stars supported by the omens of my soul we will penetrate to those vast and glorious worlds which my wisdom tells me lie yet untracked
3547-8363-0029	train-other-500	in the recesses of the circling sea There may this heart possessed of love grow once more alive to ambition there amongst nations uncrushed by the Roman yoke and to whose ear the name of Rome has not yet been wafted
none	none	 I may found an empire and transplant my ancestral creed renewing the ashes of the dead Theban rule continuing in yet grander shores the dynasty of my crowned fathers and waking in the noble heart of Ione 
3547-8363-0030	train-other-500	the grateful consciousness that she shares the lot of one who far from the aged rottenness of this slavish civilization restores the primal elements of greatness and unites in one mighty soul
none	none	 the attributes of the prophet and the king From this exultant soliloquy Arbaces was awakened to attend the trial of the Athenian 
3547-8363-0031	train-other-500	The worn and pallid cheek of his victim touched him less than the firmness of his nerves and the dauntlessness of his brow for Arbaces was one who had little pity for what was unfortunate but a strong sympathy for what was bold
3547-8363-0032	train-other-500	The congenialities that bind us to others ever assimilate to the qualities of our own nature The hero weeps less at the reverses of his enemy than at the fortitude with which he bears them All of us are human
3547-8363-0033	train-other-500	and Arbaces criminal as he was
none	none	 had his share of our common feelings and our mother clay Had he but obtained from Glaucus the written confession of his crime which would better than even the judgment of others have lost him with Ione and removed from Arbaces the chance of future detection the Egyptian would have strained every nerve to save his rival Even now his hatred was over his desire of revenge was slaked he crushed his prey not in enmity 
3547-8363-0034	train-other-500	but as an obstacle in his path Yet was he not the less resolved the less crafty and persevering in the course he pursued for the destruction of one whose doom was become necessary to the attainment of his objects and while
3547-8363-0035	train-other-500	with apparent reluctance and compassion he gave against Glaucus the evidence which condemned him he secretly and through the medium of the priesthood fomented that popular indignation which made an effectual obstacle
3547-8363-0036	train-other-500	to the pity of the senate He had sought Julia
none	none	 he had detailed to her the confession of Nydia 
3547-8363-0037	train-other-500	he had easily therefore lulled any scruple of conscience which might have led her to extenuate the offence of Glaucus by avowing her share in his frenzy and the more readily for her vain heart had loved the fame and the prosperity of Glaucus
3547-8363-0038	train-other-500	not Glaucus himself she felt no affection for a disgraced man
none	none	 nay she almost rejoiced in the disgrace that humbled the hated Ione 
3547-8363-0039	train-other-500	If Glaucus could not be her slave neither could he be the adorer of her rival This was sufficient consolation for any regret at his fate Volatile and fickle she began again to be moved by the sudden
3547-8363-0040	train-other-500	and earnest suit of Clodius and was not willing to hazard the loss of an alliance with that base but high born noble by any public exposure of her past weakness and immodest passion for another
none	none	 All things then smiled upon Arbaces all things frowned upon the Athenian Chapter XI NYDIA AFFECTS THE SORCERESS WHEN the Thessalian found that Arbaces returned to her no more when she was left hour after hour to all the torture of that miserable suspense which was rendered by blindness doubly intolerable she began with outstretched arms to feel around her prison for some channel of escape and finding the only entrance secure she called aloud and with the vehemence of a temper naturally violent and now sharpened by impatient agony Ho girl said the slave in attendance opening the door art thou bit by a scorpion or thinkest thou that we are dying of silence here and only to be preserved like the infant Jupiter by a hullabaloo Where is thy master and wherefore am I caged here I want air and liberty let me go forth Alas little one hast thou not seen enough of Arbaces to know that his will is imperial He hath ordered thee to be caged and caged thou art and I am thy keeper Thou canst not have air and liberty but thou mayst have what are much better things food and wine Proh Jupiter cried the girl wringing her hands and why am I thus imprisoned What can the great Arbaces want with so poor a thing as I am That I know not unless it be to attend on thy new mistress who has been brought hither this day What Ione here Yes poor lady she liked it little I fear Yet by the Temple of Castor Arbaces is a gallant man to the women Thy lady is his ward thou knowest Wilt thou take me to her She is ill frantic with rage and spite Besides I have no orders to do so and I never think for myself When Arbaces made me slave of these chambers he said I have but one lesson to give thee while thou servest me thou must have neither ears eyes nor thought thou must be but one quality obedience But what harm is there in seeing Ione That I know not but if thou wantest a companion I am willing to talk to thee little one for I am solitary enough in my dull cubiculum And by the way thou art Thessalian knowest thou not some cunning amusement of knife and shears some pretty trick of telling fortunes as most of thy race do in order to pass the time Tush slave hold thy peace or if thou wilt speak what hast thou heard of the state of Glaucus Why my master has gone to the Athenian s trial Glaucus will smart for it For what The murder of the priest Apaecides Ha said Nydia pressing her hands to her forehead something of this I have indeed heard but understand not Yet who will dare to touch a hair of his head That will the lion I fear Averting gods what wickedness dost thou utter Why only that if he be found guilty the lion or may be the tiger will be his executioner Nydia leaped up as if an arrow had entered her heart she uttered a piercing scream then falling before the feet of the slave she cried in a tone that melted even his rude heart Ah tell me thou jestest thou utterest not the truth speak speak Why by my faith blind girl I know nothing of the law it may not be so bad as I say But Arbaces is his accuser and the people desire a victim for the arena Cheer thee But what hath the fate of the Athenian to do with thine No matter no matter he has been kind to me thou knowest not then what they will do Arbaces his accuser O fate The people the people Ah they can look upon his face who will be cruel to the Athenian Yet was not Love itself cruel to him So saying her head drooped upon her bosom she sunk into silence scalding tears flowed down her cheeks and all the kindly efforts of the slave were unable either to console her or distract the absorption of her reverie When his household cares obliged the ministrant to leave her room Nydia began to re collect her thoughts Arbaces was the accuser of Glaucus Arbaces had imprisoned her here was not that a proof that her liberty might be serviceable to Glaucus Yes she was evidently inveigled into some snare she was contributing to the destruction of her beloved Oh how she panted for release Fortunately for her sufferings all sense of pain became merged in the desire of escape and as she began to revolve the possibility of deliverance she grew calm and thoughtful She possessed much of the craft of her sex and it had been increased in her breast by her early servitude What slave was ever destitute of cunning She resolved to practise upon her keeper and calling suddenly to mind his superstitious query as to her Thessalian art she hoped by that handle to work out some method of release These doubts occupied her mind during the rest of the day and the long hours of night and accordingly when Sosia visited her the following morning she hastened to divert his garrulity into that channel in which it had before evinced a natural disposition to flow She was aware however that her only chance of escape was at night and accordingly she was obliged with a bitter pang at the delay to defer till then her purposed attempt The night said she is the sole time in which we can well decipher the decrees of Fate then it is thou must seek me But what desirest thou to learn By Pollux I should like to know as much as my master but that is not to be expected Let me know at least whether I shall save enough to purchase my freedom or whether this Egyptian will give it me for nothing He does such generous things sometimes Next supposing that be true shall I possess myself of that snug taberna among the Myropolia which I have long had in my eye Tis a genteel trade that of a perfumer and suits a retired slave who has something of a gentleman about him Ay so you would have precise answers to those questions there are various ways of satisfying you There is the Lithomanteia or Speaking stone which answers your prayer with an infant s voice but then we have not that precious stone with us costly is it and rare Then there is the Gastromanteia whereby the demon casts pale and deadly images upon the water prophetic of the future But this art requires also glasses of a peculiar fashion to contain the consecrated liquid which we have not I think therefore that the simplest method of satisfying your desire would be by the Magic of Air I trust said Sosia tremulously that there is nothing very frightful in the operation I have no love for apparitions Fear not thou wilt see nothing thou wilt only hear by the bubbling of water whether or not thy suit prospers First then be sure from the rising of the evening star that thou leavest the garden gate somewhat open so that the demon may feel himself invited to enter therein and place fruits and water near the gate as a sign of hospitality then three hours after twilight come here with a bowl of the coldest and purest water and thou shalt learn all according to the Thessalian lore my mother taught me But forget not the garden gate all rests upon that it must be open when you come and for three hours previously Trust me replied the unsuspecting Sosia I know what a gentleman s feelings are when a door is shut in his face as the cookshop s hath been in mine many a day and I know also that a person of respectability as a demon of course is cannot but be pleased on the other hand with any little mark of courteous hospitality Meanwhile pretty one here is thy morning s meal But what of the trial Oh the lawyers are still at it talk talk it will last over all to morrow To morrow You are sure of that So I hear And Ione By Bacchus she must be tolerably well for she was strong enough to make my master stamp and bite his lip this morning I saw him quit her apartment with a brow like a thunderstorm Lodges she near this No in the upper apartments But I must not stay prating here longer Vale Chapter XII A WASP VENTURES INTO THE SPIDER S WEB THE second night of the trial had set in and it was nearly the time in which Sosia was to brave the dread Unknown when there entered at that very garden gate which the slave had left ajar not indeed one of the mysterious spirits of earth or air 
3547-8365-0000	train-other-500	but the heavy and most human form of Calenus the priest of Isis He scarcely noted the humble offerings of indifferent fruit and still more indifferent wine which the pious Sosia had deemed good enough for the invisible stranger they were intended to allure
3547-8365-0001	train-other-500	Some tribute thought he to the garden god By my father s head if his deityship were never better served he would do well to give up the godly profession Ah were it not for us priests
3547-8365-0002	train-other-500	the gods would have a sad time of it And now for Arbaces I am treading a quicksand but it ought to cover a mine I have the Egyptian s life in my power what will he value it at As he thus soliloquised
none	none	 he crossed through the open court into the peristyle where a few lamps here and there broke upon the empire of the starlit night 
3547-8365-0003	train-other-500	and issuing from one of the chambers that bordered the colonnade suddenly encountered Arbaces
none	none	 Ho Calenus seekest thou me said the Egyptian and there was a little embarrassment in his voice Yes wise Arbaces I trust my visit is not unseasonable Nay it was but this instant that my freedman Callias sneezed thrice at my right hand I knew therefore some good fortune was in store for me and lo the gods have sent me Calenus Shall we within to your chamber Arbaces 
3547-8365-0004	train-other-500	As you will but the night is clear and balmy I have some remains of languor yet lingering on me from my recent illness the air refreshes me let us walk in the garden we are equally alone there
3547-8365-0005	train-other-500	With all my heart answered the priest and the two friends passed slowly to one of the many terraces which bordered by marble vases and sleeping flowers intersected the garden It is a lovely night said Arbaces
none	none	 blue and beautiful as that on which twenty years ago 
3547-8365-0006	train-other-500	the shores of Italy first broke upon my view My Calenus age creeps upon us let us at least feel that we have lived Thou at least mayst arrogate that boast said Calenus
3547-8365-0007	train-other-500	beating about as it were for an opportunity to communicate the secret which weighed upon him
none	none	 and feeling his usual awe of Arbaces still more impressively that night 
3547-8365-0008	train-other-500	from the quiet and friendly tone of dignified condescension which the Egyptian assumed
none	none	 Thou at least mayst arrogate that boast 
3547-8365-0009	train-other-500	Thou hast had countless wealth a frame on whose close woven fibres disease can find no space to enter prosperous love inexhaustible pleasure and even at this hour triumphant revenge Thou alludest to the Athenian
3547-8365-0010	train-other-500	Ay to morrow s sun the fiat of his death will go forth The senate does not relent But thou mistakest his death gives me no other gratification
none	none	 than that it releases me from a rival in the affections of Ione 
3547-8365-0011	train-other-500	I entertain no other sentiment of animosity against that unfortunate homicide Homicide repeated Calenus slowly and meaningly and halting as he spoke he fixed his eyes upon Arbaces
3547-8365-0012	train-other-500	The stars shone pale and steadily on the proud face of their prophet but they betrayed there no change the eyes of Calenus fell disappointed and abashed He continued rapidly
none	none	 Homicide 
3547-8365-0013	train-other-500	it is well to charge him with that crime but thou of all men knowest that he is innocent Explain thyself said Arbaces coldly for he had prepared himself for the hint his secret fears had foretold Arbaces
3547-8365-0014	train-other-500	answered Calenus sinking his voice into a whisper I was in the sacred grove sheltered by the chapel and the surrounding foliage I overheard I marked the whole
none	none	 I saw thy weapon pierce the heart of Apaecides 
3547-8365-0015	train-other-500	I blame not the deed it destroyed a foe and an apostate Thou sawest the whole said Arbaces dryly so I imagined thou wert alone Alone returned Calenus surprised at the Egyptian s calmness
3547-8365-0016	train-other-500	And wherefore wert thou hid behind the chapel at that hour
none	none	 Because I had learned the conversion of Apaecides to the Christian faith 
3547-8365-0017	train-other-500	because I knew that on that spot he was to meet the fierce Olinthus because they were to meet there to discuss plans for unveiling the sacred mysteries of our goddess to the people and I was there to detect in order to defeat them
3547-8365-0018	train-other-500	Hast thou told living ear what thou didst witness No my master the secret is locked in thy servant s breast What even thy kinsman Burbo guesses it not Come the truth By the gods
3547-8365-0019	train-other-500	Hush we know each other what are the gods to us By the fear of thy vengeance then no And why hast thou hitherto concealed from me this secret
none	none	 Why hast thou waited till the eve of the Athenian s 
3547-8365-0020	train-other-500	condemnation before thou hast ventured to tell me that Arbaces is a murderer And having tarried so long why revealest thou now that knowledge Because because stammered Calenus coloring and in confusion
3547-8365-0021	train-other-500	Because interrupted Arbaces with a gentle smile and tapping the priest on the shoulder with a kindly and familiar gesture
none	none	 because my Calenus see now I will read thy heart and explain its motives because thou didst wish thoroughly to commit and entangle me in the trial so that I might have no loophole of escape that I might stand firmly pledged to perjury 
3547-8365-0022	train-other-500	and to malice as well as to homicide that having myself whetted the appetite of the populace to blood no wealth no power could prevent my becoming their victim and thou tellest me thy secret now
3547-8365-0023	train-other-500	ere the trial be over and the innocent condemned to show what a desperate web of villainy thy word to morrow could destroy to enhance in this the ninth hour the price of thy forbearance to show that my own arts
3547-8365-0024	train-other-500	in arousing the popular wrath would at thy witness recoil upon myself and that if not for Glaucus for me would gape the jaws of the lion Is it not so Arbaces replied Calenus
3547-8365-0025	train-other-500	losing all the vulgar audacity of his natural character verily thou art a Magician thou readest the heart as it were a scroll It is my vocation answered the Egyptian laughing gently Well then forbear
none	none	 and when all is over I will make thee rich Pardon me said the priest as the quick suggestion of that avarice which was his master passion bade him trust no future chance of generosity pardon me thou saidst right 
3547-8365-0026	train-other-500	we know each other If thou wouldst have me silent thou must pay something in advance as an offer to Harpocrates If the rose sweet emblem of discretion is to take root firmly water her this night with a stream of gold
none	none	 Witty and poetical answered Arbaces still in that bland voice which lulled and encouraged when it ought to have alarmed and checked his griping comrade 
3547-8365-0027	train-other-500	Wilt thou not wait the morrow Why this delay
none	none	 Perhaps when I can no longer give my testimony without shame for not having given it ere 
3547-8365-0028	train-other-500	the innocent man suffered thou wilt forget my claim and indeed thy present hesitation is a bad omen of thy future gratitude Well then Calenus what wouldst thou have me pay thee
none	none	 Thy life is very precious and thy wealth is very great 
3547-8365-0029	train-other-500	returned the priest grinning Wittier and more witty But speak out what shall be the sum Arbaces I have heard that in thy secret treasury below beneath those rude Oscan arches which prop thy stately halls
3547-8365-0030	train-other-500	thou hast piles of gold of vases and of jewels which might rival the receptacles of the wealth of the deified Nero
none	none	 Thou mayst easily spare out of those piles enough to make Calenus among the richest priests of Pompeii and yet not miss the loss Come Calenus said Arbaces winningly and with a frank and generous air thou art an old friend and hast been a faithful servant Thou canst have no wish to take away my life 
3547-8365-0031	train-other-500	nor I a desire to stint thy reward thou shalt descend with me to that treasury thou referrest to thou shalt feast thine eyes with the blaze of uncounted gold and the sparkle of priceless gems and thou shalt for thy own reward
3547-8365-0032	train-other-500	bear away with thee this night as much as thou canst conceal beneath thy robes Nay when thou hast once seen what thy friend possesses
none	none	 thou wilt learn how foolish it would be to injure one who has so much to bestow 
3547-8365-0033	train-other-500	When Glaucus is no more thou shalt pay the treasury another visit Speak I frankly and as a friend
none	none	 Oh greatest best of men 
3547-8365-0034	train-other-500	cried Calenus almost weeping with joy canst thou thus forgive my injurious doubts of thy justice thy generosity Hush
none	none	 one other turn and we will descend to the Oscan arches Chapter XIII THE SLAVE CONSULTS THE ORACLE THEY WHO BLIND THEMSELVES THE BLIND MAY FOOL TWO NEW PRISONERS MADE IN ONE NIGHT IMPATIENTLY Nydia awaited the arrival of the no less anxious Sosia Fortifying his courage by plentiful potations of a better liquor than that provided for the demon the credulous ministrant stole into the blind girl s chamber Well Sosia and art thou prepared Hast thou the bowl of pure water Verily yes but I tremble a little You are sure I shall not see the demon I have heard that those gentlemen are by no means of a handsome person or a civil demeanor Be assured And hast thou left the garden gate gently open Yes and placed some beautiful nuts and apples on a little table close by That s well And the gate is open now so that the demon may pass through it Surely it is Well then open this door there leave it just ajar And now Sosia give me the lamp What you will not extinguish it No but I must breathe my spell over its ray There is a spirit in fire Seat thyself The slave obeyed and Nydia after bending for some moments silently over the lamp rose and in a low voice chanted the following rude INVOCATION TO THE SPECTRE OF THE AIR Loved alike by Air and Water Aye must be Thessalia s daughter To us Olympian hearts are given Spells that draw the moon from heaven All that Egypt s learning wrought All that Persia s Magian taught Won from song or wrung from flowers Or whisper d low by fiend are ours Spectre of the viewless air Hear the blind Thessalian s prayer By Erictho s art that shed Dews of life when life was fled By lone Ithaca s wise king Who could wake the crystal spring To the voice of prophecy By the lost Eurydice Summon d from the shadowy throng As the muse son s magic song By the Colchian s awful charms When fair haired Jason left her arms Spectre of the airy halls One who owns thee duly calls Breathe along the brimming bowl And instruct the fearful soul In the shadowy things that lie Dark in dim futurity Come wild demon of the air Answer to thy votary s prayer Come oh come And no god on heaven or earth Not the Paphian Queen of Mirth Not the vivid Lord of Light Nor the triple Maid of Night Nor the Thunderer s self shall be Blest and honour d more than thee Come oh come The spectre is certainly coming said Sosia I feel him running along my hair Place thy bowl of water on the ground Now then give me thy napkin and let me fold up thy face and eyes Ay that s always the custom with these charms Not so tight though gently gently There thou canst not see See by Jupiter No nothing but darkness Address then to the spectre whatever question thou wouldst ask him in a low whispered voice three times If thy question is answered in the affirmative thou wilt hear the water ferment and bubble before the demon breathes upon it if in the negative the water will be quite silent But you will not play any trick with the water eh Let me place the bowl under thy feet so Now thou wilt perceive that I cannot touch it without thy knowledge Very fair Now then O Bacchus befriend me Thou knowest that I have always loved thee better than all the other gods and I will dedicate to thee that silver cup I stole last year from the burly carptor butler if thou wilt but befriend me with this water loving demon And thou O Spirit listen and hear me Shall I be enabled to purchase my freedom next year Thou knowest for as thou livest in the air the birds have doubtless acquainted thee with every secret of this house thou knowest that I have filched and pilfered all that I honestly that is safely could lay finger upon for the last three years and I yet want two thousand sesterces of the full sum Shall I be able O good Spirit to make up the deficiency in the course of this year Speak Ha does the water bubble No all is as still as a tomb Well then if not this year in two years Ah I hear something the demon is scratching at the door he ll be here presently In two years my good fellow come now two that s a very reasonable time What dumb still Two years and a half three four ill fortune to you friend demon You are not a lady that s clear or you would not keep silence so long Five six sixty years and may Pluto seize you I ll ask no more And Sosia in a rage kicked down the water over his legs He then after much fumbling and more cursing managed to extricate his head from the napkin in which it was completely folded stared round and discovered that he was in the dark What ho Nydia the lamp is gone Ah traitress and thou art gone too but I ll catch thee thou shalt smart for this The slave groped his way to the door it was bolted from without he was a prisoner instead of Nydia What could he do He did not dare to knock loud to call out lest Arbaces should overhear him and discover how he had been duped and Nydia meanwhile had probably already gained the garden gate and was fast on her escape But thought he she will go home or at least be somewhere in the city To morrow at dawn when the slaves are at work in the peristyle I can make myself heard then I can go forth and seek her I shall be sure to find and bring her back before Arbaces knows a word of the matter Ah that s the best plan Little traitress my fingers itch at thee and to leave only a bowl of water too Had it been wine it would have been some comfort While Sosia thus entrapped was lamenting his fate and revolving his schemes to repossess himself of Nydia the blind girl with that singular precision and dexterous rapidity of motion which we have before observed was peculiar to her had passed lightly along the peristyle threaded the opposite passage that led into the garden and with a beating heart was about to proceed towards the gate when she suddenly heard the sound of approaching steps and distinguished the dreaded voice of Arbaces himself She paused for a moment in doubt and terror then suddenly it flashed across her recollection that there was another passage which was little used except for the admission of the fair partakers of the Egyptian s secret revels and which wound along the basement of that massive fabric towards a door which also communicated with the garden By good fortune it might be open At that thought she hastily retraced her steps descended the narrow stairs at the right and was soon at the entrance of the passage Alas the door at the entrance was closed and secured While she was yet assuring herself that it was indeed locked she heard behind her the voice of Calenus and a moment after that of Arbaces in low reply She could not stay there they were probably passing to that very door She sprang onward and felt herself in unknown ground The air grew damp and chill this reassured her She thought she might be among the cellars of the luxurious mansion or at least in some rude spot not likely to be visited by its haughty lord when again her quick ear caught steps and the sound of voices On on she hurried extending her arms which now frequently encountered pillars of thick and massive form With a tact doubled in acuteness by her fear she escaped these perils and continued her way the air growing more and more damp as she proceeded yet still as she ever and anon paused for breath she heard the advancing steps and the indistinct murmur of voices At length she was abruptly stopped by a wall that seemed the limit of her path Was there no spot in which she could hide No aperture no cavity There was none She stopped and wrung her hands in despair then again nerved as the voices neared upon her she hurried on by the side of the wall and coming suddenly against one of the sharp buttresses that here and there jutted boldly forth she fell to the ground Though much bruised her senses did not leave her she uttered no cry nay she hailed the accident that had led her to something like a screen and creeping close up to the angle formed by the buttress so that on one side at least she was sheltered from view she gathered her slight and small form into its smallest compass and breathlessly awaited her fate Meanwhile Arbaces and the priest were taking their way to that secret chamber whose stores were so vaunted by the Egyptian They were in a vast subterranean atrium or hall the low roof was supported by short thick pillars of an architecture far remote from the Grecian graces of that luxuriant period The single and pale lamp which Arbaces bore shed but an imperfect ray over the bare and rugged walls in which the huge stones without cement were fitted curiously and uncouthly into each other The disturbed reptiles glared dully on the intruders and then crept into the shadow of the walls Calenus shivered as he looked around and breathed the damp unwholesome air Yet said Arbaces with a smile perceiving his shudder it is these rude abodes that furnish the luxuries of the halls above They are like the laborers of the world we despise their ruggedness yet they feed the very pride that disdains them And whither goes yon dim gallery to the left asked Calenus in this depth of gloom it seems without limit as if winding into Hades On the contrary it does but conduct to the upper rooms answered Arbaces carelessly it is to the right that we steer to our bourn The hall like many in the more habitable regions of Pompeii branched off at the extremity into two wings or passages the length of which not really great was to the eye considerably exaggerated by the sudden gloom against which the lamp so faintly struggled To the right of these alae the two comrades now directed their steps The gay Glaucus will be lodged to morrow in apartments not much drier and far less spacious than this said Calenus as they passed by the very spot where completely wrapped in the shadow of the broad projecting buttress cowered the Thessalian Ay but then he will have dry room and ample enough in the arena on the following day And to think continued Arbaces slowly and very deliberately to think that a word of thine could save him and consign Arbaces to his doom That word shall never be spoken said Calenus Right my Calenus it never shall returned Arbaces familiarly leaning his arm on the priest s shoulder and now halt we are at the door The light trembled against a small door deep set in the wall and guarded strongly by many plates and bindings of iron that intersected the rough and dark wood From his girdle Arbaces now drew a small ring holding three or four short but strong keys Oh how beat the griping heart of Calenus as he heard the rusty wards growl as if resenting the admission to the treasures they guarded Enter my friend said Arbaces while I hold the lamp on high that thou mayst glut thine eyes on the yellow heaps The impatient Calenus did not wait to be twice invited he hastened towards the aperture Scarce had he crossed the threshold when the strong hand of Arbaces plunged him forwards The word shall never be spoken said the Egyptian with a loud exultant laugh and closed the door upon the priest Calenus had been precipitated down several steps but not feeling at the moment the pain of his fall he sprung up again to the door and beating at it fiercely with his clenched fist he cried aloud in what seemed more a beast s howl than a human voice so keen was his agony and despair Oh release me release me and I will ask no gold The words but imperfectly penetrated the massive door and Arbaces again laughed Then stamping his foot violently rejoined perhaps to give vent to his long stifled passions All the gold of Dalmatia cried he will not buy thee a crust of bread Starve wretch thy dying groans will never wake even the echo of these vast halls nor will the air ever reveal as thou gnawest in thy desperate famine thy flesh from thy bones that so perishes the man who threatened and could have undone Arbaces Farewell Oh pity mercy Inhuman villain was it for this The rest of the sentence was lost to the ear of Arbaces as he passed backward along the dim hall A toad plump and bloated lay unmoving before his path the rays of the lamp fell upon its unshaped hideousness and red upward eye Arbaces turned aside that he might not harm it Thou art loathsome and obscene he muttered but thou canst not injure me therefore thou art safe in my path The cries of Calenus dulled and choked by the barrier that confined him yet faintly reached the ear of the Egyptian He paused and listened intently This is unfortunate thought he for I cannot sail till that voice is dumb for ever My stores and treasures lie not in yon dungeon it is true but in the opposite wing My slaves as they move them must not hear his voice But what fear of that In three days if he still survive his accents by my father s beard must be weak enough then no they could not pierce even through his tomb By Isis it is cold I long for a deep draught of the spiced Falernian With that the remorseless Egyptian drew his gown closer round him and resought the upper air Chapter XIV NYDIA ACCOSTS CALENUS WHAT words of terror yet of hope had Nydia overheard The next day Glaucus was to be condemned yet there lived one who could save him and adjudge Arbaces to his doom and that one breathed within a few steps of her hiding place She caught his cries and shrieks his imprecations his prayers though they fell choked and muffled on her ear He was imprisoned but she knew the secret of his cell could she but escape could she but seek the praetor he might yet in time be given to light and preserve the Athenian Her emotions almost stifled her her brain reeled she felt her sense give way but by a violent effort she mastered herself and after listening intently for several minutes till she was convinced that Arbaces had left the space to solitude and herself she crept on as her ear guided her to the very door that had closed upon Calenus Here she more distinctly caught his accents of terror and despair Thrice she attempted to speak and thrice her voice failed to penetrate the folds of the heavy door At length finding the lock she applied her lips to its small aperture and the prisoner distinctly heard a soft tone breathe his name His blood curdled his hair stood on end That awful solitude what mysterious and preternatural being could penetrate Who s there he cried in new alarm what spectre what dread larva calls upon the lost Calenus Priest replied the Thessalian unknown to Arbaces I have been by the permission of the gods a witness to his perfidy If I myself can escape from these walls I may save thee But let thy voice reach my ear through this narrow passage and answer what I ask Ah blessed spirit said the priest exultingly and obeying the suggestion of Nydia save me and I will sell the very cups on the altar to pay thy kindness I want not thy gold I want thy secret Did I hear aright Canst thou save the Athenian Glaucus from the charge against his life I can I can therefore may the Furies blast the foul Egyptian hath Arbaces snared me thus and left me to starve and rot They accuse the Athenian of murder canst thou disprove the accusation Only free me and the proudest head of Pompeii is not more safe than his I saw the deed done I saw Arbaces strike the blow I can convict the true murderer and acquit the innocent man But if I perish he dies also Dost thou interest thyself for him Oh blessed stranger in my heart is the urn which condemns or frees him And thou wilt give full evidence of what thou knowest Will Oh were hell at my feet yes Revenge on the false Egyptian revenge revenge revenge As through his ground teeth Calenus shrieked forth those last words Nydia felt that in his worst passions was her certainty of his justice to the Athenian Her heart beat was it to be her proud destiny to preserve her idolized her adored Enough said she the powers that conducted me hither will carry me through all Yes I feel that I shall deliver thee Wait in patience and hope But be cautious be prudent sweet stranger Attempt not to appeal to Arbaces he is marble Seek the praetor say what thou knowest obtain his writ of search bring soldiers and smiths of cunning these locks are wondrous strong Time flies I may starve starve if you are not quick Go go Yet stay it is horrible to be alone the air is like a charnel and the scorpions ha and the pale larvae oh stay stay Nay said Nydia terrified by the terror of the priest and anxious to confer with herself nay for thy sake I must depart Take hope for thy companion farewell So saying she glided away and felt with extended arms along the pillared space until she had gained the farther end of the hall and the mouth of the passage that led to the upper air But there she paused she felt that it would be more safe to wait awhile until the night was so far blended with the morning that the whole house would be buried in sleep and so that she might quit it unobserved She therefore once more laid herself down and counted the weary moments In her sanguine heart joy was the predominant emotion Glaucus was in deadly peril but she should save him Chapter XV ARBACES AND IONE NYDIA GAINS THE GARDEN WILL SHE ESCAPE AND SAVE THE ATHENIAN WHEN Arbaces had warmed his veins by large draughts of that spiced and perfumed wine so valued by the luxurious he felt more than usually elated and exultant of heart There is a pride in triumphant ingenuity not less felt perhaps though its object be guilty Our vain human nature hugs itself in the consciousness of superior craft and self obtained success afterwards comes the horrible reaction of remorse But remorse was not a feeling which Arbaces was likely ever to experience for the fate of the base Calenus He swept from his remembrance the thought of the priest s agonies and lingering death he felt only that a great danger was passed and a possible foe silenced all left to him now would be to account to the priesthood for the disappearance of Calenus and this he imagined it would not be difficult to do Calenus had often been employed by him in various religious missions to the neighboring cities On some such errand he could now assert that he had been sent with offerings to the shrines of Isis at Herculaneum and Neapolis placatory of the goddess for the recent murder of her priest Apaecides When Calenus had expired his body might be thrown previous to the Egyptian s departure from Pompeii into the deep stream of the Sarnus and when discovered suspicion would probably fall upon the Nazarene atheists as an act of revenge for the death of Olinthus at the arena After rapidly running over these plans for screening himself Arbaces dismissed at once from his mind all recollection of the wretched priest and animated by the success which had lately crowned all his schemes he surrendered his thoughts to Ione The last time he had seen her she had driven him from her presence by a reproachful and bitter scorn which his arrogant nature was unable to endure He now felt emboldened once more to renew that interview for his passion for her was like similar feelings in other men it made him restless for her presence even though in that presence he was exasperated and humbled From delicacy to her grief he laid not aside his dark and unfestive robes but renewing the perfumes on his raven locks and arranging his tunic in its most becoming folds he sought the chamber of the Neapolitan Accosting the slave in attendance without he inquired if Ione had yet retired to rest and learning that she was still up and unusually quiet and composed he ventured into her presence He found his beautiful ward sitting before a small table and leaning her face upon both her hands in the attitude of thought Yet the expression of the face itself possessed not its wonted bright and Psyche like expression of sweet intelligence the lips were apart the eye vacant and unheeding and the long dark hair falling neglected and disheveled upon her neck gave by the contrast additional paleness to a cheek which had already lost the roundness of its contour Arbaces gazed upon her a moment ere he advanced She too lifted up her eyes and when she saw who was the intruder shut them with an expression of pain but did not stir Ah said Arbaces in a low and earnest tone as he respectfully nay humbly advanced and seated himself at a little distance from the table Ah that my death could remove thy hatred then would I gladly die Thou wrongest me Ione but I will bear the wrong without a murmur only let me see thee sometimes Chide reproach scorn me if thou wilt I will teach myself to bear it And is not even thy bitterest tone sweeter to me than the music of the most artful lute In thy silence the world seems to stand still a stagnation curdles up the veins of the earth there is no earth no life without the light of thy countenance and the melody of thy voice Give me back my brother and my betrothed said Ione in a calm and imploring tone and a few large tears rolled unheeded down her cheeks Would that I could restore the one and save the other returned Arbaces with apparent emotion Yes to make thee happy I would renounce my ill fated love and gladly join thy hand to the Athenian s Perhaps he will yet come unscathed from his trial Arbaces had prevented her learning that the trial had already commenced if so thou art free to judge or condemn him thyself And think not O Ione that I would follow thee longer with a prayer of love I know it is in vain Suffer me only to weep to mourn with thee Forgive a violence deeply repented and that shall offend no more Let me be to thee only what I once was a friend a father a Protector Ah Ione spare me and forgive I forgive thee Save but Glaucus and I will renounce him O mighty Arbaces thou art powerful in evil or in good save the Athenian and the poor Ione will never see him more As she spoke she rose with weak and trembling limbs and falling at his feet she clasped his knees Oh if thou really lovest me if thou art human remember my father s ashes remember my childhood think of all the hours we passed happily together and save my Glaucus Strange convulsions shook the frame of the Egyptian his features worked fearfully he turned his face aside and said in a hollow voice If I could save him even now I would but the Roman law is stern and sharp Yet if I could succeed if I could rescue and set him free wouldst thou be mine my bride Thine repeated Ione rising thine thy bride My brother s blood is unavenged who slew him O Nemesis can I even sell for the life of Glaucus thy solemn trust Arbaces thine Never Ione Ione cried Arbaces passionately why these mysterious words why dost thou couple my name with the thought of thy brother s death My dreams couple it and dreams are from the gods Vain fantasies all Is it for a dream that thou wouldst wrong the innocent and hazard thy sole chance of saving thy lover s life Hear me said Ione speaking firmly and with a deliberate and solemn voice If Glaucus be saved by thee I will never be borne to his home a bride But I cannot master the horror of other rites I cannot wed with thee Interrupt me not but mark me Arbaces if Glaucus die on that same day I baffle thine arts and leave to thy love only my dust Yes thou mayst put the knife and the poison from my reach thou mayst imprison thou mayst chain me but the brave soul resolved to escape is never without means These hands naked and unarmed though they be shall tear away the bonds of life Fetter them and these lips shall firmly refuse the air Thou art learned thou hast read how women have died rather than meet dishonour If Glaucus perish I will not unworthily linger behind him By all the gods of the heaven and the ocean and the earth I devote myself to death I have said High proud dilating in her stature like one inspired the air and voice of Ione struck an awe into the breast of her listener Brave heart said he after a short pause thou art indeed worthy to be mine Oh that I should have dreamt of such a partner in my lofty destinies and never found it but in thee Ione he continued rapidly dost thou not see that we are born for each other Canst thou not recognize something kindred to thine own energy thine own courage in this high and self dependent soul We were formed to unite our sympathies formed to breathe a new spirit into this hackneyed and gross world formed for the mighty ends which my soul sweeping down the gloom of time foresees with a prophet s vision With a resolution equal to thine own I defy thy threats of an inglorious suicide I hail thee as my own Queen of climes undarkened by the eagle s wing unravaged by his beak I bow before thee in homage and in awe but I claim thee in worship and in love Together will we cross the ocean together will we found our realm and far distant ages shall acknowledge the long race of kings born from the marriage bed of Arbaces and Ione Thou ravest These mystic declamations are suited rather to some palsied crone selling charms in the market place than to the wise Arbaces Thou hast heard my resolution it is fixed as the Fates themselves Orcus has heard my vow and it is written in the book of the unforgetful Hades Atone then O Arbaces atone the past convert hatred into regard vengeance into gratitude preserve one who shall never be thy rival These are acts suited to thy original nature which gives forth sparks of something high and noble They weigh in the scales of the Kings of Death they turn the balance on that day when the disembodied soul stands shivering and dismayed between Tartarus and Elysium they gladden the heart in life better and longer than the reward of a momentary passion Oh Arbaces hear me and be swayed Enough Ione All that I can do for Glaucus shall be done but blame me not if I fail Inquire of my foes even if I have not sought if I do not seek to turn aside the sentence from his head and judge me accordingly Sleep then Ione Night wanes I leave thee to rest and mayst thou have kinder dreams of one who has no existence but in thine Without waiting a reply Arbaces hastily withdrew afraid perhaps to trust himself further to the passionate prayer of Ione which racked him with jealousy even while it touched him to compassion But compassion itself came too late Had Ione even pledged him her hand as his reward he could not now his evidence given the populace excited have saved the Athenian Still made sanguine by his very energy of mind he threw himself on the chances of the future and believed he should yet triumph over the woman that had so entangled his passions As his attendants assisted to unrobe him for the night the thought of Nydia flashed across him He felt it was necessary that Ione should never learn of her lover s frenzy lest it might excuse his imputed crime and it was possible that her attendants might inform her that Nydia was under his roof and she might desire to see her As this idea crossed him he turned to one of his freedmen Go Callias said he forthwith to Sosia and tell him that on no pretence is he to suffer the blind slave Nydia out of her chamber But stay first seek those in attendance upon my ward and caution them not to inform her that the blind girl is under my roof Go quick The freedman hastened to obey After having discharged his commission with respect to Ione s attendants he sought the worthy Sosia He found him not in the little cell which was apportioned for his cubiculum he called his name aloud and from Nydia s chamber close at hand he heard the voice of Sosia reply Oh Callias is it you that I hear the gods be praised Open the door I pray you Callias withdrew the bolt and the rueful face of Sosia hastily protruded itself What in the chamber with that young girl Sosia Proh pudor Are there not fruits ripe enough on the wall but that thou must tamper with such green Name not the little witch interrupted Sosia impatiently she will be my ruin And he forthwith imparted to Callias the history of the Air Demon and the escape of the Thessalian Hang thyself then unhappy Sosia I am just charged from Arbaces with a message to thee on no account art thou to suffer her even for a moment from that chamber Me miserum exclaimed the slave What can I do by this time she may have visited half Pompeii But tomorrow I will undertake to catch her in her old haunts Keep but my counsel my dear Callias I will do all that friendship can consistent with my own safety But are you sure she has left the house she may be hiding here yet How is that possible She could easily have gained the garden and the door as I told thee was open Nay not so for at that very hour thou specifiest Arbaces was in the garden with the priest Calenus I went there in search of some herbs for my master s bath to morrow I saw the table set out but the gate I am sure was shut depend upon it that Calenus entered by the garden and naturally closed the door after him But it was not locked Yes for I myself angry at a negligence which might expose the bronzes in the peristyle to the mercy of any robber turned the key took it away and as I did not see the proper slave to whom to give it or I should have rated him finely here it actually is still in my girdle Oh merciful Bacchus I did not pray to thee in vain after all Let us not lose a moment Let us to the garden instantly she may yet be there The good natured Callias consented to assist the slave and after vainly searching the chambers at hand and the recesses of the peristyle they entered the garden It was about this time that Nydia had resolved to quit her hiding place and venture forth on her way Lightly tremulously holding her breath which ever and anon broke forth in quick convulsive gasps now gliding by the flower wreathed columns that bordered the peristyle now darkening the still moonshine that fell over its tessellated centre now ascending the terrace of the garden now gliding amidst the gloomy and breathless trees she gained the fatal door to find it locked We have all seen that expression of pain of uncertainty of fear which a sudden disappointment of touch if I may use the expression casts over the face of the blind But what words can paint the intolerable woe the sinking of the whole heart which was now visible on the features of the Thessalian Again and again her small quivering hands wandered to and fro the inexorable door Poor thing that thou wert in vain had been all thy noble courage thy innocent craft thy doublings to escape the hound and huntsmen Within but a few yards from thee laughing at thy endeavors thy despair knowing thou wert now their own and watching with cruel patience their own moment to seize their prey thou art saved from seeing thy pursuers Hush Callias let her go on Let us see what she will do when she has convinced herself that the door is honest Look she raises her face to the heavens she mutters she sinks down despondent No by Pollux she has some new scheme She will not resign herself By Jupiter a tough spirit See she springs up she retraces her steps she thinks of some other chance I advise thee Sosia to delay no longer seize her ere she quit the garden now Ah runaway I have thee eh said Sosia seizing upon the unhappy Nydia As a hare s last human cry in the fangs of the dogs as the sharp voice of terror uttered by a sleep walker suddenly awakened broke the shriek of the blind girl when she felt the abrupt gripe of her gaoler It was a shriek of such utter agony such entire despair that it might have rung hauntingly in your ears for ever She felt as if the last plank of the sinking Glaucus were torn from his clasp It had been a suspense of life and death and death had now won the game Gods that cry will alarm the house Arbaces sleeps full lightly Gag her cried Callias Ah here is the very napkin with which the young witch conjured away my reason Come that s right now thou art dumb as well as blind And catching the light weight in his arms Sosia soon gained the house and reached the chamber from which Nydia had escaped There removing the gag he left her to a solitude so racked and terrible that out of Hades its anguish could scarcely be exceeded Chapter XVI THE SORROW OF BOON COMPANIONS FOR OUR AFFLICTIONS THE DUNGEON AND ITS VICTIMS IT was now late on the third and last day of the trial of Glaucus and Olinthus A few hours after the court had broken up and judgment been given a small party of the fashionable youth at Pompeii were assembled round the fastidious board of Lepidus So Glaucus denies his crime to the last said Clodius Yes but the testimony of Arbaces was convincing he saw the blow given answered Lepidus What could have been the cause Why the priest was a gloomy and sullen fellow He probably rated Glaucus soundly about his gay life and gaming habits and ultimately swore he would not consent to his marriage with Ione High words arose Glaucus seems to have been full of the passionate god and struck in sudden exasperation The excitement of wine the desperation of abrupt remorse brought on the delirium under which he suffered for some days and I can readily imagine poor fellow that yet confused by that delirium he is even now unconscious of the crime he committed Such at least is the shrewd conjecture of Arbaces who seems to have been most kind and forbearing in his testimony Yes he has made himself generally popular by it But in consideration of these extenuating circumstances the senate should have relaxed the sentence And they would have done so but for the people but they were outrageous The priest had spared no pains to excite them and they imagined the ferocious brutes because Glaucus was a rich man and a gentleman that he was likely to escape and therefore they were inveterate against him and doubly resolved upon his sentence It seems by some accident or other that he was never formally enrolled as a Roman citizen and thus the senate is deprived of the power to resist the people though after all there was but a majority of three against him Ho the Chian He looks sadly altered but how composed and fearless Ay we shall see if his firmness will last over to morrow But what merit in courage when that atheistical hound Olinthus manifested the same The blasphemer Yes said Lepidus with pious wrath no wonder that one of the decurions was but two days ago struck dead by lightning in a serene sky The gods feel vengeance against Pompeii while the vile desecrator is alive within its walls Yet so lenient was the senate that had he but expressed his penitence and scattered a few grains of incense on the altar of Cybele he would have been let off I doubt whether these Nazarenes had they the state religion would be as tolerant to us supposing we had kicked down the image of their Deity blasphemed their rites and denied their faith They give Glaucus one chance in consideration of the circumstances they allow him against the lion the use of the same stilus wherewith he smote the priest Hast thou seen the lion hast thou looked at his teeth and fangs and wilt thou call that a chance Why sword and buckler would be mere reed and papyrus against the rush of the mighty beast No I think the true mercy has been not to leave him long in suspense and it was therefore fortunate for him that our benign laws are slow to pronounce but swift to execute and that the games of the amphitheatre had been by a sort of providence so long since fixed for to morrow He who awaits death dies twice As for the Atheist said Clodius he is to cope the grim tiger naked handed Well these combats are past betting on Who will take the odds A peal of laughter announced the ridicule of the question Poor Clodius said the host I to lose a friend is something but to find no one to bet on the chance of his escape is a worse misfortune to thee Why it is provoking it would have been some consolation to him and to me to think he was useful to the last The people said the grave Pansa are all delighted with the result They were so much afraid the sports at the amphitheatre would go off without a criminal for the beasts and now to get two such criminals is indeed a joy for the poor fellows They work hard they ought to have some amusement There speaks the popular Pansa who never moves without a string of clients as long as an Indian triumph He is always prating about the people Gods he will end by being a Gracchus Certainly I am no insolent patrician said Pansa with a generous air Well observed Lepidus it would have been assuredly dangerous to have been merciful at the eve of a beast fight If ever I though a Roman bred and born come to be tried pray Jupiter there may be either no beasts in the vivaria or plenty of criminals in the gaol And pray said one of the party what has become of the poor girl whom Glaucus was to have married A widow without being a bride that is hard Oh returned Clodius she is safe under the protection of her guardian Arbaces It was natural she should go to him when she had lost both lover and brother By sweet Venus Glaucus was fortunate among the women They say the rich Julia was in love with him A mere fable my friend said Clodius coxcombically I was with her to day If any feeling of the sort she ever conceived I flatter myself that I have consoled her Hush gentlemen said Pansa do you not know that Clodius is employed at the house of Diomed in blowing hard at the torch It begins to burn and will soon shine bright on the shrine of Hymen Is it so said Lepidus What Clodius become a married man Fie Never fear answered Clodius old Diomed is delighted at the notion of marrying his daughter to a nobleman and will come down largely with the sesterces You will see that I shall not lock them up in the atrium It will be a white day for his jolly friends when Clodius marries an heiress Say you so cried Lepidus come then a full cup to the health of the fair Julia While such was the conversation one not discordant to the tone of mind common among the dissipated of that day and which might perhaps a century ago have found an echo in the looser circles of Paris while such I say was the conversation in the gaudy triclinium of Lepidus far different the scene which scowled before the young Athenian After his condemnation Glaucus was admitted no more to the gentle guardianship of Sallust the only friend of his distress He was led along the forum till the guards stopped at a small door by the side of the temple of Jupiter You may see the place still The door opened in the centre in a somewhat singular fashion revolving round on its hinges as it were like a modern turnstile so as only to leave half the threshold open at the same time Through this narrow aperture they thrust the prisoner placed before him a loaf and a pitcher of water and left him to darkness and as he thought to solitude So sudden had been that revolution of fortune which had prostrated him from the palmy height of youthful pleasure and successful love to the lowest abyss of ignominy and the horror of a most bloody death that he could scarcely convince himself that he was not held in the meshes of some fearful dream His elastic and glorious frame had triumphed over a potion the greater part of which he had fortunately not drained He had recovered sense and consciousness but still a dim and misty depression clung to his nerves and darkened his mind His natural courage and the Greek nobility of pride enabled him to vanquish all unbecoming apprehension and in the judgment court to face his awful lot with a steady mien and unquailing eye But the consciousness of innocence scarcely sufficed to support him when the gaze of men no longer excited his haughty valor and he was left to loneliness and silence He felt the damps of the dungeon sink chillingly into his enfeebled frame He the fastidious the luxurious the refined he who had hitherto braved no hardship and known no sorrow Beautiful bird that he was why had he left his far and sunny clime the olive groves of his native hills the music of immemorial streams Why had he wantoned on his glittering plumage amidst these harsh and ungenial strangers dazzling the eyes with his gorgeous hues charming the ear with his blithesome song thus suddenly to be arrested caged in darkness a victim and a prey his gay flights for ever over his hymns of gladness for ever stilled The poor Athenian his very faults the exuberance of a gentle and joyous nature how little had his past career fitted him for the trials he was destined to undergo The hoots of the mob amidst whose plaudits he had so often guided his graceful car and bounding steeds still rang gratingly in his ear The cold and stony faces of former friends the company mates of merry revels still rose before his eye None now were by to soothe to sustain the admired the adulated stranger These walls opened but on the dread arena of a violent and shameful death And Ione of her too he had heard naught no encouraging word no pitying message she too had forsaken him she believed him guilty and of what crime the murder of a brother He ground his teeth he groaned aloud and ever and anon a sharp fear shot across him In that fell and fierce delirium which had so unaccountably seized his soul which had so ravaged the disordered brain might he not indeed unknowing to himself have committed the crime of which he was accused Yet as the thought flashed upon him it was as suddenly checked for amidst all the darkness of the past he thought distinctly to recall the dim grove of Cybele the upward face of the pale dead the pause that he had made beside the corpse and the sudden shock that felled him to the earth He felt convinced of his innocence and yet who to the latest time long after his mangled remains were mingled with the elements would believe him guiltless or uphold his fame As he recalled his interview with Arbaces and the causes of revenge which had been excited in the heart of that dark and fearful man he could not but believe that he was the victim of some deep laid and mysterious snare the clue and train of which he was lost in attempting to discover and Ione Arbaces loved her might his rival s success be founded upon his ruin That thought cut him more deeply than all and his noble heart was more stung by jealousy than appalled by fear Again he groaned aloud A voice from the recess of the darkness answered that burst of anguish Who it said is my companion in this awful hour Athenian Glaucus it is thou So indeed they called me in mine hour of fortune they may have other names for me now And thy name stranger Is Olinthus thy company mate in the prison as the trial What he whom they call the Atheist Is it the injustice of men that hath taught thee to deny the providence of the gods Alas answered Olinthus thou not I art the true Atheist for thou deniest the sole true God the Unknown One to whom thy Athenian fathers erected an altar It is in this hour that I know my God He is with me in the dungeon His smile penetrates the darkness on the eve of death my heart whispers immortality and earth recedes from me but to bring the weary soul nearer unto heaven Tell me said Glaucus abruptly did I not hear thy name coupled with that of Apaecides in my trial Dost thou believe me guilty God alone reads the heart but my suspicion rested not upon thee On whom then Thy accuser Arbaces Ha thou cheerest me and wherefore Because I know the man s evil breast and he had cause to fear him who is now dead With that Olinthus proceeded to inform Glaucus of those details which the reader already knows the conversion of Apaecides the plan they had proposed for the detection of the impostures of the Egyptian upon the youthful weakness of the proselyte Therefore concluded Olinthus had the deceased encountered Arbaces reviled his treasons and threatened detection the place the hour might have favored the wrath of the Egyptian and passion and craft alike dictated the fatal blow It must have been so cried Glaucus joyfully I am happy Yet what O unfortunate avails to thee now the discovery Thou art condemned and fated and in thine innocence thou wilt perish But I shall know myself guiltless and in my mysterious madness I had fearful though momentary doubts Yet tell me man of a strange creed thinkest thou that for small errors or for ancestral faults we are for ever abandoned and accursed by the powers above whatever name thou allottest to them God is just and abandons not His creatures for their mere human frailty God is merciful and curses none but the wicked who repent not Yet it seemeth to me as if in the divine anger I had been smitten by a sudden madness a supernatural and solemn frenzy wrought not by human means There are demons on earth answered the Nazarene fearfully as well as there are God and His Son in heaven and since thou acknowledgest not the last the first may have had power over thee Glaucus did not reply and there was a silence for some minutes At length the Athenian said in a changed and soft and half hesitating voice Christian believest thou among the doctrines of thy creed that the dead live again that they who have loved here are united hereafter that beyond the grave our good name shines pure from the mortal mists that unjustly dim it in the gross eyed world and that the streams which are divided by the desert and the rock meet in the solemn Hades and flow once more into one Believe I that O Athenian No I do not believe I know and it is that beautiful and blessed assurance which supports me now O Cyllene continued Olinthus passionately bride of my heart torn from me in the first month of our nuptials shall I not see thee yet and ere many days be past Welcome welcome death that will bring me to heaven and thee There was something in this sudden burst of human affection which struck a kindred chord in the soul of the Greek He felt for the first time a sympathy greater than mere affliction between him and his companion He crept nearer towards Olinthus for the Italians fierce in some points were not unnecessarily cruel in others they spared the separate cell and the superfluous chain and allowed the victims of the arena the sad comfort of such freedom and such companionship as the prison would afford Yes continued the Christian with holy fervor the immortality of the soul the resurrection the reunion of the dead is the great principle of our creed the great truth a God suffered death itself to attest and proclaim No fabled Elysium no poetic Orcus but a pure and radiant heritage of heaven itself is the portion of the good Tell me then thy doctrines and expound to me thy hopes said Glaucus earnestly Olinthus was not slow to obey that prayer and there as oftentimes in the early ages of the Christian creed it was in the darkness of the dungeon and over the approach of death that the dawning Gospel shed its soft and consecrating rays Chapter XVII A CHANCE FOR GLAUCUS THE hours passed in lingering torture over the head of Nydia from the time in which she had been replaced in her cell Sosia as if afraid he should be again outwitted had refrained from visiting her until late in the morning of the following day and then he but thrust in the periodical basket of food and wine and hastily reclosed the door That day rolled on and Nydia felt herself pent barred inexorably confined when that day was the judgment day of Glaucus and when her release would have saved him Yet knowing almost impossible as seemed her escape that the sole chance for the life of Glaucus rested on her this young girl frail passionate and acutely susceptible as she was resolved not to give way to a despair that would disable her from seizing whatever opportunity might occur She kept her senses whenever beneath the whirl of intolerable thought they reeled and tottered nay she took food and wine that she might sustain her strength that she might be prepared She revolved scheme after scheme of escape and was forced to dismiss all Yet Sosia was her only hope the only instrument with which she could tamper He had been superstitious in the desire of ascertaining whether he could eventually purchase his freedom Blessed gods might he not be won by the bribe of freedom itself was she not nearly rich enough to purchase it Her slender arms were covered with bracelets the presents of Ione and on her neck she yet wore that very chain which it may be remembered had occasioned her jealous quarrel with Glaucus and which she had afterwards promised vainly to wear for ever She waited burningly till Sosia should again appear but as hour after hour passed and he came not she grew impatient Every nerve beat with fever she could endure the solitude no longer she groaned she shrieked aloud she beat herself against the door Her cries echoed along the hall and Sosia in peevish anger hastened to see what was the matter and silence his prisoner if possible Ho ho what is this said he surlily Young slave if thou screamest out thus we must gag thee again My shoulders will smart for it if thou art heard by my master Kind Sosia chide me not I cannot endure to be so long alone answered Nydia the solitude appals me Sit with me I pray a little while Nay fear not that I should attempt to escape place thy seat before the door Keep thine eye on me I will not stir from this spot Sosia who was a considerable gossip himself was moved by this address He pitied one who had nobody to talk with it was his case too he pitied and resolved to relieve himself He took the hint of Nydia placed a stool before the door leant his back against it and replied I am sure I do not wish to be churlish and so far as a little innocent chat goes I have no objection to indulge you But mind no tricks no more conjuring No no tell me dear Sosia what is the hour It is already evening the goats are going home O gods how went the trial Both condemned Nydia repressed the shriek Well well I thought it would be so When do they suffer To morrow in the amphitheatre If it were not for thee little wretch I should be allowed to go with the rest and see it Nydia leant back for some moments Nature could endure no more she had fainted away But Sosia did not perceive it for it was the dusk of eve and he was full of his own privations He went on lamenting the loss of so delightful a show and accusing the injustice of Arbaces for singling him out from all his fellows to be converted into a gaoler and ere he had half finished Nydia with a deep sigh recovered the sense of life Thou sighest blind one at my loss Well that is some comfort So long as you acknowledge how much you cost me I will endeavor not to grumble It is hard to be ill treated and yet not pitied Sosia how much dost thou require to make up the purchase of thy freedom How much Why about two thousand sesterces The gods be praised not more Seest thou these bracelets and this chain They are well worth double that sum I will give them thee if Tempt me not I cannot release thee Arbaces is a severe and awful master Who knows but I might feed the fishes of the Sarnus Alas all the sesterces in the world would not buy me back into life Better a live dog than a dead lion Sosia thy freedom Think well If thou wilt let me out only for one little hour let me out at midnight I will return ere to morrow s dawn nay thou canst go with me No said Sosia sturdily a slave once disobeyed Arbaces and he was never more heard of But the law gives a master no power over the life of a slave The law is very obliging but more polite than efficient I know that Arbaces always gets the law on his side Besides if I am once dead what law can bring me to life again Nydia wrung her hands Is there no hope then said she convulsively None of escape till Arbaces gives the word Well then said Nydia quickly thou wilt not at least refuse to take a letter for me thy master cannot kill thee for that To whom The praetor To a magistrate No not I I should be made a witness in court for what I know and the way they cross examine the slaves is by the torture Pardon I meant not the praetor it was a word that escaped me unawares I meant quite another person the gay Sallust Oh and what want you with him Glaucus was my master he purchased me from a cruel lord He alone has been kind to me He is to die I shall never live happily if I cannot in his hour of trial and doom let him know that one heart is grateful to him Sallust is his friend he will convey my message I am sure he will do no such thing Glaucus will have enough to think of between this and to morrow without troubling his head about a blind girl Man said Nydia rising wilt thou become free Thou hast the offer in thy power to morrow it will be too late Never was freedom more cheaply purchased Thou canst easily and unmissed leave home less than half an hour will suffice for thine absence And for such a trifle wilt thou refuse liberty Sosia was greatly moved It was true that the request was remarkably silly but what was that to him So much the better He could lock the door on Nydia and if Arbaces should learn his absence the offence was venial and would merit but a reprimand Yet should Nydia s letter contain something more than what she had said should it speak of her imprisonment as he shrewdly conjectured it would do what then It need never be known to Arbaces that he had carried the letter At the worst the bribe was enormous the risk light the temptation irresistible He hesitated no longer he assented to the proposal Give me the trinkets and I will take the letter Yet stay thou art a slave thou hast no right to these ornaments they are thy master s They were the gifts of Glaucus he is my master What chance hath he to claim them Who else will know they are in my possession Enough I will bring thee the papyrus No not papyrus a tablet of wax and a stilus Nydia as the reader will have seen was born of gentle parents They had done all to lighten her calamity and her quick intellect seconded their exertions Despite her blindness she had therefore acquired in childhood though imperfectly the art to write with the sharp stilus upon waxen tablets in which her exquisite sense of touch came to her aid When the tablets were brought to her she thus painfully traced some words in Greek the language of her childhood and which almost every Italian of the higher ranks was then supposed to know She carefully wound round the epistle the thread and covered its knot with wax and ere she placed it in the hands of Sosia she thus addressed him Sosia I am blind and in prison Thou mayst think to deceive me thou mayst pretend only to take the letter to Sallust thou mayst not fulfill thy charge but here I solemnly dedicate thy head to vengeance thy soul to the infernal powers if thou wrongest thy trust and I call upon thee to place thy right hand of faith in mine and repeat after me these words By the ground on which we stand by the elements which contain life and can curse life by Orcus the all avenging by the Olympian Jupiter the all seeing I swear that I will honestly discharge my trust and faithfully deliver into the hands of Sallust this letter And if I perjure myself in this oath may the full curses of heaven and hell be wreaked upon me Enough I trust thee take thy reward It is already dark depart at once Thou art a strange girl and thou hast frightened me terribly but it is all very natural and if Sallust is to be found I give him this letter as I have sworn By my faith I may have my little peccadilloes but perjury no I leave that to my betters With this Sosia withdrew carefully passing the heavy bolt athwart Nydia s door carefully locking its wards and hanging the key to his girdle he retired to his own den enveloped himself from head to foot in a huge disguising cloak and slipped out by the back way undisturbed and unseen The streets were thin and empty He soon gained the house of Sallust The porter bade him leave his letter and be gone for Sallust was so grieved at the condemnation of Glaucus that he could not on any account be disturbed Nevertheless I have sworn to give this letter into his own hands do so I must And Sosia well knowing by experience that Cerberus loves a sop thrust some half a dozen sesterces into the hand of the porter Well well said the latter relenting you may enter if you will but to tell you the truth Sallust is drinking himself out of his grief It is his way when anything disturbs him He orders a capital supper the best wine and does not give over till everything is out of his head but the liquor An excellent plan excellent Ah what it is to be rich If I were Sallust I would have some grief or another every day But just say a kind word for me with the atriensis I see him coming Sallust was too sad to receive company he was too sad also to drink alone so as was his wont he admitted his favorite freedman to his entertainment and a stranger banquet never was held For ever and anon the kind hearted epicure sighed whimpered wept outright and then turned with double zest to some new dish or his refilled goblet My good fellow said he to his companion it was a most awful judgment heigho it is not bad that kid eh Poor dear Glaucus what a jaw the lion has too Ah ah ah And Sallust sobbed loudly the fit was stopped by a counteraction of hiccups Take a cup of wine said the freedman A thought too cold but then how cold Glaucus must be Shut up the house to morrow not a slave shall stir forth none of my people shall honour that cursed arena No no Taste the Falernian your grief distracts you By the gods it does a piece of that cheesecake It was at this auspicious moment that Sosia was admitted to the presence of the disconsolate carouser Ho what art thou Merely a messenger to Sallust I give him this billet from a young female There is no answer that I know of May I withdraw Thus said the discreet Sosia keeping his face muffled in his cloak and speaking with a feigned voice so that he might not hereafter be recognized By the gods a pimp Unfeeling wretch do you not see my sorrows Go and the curses of Pandarus with you Sosia lost not a moment in retiring Will you read the letter Sallust said the freedman Letter which letter said the epicure reeling for he began to see double A curse on these wenches say I Am I a man to think of hiccup pleasure when when my friend is going to be eat up Eat another tartlet No no My grief chokes me Take him to bed said the freedman and Sallust s head now declining fairly on his breast they bore him off to his cubiculum still muttering lamentations for Glaucus and imprecations on the unfeeling overtures of ladies of pleasure Meanwhile Sosia strode indignantly homeward Pimp indeed quoth he to himself Pimp a scurvy tongued fellow that Sallust Had I been called knave or thief I could have forgiven it but pimp Faugh There is something in the word which the toughest stomach in the world would rise against A knave is a knave for his own pleasure and a thief a thief for his own profit and there is something honorable and philosophical in being a rascal for one s own sake that is doing things upon principle upon a grand scale But a pimp is a thing that defiles itself for another a pipkin that is put on the fire for another man s pottage a napkin that every guest wipes his hands upon and the scullion says by your leave too A pimp I would rather he had called me parricide But the man was drunk and did not know what he said and besides I disguised myself Had he seen it had been Sosia who addressed him it would have been honest Sosia and worthy man I warrant Nevertheless the trinkets have been won easily that s some comfort and O goddess Feronia I shall be a freedman soon and then I should like to see who ll call me pimp unless indeed he pay me pretty handsomely for it While Sosia was soliloquising in this high minded and generous vein his path lay along a narrow lane that led towards the amphitheatre and its adjacent palaces Suddenly as he turned a sharp corner he found himself in the midst of a considerable crowd Men women and children all were hurrying or laughing talking gesticulating and ere he was aware of it the worthy Sosia was borne away with the noisy stream What now he asked of his nearest neighbor a young artificer what now Where are all these good folks thronging Does any rich patron give away alms or viands to night Not so man better still replied the artificer the noble Pansa the people s friend has granted the public leave to see the beasts in their vivaria By Hercules they will not be seen so safely by some persons to morrow Tis a pretty sight said the slave yielding to the throng that impelled him onward and since I may not go to the sports to morrow I may as well take a peep at the beasts to night You will do well returned his new acquaintance a lion and a tiger are not to be seen at Pompeii every day The crowd had now entered a broken and wide space of ground on which as it was only lighted scantily and from a distance the press became dangerous to those whose limbs and shoulders were not fitted for a mob Nevertheless the women especially many of them with children in their arms or even at the breast were the most resolute in forcing their way and their shrill exclamations of complaint or objurgation were heard loud above the more jovial and masculine voices Yet amidst them was a young and girlish voice that appeared to come from one too happy in her excitement to be alive to the inconvenience of the crowd Aha cried the young woman to some of her companions I always told you so I always said we should have a man for the lion and now we have one for the tiger too I wish tomorrow were come Ho ho for the merry merry show With a forest of faces in every row Lo the swordsmen bold as the son of Alcmaena Sweep side by side o er the hushed arena Talk while you may you will hold your breath When they meet in the grasp of the glowing death Tramp tramp how gaily they go Ho ho for the merry merry show A jolly girl said Sosia Yes replied the young artificer a curly headed handsome youth Yes replied he enviously the women love a gladiator If I had been a slave I would have soon found my schoolmaster in the lanista Would you indeed said Sosia with a sneer People s notions differ The crowd had now arrived at the place of destination but as the cell in which the wild beasts were confined was extremely small and narrow tenfold more vehement than it hitherto had been was the rush of the aspirants to obtain admittance Two of the officers of the amphitheatre placed at the entrance very wisely mitigated the evil by dispensing to the foremost only a limited number of tickets at a time and admitting no new visitors till their predecessors had sated their curiosity Sosia who was a tolerably stout fellow and not troubled with any remarkable scruples of diffidence or good breeding contrived to be among the first of the initiated Separated from his companion the artificer Sosia found himself in a narrow cell of oppressive heat and atmosphere and lighted by several rank and flaring torches The animals usually kept in different vivaria or dens were now for the greater entertainment of the visitors placed in one but equally indeed divided from each other by strong cages protected by iron bars There they were the fell and grim wanderers of the desert who have now become almost the principal agents of this story The lion who as being the more gentle by nature than his fellow beast had been more incited to ferocity by hunger stalked restlessly and fiercely to and fro his narrow confines his eyes were lurid with rage and famine and as every now and then he paused and glared around the spectators fearfully pressed backward and drew their breath more quickly But the tiger lay quiet and extended at full length in his cage and only by an occasional play of his tail or a long impatient yawn testified any emotion at his confinement or at the crowd which honored him with their presence I have seen no fiercer beast than yon lion even in the amphitheatre of Rome said a gigantic and sinewy fellow who stood at the right hand of Sosia I feel humbled when I look at his limbs replied at the left of Sosia a slighter and younger figure with his arms folded on his breast The slave looked first at one and then at the other Virtus in medio virtue is ever in the middle muttered he to himself a goodly neighborhood for thee Sosia a gladiator on each side That is well said Lydon returned the huger gladiator I feel the same And to think observed Lydon in a tone of deep feeling to think that the noble Greek he whom we saw but a day or two since before us so full of youth and health and joyousness is to feast yon monster Why not growled Niger savagely many an honest gladiator has been compelled to a like combat by the emperor why not a wealthy murderer by the law Lydon sighed shrugged his shoulders and remained silent Meanwhile the common gazers listened with staring eyes and lips apart the gladiators were objects of interest as well as the beasts they were animals of the same species so the crowd glanced from one to the other the men and the brutes whispering their comments and anticipating the morrow Well said Lydon turning away I thank the gods that it is not the lion or the tiger I am to contend with even you Niger are a gentler combatant than they But equally dangerous said the gladiator with a fierce laugh and the bystanders admiring his vast limbs and ferocious countenance laughed too That as it may be answered Lydon carelessly as he pressed through the throng and quitted the den I may as well take advantage of his shoulders thought the prudent Sosia hastening to follow him the crowd always give way to a gladiator so I will keep close behind and come in for a share of his consequence The son of Medon strode quickly through the mob many of whom recognized his features and profession That is young Lydon a brave fellow he fights to morrow said one Ah I have a bet on him said another see how firmly he walks Good luck to thee Lydon said a third Lydon you have my wishes half whispered a fourth smiling a comely woman of the middle class and if you win why you may hear more of me A handsome man by Venus cried a fifth who was a girl scarce in her teens Thank you returned Sosia gravely taking the compliment to himself However strong the purer motives of Lydon and certain though it be that he would never have entered so bloody a calling but from the hope of obtaining his father s freedom he was not altogether unmoved by the notice he excited He forgot that the voices now raised in commendation might on the morrow shout over his death pangs By nature fierce and reckless as well as generous and warm hearted he was already imbued with the pride of a profession that he fancied he disdained and affected by the influence of a companionship that in reality he loathed He saw himself now a man of importance his step grew yet lighter and his mien more elate Niger said he turning suddenly as he had now threaded the crowd we have often quarrelled we are not matched against each other but one of us at least may reasonably expect to fall give us thy hand Most readily said Sosia extending his palm Ha what fool is this Why I thought Niger was at my heels I forgive the mistake replied Sosia condescendingly don t mention it the error was easy I and Niger are somewhat of the same build Ha ha that is excellent Niger would have slit thy throat had he heard thee You gentlemen of the arena have a most disagreeable mode of talking said Sosia let us change the conversation Vah vah said Lydon impatiently I am in no humor to converse with thee Why truly returned the slave you must have serious thoughts enough to occupy your mind to morrow is I think your first essay in the arena Well I am sure you will die bravely May thy words fall on thine own head said Lydon superstitiously for he by no means liked the blessing of Sosia Die No I trust my hour is not yet come He who plays at dice with death must expect the dog s throw replied Sosia maliciously But you are a strong fellow and I wish you all imaginable luck and so vale With that the slave turned on his heel and took his way homeward I trust the rogue s words are not ominous said Lydon musingly In my zeal for my father s liberty and my confidence in my own thews and sinews I have not contemplated the possibility of death My poor father I am thy only son if I were to fall As the thought crossed him the gladiator strode on with a more rapid and restless pace when suddenly in an opposite street he beheld the very object of his thoughts Leaning on his stick his form bent by care and age his eyes downcast and his steps trembling the grey haired Medon slowly approached towards the gladiator Lydon paused a moment he divined at once the cause that brought forth the old man at that late hour Be sure it is I whom he seeks thought he he is horror struck at the condemnation of Olinthus he more than ever esteems the arena criminal and hateful he comes again to dissuade me from the contest I must shun him I cannot brook his prayers his tears These thoughts so long to recite flashed across the young man like lightning He turned abruptly and fled swiftly in an opposite direction He paused not till almost spent and breathless he found himself on the summit of a small acclivity which overlooked the most gay and splendid part of that miniature city and as there he paused and gazed along the tranquil streets glittering in the rays of the moon which had just arisen and brought partially and picturesquely into light the crowd around the amphitheatre at a distance murmuring and swaying to and fro the influence of the scene affected him rude and unimaginative though his nature He sat himself down to rest upon the steps of a deserted portico and felt the calm of the hour quiet and restore him Opposite and near at hand the lights gleamed from a palace in which the master now held his revels The doors were open for coolness and the gladiator beheld the numerous and festive group gathered round the tables in the atrium while behind them closing the long vista of the illumined rooms beyond the spray of the distant fountain sparkled in the moonbeams There the garlands wreathed around the columns of the hall there gleamed still and frequent the marble statue there amidst peals of jocund laughter rose the music and the lay EPICUREAN SONG Away with your stories of Hades Which the Flamen has forged to affright us We laugh at your three Maiden Ladies Your Fates and your sullen Cocytus Poor Jove has a troublesome life sir Could we credit your tales of his portals In shutting his ears on his wife sir And opening his eyes upon mortals Oh blest be the bright Epicurus Who taught us to laugh at such fables On Hades they wanted to moor us And his hand cut the terrible cables If then there s a Jove or a Juno They vex not their heads about us man Besides if they did I and you know Tis the life of a god to live thus man What think you the gods place their bliss eh In playing the spy on a sinner In counting the girls that we kiss eh Or the cups that we empty at dinner Content with the soft lips that love us This music this wine and this mirth boys We care not for gods up above us We know there s no god for this earth boys While Lydon s piety which accommodating as it might be was in no slight degree disturbed by these verses which embodied the fashionable philosophy of the day slowly recovered itself from the shock it had received a small party of men in plain garments and of the middle class passed by his resting place They were in earnest conversation and did not seem to notice or heed the gladiator as they moved on O horror on horrors said one Olinthus is snatched from us our right arm is lopped away When will Christ descend to protect his own Can human atrocity go farther said another to sentence an innocent man to the same arena as a murderer But let us not despair the thunder of Sinai may yet be heard and the Lord preserve his saint The fool hath said in his heart There is no God At that moment out broke again from the illumined palace the burden of the reveller s song We care not for gods up above us We know there s no god for this earth boys Ere the words died away the Nazarenes moved by sudden indignation caught up the echo and in the words of one of their favorite hymns shouted aloud THE WARNING HYMN OF THE NAZARENES Around about for ever near thee God OUR GOD shall mark and hear thee On his car of storm He sweeps Bow ye heavens and shrink ye deeps Woe to the proud ones who defy Him Woe to the dreamers who deny Him Woe to the wicked woe The proud stars shall fail The sun shall grow pale The heavens shrivel up like a scroll Hell s ocean shall bare Its depths of despair Each wave an eternal soul For the only thing then That shall not live again Is the corpse of the giant TIME Hark the trumpet of thunder Lo earth rent asunder And forth on His Angel throne He comes through the gloom The Judge of the Tomb To summon and save His own Oh joy to Care and woe to Crime He comes to save His own Woe to the proud ones who defy Him Woe to the dreamers who deny Him Woe to the wicked woe A sudden silence from the startled hall of revel succeeded these ominous words the Christians swept on and were soon hidden from the sight of the gladiator Awed he scarce knew why by the mystic denunciations of the Christians Lydon after a short pause now rose to pursue his way homeward Before him how serenely slept the starlight on that lovely city how breathlessly its pillared streets reposed in their security how softly rippled the dark green waves beyond how cloudless spread aloft and blue the dreaming Campanian skies Yet this was the last night for the gay Pompeii the colony of the hoar Chaldean the fabled city of Hercules the delight of the voluptuous Roman Age after age had rolled indestructive unheeded over its head and now the last ray quivered on the dial plate of its doom The gladiator heard some light steps behind a group of females were wending homeward from their visit to the amphitheatre As he turned his eye was arrested by a strange and sudden apparition From the summit of Vesuvius darkly visible at the distance there shot a pale meteoric livid light it trembled an instant and was gone And at the same moment that his eye caught it the voice of one of the youngest of the women broke out hilariously and shrill TRAMP TRAMP HOW GAILY THEY GO HO HO FOR THE MORROW S MERRY SHOW BOOK THE FIFTH Chapter I THE DREAM OF ARBACES A VISITOR AND A WARNING TO THE EGYPTIAN THE awful night preceding the fierce joy of the amphitheatre rolled drearily away and greyly broke forth the dawn of THE LAST DAY OF POMPEII The air was uncommonly calm and sultry 
4480-8371-0000	train-other-500	a thin and dull mist gathered over the valleys and hollows of the broad Campanian fields But yet it was remarked in surprise by the early fishermen that despite the exceeding stillness of the atmosphere the waves of the sea were agitated

4480-8371-0009	train-other-500	At the sight of her quaint and primaeval garb of her wild gait and gestures the passengers she encountered touched each other and smiled but as they caught a glimpse of her countenance the mirth was hushed at once

4480-8371-0015	train-other-500	and now leaped fiercely to and fro darting across the vast gloom in wild gambols suddenly disappearing and as suddenly bursting into tenfold brilliancy and power
4480-8371-0016	train-other-500	And while he gazed wonderingly upon the gallery to the left thin mist like aerial shapes passed slowly up and when they had gained the hall they seemed to rise aloft and to vanish as the smoke vanishes
4480-8371-0017	train-other-500	in the measureless ascent He turned in fear towards the opposite extremity and behold there came swiftly from the gloom above similar shadows which swept hurriedly along the gallery to the right
4480-8371-0018	train-other-500	as if borne involuntarily adown the sides of some invisible stream and the faces of these spectres were more distinct than those that emerged from the opposite passage and on some was joy and on others sorrow
4480-8371-0019	train-other-500	some were vivid with expectation and hope some unutterably dejected by awe and horror And so they passed swift and constantly on till the eyes of the gazer grew dizzy and blinded
4480-8371-0020	train-other-500	with the whirl of an ever varying succession of things impelled by a power apparently not their own Arbaces turned away and in the recess of the hall he saw the mighty form of a giantess seated upon a pile of skulls
none	none	 and her hands were busy upon a pale and shadowy woof 
4480-8371-0021	train-other-500	and he saw that the woof communicated with the numberless wheels as if it guided the machinery of their movements
none	none	 He thought his feet by some secret agency were impelled towards the female and that he was borne onwards 
4480-8371-0022	train-other-500	till he stood before her face to face The countenance of the giantess was solemn and hushed and beautifully serene It was as the face of some colossal sculpture of his own ancestral sphinx No passion
4480-8371-0023	train-other-500	no human emotion disturbed its brooding and unwrinkled brow there was neither sadness nor joy nor memory nor hope it was free from all with which the wild human heart can sympathize
4480-8371-0024	train-other-500	The mystery of mysteries rested on its beauty it awed but terrified not it was the Incarnation of the sublime And Arbaces felt the voice leave his lips
none	none	 without an impulse of his own and the voice asked Who art thou and what is thy task I am That which thou hast acknowledged answered without desisting from its work the mighty phantom My name is NATURE These are the wheels of the world and my hand guides them for the life of all things And what said the voice of Arbaces are these galleries that strangely and fitfully illumined stretch on either hand into the abyss of gloom That answered the giant mother which thou beholdest to the left is the gallery of the Unborn The shadows that flit onward and upward into the world are the souls that pass from the long eternity of being to their destined pilgrimage on earth That which thou beholdest to thy right wherein the shadows descending from above sweep on equally unknown and dim is the gallery of the Dead And wherefore said the voice of Arbaces yon wandering lights that so wildly break the darkness but only break not reveal Dark fool of the human sciences dreamer of the stars and would be decipherer of the heart and origin of things those lights are but the glimmerings of such knowledge as is vouchsafed to Nature to work her way to trace enough of the past and future to give providence to her designs Judge then puppet as thou art what lights are reserved for thee Arbaces felt himself tremble as he asked again Wherefore am I here It is the forecast of thy soul the prescience of thy rushing doom the shadow of thy fate lengthening into eternity as declines from earth Ere he could answer Arbaces felt a rushing WIND sweep down the cavern as the winds of a giant god Borne aloft from the ground and whirled on high as a leaf in the storms of autumn he beheld himself in the midst of the Spectres of the Dead and hurrying with them along the length of gloom As in vain and impotent despair he struggled against the impelling power he thought the WIND 
4480-8371-0025	train-other-500	grew into something like a shape a spectral outline of the wings and talons of an eagle with limbs floating far and indistinctly along the air and eyes that alone clearly and vividly seen
4480-8371-0026	train-other-500	glared stonily and remorselessly on his own What art thou
none	none	 again said the voice of the Egyptian I am That which thou hast acknowledged and the spectre laughed aloud and my name is NECESSITY To what dost thou bear me To the Unknown To happiness or to woe As thou hast sown so shalt thou reap Dread thing not so If thou art the Ruler of Life thine are my misdeeds not mine I am but the breath of God answered the mighty WIND 
4480-8371-0027	train-other-500	Then is my wisdom vain groaned the dreamer
none	none	 The husbandman accuses not fate when having sown thistles he reaps not corn Thou hast sown crime accuse not fate if thou reapest not the harvest of virtue The scene suddenly changed Arbaces was in a place of human bones and lo in the midst of them was a skull and the skull still retaining its fleshless hollows assumed slowly and in the mysterious confusion of a dream the face of Apaecides and forth from the grinning jaws there crept a small worm and it crawled to the feet of Arbaces He attempted to stamp on it and crush it but it became longer and larger with that attempt It swelled and bloated till it grew into a vast serpent it coiled itself round the limbs of Arbaces it crunched his bones it raised its glaring eyes and poisonous jaws to his face He writhed in vain 
4480-8371-0028	train-other-500	he withered he gasped beneath the influence of the blighting breath he felt himself blasted
none	none	 into death And then a voice came from the reptile which still bore the face of Apaecides and rang in his reeling ear THY VICTIM IS THY JUDGE THE WORM THOU WOULDST CRUSH BECOMES THE SERPENT THAT DEVOURS THEE With a shriek of wrath and woe and despairing resistance Arbaces awoke his hair on end his brow bathed in dew his eyes glazed and staring his mighty frame quivering as an infant s beneath the agony of that dream He awoke 
4480-8371-0029	train-other-500	he collected himself he blessed the gods whom he disbelieved that he was in a dream he turned his eyes from side to side he saw the dawning light break through his small but lofty window
4480-8371-0030	train-other-500	he was in the Precincts of Day he rejoiced he smiled his eyes fell and opposite to him he beheld the ghastly features the lifeless eye the livid lip
4480-8371-0031	train-other-500	of the hag of Vesuvius Ha he cried placing his hands before his eyes as to shut out the grisly vision do I dream still Am I with the dead
none	none	 Mighty Hermes no 
4480-8371-0032	train-other-500	Thou art with one death like but not dead Recognize thy friend and slave There was a long silence
4480-8371-0033	train-other-500	Slowly the shudders that passed over the limbs of the Egyptian chased each other away faintlier and faintlier dying till he was himself again It was a dream then said he Well let me dream no more
4480-8371-0034	train-other-500	or the day cannot compensate for the pangs of night
none	none	 Woman how camest thou here and wherefore I came to warn thee answered the sepulchral voice of the saga Warn me The dream lied not then Of what peril Listen to me Some evil hangs over this fated city Fly 
4480-8371-0035	train-other-500	while it be time Thou knowest that I hold my home on that mountain beneath which old tradition saith there yet burn the fires of the river
none	none	 of Phlegethon and in my cavern is a vast abyss and in that abyss I have of late marked a red and dull stream 
4480-8371-0036	train-other-500	creep slowly slowly on and heard many and mighty sounds hissing and roaring through the gloom But last night as I looked thereon behold
4480-8371-0037	train-other-500	the stream was no longer dull but intensely and fiercely luminous and while I gazed the beast that liveth with me and was cowering by my side
none	none	 uttered a shrill howl and fell down and died and the slaver and froth were round his lips I crept back to my lair but I distinctly heard 
4480-8371-0038	train-other-500	all the night the rock shake and tremble and though the air was heavy and still there were the hissing of pent winds and the grinding as of wheels beneath the ground
none	none	 So when I rose this morning at the very birth of dawn 
4480-8371-0039	train-other-500	I looked again down the abyss
none	none	 and I saw vast fragments of stone borne black and floatingly over the lurid stream 
4480-8371-0040	train-other-500	and the stream itself was broader fiercer redder than the night before Then I went forth and ascended to the summit of the rock and in that summit
4480-8371-0041	train-other-500	there appeared a sudden and vast hollow which I had never perceived before
none	none	 from which curled a dim 
4480-8371-0042	train-other-500	faint smoke and the vapor was deathly and I gasped and sickened and nearly died
none	none	 I returned home 
4480-8371-0043	train-other-500	I took my gold and my drugs and left the habitation of many years for I remembered the dark Etruscan prophecy which saith
none	none	 When the mountain opens the city shall fall when the smoke crowns the Hill of the Parched Fields 
4480-8371-0044	train-other-500	there shall be woe and weeping in the hearths of the Children of the Sea Dread master ere I leave these walls for some more distant dwelling
none	none	 I come to thee As thou livest know I in my heart that the earthquake that sixteen years ago shook this city to its solid base was but the forerunner of more deadly doom The walls of Pompeii are built above the fields of the Dead and the rivers of the sleepless Hell Be warned and fly Witch I thank thee for thy care of one not ungrateful On yon table stands a cup of gold take it it is thine 
4480-8371-0045	train-other-500	I dreamt not that there lived one out of the priesthood of Isis who would have saved Arbaces from destruction The signs thou hast seen in the bed of the extinct volcano continued the Egyptian musingly
none	none	 surely tell of some coming danger to the city perhaps another earthquake fiercer than the last Be that as it may there is a new reason for my hastening from these walls After this day I will prepare my departure Daughter of Etruria 
4480-8371-0046	train-other-500	whither wendest thou I shall cross over to Herculaneum this day and wandering thence along the coast shall seek out a new home I am friendless my two companions
none	none	 the fox and the snake are dead Great Hermes 
4480-8371-0047	train-other-500	thou hast promised me twenty additional years of life Aye said the Egyptian I have promised thee But woman he added lifting himself upon his arm and gazing curiously on her face
4480-8371-0048	train-other-500	tell me I pray thee wherefore thou wishest to live What sweets dost thou discover in existence It is not life that is sweet but death that is awful
4480-8371-0049	train-other-500	replied the hag in a sharp impressive tone that struck forcibly upon the heart of the vain star seer He winced at the truth of the reply and no longer anxious to retain so uninviting a companion he said
4480-8371-0050	train-other-500	Time wanes I must prepare for the solemn spectacle of this day Sister farewell enjoy thyself as thou canst over the ashes of life The hag
4480-8371-0051	train-other-500	who had placed the costly gift of Arbaces in the loose folds of her vest now rose to depart When she had gained the door she paused turned back and said This may be the last time we meet on earth
4480-8371-0052	train-other-500	but whither flieth the flame when it leaves the ashes Wandering to and fro up and down as an exhalation on the morass the flame may be seen in the marshes of the lake below
4480-8371-0053	train-other-500	and the witch and the Magian the pupil and the master the great one and the accursed one may meet again Farewell Out croaker
4480-8371-0054	train-other-500	muttered Arbaces as the door closed on the hag s tattered robes and impatient of his own thoughts not yet recovered from the past dream he hastily summoned his slaves
4480-8371-0055	train-other-500	It was the custom to attend the ceremonials of the amphitheatre in festive robes and Arbaces arrayed himself that day with more than usual care His tunic was of the most dazzling white
none	none	 his many fibulae were formed from the most precious stones 
4480-8371-0056	train-other-500	over his tunic flowed a loose eastern robe half gown half mantle glowing in the richest hues of the Tyrian dye
none	none	 and the sandals that reached half way up the knee were studded with gems and inlaid with gold In the quackeries that belonged to his priestly genius Arbaces never neglected on great occasions the arts which dazzle and impose upon the vulgar and on this day that was for ever to release him by the sacrifice of Glaucus from the fear of a rival and the chance of detection he felt that he was arraying himself as for a triumph or a nuptial feast It was customary for men of rank to be accompanied to the shows of the amphitheatre by a procession of their slaves and freedmen 
4480-8371-0057	train-other-500	and the long family of Arbaces were already arranged in order to attend the litter of their lord Only to their great chagrin the slaves in attendance on Ione
none	none	 and the worthy Sosia as gaoler to Nydia 
4480-8371-0058	train-other-500	were condemned to remain at home Callias said Arbaces apart to his freedman who was buckling on his girdle I am weary of Pompeii I propose to quit it in three days should the wind favor
4480-8371-0059	train-other-500	Thou knowest the vessel that lies in the harbor which belonged to Narses of Alexandria I have purchased it of him The day after tomorrow we shall begin to remove my stores So soon Tis well Arbaces shall be obeyed
4480-8371-0060	train-other-500	and his ward Ione Accompanies me Enough Is the morning fair Dim and oppressive it will probably be intensely hot in the forenoon The poor gladiators and more wretched criminals
4480-8371-0061	train-other-500	Descend and see that the slaves are marshalled
none	none	 Left alone Arbaces stepped into his chamber of study 
4480-8371-0062	train-other-500	and thence upon the portico without He saw the dense masses of men pouring fast into the amphitheatre and heard the cry of the assistants and the cracking of the cordage
none	none	 as they were straining aloft the huge awning under which the citizens 
4480-8371-0063	train-other-500	molested by no discomforting ray were to behold at luxurious ease the agonies of their fellow creatures Suddenly a wild strange sound went forth and as suddenly died away it was the roar
4480-8371-0064	train-other-500	of the lion There was a silence in the distant crowd but the silence was followed by joyous laughter they were making merry at the hungry impatience of the royal beast Brutes
none	none	 muttered the disdainful Arbaces 
4480-8371-0065	train-other-500	are ye less homicides than I am I slay but in self defence ye make murder pastime He turned with a restless and curious eye towards Vesuvius Beautifully glowed the green vineyards round its breast
4480-8371-0066	train-other-500	and tranquil as eternity lay in the breathless skies the form of the mighty hill We have time yet if the earthquake be nursing thought Arbaces and he turned from the spot
none	none	 He passed by the table which bore his mystic scrolls and Chaldean calculations August art he thought I have not consulted thy decrees since I passed the danger and the crisis they foretold What matter I know that henceforth all in my path is bright and smooth Have not events already proved it Away doubt away pity Reflect O my heart reflect for the future but two images Empire and Ione Chapter II THE AMPHITHEATRE NYDIA assured by the account of Sosia on his return home and satisfied that her letter was in the hands of Sallust gave herself up once more to hope Sallust would surely lose no time in seeking the praetor in coming to the house of the Egyptian in releasing her in breaking the prison of Calenus That very night Glaucus would be free Alas the night passed the dawn broke she heard nothing but the hurried footsteps of the slaves along the hall and peristyle and their voices in preparation for the show By and by the commanding voice of Arbaces broke on her ear a flourish of music rung out cheerily the long procession were sweeping to the amphitheatre to glut their eyes on the death pangs of the Athenian The procession of Arbaces moved along slowly and with much solemnity till now arriving at the place where it was necessary for such as came in litters or chariots to alight Arbaces descended from his vehicle and proceeded to the entrance by which the more distinguished spectators were admitted His slaves mingling with the humbler crowd were stationed by officers who received their tickets not much unlike our modern Opera ones in places in the popularia the seats apportioned to the vulgar And now from the spot where Arbaces sat his eyes scanned the mighty and impatient crowd that filled the stupendous theatre On the upper tier but apart from the male spectators sat women their gay dresses resembling some gaudy flower bed it is needless to add that they were the most talkative part of the assembly and many were the looks directed up to them especially from the benches appropriated to the young and the unmarried men On the lower seats round the arena sat the more high born and wealthy visitors the magistrates and those of senatorial or equestrian dignity the passages which by corridors at the right and left gave access to these seats at either end of the oval arena were also the entrances for the combatants Strong palings at these passages prevented any unwelcome eccentricity in the movements of the beasts and confined them to their appointed prey Around the parapet which was raised above the arena and from which the seats gradually rose were gladiatorial inscriptions and paintings wrought in fresco typical of the entertainments for which the place was designed Throughout the whole building wound invisible pipes from which as the day advanced cooling and fragrant showers were to be sprinkled over the spectators The officers of the amphitheatre were still employed in the task of fixing the vast awning or velaria which covered the whole and which luxurious invention the Campanians arrogated to themselves it was woven of the whitest Apulian wool and variegated with broad stripes of crimson Owing either to some inexperience on the part of the workmen or to some defect in the machinery the awning however was not arranged that day so happily as usual indeed from the immense space of the circumference the task was always one of great difficulty and art so much so that it could seldom be adventured in rough or windy weather But the present day was so remarkably still that there seemed to the spectators no excuse for the awkwardness of the artificers and when a large gap in the back of the awning was still visible from the obstinate refusal of one part of the velaria to ally itself with the rest the murmurs of discontent were loud and general The aedile Pansa at whose expense the exhibition was given looked particularly annoyed at the defect and vowed bitter vengeance on the head of the chief officer of the show who fretting puffing perspiring busied himself in idle orders and unavailing threats The hubbub ceased suddenly the operators desisted the crowd were stilled the gap was forgotten for now with a loud and warlike flourish of trumpets the gladiators marshalled in ceremonious procession entered the arena They swept round the oval space very slowly and deliberately in order to give the spectators full leisure to admire their stern serenity of feature their brawny limbs and various arms as well as to form such wagers as the excitement of the moment might suggest Oh cried the widow Fulvia to the wife of Pansa as they leaned down from their lofty bench do you see that gigantic gladiator how drolly he is dressed Yes said the aedile s wife with complacent importance for she knew all the names and qualities of each combatant he is a retiarius or netter he is armed only you see with a three pronged spear like a trident and a net he wears no armor only the fillet and the tunic He is a mighty man and is to fight with Sporus yon thick set gladiator with the round shield and drawn sword but without body armor he has not his helmet on now in order that you may see his face how fearless it is by and by he will fight with his vizor down But surely a net and a spear are poor arms against a shield and sword That shows how innocent you are my dear Fulvia the retiarius has generally the best of it But who is yon handsome gladiator nearly naked is it not quite improper By Venus but his limbs are beautifully shaped It is Lydon a young untried man he has the rashness to fight yon other gladiator similarly dressed or rather undressed Tetraides They fight first in the Greek fashion with the cestus afterwards they put on armor and try sword and shield He is a proper man this Lydon and the women I am sure are on his side So are not the experienced betters Clodius offers three to one against him Oh Jove how beautiful exclaimed the widow as two gladiators armed cap a pie rode round the arena on light and prancing steeds Resembling much the combatants in the tilts of the middle age they bore lances and round shields beautifully inlaid their armor was woven intricately with bands of iron but it covered only the thighs and the right arms short cloaks extending to the seat gave a picturesque and graceful air to their costume their legs were naked with the exception of sandals which were fastened a little above the ankle Oh beautiful Who are these asked the widow The one is named Berbix he has conquered twelve times the other assumes the arrogant name of Nobilior They are both Gauls While thus conversing the first formalities of the show were over To these succeeded a feigned combat with wooden swords between the various gladiators matched against each other Amongst these the skill of two Roman gladiators hired for the occasion was the most admired and next to them the most graceful combatant was Lydon This sham contest did not last above an hour nor did it attract any very lively interest except among those connoisseurs of the arena to whom art was preferable to more coarse excitement the body of the spectators were rejoiced when it was over and when the sympathy rose to terror The combatants were now arranged in pairs as agreed beforehand their weapons examined and the grave sports of the day commenced amidst the deepest silence broken only by an exciting and preliminary blast of warlike music It was often customary to begin the sports by the most cruel of all and some bestiarius or gladiator appointed to the beasts was slain first as an initiatory sacrifice But in the present instance the experienced Pansa thought it better that the sanguinary drama should advance not decrease in interest and accordingly the execution of Olinthus and Glaucus was reserved for the last It was arranged that the two horsemen should first occupy the arena that the foot gladiators paired Off should then be loosed indiscriminately on the stage that Glaucus and the lion should next perform their part in the bloody spectacle and the tiger and the Nazarene be the grand finale And in the spectacles of Pompeii the reader of Roman history must limit his imagination nor expect to find those vast and wholesale exhibitions of magnificent slaughter with which a Nero or a Caligula regaled the inhabitants of the Imperial City The Roman shows which absorbed the more celebrated gladiators and the chief proportion of foreign beasts were indeed the very reason why in the lesser towns of the empire the sports of the amphitheatre were comparatively humane and rare and in this as in other respects Pompeii was but the miniature the microcosm of Rome Still it was an awful and imposing spectacle with which modern times have happily nothing to compare a vast theatre rising row upon row and swarming with human beings from fifteen to eighteen thousand in number intent upon no fictitious representation no tragedy of the stage but the actual victory or defeat the exultant life or the bloody death of each and all who entered the arena The two horsemen were now at either extremity of the lists if so they might be called and at a given signal from Pansa the combatants started simultaneously as in full collision each advancing his round buckler each poising on high his light yet sturdy javelin but just when within three paces of his opponent the steed of Berbix suddenly halted wheeled round and as Nobilior was borne rapidly by his antagonist spurred upon him The buckler of Nobilior quickly and skillfully extended received a blow which otherwise would have been fatal Well done Nobilior cried the praetor giving the first vent to the popular excitement Bravely struck my Berbix answered Clodius from his seat And the wild murmur swelled by many a shout echoed from side to side The vizors of both the horsemen were completely closed like those of the knights in after times but the head was nevertheless the great point of assault and Nobilior now wheeling his charger with no less adroitness than his opponent directed his spear full on the helmet of his foe Berbix raised his buckler to shield himself and his quick eyed antagonist suddenly lowering his weapon pierced him through the breast Berbix reeled and fell Nobilior Nobilior shouted the populace I have lost ten sestertia said Clodius between his teeth Habet he has it said Pansa deliberately The populace not yet hardened into cruelty made the signal of mercy but as the attendants of the arena approached they found the kindness came too late the heart of the Gaul had been pierced and his eyes were set in death It was his life s blood that flowed so darkly over the sand and sawdust of the arena It is a pity it was so soon over there was little enough for one s trouble said the widow Fulvia Yes I have no compassion for Berbix Any one might have seen that Nobilior did but feint Mark they fix the fatal hook to the body they drag him away to the spoliarium they scatter new sand over the stage Pansa regrets nothing more than that he is not rich enough to strew the arena with borax and cinnabar as Nero used to do Well if it has been a brief battle it is quickly succeeded See my handsome Lydon on the arena ay and the net bearer too and the swordsmen oh charming There were now on the arena six combatants Niger and his net matched against Sporus with his shield and his short broadsword Lydon and Tetraides naked save by a cincture round the waist each armed only with a heavy Greek cestus and two gladiators from Rome clad in complete steel and evenly matched with immense bucklers and pointed swords The initiatory contest between Lydon and Tetraides being less deadly than that between the other combatants no sooner had they advanced to the middle of the arena than as by common consent the rest held back to see how that contest should be decided and wait till fiercer weapons might replace the cestus ere they themselves commenced hostilities They stood leaning on their arms and apart from each other gazing on the show which if not bloody enough thoroughly to please the populace they were still inclined to admire because its origin was of their ancestral Greece No person could at first glance have seemed less evenly matched than the two antagonists Tetraides though not taller than Lydon weighed considerably more the natural size of his muscles was increased to the eyes of the vulgar by masses of solid flesh for as it was a notion that the contest of the cestus fared easiest with him who was plumpest Tetraides had encouraged to the utmost his hereditary predisposition to the portly His shoulders were vast and his lower limbs thick set double jointed and slightly curved outward in that formation which takes so much from beauty to give so largely to strength But Lydon except that he was slender even almost to meagreness was beautifully and delicately proportioned and the skilful might have perceived that with much less compass of muscle than his foe that which he had was more seasoned iron and compact In proportion too as he wanted flesh he was likely to possess activity and a haughty smile on his resolute face which strongly contrasted the solid heaviness of his enemy s gave assurance to those who beheld it and united their hope to their pity so that despite the disparity of their seeming strength the cry of the multitude was nearly as loud for Lydon as for Tetraides Whoever is acquainted with the modern prize ring whoever has witnessed the heavy and disabling strokes which the human fist skillfully directed hath the power to bestow may easily understand how much that happy facility would be increased by a band carried by thongs of leather round the arm as high as the elbow and terribly strengthened about the knuckles by a plate of iron and sometimes a plummet of lead Yet this which was meant to increase perhaps rather diminished the interest of the fray for it necessarily shortened its duration A very few blows successfully and scientifically planted might suffice to bring the contest to a close and the battle did not therefore often allow full scope for the energy fortitude and dogged perseverance that we technically style pluck which not unusually wins the day against superior science and which heightens to so painful a delight the interest in the battle and the sympathy for the brave Guard thyself growled Tetraides moving nearer and nearer to his foe who rather shifted round him than receded Lydon did not answer save by a scornful glance of his quick vigilant eye Tetraides struck it was as the blow of a smith on a vice Lydon sank suddenly on one knee the blow passed over his head Not so harmless was Lydon s retaliation he quickly sprung to his feet and aimed his cestus full on the broad breast of his antagonist Tetraides reeled the populace shouted You are unlucky to day said Lepidus to Clodius you have lost one bet you will lose another By the gods my bronzes go to the auctioneer if that is the case I have no less than a hundred sestertia upon Tetraides Ha ha see how he rallies That was a home stroke he has cut open Lydon s shoulder A Tetraides a Tetraides But Lydon is not disheartened By Pollux how well he keeps his temper See how dexterously he avoids those hammer like hands dodging now here now there circling round and round Ah poor Lydon he has it again Three to one still on Tetraides What say you Lepidus Well nine sestertia to three be it so What again Lydon He stops he gasps for breath By the gods he is down No he is again on his legs Brave Lydon Tetraides is encouraged he laughs loud he rushes on him Fool success blinds him he should be cautious Lydon s eye is like the lynx s said Clodius between his teeth Ha Clodius saw you that Your man totters Another blow he falls he falls Earth revives him then He is once more up but the blood rolls down his face By the thunderer Lydon wins it See how he presses on him That blow on the temple would have crushed an ox it has crushed Tetraides He falls again he cannot move habet habet Habet repeated Pansa Take them out and give them the armor and swords Noble editor said the officers we fear that Tetraides will not recover in time howbeit we will try Do so In a few minutes the officers who had dragged off the stunned and insensible gladiator returned with rueful countenances They feared for his life he was utterly incapacitated from re entering the arena In that case said Pansa hold Lydon a subdititius and the first gladiator that is vanquished let Lydon supply his place with the victor The people shouted their applause at this sentence then they again sunk into deep silence The trumpet sounded loudly The four combatants stood each against each in prepared and stern array Dost thou recognize the Romans my Clodius are they among the celebrated or are they merely ordinary Eumolpus is a good second rate swordsman my Lepidus Nepimus the lesser man I have never seen before but he is the son of one of the imperial fiscales and brought up in a proper school doubtless they will show sport but I have no heart for the game I cannot win back my money I am undone Curses on that Lydon who could have supposed he was so dexterous or so lucky Well Clodius shall I take compassion on you and accept your own terms with these Romans An even ten sestertia on Eumolpus then What when Nepimus is untried Nay nay that is to bad Well ten to eight Agreed While the contest in the amphitheatre had thus commenced there was one in the loftier benches for whom it had assumed indeed a poignant a stifling interest The aged father of Lydon despite his Christian horror of the spectacle in his agonized anxiety for his son had not been able to resist being the spectator of his fate One amidst a fierce crowd of strangers the lowest rabble of the populace the old man saw felt nothing but the form the presence of his brave son Not a sound had escaped his lips when twice he had seen him fall to the earth only he had turned paler and his limbs trembled But he had uttered one low cry when he saw him victorious unconscious alas of the more fearful battle to which that victory was but a prelude My gallant boy said he and wiped his eyes Is he thy son said a brawny fellow to the right of the Nazarene he has fought well let us see how he does by and by Hark he is to fight the first victor Now old boy pray the gods that that victor be neither of the Romans nor next to them the giant Niger The old man sat down again and covered his face The fray for the moment was indifferent to him Lydon was not one of the combatants Yet yet the thought flashed across him the fray was indeed of deadly interest the first who fell was to make way for Lydon He started and bent down with straining eyes and clasped hands to view the encounter The first interest was attracted towards the combat of Niger with Sporus for this species of contest from the fatal result which usually attended it and from the great science it required in either antagonist was always peculiarly inviting to the spectators They stood at a considerable distance from each other The singular helmet which Sporus wore the vizor of which was down concealed his face but the features of Niger attracted a fearful and universal interest from their compressed and vigilant ferocity Thus they stood for some moments each eyeing each until Sporus began slowly and with great caution to advance holding his sword pointed like a modern fencer s at the breast of his foe Niger retreated as his antagonist advanced gathering up his net with his right hand and never taking his small glittering eye from the movements of the swordsman Suddenly when Sporus had approached nearly at arm s length the retiarius threw himself forward and cast his net A quick inflection of body saved the gladiator from the deadly snare he uttered a sharp cry of joy and rage and rushed upon Niger but Niger had already drawn in his net thrown it across his shoulders and now fled round the lists with a swiftness which the secutor in vain endeavored to equal The people laughed and shouted aloud to see the ineffectual efforts of the broad shouldered gladiator to overtake the flying giant when at that moment their attention was turned from these to the two Roman combatants They had placed themselves at the onset face to face at the distance of modern fencers from each other but the extreme caution which both evinced at first had prevented any warmth of engagement and allowed the spectators full leisure to interest themselves in the battle between Sporus and his foe But the Romans were now heated into full and fierce encounter they pushed returned advanced on retreated from each other with all that careful yet scarcely perceptible caution which characterizes men well experienced and equally matched But at this moment Eumolpus the elder gladiator by that dexterous back stroke which was considered in the arena so difficult to avoid had wounded Nepimus in the side The people shouted Lepidus turned pale Ho said Clodius the game is nearly over If Eumolpus fights now the quiet fight the other will gradually bleed himself away But thank the gods he does not fight the backward fight See he presses hard upon Nepimus By Mars but Nepimus had him there the helmet rang again Clodius I shall win Why do I ever bet but at the dice groaned Clodius to himself or why cannot one cog a gladiator A Sporus a Sporus shouted the populace as Niger having now suddenly paused had again cast his net and again unsuccessfully He had not retreated this time with sufficient agility the sword of Sporus had inflicted a severe wound upon his right leg and incapacitated to fly he was pressed hard by the fierce swordsman His great height and length of arm still continued however to give him no despicable advantages and steadily keeping his trident at the front of his foe he repelled him successfully for several minutes Sporus now tried by great rapidity of evolution to get round his antagonist who necessarily moved with pain and slowness In so doing he lost his caution he advanced too near to the giant raised his arm to strike and received the three points of the fatal spear full in his breast He sank on his knee In a moment more the deadly net was cast over him he struggled against its meshes in vain again again again he writhed mutely beneath the fresh strokes of the trident his blood flowed fast through the net and redly over the sand He lowered his arms in acknowledgment of defeat The conquering retiarius withdrew his net and leaning on his spear looked to the audience for their judgement Slowly too at the same moment the vanquished gladiator rolled his dim and despairing eyes around the theatre From row to row from bench to bench there glared upon him but merciless and unpitying eyes Hushed was the roar the murmur The silence was dread for it was no sympathy not a hand no not even a woman s hand gave the signal of charity and life Sporus had never been popular in the arena and lately the interest of the combat had been excited on behalf of the wounded Niger The people were warmed into blood the mimic fight had ceased to charm the interest had mounted up to the desire of sacrifice and the thirst of death The gladiator felt that his doom was sealed he uttered no prayer no groan The people gave the signal of death In dogged but agonized submission he bent his neck to receive the fatal stroke And now as the spear of the retiarius was not a weapon to inflict instant and certain death there stalked into the arena a grim and fatal form brandishing a short sharp sword and with features utterly concealed beneath its vizor With slow and measured steps this dismal headsman approached the gladiator still kneeling laid the left hand on his humbled crest drew the edge of the blade across his neck turned round to the assembly lest in the last moment remorse should come upon them the dread signal continued the same the blade glittered brightly in the air fell and the gladiator rolled upon the sand his limbs quivered were still he was a corpse His body was dragged at once from the arena through the gate of death and thrown into the gloomy den termed technically the spoliarium And ere it had well reached that destination the strife between the remaining combatants was decided The sword of Eumolpus had inflicted the death wound upon the less experienced combatant A new victim was added to the receptacle of the slain Throughout that mighty assembly there now ran a universal movement the people breathed more freely and resettled themselves in their seats A grateful shower was cast over every row from the concealed conduits In cool and luxurious pleasure they talked over the late spectacle of blood Eumolpus removed his helmet and wiped his brows his close curled hair and short beard his noble Roman features and bright dark eye attracted the general admiration He was fresh unwounded unfatigued The editor paused and proclaimed aloud that as Niger s wound disabled him from again entering the arena Lydon was to be the successor to the slaughtered Nepimus and the new combatant of Eumolpus Yet Lydon added he if thou wouldst decline the combat with one so brave and tried thou mayst have full liberty to do so Eumolpus is not the antagonist that was originally decreed for thee Thou knowest best how far thou canst cope with him If thou failest thy doom is honorable death if thou conquerest out of my own purse I will double the stipulated prize The people shouted applause Lydon stood in the lists he gazed around high above he beheld the pale face the straining eyes of his father He turned away irresolute for a moment No the conquest of the cestus was not sufficient he had not yet won the prize of victory his father was still a slave Noble aedile he replied in a firm and deep tone I shrink not from this combat For the honour of Pompeii I demand that one trained by its long celebrated lanista shall do battle with this Roman The people shouted louder than before Four to one against Lydon said Clodius to Lepidus I would not take twenty to one Why Eumolpus is a very Achilles and this poor fellow is but a tyro Eumolpus gazed hard on the face of Lydon he smiled yet the smile was followed by a slight and scarce audible sigh a touch of compassionate emotion which custom conquered the moment the heart acknowledged it And now both clad in complete armor the sword drawn the vizor closed the two last combatants of the arena ere man at least was matched with beast stood opposed to each other It was just at this time that a letter was delivered to the proctor by one of the attendants of the arena he removed the cincture glanced over it for a moment his countenance betrayed surprise and embarrassment He re read the letter and then muttering Tush it is impossible the man must be drunk even in the morning to dream of such follies threw it carelessly aside and gravely settled himself once more in the attitude of attention to the sports The interest of the public was wound up very high Eumolpus had at first won their favor but the gallantry of Lydon and his well timed allusion to the honour of the Pompeian lanista had afterwards given the latter the preference in their eyes Holla old fellow said Medon s neighbor to him Your son is hardly matched but never fear the editor will not permit him to be slain no nor the people neither he has behaved too bravely for that Ha that was a home thrust well averted by Pollux At him again Lydon they stop to breathe What art thou muttering old boy Prayers answered Medon with a more calm and hopeful mien than he had yet maintained Prayers trifles The time for gods to carry a man away in a cloud is gone now Ha Jupiter what a blow Thy side thy side take care of thy side Lydon There was a convulsive tremor throughout the assembly A fierce blow from Eumolpus full on the crest had brought Lydon to his knee Habet he has it cried a shrill female voice he has it It was the voice of the girl who had so anxiously anticipated the sacrifice of some criminal to the beasts Be silent child said the wife of Pansa haughtily Non habet he is not wounded I wish he were if only to spite old surly Medon muttered the girl Meanwhile Lydon who had hitherto defended himself with great skill and valor began to give way before the vigorous assaults of the practised Roman his arm grew tired his eye dizzy he breathed hard and painfully The combatants paused again for breath Young man said Eumolpus in a low voice desist I will wound thee slightly then lower thy arms thou hast propitiated the editor and the mob thou wilt be honorably saved And my father still enslaved groaned Lydon to himself No death or his freedom At that thought and seeing that his strength not being equal to the endurance of the Roman everything depended on a sudden and desperate effort he threw himself fiercely on Eumolpus the Roman warily retreated Lydon thrust again Eumolpus drew himself aside the sword grazed his cuirass Lydon s breast was exposed the Roman plunged his sword through the joints of the armor not meaning however to inflict a deep wound Lydon weak and exhausted fell forward fell right on the point it passed through and through even to the back Eumolpus drew forth his blade Lydon still made an effort to regain his balance his sword left his grasp he struck mechanically at the gladiator with his naked hand and fell prostrate on the arena With one accord editor and assembly made the signal of mercy the officers of the arena approached they took off the helmet of the vanquished He still breathed his eyes rolled fiercely on his foe the savageness he had acquired in his calling glared from his gaze and lowered upon the brow darkened already with the shades of death then with a convulsive groan with a half start he lifted his eyes above They rested not on the face of the editor nor on the pitying brows of his relenting judges He saw them not they were as if the vast space was desolate and bare one pale agonizing face alone was all he recognized one cry of a broken heart was all that amidst the murmurs and the shouts of the populace reached his ear The ferocity vanished from his brow a soft a tender expression of sanctifying but despairing love played over his features played waned darkened His face suddenly became locked and rigid resuming its former fierceness He fell upon the earth Look to him said the aedile he has done his duty The officers dragged him off to the spoliarium A true type of glory and of its fate murmured Arbaces to himself and his eye glancing round the amphitheatre betrayed so much of disdain and scorn that whoever encountered it felt his breath suddenly arrested and his emotions frozen into one sensation of abasement and of awe Again rich perfumes were wafted around the theatre the attendants sprinkled fresh sand over the arena Bring forth the lion and Glaucus the Athenian said the editor And a deep and breathless hush of overwrought interest and intense yet strange to say not unpleasing terror lay like a mighty and awful dream over the assembly Chapter III SALLUST AND NYDIA S LETTER THRICE had Sallust awakened from his morning sleep and thrice recollecting that his friend was that day to perish had he turned himself with a deep sigh once more to court oblivion His sole object in life was to avoid pain and where he could not avoid at least to forget it At length unable any longer to steep his consciousness in slumber he raised himself from his incumbent posture and discovered his favorite freedman sitting by his bedside as usual for Sallust who as I have said had a gentlemanlike taste for the polite letters was accustomed to be read to for an hour or so previous to his rising in the morning No books to day no more Tibullus no more Pindar for me Pindar alas alas the very name recalls those games to which our arena is the savage successor Has it begun the amphitheatre are its rites commenced Long since O Sallust Did you not hear the trumpets and the trampling feet Ay ay but the gods be thanked I was drowsy and had only to turn round to fall asleep again The gladiators must have been long in the ring The wretches None of my people have gone to the spectacle Assuredly not your orders were too strict That is well would the day were over What is that letter yonder on the table That Oh the letter brought to you last night when you were too too Drunk to read it I suppose No matter it cannot be of much importance Shall I open it for you Sallust Do anything to divert my thoughts Poor Glaucus The freedman opened the letter What Greek said he some learned lady I suppose He glanced over the letter and for some moments the irregular lines traced by the blind girl s hand puzzled him Suddenly however his countenance exhibited emotion and surprise Good gods noble Sallust what have we done not to attend to this before Hear me read Nydia the slave to Sallust the friend of Glaucus I am a prisoner in the house of Arbaces Hasten to the praetor procure my release and we shall yet save Glaucus from the lion There is another prisoner within these walls whose witness can exonerate the Athenian from the charge against him one who saw the crime who can prove the criminal in a villain hitherto unsuspected Fly hasten quick quick Bring with you armed men lest resistance be made and a cunning and dexterous smith for the dungeon of my fellow prisoner is thick and strong Oh by thy right hand and thy father s ashes lose not a moment Great Jove exclaimed Sallust starting and this day nay within this hour perhaps he dies What is to be done I will instantly to the praetor Nay not so The praetor as well as Pansa the editor himself is the creature of the mob and the mob will not hear of delay they will not be balked in the very moment of expectation Besides the publicity of the appeal would forewarn the cunning Egyptian It is evident that he has some interest in these concealments No fortunately thy slaves are in thy house I seize thy meaning interrupted Sallust arm the slaves instantly The streets are empty We will ourselves hasten to the house of Arbaces and release the prisoners Quick quick What ho Davus there My gown and sandals the papyrus and a reed I will write to the praetor to beseech him to delay the sentence of Glaucus for that within an hour we may yet prove him innocent So so that is well Hasten with this Davus to the praetor at the amphitheatre See it given to his own hand Now then O ye gods whose providence Epicurus denied befriend me and I will call Epicurus a liar Chapter IV THE AMPHITHEATRE ONCE MORE GLAUCUS and Olinthus had been placed together in that gloomy and narrow cell in which the criminals of the arena awaited their last and fearful struggle Their eyes of late accustomed to the darkness scanned the faces of each other in this awful hour and by that dim light the paleness which chased away the natural hues from either cheek assumed a yet more ashy and ghastly whiteness Yet their brows were erect and dauntless their limbs did not tremble their lips were compressed and rigid The religion of the one the pride of the other the conscious innocence of both and it may be the support derived from their mutual companionship elevated the victim into the hero Hark hearest thou that shout They are growling over their human blood said Olinthus I hear my heart grows sick but the gods support me The gods O rash young man in this hour recognize only the One God Have I not taught thee in the dungeon wept for thee prayed for thee in my zeal and in my agony have I not thought more of thy salvation than my own Brave friend answered Glaucus solemnly I have listened to thee with awe with wonder and with a secret tendency towards conviction Had our lives been spared I might gradually have weaned myself from the tenets of my own faith and inclined to thine but in this last hour it were a craven thing and a base to yield to hasty terror what should only be the result of lengthened meditation Were I to embrace thy creed and cast down my father s gods should I not be bribed by thy promise of heaven or awed by thy threats of hell Olinthus no Think we of each other with equal charity I honoring thy sincerity thou pitying my blindness or my obdurate courage As have been my deeds such will be my reward and the Power or Powers above will not judge harshly of human error when it is linked with honesty of purpose and truth of heart Speak we no more of this Hush Dost thou hear them drag yon heavy body through the passage Such as that clay will be ours soon O Heaven O Christ already I behold ye cried the fervent Olinthus lifting up his hands I tremble not I rejoice that the prison house shall be soon broken Glaucus bowed his head in silence He felt the distinction between his fortitude and that of his fellow sufferer The heathen did not tremble but the Christian exulted The door swung gratingly back the gleam of spears shot along the walls Glaucus the Athenian thy time has come said a loud and clear voice the lion awaits thee I am ready said the Athenian Brother and company mate one last embrace Bless me and farewell The Christian opened his arms he clasped the young heathen to his breast he kissed his forehead and cheek he sobbed aloud his tears flowed fast and hot over the features of his new friend Oh could I have converted thee I had not wept Oh that I might say to thee We two shall sup this night in Paradise It may be so yet answered the Greek with a tremulous voice They whom death part not may meet yet beyond the grave on the earth on the beautiful the beloved earth farewell for ever Worthy officer I attend you Glaucus tore himself away and when he came forth into the air its breath which though sunless was hot and arid smote witheringly upon him His frame not yet restored from the effects of the deadly draught shrank and trembled The officers supported him Courage said one thou art young active well knit They give thee a weapon despair not and thou mayst yet conquer Glaucus did not reply but ashamed of his infirmity he made a desperate and convulsive effort and regained the firmness of his nerves They anointed his body completely naked save by a cincture round the loins placed the stilus vain weapon in his hand and led him into the arena And now when the Greek saw the eyes of thousands and tens of thousands upon him he no longer felt that he was mortal All evidence of fear all fear itself was gone A red and haughty flush spread over the paleness of his features he towered aloft to the full of his glorious stature In the elastic beauty of his limbs and form in his intent but unfrowning brow in the high disdain and in the indomitable soul which breathed visibly which spoke audibly from his attitude his lip his eye he seemed the very incarnation vivid and corporeal of the valor of his land of the divinity of its worship at once a hero and a god The murmur of hatred and horror at his crime which had greeted his entrance died into the silence of involuntary admiration and half compassionate respect and with a quick and convulsive sigh that seemed to move the whole mass of life as if it were one body the gaze of the spectators turned from the Athenian to a dark uncouth object in the centre of the arena It was the grated den of the lion By Venus how warm it is said Fulvia yet there is no sun Would that those stupid sailors could have fastened up that gap in the awning Oh it is warm indeed I turn sick I faint said the wife of Pansa even her experienced stoicism giving way at the struggle about to take place The lion had been kept without food for twenty four hours and the animal had during the whole morning testified a singular and restless uneasiness which the keeper had attributed to the pangs of hunger Yet its bearing seemed rather that of fear than of rage its roar was painful and distressed it hung its head snuffed the air through the bars then lay down started again and again uttered its wild and far resounding cries And now in its den it lay utterly dumb and mute with distended nostrils forced hard against the grating and disturbing with a heaving breath the sand below on the arena The editor s lip quivered and his cheek grew pale he looked anxiously around hesitated delayed the crowd became impatient Slowly he gave the sign the keeper who was behind the den cautiously removed the grating and the lion leaped forth with a mighty and glad roar of release The keeper hastily retreated through the grated passage leading from the arena and left the lord of the forest and his prey Glaucus had bent his limbs so as to give himself the firmest posture at the expected rush of the lion with his small and shining weapon raised on high in the faint hope that one well directed thrust for he knew that he should have time but for one might penetrate through the eye to the brain of his grim foe But to the unutterable astonishment of all the beast seemed not even aware of the presence of the criminal At the first moment of its release it halted abruptly in the arena raised itself half on end snuffing the upward air with impatient sighs then suddenly it sprang forward but not on the Athenian At half speed it circled round and round the space turning its vast head from side to side with an anxious and perturbed gaze as if seeking only some avenue of escape once or twice it endeavored to leap up the parapet that divided it from the audience and on failing uttered rather a baffled howl than its deep toned and kingly roar It evinced no sign either of wrath or hunger its tail drooped along the sand instead of lashing its gaunt sides and its eye though it wandered at times to Glaucus rolled again listlessly from him At length as if tired of attempting to escape it crept with a moan into its cage and once more laid itself down to rest The first surprise of the assembly at the apathy of the lion soon grew converted into resentment at its cowardice and the populace already merged their pity for the fate of Glaucus into angry compassion for their own disappointment The editor called to the keeper How is this Take the goad prick him forth and then close the door of the den As the keeper with some fear but more astonishment was preparing to obey a loud cry was heard at one of the entrances of the arena there was a confusion a bustle voices of remonstrance suddenly breaking forth and suddenly silenced at the reply All eyes turned in wonder at the interruption towards the quarter of the disturbance the crowd gave way and suddenly Sallust appeared on the senatorial benches his hair disheveled breathless heated half exhausted He cast his eyes hastily round the ring Remove the Athenian he cried haste he is innocent Arrest Arbaces the Egyptian HE is the murderer of Apaecides Art thou mad O Sallust said the praetor rising from his seat What means this raving Remove the Athenian Quick or his blood be on your head Praetor delay and you answer with your own life to the emperor I bring with me the eye witness to the death of the priest Apaecides Room there stand back give way People of Pompeii fix every eye upon Arbaces there he sits Room there for the priest Calenus Pale haggard fresh from the jaws of famine and of death his face fallen his eyes dull as a vulture s his broad frame gaunt as a skeleton Calenus was supported into the very row in which Arbaces sat His releasers had given him sparingly of food but the chief sustenance that nerved his feeble limbs was revenge The priest Calenus Calenus cried the mob Is it he No it is a dead man It is the priest Calenus said the praetor gravely What hast thou to say Arbaces of Egypt is the murderer of Apaecides the priest of Isis these eyes saw him deal the blow It is from the dungeon into which he plunged me it is from the darkness and horror of a death by famine that the gods have raised me to proclaim his crime Release the Athenian he is innocent It is for this then that the lion spared him A miracle a miracle cried Pansa A miracle a miracle shouted the people remove the Athenian Arbaces to the lion And that shout echoed from hill to vale from coast to sea Arbaces to the lion Officers remove the accused Glaucus remove but guard him yet said the praetor The gods lavish their wonders upon this day As the praetor gave the word of release there was a cry of joy a female voice a child s voice and it was of joy It rang through the heart of the assembly with electric force it was touching it was holy that child s voice And the populace echoed it back with sympathizing congratulation Silence said the grave praetor who is there The blind girl Nydia answered Sallust it is her hand that has raised Calenus from the grave and delivered Glaucus from the lion Of this hereafter said the praetor Calenus priest of Isis thou accusest Arbaces of the murder of Apaecides I do Thou didst behold the deed Praetor with these eyes Enough at present the details must be reserved for more suiting time and place Arbaces of Egypt thou hearest the charge against thee thou hast not yet spoken what hast thou to say The gaze of the crowd had been long riveted on Arbaces but not until the confusion which he had betrayed at the first charge of Sallust and the entrance of Calenus had subsided At the shout Arbaces to the lion he had indeed trembled and the dark bronze of his cheek had taken a paler hue But he had soon recovered his haughtiness and self control Proudly he returned the angry glare of the countless eyes around him and replying now to the question of the praetor he said in that accent so peculiarly tranquil and commanding which characterized his tones Praetor this charge is so mad that it scarcely deserves reply My first accuser is the noble Sallust the most intimate friend of Glaucus my second is a priest I revere his garb and calling but people of Pompeii ye know somewhat of the character of Calenus he is griping and gold thirsty to a proverb the witness of such men is to be bought Praetor I am innocent Sallust said the magistrate where found you Calenus In the dungeons of Arbaces Egyptian said the praetor frowning thou didst then dare to imprison a priest of the gods and wherefore Hear me answered Arbaces rising calmly but with agitation visible in his face This man came to threaten that he would make against me the charge he has now made unless I would purchase his silence with half my fortune I remonstrated in vain Peace there let not the priest interrupt me Noble praetor and ye O people I was a stranger in the land I knew myself innocent of crime but the witness of a priest against me might yet destroy me In my perplexity I decoyed him to the cell whence he has been released on pretence that it was the coffer house of my gold I resolved to detain him there until the fate of the true criminal was sealed and his threats could avail no longer but I meant no worse I may have erred but who amongst ye will not acknowledge the equity of self preservation Were I guilty why was the witness of this priest silent at the trial then I had not detained or concealed him Why did he not proclaim my guilt when I proclaimed that of Glaucus Praetor this needs an answer For the rest I throw myself on your laws I demand their protection Remove hence the accused and the accuser I will willingly meet and cheerfully abide by the decision of the legitimate tribunal This is no place for further parley He says right said the praetor Ho guards remove Arbaces guard Calenus Sallust we hold you responsible for your accusation Let the sports be resumed What cried Calenus turning round to the people shall Isis be thus contemned Shall the blood of Apaecides yet cry for vengeance Shall justice be delayed now that it may be frustrated hereafter Shall the lion be cheated of his lawful prey A god a god I feel the god rush to my lips To the lion to the lion with Arbaces His exhausted frame could support no longer the ferocious malice of the priest he sank on the ground in strong convulsions the foam gathered to his mouth he was as a man indeed whom a supernatural power had entered The people saw and shuddered It is a god that inspires the holy man To the lion with the Egyptian With that cry up sprang on moved thousands upon thousands They rushed from the heights they poured down in the direction of the Egyptian In vain did the aedile command in vain did the praetor lift his voice and proclaim the law The people had been already rendered savage by the exhibition of blood they thirsted for more their superstition was aided by their ferocity Aroused inflamed by the spectacle of their victims they forgot the authority of their rulers It was one of those dread popular convulsions common to crowds wholly ignorant half free and half servile and which the peculiar constitution of the Roman provinces so frequently exhibited The power of the praetor was as a reed beneath the whirlwind still at his word the guards had drawn themselves along the lower benches on which the upper classes sat separate from the vulgar They made but a feeble barrier the waves of the human sea halted for a moment to enable Arbaces to count the exact moment of his doom In despair and in a terror which beat down even pride he glanced his eyes over the rolling and rushing crowd when right above them through the wide chasm which had been left in the velaria he beheld a strange and awful apparition he beheld and his craft restored his courage He stretched his hand on high over his lofty brow and royal features there came an expression of unutterable solemnity and command Behold he shouted with a voice of thunder which stilled the roar of the crowd behold how the gods protect the guiltless The fires of the avenging Orcus burst forth against the false witness of my accusers The eyes of the crowd followed the gesture of the Egyptian and beheld with ineffable dismay a vast vapor shooting from the summit of Vesuvius in the form of a gigantic pine tree the trunk blackness the branches fire a fire that shifted and wavered in its hues with every moment now fiercely luminous now of a dull and dying red that again blazed terrifically forth with intolerable glare There was a dead heart sunken silence through which there suddenly broke the roar of the lion which was echoed back from within the building by the sharper and fiercer yells of its fellow beast Dread seers were they of the Burden of the Atmosphere and wild prophets of the wrath to come Then there arose on high the universal shrieks of women the men stared at each other but were dumb At that moment they felt the earth shake beneath their feet the walls of the theatre trembled and beyond in the distance they heard the crash of falling roofs an instant more and the mountain cloud seemed to roll towards them dark and rapid like a torrent at the same time it cast forth from its bosom a shower of ashes mixed with vast fragments of burning stone Over the crushing vines over the desolate streets over the amphitheatre itself far and wide with many a mighty splash in the agitated sea fell that awful shower No longer thought the crowd of justice or of Arbaces safety for themselves was their sole thought Each turned to fly each dashing pressing crushing against the other Trampling recklessly over the fallen amidst groans and oaths and prayers and sudden shrieks the enormous crowd vomited itself forth through the numerous passages Whither should they fly Some anticipating a second earthquake hastened to their homes to load themselves with their more costly goods and escape while it was yet time others dreading the showers of ashes that now fell fast torrent upon torrent over the streets rushed under the roofs of the nearest houses or temples or sheds shelter of any kind for protection from the terrors of the open air But darker and larger and mightier spread the cloud above them It was a sudden and more ghastly Night rushing upon the realm of Noon Chapter V THE CELL OF THE PRISONER AND THE DEN OF THE DEAD GRIEF UNCONSCIOUS OF HORROR STUNNED by his reprieve doubting that he was awake Glaucus had been led by the officers of the arena into a small cell within the walls of the theatre They threw a loose robe over his form and crowded round in congratulation and wonder There was an impatient and fretful cry without the cell the throng gave way and the blind girl led by some gentler hand flung herself at the feet of Glaucus It is I who have saved thee she sobbed now let me die Nydia my child my preserver Oh let me feel thy touch thy breath Yes yes thou livest We are not too late That dread door methought it would never yield and Calenus oh his voice was as the dying wind among tombs we had to wait gods it seemed hours ere food and wine restored to him something of strength But thou livest thou livest yet And I I have saved thee This affecting scene was soon interrupted by the event just described The mountain the earthquake resounded from side to side The officers fled with the rest they left Glaucus and Nydia to save themselves as they might As the sense of the dangers around them flashed on the Athenian his generous heart recurred to Olinthus He too was reprieved from the tiger by the hand of the gods should he be left to a no less fatal death in the neighboring cell Taking Nydia by the hand Glaucus hurried across the passages he gained the den of the Christian He found Olinthus kneeling and in prayer Arise arise my friend he cried Save thyself and fly See Nature is thy dread deliverer He led forth the bewildered Christian and pointed to a cloud which advanced darker and darker disgorging forth showers of ashes and pumice stones and bade him hearken to the cries and trampling rush of the scattered crowd This is the hand of God God be praised said Olinthus devoutly Fly seek thy brethren Concert with them thy escape Farewell Olinthus did not answer neither did he mark the retreating form of his friend High thoughts and solemn absorbed his soul and in the enthusiasm of his kindling heart he exulted in the mercy of God rather than trembled at the evidence of His power At length he roused himself and hurried on he scarce knew whither The open doors of a dark desolate cell suddenly appeared on his path through the gloom within there flared and flickered a single lamp and by its light he saw three grim and naked forms stretched on the earth in death His feet were suddenly arrested for amidst the terror of that drear recess the spoliarium of the arena he heard a low voice calling on the name of Christ He could not resist lingering at that appeal he entered the den and his feet were dabbled in the slow streams of blood that gushed from the corpses over the sand Who said the Nazarene calls upon the son of God No answer came forth and turning round Olinthus beheld by the light of the lamp an old grey headed man sitting on the floor and supporting in his lap the head of one of the dead The features of the dead man were firmly and rigidly locked in the last sleep but over the lip there played a fierce smile not the Christian s smile of hope but the dark sneer of hatred and defiance Yet on the face still lingered the beautiful roundness of early youth The hair curled thick and glossy over the unwrinkled brow and the down of manhood but slightly shaded the marble of the hueless cheek And over this face bent one of such unutterable sadness of such yearning tenderness of such fond and such deep despair The tears of the old man fell fast and hot but he did not feel them and when his lips moved and he mechanically uttered the prayer of his benign and hopeful faith neither his heart nor his sense responded to the words it was but the involuntary emotion that broke from the lethargy of his mind His boy was dead and had died for him and the old man s heart was broken Medon said Olinthus pityingly arise and fly God is forth upon the wings of the elements The New Gomorrah is doomed Fly ere the fires consume thee He was ever so full of life he cannot be dead Come hither place your hand on his heart sure it beats yet Brother the soul has fled We will remember it in our prayers Thou canst not reanimate the dumb clay Come come hark while I speak yon crashing walls hark yon agonizing cries Not a moment is to be lost Come I hear nothing said Medon shaking his grey hair The poor boy his love murdered him Come come forgive this friendly force What Who could sever the father from the son And Medon clasped the body tightly in his embrace and covered it with passionate kisses Go said he lifting up his face for one moment Go we must be alone Alas said the compassionate Nazarene Death hath severed ye already The old man smiled very calmly No no no muttered his voice growing lower with each word Death has been more kind With that his head drooped on His son s breast his arms relaxed their grasp Olinthus caught him by the hand the pulse had ceased to beat The last words of the father were the words of truth Death had been more kind Meanwhile Glaucus and Nydia were pacing swiftly up the perilous and fearful streets The Athenian had learned from his preserver that Ione was yet in the house of Arbaces Thither he fled to release to save her The few slaves whom the Egyptian had left at his mansion when he had repaired in long procession to the amphitheatre had been able to offer no resistance to the armed band of Sallust and when afterwards the volcano broke forth they had huddled together stunned and frightened in the inmost recesses of the house Even the tall Ethiopian had forsaken his post at the door and Glaucus who left Nydia without the poor Nydia jealous once more even in such an hour passed on through the vast hall without meeting one from whom to learn the chamber of Ione Even as he passed however the darkness that covered the heavens increased so rapidly that it was with difficulty he could guide his steps The flower wreathed columns seemed to reel and tremble and with every instant he heard the ashes fall cranchingly into the roofless peristyle He ascended to the upper rooms breathless he paced along shouting out aloud the name of Ione and at length he heard at the end of a gallery a voice her voice in wondering reply To rush forward to shatter the door to seize Ione in his arms to hurry from the mansion seemed to him the work of an instant Scarce had he gained the spot where Nydia was than he heard steps advancing towards the house and recognized the voice of Arbaces who had returned to seek his wealth and Ione ere he fled from the doomed Pompeii But so dense was already the reeking atmosphere that the foes saw not each other though so near save that dimly in the gloom Glaucus caught the moving outline of the snowy robes of the Egyptian They hastened onward those three Alas whither They now saw not a step before them the blackness became utter They were encompassed with doubt and horror and the death he had escaped seemed to Glaucus only to have changed its form and augmented its victims Chapter VI CALENUS AND BURBO DIOMED AND CLODIUS THE GIRL OF THE AMPHITHEATRE AND JULIA THE sudden catastrophe which had as it were riven the very bonds of society and left prisoner and jailer alike free had soon rid Calenus of the guards to whose care the praetor had consigned him And when the darkness and the crowd separated the priest from his attendants he hastened with trembling steps towards the temple of his goddess As he crept along and ere the darkness was complete he felt himself suddenly caught by the robe and a voice muttered in his ear Hist Calenus an awful hour Ay by my father s head Who art thou thy face is dim and thy voice is strange Not know thy Burbo fie Gods how the darkness gathers Ho ho by yon terrific mountain what sudden blazes of lightning How they dart and quiver Hades is loosed on earth Tush thou believest not these things Calenus Now is the time to make our fortune Ha Listen Thy temple is full of gold and precious mummeries let us load ourselves with them and then hasten to the sea and embark None will ever ask an account of the doings of this day Burbo thou art right Hush and follow me into the temple Who cares now who sees now whether thou art a priest or not Follow and we will share In the precincts of the temple were many priests gathered around the altars praying weeping grovelling in the dust Impostors in safety they were not the less superstitious in danger Calenus passed them and entered the chamber yet to be seen in the south side of the court Burbo followed him the priest struck a light Wine and viands strewed the table the remains of a sacrificial feast A man who has hungered forty eight hours muttered Calenus has an appetite even in such a time He seized on the food and devoured it greedily Nothing could perhaps be more unnaturally horrid than the selfish baseness of these villains for there is nothing more loathsome than the valor of avarice Plunder and sacrilege while the pillars of the world tottered to and fro What an increase to the terrors of nature can be made by the vices of man Wilt thou never have done said Burbo impatiently thy face purples and thine eyes start already It is not every day one has such a right to be hungry Oh Jupiter what sound is that the hissing of fiery water What does the cloud give rain as well as flame Ha what shrieks And Burbo how silent all is now Look forth Amidst the other horrors the mighty mountain now cast up columns of boiling water Blent and kneaded with the half burning ashes the streams fell like seething mud over the streets in frequent intervals And full where the priests of Isis had now cowered around the altars on which they had vainly sought to kindle fires and pour incense one of the fiercest of those deadly torrents mingled with immense fragments of scoria had poured its rage Over the bended forms of the priests it dashed that cry had been of death that silence had been of eternity The ashes the pitchy streams sprinkled the altars covered the pavement and half concealed the quivering corpses of the priests They are dead said Burbo terrified for the first time and hurrying back into the cell I thought not the danger was so near and fatal The two wretches stood staring at each other you might have heard their hearts beat Calenus the less bold by nature but the more griping recovered first We must to our task and away he said in a low whisper frightened at his own voice He stepped to the threshold paused crossed over the heated floor and his dead brethren to the sacred chapel and called to Burbo to follow But the gladiator quaked and drew back So much the better thought Calenus the more will be my booty Hastily he loaded himself with the more portable treasures of the temple and thinking no more of his comrade hurried from the sacred place A sudden flash of lightning from the mount showed to Burbo who stood motionless at the threshold the flying and laden form of the priest He took heart he stepped forth to join him when a tremendous shower of ashes fell right before his feet The gladiator shrank back once more Darkness closed him in But the shower continued fast fast its heaps rose high and suffocatingly deathly vapors steamed from them The wretch gasped for breath he sought in despair again to fly the ashes had blocked up the threshold he shrieked as his feet shrank from the boiling fluid How could he escape he could not climb to the open space nay were he able he could not brave its horrors It were best to remain in the cells protected at least from the fatal air He sat down and clenched his teeth By degrees the atmosphere from without stifling and venomous crept into the chamber He could endure it no longer His eyes glaring round rested on a sacrificial axe which some priest had left in the chamber he seized it With the desperate strength of his gigantic arm he attempted to hew his way through the walls Meanwhile the streets were already thinned the crowd had hastened to disperse itself under shelter the ashes began to fill up the lower parts of the town but here and there you heard the steps of fugitives cranching them warily or saw their pale and haggard faces by the blue glare of the lightning or the more unsteady glare of torches by which they endeavored to steer their steps But ever and anon the boiling water or the straggling ashes mysterious and gusty winds rising and dying in a breath extinguished these wandering lights and with them the last living hope of those who bore them In the street that leads to the gate of Herculaneum Clodius now bent his perplexed and doubtful way If I can gain the open country thought he doubtless there will be various vehicles beyond the gate and Herculaneum is not far distant Thank Mercury I have little to lose and that little is about me Holla help there help cried a querulous and frightened voice I have fallen down my torch has gone out my slaves have deserted me I am Diomed the rich Diomed ten thousand sesterces to him who helps me At the same moment Clodius felt himself caught by the feet Ill fortune to thee let me go fool said the gambler Oh help me up give me thy hand There rise Is this Clodius I know the voice Whither fliest thou Towards Herculaneum Blessed be the gods our way is the same then as far as the gate Why not take refuge in my villa Thou knowest the long range of subterranean cellars beneath the basement that shelter what shower can penetrate You speak well said Clodius musingly And by storing the cellar with food we can remain there even some days should these wondrous storms endure so long Oh blessed be he who invented gates to a city cried Diomed See they have placed a light within yon arch by that let us guide our steps The air was now still for a few minutes the lamp from the gate streamed out far and clear the fugitives hurried on they gained the gate they passed by the Roman sentry the lightning flashed over his livid face and polished helmet but his stern features were composed even in their awe He remained erect and motionless at his post That hour itself had not animated the machine of the ruthless majesty of Rome into the reasoning and self acting man There he stood amidst the crashing elements he had not received the permission to desert his station and escape Diomed and his companion hurried on when suddenly a female form rushed athwart their way It was the girl whose ominous voice had been raised so often and so gladly in anticipation of the merry show Oh Diomed she cried shelter shelter See pointing to an infant clasped to her breast see this little one it is mine the child of shame I have never owned it till this hour But now I remember I am a mother I have plucked it from the cradle of its nurse she had fled Who could think of the babe in such an hour but she who bore it Save it save it Curses on thy shrill voice Away harlot muttered Clodius between his ground teeth Nay girl said the more humane Diomed follow if thou wilt This way this way to the vaults They hurried on they arrived at the house of Diomed they laughed aloud as they crossed the threshold for they deemed the danger over Diomed ordered his slaves to carry down into the subterranean gallery before described a profusion of food and oil for lights and there Julia Clodius the mother and her babe the greater part of the slaves and some frightened visitors and clients of the neighborhood sought their shelter Chapter VII

none	none	 so that to the eyes and fancies of the affrighted wanderers 
2297-8377-0007	train-other-500	the unsubstantial vapors were as the bodily forms of gigantic foes the agents of terror and of death The ashes in many places were already knee deep and the boiling showers which came from the steaming breath of the volcano
2297-8377-0008	train-other-500	forced their way into the houses bearing with them a strong and suffocating vapor In some places immense fragments of rock hurled upon the house roofs bore down along the streets masses of confused ruin
2297-8377-0009	train-other-500	which yet more and more with every hour obstructed the way and as the day advanced the motion of the earth was more sensibly felt the footing seemed to slide and creep nor could chariot or litter be kept steady even on the most level ground
2297-8377-0010	train-other-500	Sometimes the huger stones striking against each other as they fell broke into countless fragments emitting sparks of fire which caught whatever was combustible within their reach and along the plains beyond the city
2297-8377-0011	train-other-500	the darkness was now terribly relieved for several houses and even vineyards had been set on flames and at various intervals the fires rose suddenly and fiercely against the solid gloom
2297-8377-0012	train-other-500	To add to this partial relief of the darkness the citizens had here and there in the more public places such as the porticoes of temples and the entrances to the forum endeavored to place rows of torches
2297-8377-0013	train-other-500	but these rarely continued long the showers and the winds extinguished them and the sudden darkness into which their sudden birth was converted had something in it doubly terrible and doubly impressing on the impotence of human hopes

2297-8377-0016	train-other-500	Wild haggard ghastly with supernatural fears these groups encountered each other but without the leisure to speak to consult to advise for the showers fell now frequently though not continuously

2297-8377-0018	train-other-500	by the flickering lights you saw the thief hastening by the most solemn authorities of the law laden with and fearfully chuckling over the produce of his sudden gains If in the darkness wife was separated from husband

2297-8377-0020	train-other-500	save the primal law of self preservation Through this awful scene did the Athenian wade his way accompanied by Ione and the blind girl Suddenly a rush of hundreds in their path to the sea swept by them
2297-8377-0021	train-other-500	Nydia was torn from the side of Glaucus who with Ione was borne rapidly onward and when the crowd whose forms they saw not so thick was the gloom were gone Nydia was still separated from their side
2297-8377-0022	train-other-500	Glaucus shouted her name No answer came They retraced their steps in vain they could not discover her
2297-8377-0023	train-other-500	it was evident she had been swept along some opposite direction by the human current Their friend their preserver was lost And hitherto Nydia had been their guide
2297-8377-0024	train-other-500	Her blindness rendered the scene familiar to her alone Accustomed through a perpetual night to thread the windings of the city she had led them unerringly towards the sea shore by which they had resolved to hazard an escape
2297-8377-0025	train-other-500	Now which way could they wend all was rayless to them a maze without a clue Wearied despondent bewildered they however passed along the ashes falling upon their heads

none	none	 and leaned over her that he might shield her with his own form 
2297-8377-0031	train-other-500	from the lightning and the showers The beauty and the unselfishness of love could hallow even that dismal time Who is there said the trembling and hollow voice of one who had preceded them

2297-8377-0033	train-other-500	Ione turned at the sound of the voice and with a faint shriek cowered again beneath the arms of Glaucus and he looking in the direction of the voice beheld the cause of her alarm
2297-8377-0034	train-other-500	Through the darkness glared forth two burning eyes the lightning flashed and lingered athwart the temple and Glaucus with a shudder perceived the lion to which he had been doomed couched beneath the pillars and close beside it

2297-8377-0038	train-other-500	a group of men and women bearing torches passed by the temple
none	none	 They were of the congregation of the Nazarenes 
2297-8377-0039	train-other-500	and a sublime and unearthly emotion had not indeed quelled their awe but it had robbed awe of fear They had long believed according to the error of the early Christians that the Last Day was at hand

none	none	 Woe woe cried in a shrill and piercing voice the elder at their head

2297-8377-0043	train-other-500	The Nazarenes paced slowly on their torches still flickering in the storm their voices still raised in menace and solemn warning till lost amid the windings in the streets the darkness of the atmosphere
2297-8377-0044	train-other-500	and the silence of death again fell over the scene There was one of the frequent pauses in the showers and Glaucus encouraged Ione once more to proceed Just as they stood hesitating on the last step of the portico
2297-8377-0045	train-other-500	an old man with a bag in his right hand and leaning upon a youth tottered by The youth bore a torch Glaucus recognized the two as father and son miser and prodigal Father said the youth

2297-8377-0048	train-other-500	and fled onward with a shrill yell
none	none	 Ye gods cried Glaucus are ye blind then even in the dark Such crimes may well confound the guiltless with the guilty in one common ruin Ione on on Chapter VIII ARBACES ENCOUNTERS GLAUCUS AND IONE ADVANCING as men grope for escape in a dungeon Ione and her lover continued their uncertain way At the moments when the volcanic lightnings lingered over the streets they were enabled by that awful light to steer and guide their progress yet little did the view it presented to them cheer or encourage their path In parts where the ashes lay dry and uncommixed with the boiling torrents cast upward from the mountain at capricious intervals the surface of the earth presented a leprous and ghastly white In other places cinder and rock lay matted in heaps from beneath which emerged the half hid limbs of some crushed and mangled fugitive The groans of the dying were broken by wild shrieks of women s terror now near now distant which when heard in the utter darkness were rendered doubly appalling by the crushing sense of helplessness and the uncertainty of the perils around and clear and distinct through all were the mighty and various noises from the Fatal Mountain its rushing winds its whirling torrents and from time to time the burst and roar of some more fiery and fierce explosion And ever as the winds swept howling along the street they bore sharp streams of burning dust and such sickening and poisonous vapors as took away for the instant breath and consciousness followed by a rapid revulsion of the arrested blood and a tingling sensation of agony trembling through every nerve and fibre of the frame Oh Glaucus my beloved my own take me to thy arms One embrace let me feel thy arms around me and in that embrace let me die I can no more For my sake for my life courage yet sweet Ione my life is linked with thine and see torches this way Lo how they brave the Wind Ha they live through the storm doubtless fugitives to the sea we will join them As if to aid and reanimate the lovers the winds and showers came to a sudden pause the atmosphere was profoundly still the mountain seemed at rest gathering perhaps fresh fury for its next burst the torch bearers moved quickly on We are nearing the sea said in a calm voice the person at their head Liberty and wealth to each slave who survives this day Courage I tell you that the gods themselves have assured me of deliverance On Redly and steadily the torches flashed full on the eyes of Glaucus and Ione who lay trembling and exhausted on his bosom Several slaves were bearing by the light panniers and coffers heavily laden in front of them a drawn sword in his hand towered the lofty form of Arbaces By my fathers cried the Egyptian Fate smiles upon me even through these horrors and amidst the dreadest aspects of woe and death bodes me happiness and love Away Greek I claim my ward Ione Traitor and murderer cried Glaucus glaring upon his foe Nemesis hath guided thee to my revenge a just sacrifice to the shades of Hades that now seem loosed on earth Approach touch but the hand of Ione and thy weapon shall be as a reed I will tear thee limb from limb Suddenly as he spoke the place became lighted with an intense and lurid glow Bright and gigantic through the darkness which closed around it like the walls of hell the mountain shone a pile of fire Its summit seemed riven in two or rather above its surface there seemed to rise two monster shapes each confronting each as Demons contending for a world These were of one deep blood red hue of fire which lighted up the whole atmosphere far and wide but below the nether part of the mountain was still dark and shrouded save in three places adown which flowed serpentine and irregular rivers of the molten lava Darkly red through the profound gloom of their banks they flowed slowly on as towards the devoted city Over the broadest there seemed to spring a cragged and stupendous arch from which as from the jaws of hell gushed the sources of the sudden Phlegethon And through the stilled air was heard the rattling of the fragments of rock hurtling one upon another as they were borne down the fiery cataracts darkening for one instant the spot where they fell and suffused the next in the burnished hues of the flood along which they floated The slaves shrieked aloud and cowering hid their faces The Egyptian himself stood transfixed to the spot the glow lighting up his commanding features and jewelled robes High behind him rose a tall column that supported the bronze statue of Augustus and the imperial image seemed changed to a shape of fire With his left hand circled round the form of Ione with his right arm raised in menace and grasping the stilus which was to have been his weapon in the arena and which he still fortunately bore about him with his brow knit his lips apart the wrath and menace of human passions arrested as by a charm upon his features Glaucus fronted the Egyptian Arbaces turned his eyes from the mountain they rested on the form of Glaucus He paused a moment Why he muttered should I hesitate Did not the stars foretell the only crisis of imminent peril to which I was subjected Is not that peril past The soul cried he aloud can brave the wreck of worlds and the wrath of imaginary gods By that soul will I conquer to the last Advance slaves Athenian resist me and thy blood be on thine own head Thus then I regain Ione He advanced one step it was his last on earth The ground shook beneath him with a convulsion that cast all around upon its surface A simultaneous crash resounded through the city as down toppled many a roof and pillar the lightning as if caught by the metal lingered an instant on the Imperial Statue then shivered bronze and column Down fell the ruin echoing along the street and riving the solid pavement where it crashed The prophecy of the stars was fulfilled The sound the shock stunned the Athenian for several moments When he recovered the light still illuminated the scene the earth still slid and trembled beneath Ione lay senseless on the ground but he saw her not yet his eyes were fixed upon a ghastly face that seemed to emerge without limbs or trunk from the huge fragments of the shattered column a face of unutterable pain agony and despair The eyes shut and opened rapidly as if sense were not yet fled the lips quivered and grinned then sudden stillness and darkness fell over the features yet retaining that aspect of horror never to be forgotten So perished the wise Magician the great Arbaces the Hermes of the Burning Belt the last of the royalty of Egypt Chapter IX THE DESPAIR OF THE LOVERS THE CONDITION OF THE MULTITUDE GLAUCUS turned in gratitude but in awe caught Ione once more in his arms and fled along the street that was yet intensely luminous But suddenly a duller shade fell over the air Instinctively he turned to the mountain and beheld one of the two gigantic crests into which the summit had been divided rocked and wavered to and fro and then with a sound the mightiness of which no language can describe it fell from its burning base and rushed an avalanche of fire down the sides of the mountain At the same instant gushed forth a volume of blackest smoke rolling on over air sea and earth Another and another and another shower of ashes far more profuse than before scattered fresh desolation along the streets Darkness once more wrapped them as a veil and Glaucus his bold heart at last quelled and despairing sank beneath the cover of an arch and clasping Ione to his heart a bride on that couch of ruin resigned himself to die Meanwhile Nydia when separated by the throng from Glaucus and Ione had in vain endeavored to regain them In vain she raised that plaintive cry so peculiar to the blind it was lost amidst a thousand shrieks of more selfish terror Again and again she returned to the spot where they had been divided to find her companions gone to seize every fugitive to inquire of Glaucus to be dashed aside in the impatience of distraction Who in that hour spared one thought to his neighbor Perhaps in scenes of universal horror nothing is more horrid than the unnatural selfishness they engender At length it occurred to Nydia that as it had been resolved to seek the sea shore for escape her most probable chance of rejoining her companions would be to persevere in that direction Guiding her steps then by the staff which she always carried she continued with incredible dexterity to avoid the masses of ruin that encumbered the path to thread the streets and unerringly so blessed now was that accustomed darkness so afflicting in ordinary life to take the nearest direction to the sea side Poor girl her courage was beautiful to behold and Fate seemed to favor one so helpless The boiling torrents touched her not save by the general rain which accompanied them the huge fragments of scoria shivered the pavement before and beside her but spared that frail form and when the lesser ashes fell over her she shook them away with a slight tremor and dauntlessly resumed her course Weak exposed yet fearless supported but by one wish she was a very emblem of Psyche in her wanderings of Hope walking through the Valley of the Shadow of the Soul itself lone but undaunted amidst the dangers and the snares of life Her path was however constantly impeded by the crowds that now groped amidst the gloom now fled in the temporary glare of the lightnings across the scene and at length a group of torch bearers rushing full against her she was thrown down with some violence What said the voice of one of the party is this the brave blind girl By Bacchus she must not be left here to die Up my Thessalian So so Are you hurt That s well Come along with us we are for the shore O Sallust it is thy voice The gods be thanked Glaucus Glaucus Glaucus have ye seen him Not I He is doubtless out of the city by this time The gods who saved him from the lion will save him from the burning mountain As the kindly epicure thus encouraged Nydia he drew her along with him towards the sea heeding not her passionate entreaties that he would linger yet awhile to search for Glaucus and still in the accent of despair she continued to shriek out that beloved name which amidst all the roar of the convulsed elements kept alive a music at her heart The sudden illumination the bursts of the floods of lava and the earthquake which we have already described chanced when Sallust and his party had just gained the direct path leading from the city to the port and here they were arrested by an immense crowd more than half the population of the city They spread along the field without the walls thousands upon thousands uncertain whither to fly The sea had retired far from the shore and they who had fled to it had been so terrified by the agitation and preternatural shrinking of the element the gasping forms of the uncouth sea things which the waves had left upon the sand and by the sound of the huge stones cast from the mountain into the deep that they had returned again to the land as presenting the less frightful aspect of the two Thus the two streams of human beings the one seaward the other from the sea had met together feeling a sad comfort in numbers arrested in despair and doubt The world is to be destroyed by fire said an old man in long loose robes a philosopher of the Stoic school Stoic and Epicurean wisdom have alike agreed in this prediction and the hour is come Yea the hour is come cried a loud voice solemn but not fearful Those around turned in dismay The voice came from above them It was the voice of Olinthus who surrounded by his Christian friends stood upon an abrupt eminence on which the old Greek colonists had raised a temple to Apollo now timeworn and half in ruin As he spoke there came that sudden illumination which had heralded the death of Arbaces and glowing over that mighty multitude awed crouching breathless never on earth had the faces of men seemed so haggard never had meeting of mortal beings been so stamped with the horror and sublimity of dread never till the last trumpet sounds shall such meeting be seen again And above those the form of Olinthus with outstretched arm and prophet brow girt with the living fires And the crowd knew the face of him they had doomed to the fangs of the beast then their victim now their warner and through the stillness again came his ominous voice The hour is come The Christians repeated the cry It was caught up it was echoed from side to side woman and man childhood and old age repeated not aloud but in a smothered and dreary murmur THE HOUR IS COME At that moment a wild yell burst through the air and thinking only of escape whither it knew not the terrible tiger of the desert leaped amongst the throng and hurried through its parted streams And so came the earthquake and so darkness once more fell over the earth And now new fugitives arrived Grasping the treasures no longer destined for their lord the slaves of Arbaces joined the throng One only of all their torches yet flickered on It was borne by Sosia and its light falling on the face of Nydia he recognized the Thessalian What avails thy liberty now blind girl said the slave Who art thou canst thou tell me of Glaucus Ay I saw him but a few minutes since Blessed be thy head where Crouched beneath the arch of the forum dead or dying gone to rejoin Arbaces who is no more Nydia uttered not a word she slid from the side of Sallust silently she glided through those behind her and retraced her steps to the city She gained the forum the arch she stooped down she felt around she called on the name of Glaucus A weak voice answered Who calls on me Is it the voice of the Shades Lo I am prepared Arise follow me Take my hand Glaucus thou shalt be saved In wonder and sudden hope Glaucus arose Nydia still Ah thou then art safe The tender joy of his voice pierced the heart of the poor Thessalian and she blessed him for his thought of her Half leading half carrying Ione Glaucus followed his guide With admirable discretion she avoided the path which led to the crowd she had just quitted and by another route sought the shore After many pauses and incredible perseverance they gained the sea and joined a group who bolder than the rest resolved to hazard any peril rather than continue in such a scene In darkness they put forth to sea but as they cleared the land and caught new aspects of the mountain its channels of molten fire threw a partial redness over the waves Utterly exhausted and worn out Ione slept on the breast of Glaucus and Nydia lay at his feet Meanwhile the showers of dust and ashes still borne aloft fell into the wave and scattered their snows over the deck Far and wide borne by the winds those showers descended upon the remotest climes startling even the swarthy African and whirled along the antique soil of Syria and of Egypt Dion Cassius Chapter X THE NEXT MORNING THE FATE OF NYDIA AND meekly softly beautifully dawned at last the light over the trembling deep the winds were sinking into rest the foam died from the glowing azure of that delicious sea Around the east thin mists caught gradually the rosy hues that heralded the morning Light was about to resume her reign Yet still dark and massive in the distance lay the broken fragments of the destroying cloud from which red streaks burning dimlier and more dim betrayed the yet rolling fires of the mountain of the Scorched Fields The white walls and gleaming columns that had adorned the lovely coasts were no more Sullen and dull were the shores so lately crested by the cities of Herculaneum and Pompeii The darlings of the deep were snatched from her embrace Century after century shall the mighty Mother stretch forth her azure arms and know them not moaning round the sepulchres of the Lost There was no shout from the mariners at the dawning light it had come too gradually and they were too wearied for such sudden bursts of joy but there was a low deep murmur of thankfulness amidst those watchers of the long night They looked at each other and smiled they took heart they felt once more that there was a world around and a God above them And in the feeling that the worst was passed the overwearied ones turned round and fell placidly to sleep In the growing light of the skies there came the silence which night had wanted and the bark drifted calmly onward to its port A few other vessels bearing similar fugitives might be seen in the expanse apparently motionless yet gliding also on There was a sense of security of companionship and of hope in the sight of their slender masts and white sails What beloved friends lost and missed in the gloom might they not bear to safety and to shelter In the silence of the general sleep Nydia rose gently She bent over the face of Glaucus she inhaled the deep breath of his heavy slumber timidly and sadly she kissed his brow his lips she felt for his hand it was locked in that of Ione she sighed deeply and her face darkened Again she kissed his brow and with her hair wiped from it the damps of night May the gods bless you Athenian she murmured may you be happy with your beloved one may you sometimes remember Nydia Alas she is of no further use on earth With these words she turned away Slowly she crept along by the fori or platforms to the farther side of the vessel and pausing bent low over the deep the cool spray dashed upward on her feverish brow It is the kiss of death she said it is welcome The balmy air played through her waving tresses she put them from her face and raised those eyes so tender though so lightless to the sky whose soft face she had never seen No no she said half aloud and in a musing and thoughtful tone I cannot endure it this jealous exacting love it shatters my whole soul in madness I might harm him again wretch that I was I have saved him twice saved him happy happy thought why not die happy it is the last glad thought I can ever know Oh sacred Sea I hear thy voice invitingly it hath a freshening and joyous call They say that in thy embrace is dishonour that thy victims cross not the fatal Styx be it so I would not meet him in the Shades for I should meet him still with her Rest rest rest there is no other Elysium for a heart like mine A sailor half dozing on the deck heard a slight splash on the waters Drowsily he looked up and behind as the vessel merrily bounded on he fancied he saw something white above the waves but it vanished in an instant He turned round again and dreamed of his home and children When the lovers awoke their first thought was of each other their next of Nydia She was not to be found none had seen her since the night Every crevice of the vessel was searched there was no trace of her Mysterious from first to last the blind Thessalian had vanished for ever from the living world They guessed her fate in silence and Glaucus and Ione while they drew nearer to each other feeling each other the world itself forgot their deliverance and wept as for a departed sister Chapter The Last WHEREIN ALL THINGS CEASE LETTER FROM GLAUCUS TO SALLUST TEN YEARS AFTER THE DESTRUCTION OF POMPEII Athens GLAUCUS to his beloved Sallust greeting and health You request me to visit you at Rome no Sallust come rather to me at Athens I have forsworn the Imperial City its mighty tumult and hollow joys In my own land henceforth I dwell for ever The ghost of our departed greatness is dearer to me than the gaudy life of your loud prosperity There is a charm to me which no other spot can supply in the porticoes hallowed still by holy and venerable shades In the olive groves of Ilyssus I still hear the voice of poetry on the heights of Phyle the clouds of twilight seem yet the shrouds of departed freedom the heralds the heralds of the morrow that shall come You smile at my enthusiasm Sallust better be hopeful in chains than resigned to their glitter You tell me you are sure that I cannot enjoy life in these melancholy haunts of a fallen majesty You dwell with rapture on the Roman splendors and the luxuries of the imperial court My Sallust non sum qualis eram I am not what I was The events of my life have sobered the bounding blood of my youth My health has never quite recovered its wonted elasticity ere it felt the pangs of disease and languished in the damps of a criminal s dungeon My mind has never shaken off the dark shadow of the Last Day of Pompeii the horror and the desolation of that awful ruin Our beloved our remembered Nydia I have reared a tomb to her shade and I see it every day from the window of my study It keeps alive in me a tender recollection a not unpleasing sadness which are but a fitting homage to her fidelity and the mysteriousness of her early death Ione gathers the flowers but my own hand wreathes them daily around the tomb She was worthy of a tomb in Athens You speak of the growing sect of the Christians in Rome Sallust to you I may confide my secret I have pondered much over that faith I have adopted it After the destruction of Pompeii I met once more with Olinthus saved alas only for a day and falling afterwards a martyr to the indomitable energy of his zeal In my preservation from the lion and the earthquake he taught me to behold the hand of the unknown God I listened believed adored My own my more than ever beloved Ione has also embraced the creed a creed Sallust which shedding light over this world gathers its concentrated glory like a sunset over the next We know that we are united in the soul as in the flesh for ever and for ever Ages may roll on our very dust be dissolved the earth shrivelled like a scroll but round and round the circle of eternity rolls the wheel of life imperishable unceasing And as the earth from the sun so immortality drinks happiness from virtue which is the smile upon the face of God Visit me then Sallust bring with you the learned scrolls of Epicurus Pythagoras Diogenes arm yourself for defeat and let us amidst the groves of Academus dispute under a surer guide than any granted to our fathers on the mighty problem of the true ends of life and the nature of the soul Ione at that name my heart yet beats Ione is by my side as I write I lift my eyes and meet her smile The sunlight quivers over Hymettus and along my garden I hear the hum of the summer bees Am I happy ask you Oh what can Rome give me equal to what I possess at Athens Here everything awakens the soul and inspires the affections the trees the waters the hills the skies are those of Athens fair though mourning mother of the Poetry and the Wisdom of the World In my hall I see the marble faces of my ancestors In the Ceramicus I survey their tombs In the streets I behold the hand of Phidias and the soul of Pericles Harmodius Aristogiton they are everywhere but in our hearts in mine at least they shall not perish If anything can make me forget that I am an Athenian and not free it is partly the soothing the love watchful vivid sleepless of Ione a love that has taken a new sentiment in our new creed a love which none of our poets beautiful though they be had shadowed forth in description for mingled with religion it partakes of religion it is blended with pure and unworldly thoughts it is that which we may hope to carry through eternity and keep therefore white and unsullied that we may not blush to confess it to our God This is the true type of the dark fable of our Grecian Eros and Psyche it is in truth the soul asleep in the arms of love And if this our love support me partly against the fever of the desire for freedom my religion supports me more for whenever I would grasp the sword and sound the shell and rush to a new Marathon but Marathon without victory I feel my despair at the chilling thought of my country s impotence the crushing weight of the Roman yoke comforted at least by the thought that earth is but the beginning of life that the glory of a few years matters little in the vast space of eternity that there is no perfect freedom till the chains of clay fall from the soul and all space all time become its heritage and domain Yet Sallust some mixture of the soft Greek blood still mingles with my faith I can share not the zeal of those who see crime and eternal wrath in men who cannot believe as they I shudder not at the creed of others I dare not curse them I pray the Great Father to convert This lukewarmness exposes me to some suspicion amongst the Christians but I forgive it and not offending openly the prejudices of the crowd I am thus enabled to protect my brethren from the danger of the law and the consequences of their own zeal If moderation seem to me the natural creature of benevolence it gives also the greatest scope to beneficence Such then O Sallust is my life such my opinions In this manner I greet existence and await death And thou glad hearted and kindly pupil of Epicurus thou But come hither and see what enjoyments what hopes are ours and not the splendor of imperial banquets nor the shouts of the crowded circus nor the noisy forum nor the glittering theatre nor the luxuriant gardens nor the voluptuous baths of Rome shall seem to thee to constitute a life of more vivid and uninterrupted happiness than that which thou so unreasonably pitiest as the career of Glaucus the Athenian Farewell Nearly Seventeen Centuries had rolled away when the City of Pompeii was disinterred from its silent tomb all vivid with undimmed hues its walls fresh as if painted yesterday not a hue faded on the rich mosaic of its floors in its forum the half finished columns as left by the workman s hand in its gardens the sacrificial tripod in its halls the chest of treasure in its baths the strigil in its theatres the counter of admission in its saloons the furniture and the lamp in its triclinia the fragments of the last feast in its cubicula the perfumes and the rouge of faded beauty and everywhere the bones and skeletons of those who once moved the springs of that minute yet gorgeous machine of luxury and of life In the house of Diomed in the subterranean vaults twenty skeletons one of a babe were discovered in one spot by the door covered by a fine ashen dust that had evidently been wafted slowly through the apertures until it had filled the whole space There were jewels and coins candelabra for unavailing light and wine hardened in the amphorae for a prolongation of agonized life The sand consolidated by damps had taken the forms of the skeletons as in a cast and the traveler may yet see the impression of a female neck and bosom of young and round proportions the trace of the fated Julia It seems to the inquirer as if the air had been gradually changed into a sulphurous vapor the inmates of the vaults had rushed to the door to find it closed and blocked up by the scoria without and in their attempts to force it had been suffocated with the atmosphere In the garden was found a skeleton with a key by its bony hand and near it a bag of coins This is believed to have been the master of the house the unfortunate Diomed who had probably sought to escape by the garden and been destroyed either by the vapors or some fragment of stone Beside some silver vases lay another skeleton probably of a slave The houses of Sallust and of Pansa the Temple of Isis with the juggling concealments behind the statues the lurking place of its holy oracles are now bared to the gaze of the curious In one of the chambers of that temple was found a huge skeleton with an axe beside it two walls had been pierced by the axe the victim could penetrate no farther In the midst of the city was found another skeleton by the side of which was a heap of coins and many of the mystic ornaments of the fane of Isis Death had fallen upon him in his avarice and Calenus perished simultaneously with Burbo As the excavators cleared on through the mass of ruin they found the skeleton of a man literally severed in two by a prostrate column the skull was of so striking a conformation so boldly marked in its intellectual as well as its worse physical developments that it has excited the constant speculation of every itinerant believer in the theories of Spurzheim who has gazed upon that ruined palace of the mind Still after the lapse of ages the traveler may survey that airy hall within whose cunning galleries and elaborate chambers once thought reasoned dreamed and sinned the soul of Arbaces the Egyptian Viewing the various witnesses of a social system which has passed from the world for ever a stranger from that remote and barbarian Isle which the Imperial Roman shivered when he named paused amidst the delights of the
