28_12332_000007_000000	train-clean-360	On the day when I found myself with twopence in my pocket I naturally made up my mind to go round the world 
28_12332_000022_000003	train-clean-360	when 
none	none	I found myself with twopence in my pocket I naturally made up my mind to go round the world 
28_12332_000008_000000	train-clean-360	It was my stepfather s death that drove me to it 
28_12332_000008_000001	train-clean-360	I had never seen my stepfather 
none	none	Indeed I never even thought of him as anything more than Colonel Watts Morgan 
28_12332_000008_000003	train-clean-360	I owed him nothing except my poverty 
28_12332_000008_000004	train-clean-360	He married my dear mother when I was a girl at school in Switzerland and he proceeded to spend her little fortune left at her sole disposal by my father s will in paying his gambling debts 
none	none	After that he carried my dear mother off to Burma and when he and the climate between them had succeeded in killing her he made up for his appropriations at the cheapest rate by allowing me just enough to send me to Girton 
28_12332_000008_000006	train-clean-360	So when the Colonel died in the year I was leaving college I did not think it necessary to go into mourning for him 
28_12332_000008_000007	train-clean-360	Especially as he chose the precise moment when my allowance was due and bequeathed me nothing but his consolidated liabilities 
28_12332_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 Of course you will teach said Elsie Petheridge when I explained my affairs to her 
none	none	There is a good demand just now for high school teachers 
28_12332_000010_000000	train-clean-360	I looked at her aghast 
none	none	Teach Elsie I cried I had come up to town to settle her in at her unfurnished lodgings Did you say teach 
28_12332_000010_000003	train-clean-360	That s just like you dear good schoolmistresses 
28_12332_000010_000004	train-clean-360	You go to Cambridge and get examined till the heart and life have been examined out of you then you say to yourselves at the end of it all Let me see what am I good for now 
none	none	I m just about fit to go away and examine other people That s what our Principal would call a vicious circle if one could ever admit there was anything vicious at all about you dear No Elsie I do not propose to teach 
28_12332_000010_000007	train-clean-360	Nature did not cut me out for a high school teacher 
28_12332_000010_000008	train-clean-360	I couldn t swallow a poker if I tried for weeks 
28_12332_000010_000009	train-clean-360	Pokers don t agree with me 
28_12332_000010_000010	train-clean-360	Between ourselves I am a bit of a rebel 
28_12332_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 You are Brownie she answered pausing in her papering with her sleeves rolled up they called me Brownie partly because of my dark complexion but partly because they could never understand me 
28_12332_000011_000001	train-clean-360	 We all knew that long ago 
28_12332_000012_000000	train-clean-360	I laid down the paste brush and mused 
none	none	Do you remember Elsie I said staring hard at the paper board when I first went to Girton how all you girls wore your hair quite straight in neat smooth coils plaited up at the back about the size of a pancake and how of a sudden I burst in upon you like a tropical hurricane and demoralised you and how after three days of me some of the dear innocents began with awe to cut themselves artless fringes while others went out in fear and trembling and surreptitiously purchased a pair of curling tongs 
28_12332_000013_000001	train-clean-360	I was a bomb shell in your midst in those days why you yourself were almost afraid at first to speak to me 
28_12332_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 You see you had a bicycle Elsie put in smoothing the half papered wall and in those days of course ladies didn t bicycle 
none	none	You must admit Brownie dear it was a startling innovation 
28_12332_000014_000002	train-clean-360	You terrified us so 
28_12332_000014_000003	train-clean-360	And yet after all there isn t much harm in you 
28_12332_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 I hope not I said devoutly 
28_12332_000015_000001	train-clean-360	 I was before my time that was all at present even a curate s wife may blamelessly bicycle 
28_12332_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 But if you don t teach Elsie went on gazing at me with those wondering big blue eyes of hers whatever will you do Brownie Her horizon was bounded by the scholastic circle 
28_12332_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 I haven t the faintest idea I answered continuing to paste 
none	none	Only as I can t trespass upon your elegant hospitality for life whatever I mean to do I must begin doing this morning when we ve finished the papering 
28_12332_000017_000002	train-clean-360	I couldn t teach teaching like mauve is the refuge of the incompetent and I don t if possible want to sell bonnets 
28_12332_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 As a milliner s girl Elsie asked with a face of red horror 
28_12332_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 As a milliner s girl why not 
28_12332_000019_000001	train-clean-360	 Tis an honest calling 
28_12332_000019_000002	train-clean-360	Earls daughters do it now 
28_12332_000019_000003	train-clean-360	But you needn t look so shocked 
28_12332_000019_000004	train-clean-360	I tell you just at present I am not contemplating it 
none	none	Then what do you contemplate 
28_12332_000021_000000	train-clean-360	I paused and reflected 
none	none	I am here in London I answered gazing rapt at the ceiling London whose streets are paved with gold though it looks at first sight like muddy flagstones London the greatest and richest city in the world where an adventurous soul ought surely to find some loophole for an adventure That piece is hung crooked dear we shall have to take it down again I devise a Plan therefore 
28_12332_000021_000002	train-clean-360	I submit myself to fate or if you prefer it I leave my future in the hands of Providence 
28_12332_000021_000003	train-clean-360	I shall stroll out this morning as soon as I ve cleaned myself and embrace the first stray enterprise that offers Our Bagdad teems with enchanted carpets 
28_12332_000021_000004	train-clean-360	Let one but float my way and hi presto I seize it 
28_12332_000021_000005	train-clean-360	I go where glory or a modest competence waits me 
28_12332_000021_000006	train-clean-360	I snatch at the first offer the first hint of an opening 
28_12332_000022_000000	train-clean-360	Elsie stared at me more aghast and more puzzled than ever 
28_12332_000022_000001	train-clean-360	 But how she asked 
none	none	Where When You are so strange 
28_12332_000022_000005	train-clean-360	What will you do to find one 
28_12332_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 Put on my hat and walk out I answered 
none	none	Nothing could be simpler This city bursts with enterprises and surprises Strangers from east and west hurry through it in all directions 
28_12332_000023_000003	train-clean-360	Omnibuses traverse it from end to end even I am told to Islington and Putney within folk sit face to face who never saw one another before in their lives and who may never see one another again or on the contrary may pass the rest of their days together 
28_12332_000024_000000	train-clean-360	I had a lovely harangue all pat in my head in much the same strain on the infinite possibilities of entertaining angels unawares in cabs on the Underground in the aerated bread shops but Elsie s widening eyes of horror pulled me up short like a hansom in Piccadilly when the inexorable upturned hand of the policeman checks it 
none	none	Oh Brownie she cried drawing back you don t mean to tell me you re going to ask the first young man you meet in an omnibus to marry you Illustration I AM GOING OUT SIMPLY IN SEARCH OF ADVENTURE I shrieked with laughter Elsie I cried kissing her dear yellow little head you are impayable You never will learn what I mean 
28_12332_000026_000002	train-clean-360	You don t understand the language 
28_12332_000026_000003	train-clean-360	No no I am going out simply in search of adventure 
28_12332_000026_000004	train-clean-360	What adventure may come I have not at this moment the faintest conception 
28_12332_000026_000005	train-clean-360	The fun lies in the search the uncertainty the toss up of it 
28_12332_000026_000006	train-clean-360	What is the good of being penniless with the trifling exception of twopence unless you are prepared to accept your position in the spirit of a masked ball at Covent Garden 
28_12332_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 I have never been to one Elsie put in 
28_12332_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 Gracious heavens neither have I What on earth do you take me for 
28_12332_000028_000001	train-clean-360	But I mean to see where fate will lead me 
28_12332_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 I may go with you Elsie pleaded 
none	none	Certainly not my child I answered she was three years older than I so I had the right to patronise her
28_12332_000030_000001	train-clean-360	 That would spoil all 
28_12332_000030_000002	train-clean-360	Your dear little face would be quite enough to scare away a timid adventure She knew what I meant 
none	none	It was gentle and pensive but it lacked initiative 
28_12332_000031_000000	train-clean-360	So when we had finished that wall I popped on my best hat and popped out by myself into Kensington Gardens 
28_12332_000032_000000	train-clean-360	I am told I ought to have been terribly alarmed at the straits in which I found myself a girl of twenty one alone in the world and only twopence short of penniless without a friend to protect a relation to counsel her 
none	none	I don t count Aunt Susan who lurked in ladylike indigence at Blackheath and whose counsel like her tracts was given away too profusely to everybody to allow of one s placing any very high value upon it But as a matter of fact I must admit I was not in the least alarmed 
28_12332_000032_000002	train-clean-360	Nature had endowed me with a profusion of crisp black hair and plenty of high spirits 
none	none	If my eyes had been like Elsie s that liquid blue which looks out upon life with mingled pity and amazement I might have felt as a girl ought to feel under such conditions but having large dark eyes with a bit of a twinkle in them and being as well able to pilot a bicycle as any girl of my acquaintance I have inherited or acquired an outlook on the world which distinctly leans rather towards cheeriness than despondency 
28_12332_000032_000004	train-clean-360	I croak with difficulty 
28_12332_000032_000005	train-clean-360	So I accepted my plight as an amusing experience affording full scope for the congenial exercise of courage and ingenuity 
28_12332_000033_000000	train-clean-360	How boundless are the opportunities of Kensington Gardens the Round Pond the winding Serpentine the mysterious seclusion of the Dutch brick Palace 
28_12332_000033_000001	train-clean-360	Genii swarm there 
28_12332_000033_000002	train-clean-360	One jostles possibilities 
28_12332_000033_000003	train-clean-360	It is a land of romance bounded on the north by the Abyss of Bayswater and on the south by the Amphitheatre of the Albert Hall 
28_12332_000033_000004	train-clean-360	But for a centre of adventure I choose the Long Walk it beckoned me somewhat as the North West Passage beckoned my seafaring ancestors the buccaneering mariners of Elizabethan Devon 
28_12332_000033_000005	train-clean-360	I sat down on a chair at the foot of an old elm with a poetic hollow prosaically filled by a utilitarian plate of galvanised iron 
28_12332_000033_000006	train-clean-360	Two ancient ladies were seated on the other side already very grand looking dames with the haughty and exclusive ugliness of the English aristocracy in its later stages 
28_12332_000033_000007	train-clean-360	For frank hideousness commend me to the noble dowager 
28_12332_000033_000008	train-clean-360	They were talking confidentially as I sat down the trifling episode of my approach did not suffice to stem the full stream of their conversation 
none	none	The great ignore the intrusion of their inferiors Illustration OUI MADAME MERCI BEAUCOUP MADAME Yes it s a terrible nuisance the eldest and ugliest of the two observed she was a high born lady with a distinctly cantankerous cast of countenance 
28_12332_000035_000001	train-clean-360	She had a Roman nose and her skin was wrinkled like a wilted apple she wore coffee coloured point lace in her bonnet with a complexion to match 
28_12332_000035_000002	train-clean-360	 But what could I do my dear 
none	none	I simply couldn t put up with such insolence So I looked her straight back in the face oh she quailed I can tell you and I said to her in my iciest voice you know how icy I can be when occasion demands it the second old lady nodded an ungrudging assent as if perfectly prepared to admit her friend s rare gift of iciness I said to her Celestine you can take your month s wages and half an hour to get out of this house And she dropped me a deep reverence and she answered Oui madame merci beaucoup madame je ne desire pas mieux madame And out she flounced 
28_12332_000035_000005	train-clean-360	So there was the end of it 
28_12332_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 Still you go to Schlangenbad on Monday 
28_12332_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 That s the point 
none	none	On Monday If it weren t for the journey I should have been glad enough to be rid of the minx I m glad as it is indeed for a more insolent upstanding independent answer you back again young woman with a sneer of her own I never saw Amelia but I must get to Schlangenbad 
28_12332_000037_000004	train-clean-360	Now there the difficulty comes in 
none	none	On the one hand if I engage a maid in London I have the choice of two evils Either I must take a trapesing English girl and I know by experience that an English girl on the Continent is a vast deal worse than no maid at all you have to wait upon her instead of her waiting upon you she gets seasick on the crossing and when she reaches France or Germany she hates the meals and she detests the hotel servants and she can t speak the language so that she s always calling you in to interpret for her in her private differences with the fille de chambre and the landlord or else I must pick up a French maid in London and I know equally by experience that the French maids one engages in London are invariably dishonest more dishonest than the rest even they ve come here because they have no character to speak of elsewhere and they think you aren t likely to write and enquire of their last mistress in Toulouse or saint Petersburg Then again on the other hand I can t wait to get a Gretchen an unsophisticated little Gretchen of the Taunus at Schlangenbad I suppose there are unsophisticated girls in Germany still made in Germany they don t make em any longer in England I m sure like everything else the trade in rustic innocence has been driven from the country I can t wait to get a Gretchen as I should like to do of course because I simply daren t undertake to cross the Channel alone and go all that long journey by Ostend or Calais Brussels and Cologne to Schlangenbad
28_12332_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 You could get a temporary maid her friend suggested in a lull of the tornado 
28_12332_000039_000000	train-clean-360	The Cantankerous Old Lady flared up 
28_12332_000039_000001	train-clean-360	 Yes and have my jewel case stolen 
none	none	Or find she was an English girl without one word of German 
28_12332_000039_000003	train-clean-360	Or nurse her on the boat when I want to give my undivided attention to my own misfortunes 
none	none	No Amelia I call it positively unkind of you to suggest such a thing You re so unsympathetic 
28_12332_000039_000006	train-clean-360	I put my foot down there 
none	none	I will not take any temporary person 
28_12332_000040_000000	train-clean-360	I saw my chance 
28_12332_000040_000001	train-clean-360	This was a delightful idea 
28_12332_000040_000002	train-clean-360	Why not start for Schlangenbad with the Cantankerous Old Lady 
28_12332_000041_000000	train-clean-360	Of course I had not the slightest intention of taking a lady s maid s place for a permanency 
28_12332_000041_000001	train-clean-360	Nor even if it comes to that as a passing expedient 
none	none	But if I wanted to go round the world how could I do better than set out by the Rhine country 
28_12332_000041_000003	train-clean-360	The Rhine leads you on to the Danube the Danube to the Black Sea the Black Sea to Asia and so by way of India China and Japan you reach the Pacific and San Francisco whence one returns quite easily by New York and the White Star Liners 
28_12332_000041_000004	train-clean-360	I began to feel like a globe trotter already the Cantankerous Old Lady was the thin end of the wedge the first rung of the ladder 
28_12332_000041_000005	train-clean-360	I proceeded to put my foot on it 
none	none	Illustration EXCUSE ME I SAID BUT I THINK I SEE A WAY OUT OF YOUR DIFFICULTY I leaned around the corner of the tree and spoke
28_12332_000043_000001	train-clean-360	 Excuse me I said in my suavest voice but I think I see a way out of your difficulty 
28_12332_000044_000000	train-clean-360	My first impression was that the Cantankerous Old Lady would go off in a fit of apoplexy 
28_12332_000044_000001	train-clean-360	She grew purple in the face with indignation and astonishment that a casual outsider should venture to address her so much so indeed that for a second I almost regretted my well meant interposition 
28_12332_000044_000002	train-clean-360	Then she scanned me up and down as if I were a girl in a mantle shop and she contemplated buying either me or the mantle 
28_12332_000044_000003	train-clean-360	At last catching my eye she thought better of it and burst out laughing 
28_12332_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 What do you mean by this eavesdropping she asked 
28_12332_000046_000000	train-clean-360	I flushed up in turn 
none	none	This is a public place I replied with dignity and you spoke in a tone which was hardly designed for the strictest privacy If you don t wish to be overheard you oughtn t to shout Besides I desired to do you a service 
28_12332_000047_000000	train-clean-360	The Cantankerous Old Lady regarded me once more from head to foot 
28_12332_000047_000001	train-clean-360	I did not quail 
28_12332_000047_000002	train-clean-360	Then she turned to her companion 
28_12332_000047_000003	train-clean-360	 The girl has spirit she remarked in an encouraging tone as if she were discussing some absent person 
28_12332_000047_000004	train-clean-360	 Upon my word Amelia I rather like the look of her 
28_12332_000047_000005	train-clean-360	Well my good woman what do you want to suggest to me 
28_12332_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 Merely this I replied bridling up and crushing her 
28_12332_000048_000001	train-clean-360	 I am a Girton girl an officer s daughter no more a good woman than most others of my class and I have nothing in particular to do for the moment 
28_12332_000048_000002	train-clean-360	I don t object to going to Schlangenbad 
28_12332_000048_000003	train-clean-360	I would convoy you over as companion or lady help or anything else you choose to call it I would remain with you there for a week till you could arrange with your Gretchen presumably unsophisticated and then I would leave you 
none	none	Salary is unimportant my fare suffices 
28_12332_000048_000005	train-clean-360	I accept the chance as a cheap opportunity of attaining Schlangenbad 
28_12332_000049_000000	train-clean-360	The yellow faced old lady put up her long handled tortoise shell eyeglasses and inspected me all over again 
28_12332_000049_000001	train-clean-360	 Well I declare she murmured 
28_12332_000049_000002	train-clean-360	 What are girls coming to I wonder 
none	none	Girton you say Girton That place at Cambridge 
28_12332_000049_000004	train-clean-360	You speak Greek of course but how about German 
28_12332_000050_000000	train-clean-360	 Like a native I answered with cheerful promptitude 
28_12332_000050_000001	train-clean-360	 I was at school in Canton Berne it is a mother tongue to me 
none	none	No no the old lady went on fixing her keen small eyes on my mouth Those little lips could never frame themselves to schlecht or wunderschoen they were not cut out for it
28_12332_000052_000000	train-clean-360	 Pardon me I answered in German What I say that I mean 
28_12332_000052_000001	train-clean-360	The never to be forgotten music of the Fatherland s speech has on my infant ear from the first beginning impressed itself 
28_12332_000053_000000	train-clean-360	The old lady laughed aloud 
28_12332_000054_000000	train-clean-360	 Don t jabber it to me child she cried 
28_12332_000054_000001	train-clean-360	 I hate the lingo 
28_12332_000054_000002	train-clean-360	It s the one tongue on earth that even a pretty girl s lips fail to render attractive 
28_12332_000054_000003	train-clean-360	You yourself make faces over it 
28_12332_000054_000004	train-clean-360	What s your name young woman 
28_12332_000055_000000	train-clean-360	 Lois Cayley 
none	none	Lois What a name 
28_12332_000056_000001	train-clean-360	I never heard of any Lois in my life before except Timothy s grandmother 
none	none	You re not anybody s grandmother are you
28_12332_000057_000000	train-clean-360	 Not to my knowledge I answered gravely 
28_12332_000058_000000	train-clean-360	She burst out laughing again 
28_12332_000059_000000	train-clean-360	 Well you ll do I think she said catching my arm 
none	none	That big mill down yonder hasn t ground the originality altogether out of you 
28_12332_000059_000002	train-clean-360	I adore originality 
28_12332_000059_000003	train-clean-360	It was clever of you to catch at the suggestion of this arrangement 
28_12332_000059_000004	train-clean-360	Lois Cayley you say any relation of a madcap Captain Cayley whom I used once to know in the Forty second Highlanders 
28_12332_000060_000000	train-clean-360	 His daughter I answered flushing 
none	none	For I was proud of my father
28_12332_000061_000000	train-clean-360	 Ha 
28_12332_000061_000001	train-clean-360	I remember he died poor fellow he was a good soldier and his I felt she was going to say his fool of a widow but a glance from me quelled her his widow went and married that good looking scapegrace Jack Watts Morgan 
28_12332_000061_000002	train-clean-360	Never marry a man my dear with a double barrelled name and no visible means of subsistence above all if he s generally known by a nickname 
28_12332_000061_000003	train-clean-360	So you re poor Tom Cayley s daughter are you 
28_12332_000061_000004	train-clean-360	Well well we can settle this little matter between us 
28_12332_000061_000005	train-clean-360	Mind I m a person who always expects to have my own way 
none	none	If you come with me to Schlangenbad you must do as I tell you I think I could manage it for a week I answered demurely 
28_12332_000063_000000	train-clean-360	She smiled at my audacity 
28_12332_000063_000001	train-clean-360	We passed on to terms 
28_12332_000063_000002	train-clean-360	They were quite satisfactory 
28_12332_000063_000003	train-clean-360	She wanted no references 
28_12332_000063_000004	train-clean-360	 Do I look like a woman who cares about a reference 
none	none	What are called characters are usually essays in how not to say it 
28_12332_000063_000006	train-clean-360	You take my fancy that s the point 
28_12332_000063_000007	train-clean-360	And poor Tom Cayley 
none	none	But mind I will not be contradicted
28_12332_000064_000000	train-clean-360	 I will not contradict your wildest misstatement I answered smiling 
none	none	And your name and address I asked after we had settled preliminaries A faint red spot rose quaintly in the centre of the Cantankerous Old Lady s sallow cheek
28_12332_000066_000001	train-clean-360	 My dear she murmured my name is the one thing on earth I m really ashamed of 
28_12332_000066_000002	train-clean-360	My parents chose to inflict upon me the most odious label that human ingenuity ever devised for a Christian soul and I ve not had courage enough to burst out and change it 
28_12332_000067_000000	train-clean-360	A gleam of intuition flashed across me You don t mean to say I exclaimed that you re called Georgina 
28_12332_000068_000000	train-clean-360	The Cantankerous Old Lady gripped my arm hard 
28_12332_000068_000001	train-clean-360	 What an unusually intelligent girl she broke in 
28_12332_000068_000002	train-clean-360	 How on earth did you guess 
none	none	It is Georgina
28_12332_000069_000000	train-clean-360	 Fellow feeling I answered 
28_12332_000069_000001	train-clean-360	 So is mine Georgina Lois 
28_12332_000069_000002	train-clean-360	But as I quite agree with you as to the atrocity of such conduct I have suppressed the Georgina 
28_12332_000069_000003	train-clean-360	It ought to be made penal to send innocent girls into the world so burdened 
28_12332_000070_000000	train-clean-360	 My opinion to a T You are really an exceptionally sensible young woman 
28_12332_000070_000001	train-clean-360	There s my name and address I start on Monday 
28_12332_000071_000000	train-clean-360	I glanced at her card 
28_12332_000071_000001	train-clean-360	The very copperplate was noisy 
28_12332_000071_000002	train-clean-360	 Lady Georgina Fawley forty nine Fortescue Crescent W 
28_12332_000072_000000	train-clean-360	It had taken us twenty minutes to arrange our protocols 
28_12332_000072_000001	train-clean-360	As I walked off well pleased Lady Georgina s friend ran after me quickly 
none	none	You must take care she said in a warning voice
28_12332_000073_000001	train-clean-360	 You ve caught a Tartar 
28_12332_000074_000000	train-clean-360	 So I suspect I answered 
none	none	But a week in Tartary will be at least an experience
28_12332_000075_000000	train-clean-360	 She has an awful temper 
28_12332_000076_000000	train-clean-360	 That s nothing 
28_12332_000076_000001	train-clean-360	So have I Appalling I assure you 
28_12332_000076_000002	train-clean-360	And if it comes to blows I m bigger and younger and stronger than she is 
28_12332_000077_000000	train-clean-360	 Well I wish you well out of it 
28_12332_000078_000000	train-clean-360	 Thank you 
28_12332_000078_000001	train-clean-360	It is kind of you to give me this warning 
28_12332_000078_000002	train-clean-360	But I think I can take care of myself 
28_12332_000078_000003	train-clean-360	I come you see of a military family 
28_12332_000079_000000	train-clean-360	I nodded my thanks and strolled back to Elsie s 
28_12332_000079_000001	train-clean-360	Dear little Elsie was in transports of surprise when I related my adventure 
28_12332_000080_000000	train-clean-360	 Will you really go 
28_12332_000080_000001	train-clean-360	And what will you do my dear when you get there 
28_12332_000081_000000	train-clean-360	 I haven t a notion I answered that s where the fun comes in 
28_12332_000081_000001	train-clean-360	But anyhow I shall have got there 
28_12332_000082_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh Brownie you might starve 
28_12332_000083_000000	train-clean-360	 And I might starve in London 
28_12332_000083_000001	train-clean-360	In either place I have only two hands and one head to help me 
none	none	But then here you are among friends 
28_12332_000084_000001	train-clean-360	You might stop with me for ever 
28_12332_000085_000000	train-clean-360	I kissed her fluffy forehead 
none	none	You good generous little Elsie I cried I won t stop here one moment after I have finished the painting and papering 
28_12332_000085_000002	train-clean-360	I came here to help you 
28_12332_000085_000003	train-clean-360	I couldn t go on eating your hard earned bread and doing nothing 
28_12332_000085_000004	train-clean-360	I know how sweet you are but the last thing I want is to add to your burdens 
28_12332_000085_000005	train-clean-360	Now let us roll up our sleeves again and hurry on with the dado 
28_12332_000086_000000	train-clean-360	 But Brownie you ll want to be getting your own things ready Remember you re off to Germany on Monday 
28_12332_000087_000000	train-clean-360	I shrugged my shoulders 
28_12332_000087_000001	train-clean-360	 Tis a foreign trick I picked up in Switzerland 
28_12332_000087_000002	train-clean-360	 What have I got to get ready I asked 
none	none	I can t go out and buy a complete summer outfit in Bond Street for twopence Now don t look at me like that be practical Elsie and let me help you paint the dado For unless I helped her poor Elsie could never have finished it herself 
28_12332_000087_000005	train-clean-360	I cut out half her clothes for her her own ideas were almost entirely limited to differential calculus 
28_12332_000087_000006	train-clean-360	And cutting out a blouse by differential calculus is weary uphill work for a high school teacher 
28_12332_000088_000000	train-clean-360	By Monday I had papered and furnished the rooms and was ready to start on my voyage of exploration 
28_12332_000088_000001	train-clean-360	I met the Cantankerous Old Lady at Charing Cross by appointment and proceeded to take charge of her luggage and tickets 
28_12332_000089_000000	train-clean-360	Oh my how fussy she was 
28_12332_000089_000001	train-clean-360	 You will drop that basket 
none	none	I hope you have got through tickets via Malines not by Brussels I won t go by Brussels 
28_12332_000089_000003	train-clean-360	You have to change there 
28_12332_000089_000004	train-clean-360	Now mind you notice how much the luggage weighs in English pounds and make the man at the office give you a note of it to check those horrid Belgian porters 
none	none	They ll charge you for double the weight unless you reduce it at once to kilogrammes I know their ways 
28_12332_000089_000006	train-clean-360	Foreigners have no consciences 
28_12332_000089_000007	train-clean-360	They just go to the priest and confess you know and wipe it all out and start fresh again on a career of crime next morning 
none	none	I m sure I don t know why I ever go abroad 
28_12332_000089_000009	train-clean-360	The only country in the world fit to live in is England 
28_12332_000089_000010	train-clean-360	No mosquitoes no passports no goodness gracious child don t let that odious man bang about my hat box 
28_12332_000089_000011	train-clean-360	Have you no immortal soul porter that you crush other people s property as if it was blackbeetles 
28_12332_000089_000012	train-clean-360	No I will not let you take this Lois this is my jewel box it contains all that remains of the Fawley family jewels 
28_12332_000089_000013	train-clean-360	I positively decline to appear at Schlangenbad without a diamond to my back 
none	none	This never leaves my hands 
28_12332_000089_000015	train-clean-360	It s hard enough nowadays to keep body and skirt together 
none	none	Have you secured that coupe at Ostend Illustration A MOST URBANE AND OBLIGING CONTINENTAL GENTLEMAN 
28_12332_000091_000000	train-clean-360	We got into our first class carriage 
28_12332_000091_000001	train-clean-360	It was clean and comfortable but the Cantankerous Old Lady made the porter mop the floor and fidgeted and worried till we slid out of the station 
28_12332_000091_000002	train-clean-360	Fortunately the only other occupant of the compartment was a most urbane and obliging Continental gentleman I say Continental because I couldn t quite make out whether he was French German or Austrian who was anxious in every way to meet Lady Georgina s wishes 
28_12332_000091_000003	train-clean-360	Did madame desire to have the window open 
28_12332_000091_000004	train-clean-360	Oh certainly with pleasure the day was so sultry 
none	none	Closed a little more Parfaitement there was a current of air il faut l admettre Madame would prefer the corner No 
28_12332_000091_000007	train-clean-360	Then perhaps she would like this valise for a footstool 
none	none	Permettez just thus A cold draught runs so often along the floor in railway carriages 
28_12332_000091_000010	train-clean-360	This is Kent that we traverse ah the garden of England 
none	none	As a diplomat he knew every nook of Europe and he echoed the mot he had accidentally heard drop from madame s lips on the platform no country in the world so delightful as England
28_12332_000092_000000	train-clean-360	 Monsieur is attached to the Embassy in London Lady Georgina inquired growing affable 
none	none	He twirled his grey moustache a waxed moustache of great distinction No madame I have quitted the diplomatic service I inhabit London now pour mon agrement Some of my compatriots call it triste for me I find it the most fascinating capital in Europe 
28_12332_000093_000002	train-clean-360	What gaiety 
none	none	What movement What poetry What mystery
28_12332_000094_000000	train-clean-360	 If mystery means fog it challenges the world I interposed 
28_12332_000095_000000	train-clean-360	He gazed at me with fixed eyes 
none	none	Yes mademoiselle he answered in quite a different and markedly chilly voice
28_12332_000095_000002	train-clean-360	 Whatever your great country attempts were it only a fog it achieves consummately 
28_12332_000096_000000	train-clean-360	I have quick intuitions 
28_12332_000096_000001	train-clean-360	I felt the foreign gentleman took an instinctive dislike to me 
28_12332_000097_000000	train-clean-360	To make up for it he talked much and with animation to Lady Georgina They ferreted out friends in common and were as much surprised at it as people always are at that inevitable experience 
28_12332_000098_000000	train-clean-360	 Ah yes madame I recollect him well in Vienna 
none	none	I was there at the time attached to our Legation 
28_12332_000098_000002	train-clean-360	He was a charming man you read his masterly paper on the Central Problem of the Dual Empire 
28_12332_000099_000000	train-clean-360	 You were in Vienna then the Cantankerous Old Lady mused back 
28_12332_000099_000001	train-clean-360	 Lois my child don t stare she had covenanted from the first to call me Lois as my father s daughter and I confess I preferred it to being Miss Cayley d 
28_12332_000099_000002	train-clean-360	 We must surely have met 
28_12332_000099_000003	train-clean-360	Dare I ask your name monsieur 
28_12332_000100_000000	train-clean-360	I could see the foreign gentleman was delighted at this turn 
28_12332_000100_000001	train-clean-360	He had played for it and carried his point 
28_12332_000100_000002	train-clean-360	He meant her to ask him 
none	none	He had a card in his pocket conveniently close and he handed it across to her She read it and passed it on M le Comte de Laroche sur Loiret Oh I remember your name well the Cantankerous Old Lady broke in
28_12332_000101_000001	train-clean-360	 I think you knew my husband Sir Evelyn Fawley and my father Lord Kynaston 
28_12332_000102_000000	train-clean-360	The Count looked profoundly surprised and delighted 
28_12332_000102_000001	train-clean-360	 What you are then Lady Georgina Fawley he cried striking an attitude 
28_12332_000102_000002	train-clean-360	 Indeed miladi your admirable husband was one of the very first to exert his influence in my favour at Vienna 
none	none	Do I recall him ce cher Sir Evelyn 
28_12332_000102_000004	train-clean-360	If I recall him 
none	none	What a fortunate rencounter I must have seen you some years ago at Vienna miladi though I had not then the great pleasure of making your acquaintance 
28_12332_000102_000007	train-clean-360	But your face had impressed itself on my sub conscious self I did not learn till later that the esoteric doctrine of the sub conscious self was Lady Georgina s favourite hobby The moment chance led me to this carriage this morning I said to myself That face those features so vivid so striking I have seen them somewhere 
none	none	With what do I connect them in the recesses of my memory A high born family genius rank the diplomatic service some unnameable charm some faint touch of eccentricity Ha 
28_12332_000102_000011	train-clean-360	I have it Vienna a carriage with footmen in red livery a noble presence a crowd of wits poets artists politicians pressing eagerly round the landau That was my mental picture as I sat and confronted you I understand it all now this is Lady Georgina Fawley 
28_12332_000103_000000	train-clean-360	I thought the Cantankerous Old Lady who was a shrewd person in her way must surely see through this obvious patter but I had under estimated the average human capacity for swallowing flattery 
28_12332_000103_000001	train-clean-360	Instead of dismissing his fulsome nonsense with a contemptuous smile Lady Georgina perked herself up with a conscious air of coquetry and asked for more 
28_12332_000103_000002	train-clean-360	 Yes they were delightful days in Vienna she said simpering I was young then Count I enjoyed life with a zest 
none	none	Illustration PERSONS OF MILADI S TEMPERAMENT ARE ALWAYS YOUNG Persons of miladi s temperament are always young the Count retorted glibly leaning forward and gazing at her
28_12332_000105_000001	train-clean-360	 Growing old is a foolish habit of the stupid and the vacant 
none	none	Men and women of esprit are never older One learns as one goes on in life to admire not the obvious beauty of mere youth and health he glanced across at me disdainfully but the profounder beauty of deep character in a face that calm and serene beauty which is imprinted on the brow by experience of the emotions
28_12332_000106_000000	train-clean-360	 I have had my moments Lady Georgina murmured with her head on one side 
none	none	I believe it miladi the Count answered and ogled her 
28_12332_000108_000000	train-clean-360	Thenceforward to Dover they talked together with ceaseless animation The Cantankerous Old Lady was capital company 
28_12332_000108_000001	train-clean-360	She had a tang in her tongue and in the course of ninety minutes she had flayed alive the greater part of London society with keen wit and sprightliness 
28_12332_000108_000002	train-clean-360	I laughed against my will at her ill tempered sallies they were too funny not to amuse in spite of their vitriol 
28_12332_000108_000003	train-clean-360	As for the Count he was charmed 
28_12332_000108_000004	train-clean-360	He talked well himself too and between them I almost forgot the time till we arrived at Dover 
28_12332_000109_000000	train-clean-360	It was a very rough passage 
28_12332_000109_000001	train-clean-360	The Count helped us to carry our nineteen hand packages and four rugs on board but I noticed that fascinated as she was with him Lady Georgina resisted his ingenious efforts to gain possession of her precious jewel case as she descended the gangway 
28_12332_000109_000002	train-clean-360	She clung to it like grim death even in the chops of the Channel Fortunately I am a good sailor and when Lady Georgina s sallow cheeks began to grow pale I was steady enough to supply her with her shawl and her smelling bottle 
28_12332_000109_000003	train-clean-360	She fidgeted and worried the whole way over 
none	none	She would be treated like a vertebrate animal 
28_12332_000109_000005	train-clean-360	Those horrid Belgians had no right to stick their deck chairs just in front of her 
none	none	The impertinence of the hussies with the bright red hair a grocer s daughters she felt sure in venturing to come and sit on the same bench with her the bench for ladies only under the lee of the funnel Ladies only indeed 
28_12332_000109_000007	train-clean-360	Did the baggages pretend they considered themselves ladies 
28_12332_000109_000008	train-clean-360	Oh that placid old gentleman in the episcopal gaiters was their father was he 
none	none	Well a bishop should bring up his daughters better having his children in subjection with all gravity Instead of which Lois my smelling salts This was a beastly boat such an odour of machinery they had no decent boats nowadays with all our boasted improvements she could remember well when the cross Channel service was much better conducted than it was at present But that was before we had compulsory education 
28_12332_000109_000011	train-clean-360	The working classes were driving trade out of the country and the consequence was we couldn t build a boat which didn t reek like an oil shop 
none	none	Even the sailors on board were French jabbering idiots not an honest British Jack tar among the lot of them though the stewards were English and very inferior Cockney English at that with their off hand ways and their School Board airs and graces She d School Board them if they were her servants she d show them the sort of respect that was due to people of birth and education 
28_12332_000109_000014	train-clean-360	But the children of the lower classes never learnt their catechism nowadays they were too much occupied with literatoor jography and free and drawrin 
28_12332_000109_000015	train-clean-360	Happily for my nerves a good lurch to leeward put a stop for a while to the course of her thoughts on the present distresses 
none	none	At Ostend the Count made a second gallant attempt to capture the jewel case which Lady Georgina automatically repulsed 
28_12332_000110_000001	train-clean-360	She had a fixed habit I believe of sticking fast to that jewel case for she was too overpowered by the Count s urbanity I feel sure to suspect for a moment his honesty of purpose 
28_12332_000110_000002	train-clean-360	But whenever she travelled I fancy she clung to her case as if her life depended upon it it contained the whole of her valuable diamonds 
none	none	We had twenty minutes for refreshments at Ostend during which interval my old lady declared with warmth that I must look after her registered luggage though as it was booked through to Cologne I could not even see it till we crossed the German frontier for the Belgian douaniers seal up the van as soon as the through baggage for Germany is unloaded To satisfy her however I went through the formality of pretending to inspect it and rendered myself hateful to the head of the douane by asking various foolish and inept questions on which Lady Georgina insisted When I had finished this silly and uncongenial task for I am not by nature fussy and it is hard to assume fussiness as another person s proxy I returned to our coupe which I had arranged for in London 
28_12332_000111_000002	train-clean-360	To my great amazement I found the Cantankerous Old Lady and the egregious Count comfortably seated there 
28_12332_000111_000003	train-clean-360	 Monsieur has been good enough to accept a place in our carriage she observed as I entered 
28_12332_000112_000000	train-clean-360	He bowed and smiled 
none	none	Or rather madame has been so kind as to offer me one he corrected
28_12332_000113_000000	train-clean-360	 Would you like some lunch Lady Georgina I asked in my chilliest voice 
none	none	There are ten minutes to spare and the buffet is excellent
28_12332_000114_000000	train-clean-360	 An admirable inspiration the Count murmured 
none	none	Permit me to escort you miladi
28_12332_000115_000000	train-clean-360	 You will come Lois Lady Georgina asked 
28_12332_000116_000000	train-clean-360	 No thank you I answered for I had an idea 
none	none	I am a capital sailor but the sea takes away my appetite Then you ll keep our places she said turning to me
28_12332_000117_000001	train-clean-360	 I hope you won t allow them to stick in any horrid foreigners 
28_12332_000117_000002	train-clean-360	They will try to force them on you unless you insist 
none	none	I know their tricky ways 
28_12332_000117_000004	train-clean-360	You have the tickets I trust 
none	none	And the bulletin for the coupe Well mind you don t lose the paper for the registered luggage 
28_12332_000117_000007	train-clean-360	Don t let those dreadful porters touch my cloaks 
28_12332_000117_000008	train-clean-360	And if anybody attempts to get in be sure you stand in front of the door as they mount to prevent them 
28_12332_000118_000000	train-clean-360	The Count handed her out he was all high courtly politeness 
none	none	As Lady Georgina descended he made yet another dexterous effort to relieve her of the jewel case 
28_12332_000118_000002	train-clean-360	I don t think she noticed it but automatically once more she waved him aside 
28_12332_000118_000003	train-clean-360	Then she turned to me 
28_12332_000118_000004	train-clean-360	 Here my dear she said handing it to me you d better take care of it 
none	none	If I lay it down in the buffet while I am eating my soup some rogue may run away with it 
28_12332_000118_000006	train-clean-360	But mind don t let it out of your hands on any account 
28_12332_000118_000007	train-clean-360	Hold it so on your knee and for Heaven s sake don t part with it 
none	none	Illustration THAT SUCCEEDS THE SHABBY LOOKING MAN MUTTERED 
28_12332_000120_000000	train-clean-360	By this time my suspicions of the Count were profound 
28_12332_000120_000001	train-clean-360	From the first I had doubted him he was so blandly plausible 
28_12332_000120_000002	train-clean-360	But as we landed at Ostend I had accidentally overheard a low whispered conversation when he passed a shabby looking man who had travelled in a second class carriage from London That succeeds the shabby looking man had muttered under his breath in French as the haughty nobleman with the waxed moustache brushed by him 
28_12332_000121_000000	train-clean-360	 That succeeds admirably the Count had answered in the same soft undertone 
none	none	Ca reussit a merveille 
28_12332_000122_000000	train-clean-360	I understood him to mean that he had prospered in his attempt to impose on Lady Georgina 
none	none	They had been gone five minutes at the buffet when the Count came back hurriedly to the door of the coupe with a nonchalant air Oh mademoiselle he said in an off hand tone Lady Georgina has sent me to fetch her jewel case 
28_12332_000124_000000	train-clean-360	I gripped it hard with both hands 
none	none	Pardon M le Comte I answered Lady Georgina intrusted it to my safe keeping and without her leave I cannot give it up to any one
28_12332_000125_000000	train-clean-360	 You mistrust me he cried looking black 
28_12332_000125_000001	train-clean-360	 You doubt my honour 
none	none	You doubt my word when I say that miladi has sent me Du tout I answered calmly
28_12332_000126_000001	train-clean-360	 But I have Lady Georgina s orders to stick to this case and till Lady Georgina returns I stick to it 
28_12332_000127_000000	train-clean-360	He murmured some indignant remark below his breath and walked off 
28_12332_000127_000001	train-clean-360	The shabby looking passenger was pacing up and down the platform outside in a badly made dust coat 
28_12332_000127_000002	train-clean-360	As they passed their lips moved 
none	none	The Count s seemed to mutter C est un coup manque 
28_12332_000128_000000	train-clean-360	However he did not desist even so 
28_12332_000128_000001	train-clean-360	I saw he meant to go on with his dangerous little game 
none	none	He returned to the buffet and rejoined Lady Georgina 
28_12332_000128_000003	train-clean-360	I felt sure it would be useless to warn her so completely had the Count succeeded in gulling her but I took my own steps 
28_12332_000128_000004	train-clean-360	I examined the jewel case closely 
28_12332_000128_000005	train-clean-360	It had a leather outer covering within was a strong steel box with stout bands of metal to bind it 
28_12332_000128_000006	train-clean-360	I took my cue at once and acted for the best on my own responsibility 
28_12332_000129_000000	train-clean-360	When Lady Georgina and the Count returned they were like old friends together 
28_12332_000129_000001	train-clean-360	The quails in aspic and the sparkling hock had evidently opened their hearts to one another 
none	none	As far as Malines they laughed and talked without ceasing 
28_12332_000129_000003	train-clean-360	Lady Georgina was now in her finest vein of spleen her acid wit grew sharper and more caustic each moment 
28_12332_000129_000004	train-clean-360	Not a reputation in Europe had a rag left to cover it as we steamed in beneath the huge iron roof of the main central junction 
none	none	I had observed all the way from Ostend that the Count had been anxious lest we might have to give up our coupe at Malines I assured him more than once that his fears were groundless for I had arranged at Charing Cross that it should run right through to the German frontier 
28_12332_000130_000002	train-clean-360	But he waved me aside with one lordly hand 
28_12332_000130_000003	train-clean-360	I had not told Lady Georgina of his vain attempt to take possession of her jewel case and the bare fact of my silence made him increasingly suspicious of me 
28_12332_000131_000000	train-clean-360	 Pardon me mademoiselle he said coldly you do not understand these lines as well as I do 
none	none	Nothing is more common than for those rascals of railway clerks to sell one a place in a coupe or a wagon lit and then never reserve it or turn one out half way It is very possible miladi may have to descend at Malines Lady Georgina bore him out by a large variety of selected stories concerning the various atrocities of the rival companies which had stolen her luggage on her way to Italy As for trains de luxe they were dens of robbers So when we reached Malines just to satisfy Lady Georgina I put out my head and inquired of a porter As I anticipated he replied that there was no change we went through to Verviers 
28_12332_000134_000000	train-clean-360	The Count however was still unsatisfied 
none	none	He descended and made some remarks a little farther down the platform to an official in the gold banded cap of a chef de gare or some such functionary 
28_12332_000134_000002	train-clean-360	Then he returned to us all fuming 
28_12332_000134_000003	train-clean-360	 It is as I said he exclaimed flinging open the door 
28_12332_000134_000004	train-clean-360	 These rogues have deceived us 
none	none	The coupe goes no farther 
28_12332_000134_000006	train-clean-360	You must dismount at once miladi and take the train just opposite 
28_12332_000135_000000	train-clean-360	I felt sure he was wrong and I ventured to say so 
28_12332_000135_000001	train-clean-360	But Lady Georgina cried Nonsense child 
none	none	The chef de gare must know 
28_12332_000135_000003	train-clean-360	Get out at once Bring my bag and the rugs 
28_12332_000135_000004	train-clean-360	Mind that cloak 
28_12332_000135_000005	train-clean-360	Don t forget the sandwich tin 
28_12332_000135_000006	train-clean-360	Thanks Count will you kindly take charge of my umbrellas 
28_12332_000135_000007	train-clean-360	Hurry up Lois hurry up the train is just starting 
none	none	I scrambled after her with my fourteen bundles keeping a quiet eye meanwhile on the jewel case We took our seats in the opposite train which I noticed was marked Amsterdam Bruxelles Paris But I said nothing 
28_12332_000137_000001	train-clean-360	The Count jumped in jumped about arranged our parcels jumped out again 
28_12332_000137_000002	train-clean-360	He spoke to a porter then he rushed back excitedly 
none	none	Mille pardons miladi he cried I find the chef de gare has cruelly deceived me 
28_12332_000137_000005	train-clean-360	You were right after all mademoiselle 
none	none	We must return to the coupe 
28_12332_000138_000000	train-clean-360	With singular magnanimity I refrained from saying I told you so 
none	none	Lady Georgina very flustered and hot by this time tumbled out once more and bolted back to the coupe 
28_12332_000139_000001	train-clean-360	Both trains were just starting 
28_12332_000139_000002	train-clean-360	In her hurry at last she let the Count take possession of her jewel case I rather fancy that as he passed one window he handed it in to the shabby looking passenger but I am not certain 
28_12332_000139_000003	train-clean-360	At any rate when we were comfortably seated in our own compartment once more and he stood on the footboard just about to enter of a sudden he made an unexpected dash back and flung himself wildly into a Paris carriage 
none	none	At the self same moment with a piercing shriek both trains started Lady Georgina threw up her hands in a frenzy of horror My diamonds she cried aloud Oh Lois my diamonds Don t distress yourself I answered holding her back for I verily believe she would have leapt from the train He has only taken the outer shell with the sandwich case inside it Here is the steel box And I produced it triumphantly She seized it overjoyed How did this happen she cried hugging it for she loved those diamonds Very simply I answered I saw the man was a rogue and that he had a confederate with him in another carriage So while you were gone to the buffet at Ostend I slipped the box out of the case and put in the sandwich tin that he might carry it off and we might have proofs against him All you have to do now is to inform the conductor who will telegraph to stop the train to Paris I spoke to him about that at Ostend so that everything is ready She positively hugged me My dear she cried you are the cleverest little woman I ever met in my life Who on earth could have suspected such a polished gentleman Why you re worth your weight in gold What the dickens shall I do without you at Schlangenbad II THE ADVENTURE OF THE SUPERCILIOUS ATTACHE The Count must have been an adept in the gentle art of quick change disguise for though we telegraphed full particulars of his appearance from Louvain the next station nobody in the least resembling either him or his accomplice the shabby looking man could be unearthed in the Paris train when it drew up at Brussels its first stopping place They must have transformed themselves meanwhile into two different persons Indeed from the outset I had suspected his moustache twas so very distinguished When we reached Cologne the Cantankerous Old Lady overwhelmed me with the warmth of her thanks and praises Nay more after breakfast next morning before we set out by slow train for Schlangenbad she burst like a tornado into my bedroom at the Cologne hotel with a cheque for twenty guineas drawn in my favour That s for you my dear she said handing it to me and looking really quite gracious I glanced at the piece of paper and felt my face glow crimson Oh Lady Georgina I cried you misunderstand You forget that I am a lady Nonsense child nonsense Your courage and promptitude were worth ten times that sum she exclaimed positively slipping her arm round my neck It was your courage I particularly admired Lois because you faced the risk of my happening to look inside the outer case and finding you had abstracted the blessed box in which case I might quite naturally have concluded you meant to steal it I thought of that I answered But I decided to risk it I felt it was worth while For I was sure the man meant to take the case as soon as ever you gave him the opportunity Then you deserve to be rewarded she insisted pressing the cheque upon me Illustration I PUT HER HAND BACK FIRMLY I put her hand back firmly Lady Georgina I said it is very amiable of you I think you do right in offering me the money but I think I should do altogether wrong in accepting it A lady is not honest from the hope of gain she is not brave because she expects to be paid for her bravery You were my employer and I was bound to serve my employer s interests I did so as well as I could and there is the end of it She looked absolutely disappointed we all hate to crush a benevolent impulse but she tore the cheque up into very small pieces As you will my dear she said with her hands on her hips I see you are poor Tom Cayley s daughter He was always a bit Quixotic Though I believe she liked me all the better for my refusal On the way from Cologne to Eltville however and on the drive up to Schlangenbad I found her just as fussy and as worrying as ever Let me see how many of these horrid pfennigs make an English penny I never can remember Oh those silly little nickel things are ten pfennigs each are they Well eight would be a penny I suppose A mark s a shilling ridiculous of them to divide it into ten pence instead of twelve one never really knows how much one s paying for anything Why these Continental people can t be content to use pounds shillings and pence all over alike the same as we do passes my comprehension They re glad enough to get English sovereigns when they can why then don t they use them as such instead of reckoning them each at twenty five francs and then trying to cheat you out of the proper exchange which is always ten centimes more than the brokers give you What we use their beastly decimal system Lois I m ashamed of you An English girl to turn and rend her native country like that Francs and centimes indeed Fancy proposing it at Peter Robinson s No I will not go by the boat my dear I hate the Rhine boats crowded with nasty selfish pigs of Germans What I like is a first class compartment all to myself and no horrid foreigners Especially Germans They re bursting with self satisfaction have such an exaggerated belief in their land and their folk And when they come to England they do nothing but find fault with us If people aren t satisfied with the countries they travel in they d better stop at home that s my opinion Nasty pigs of Germans The very sight of them sickens me Oh I don t mind if they do understand me child They all learn English nowadays it helps them in trade that s why they re driving us out of all the markets But it must be good for them to learn once in a way what other people really think of them civilised people I mean not Germans They re a set of barbarians We reached Schlangenbad alive though I sometimes doubted it for my old lady did her boisterous best to rouse some peppery German officer into cutting our throats incontinently by the way and when we got there we took up our abode in the nicest hotel in the village Lady Georgina had engaged the best front room on the first floor with a charming view across the pine clad valley but I must do her the justice to say that she took the second best for me and that she treated me in every way like the guest she delighted to honour My refusal to accept her twenty guineas made her anxious to pay it back to me within the terms of our agreement She described me to everybody as a young friend who was travelling with her and never gave any one the slightest hint of my being a paid companion Our arrangement was that I was to have two guineas for the week besides my travelling expenses board and lodging On our first morning at Schlangenbad Lady Georgina sallied forth very much overdressed and in a youthful hat to use the waters They are valued chiefly for the complexion I learned I wondered then why Lady Georgina came there for she hadn t any but they are also recommended for nervous irritability and as Lady Georgina had visited the place almost every summer for fifteen years it opened before one s mind an appalling vista of what her temper might have been if she had not gone to Schlangenbad The hot springs are used in the form of a bath You don t need them my dear Lady Georgina said to me with a good humoured smile and I will own that I did not for nature has gifted me with a tolerable cuticle But I like when at Rome to do as Rome does so I tried the baths once I found them unpleasantly smooth and oily I do not freckle but if I did I think I should prefer freckles We walked much on the terrace the inevitable dawdling promenade of all German watering places it reeked of Serene Highness We also drove out among the low wooded hills which bound the Rhine valley The majority of the visitors I found were ladies Court ladies most of them all there for their complexions but all anxious to assure me privately they had come for what they described as nervous debility I divided them at once into two classes half of them never had and never would have a complexion at all the other half had exceptionally smooth and beautiful skins of which they were obviously proud and whose pink and white peach blossom they thought to preserve by assiduous bathing It was vanity working on two opposite bases There was a sprinkling of men however who were really there for a sufficient reason wounds or serious complaints while a few good old sticks porty and whisty were in attendance on invalid wives or sisters Illustration HE CAST A HASTY GLANCE AT US From the beginning I noticed that Lady Georgina went peering about all over the place as if she were hunting for something she had lost with her long handled tortoise shell glasses perpetually in evidence the aristocratic outrage I called them and that she eyed all the men with peculiar attention But I took no open notice of her little weakness On our second day at the Spa I was sauntering with her down the chief street a beastly little hole my dear not a decent shop where one can buy a reel of thread or a yard of tape in the place when I observed a tall and handsome young man on the opposite side of the road cast a hasty glance at us and then sneak round the corner hurriedly He was a loose limbed languid looking young man with large dreamy eyes and a peculiarly beautiful and gentle expression but what I noted about him most was an odd superficial air of superciliousness He seemed always to be looking down with scorn on that foolish jumble the universe He darted away so rapidly however that I hardly discovered all this just then I piece it out from subsequent observations Later in the day we chanced to pass a cafe where three young exquisites sat sipping Rhine wines after the fashion of the country One of them with a gold tipped cigarette held gracefully between two slender fingers was my languid looking young aristocrat He was blowing out smoke in a lazy blue stream The moment he saw me however he turned away as if he desired to escape observation and ducked down so as to hide his face behind his companions I wondered why on earth he should want to avoid me Could this be the Count No the young man with the halo of cigarette smoke stood three inches taller Who then at Schlangenbad could wish to avoid my notice It was a singular mystery for I was quite certain the supercilious young man was trying his best to prevent my seeing him That evening after dinner the Cantankerous Old Lady burst out suddenly Well I can t for the life of me imagine why Harold hasn t turned up here The wretch knew I was coming and I heard from our Ambassador at Rome last week that he was going to be at Schlangenbad Who is Harold I asked My nephew Lady Georgina snapped back beating a devil s tattoo with her fan on the table The only member of my family except myself who isn t a born idiot Harold s not an idiot he s an attache at Rome I saw it at a glance Then he is in Schlangenbad I answered I noticed him this morning The old lady turned towards me sharply She peered right through me as if she were a Roentgen ray I could see she was asking herself whether this was a conspiracy and whether I had come there on purpose to meet Harold But I flatter myself I am tolerably mistress of my own countenance I did not blench How do you know she asked quickly with an acid intonation If I had answered the truth I should have said I know he is here because I saw a good looking young man evidently trying to avoid you this morning and if a young man has the misfortune to be born your nephew and also to have expectations from you it is easy to understand that he would prefer to keep out of your way as long as possible But that would have been neither polite nor politic Moreover I reflected that I had no particular reason for wishing to do mister Harold a bad turn and that it would be kinder to him as well as to her to conceal the reasons on which I based my instinctive inference So I took up a strong strategic position I have an intuition that I saw him in the village this morning I said Family likeness perhaps I merely jumped at it as you spoke A tall languid young man large poetical eyes an artistic moustache just a trifle Oriental looking That s Harold the Cantankerous Old Lady rapped out sharply with clear conviction The miserable boy Why on earth hasn t he been round to see me I reflected that I knew why but I did not say so Silence is golden I also remarked mentally on that curious human blindness which had made me conclude at first that the supercilious young man was trying to avoid me when I might have guessed it was far more likely he was trying to avoid my companion I was a nobody Lady Georgina Fawley was a woman of European reputation Perhaps he didn t know which hotel you were stopping at I put in Or even that you were here I felt a sudden desire to shield poor Harold Not know which hotel Nonsense child he knows I come here on this precise date regularly every summer and if he didn t know is it likely I should try any other inn when this is the only moderately decent house to stop at in Schlangenbad And the morning coffee undrinkable at that while the hash such hash But that s the way in Germany He s an ungrateful monster if he comes now I shall refuse to see him Illustration HAROLD YOU VIPER WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY TRYING TO AVOID ME Next morning after breakfast however in spite of these threats she hailed me forth with her on the Harold hunt She had sent the concierge to inquire at all the hotels already it seemed and found her truant at none of them now she ransacked the pensions At last she hunted him down in a house on the hill I could see she was really hurt Harold you viper what do you mean by trying to avoid me My dear aunt you here in Schlangenbad Why when did you arrive And what a colour you ve got You re looking so well That clever thrust saved him He cast me an appealing glance You will not betray me it said I answered mutely Not for worlds with a faltering pair of downcast eyelids Oh I m well enough thank you Lady Georgina replied somewhat mollified by his astute allusion to her personal appearance He had hit her weak point dexterously As well that is as one can expect to be nowadays Hereditary gout the sins of the fathers visited as usual But why didn t you come to see me How can I come to see you if you don t tell me where you are Lady Georgina Fawley Europe was the only address I knew It strikes me as insufficient His gentle drawl was a capital foil to Lady Georgina s acidulous soprano It seemed to disarm her She turned to me with a benignant wave of her hand Miss Cayley she said introducing me my nephew mister Harold Tillington You ve heard me talk of poor Tom Cayley Harold This is poor Tom Cayley s daughter Indeed the supercilious attache put in looking hard at me Delighted to make Miss Cayley s acquaintance Now Harold I can tell from your voice at once you haven t remembered one word about Captain Cayley Harold stood on the defensive My dear aunt he observed expanding both palms I have heard you talk of so very many people that even my diplomatic memory fails at times to recollect them all But I do better I dissemble I will plead forgetfulness now of Captain Cayley since you force it on me It is not likely I shall have to plead it of Captain Cayley s daughter And he bowed towards me gallantly The Cantankerous Old Lady darted a lightning glance at him It was a glance of quick suspicion Then she turned her Roentgen rays upon my face once more I fear I burned crimson A friend he asked Or a fellow guest A companion It was the first nasty thing she had said of me Ha more than a friend then A comrade He turned the edge neatly We walked out on the terrace and a little way up the zigzag path The day was superb I found mister Tillington in spite of his studiously languid and supercilious air a most agreeable companion He knew Europe He was full of talk of Rome and the Romans He had epigrammatic wit curt keen and pointed We sat down on a bench he kept Lady Georgina and myself amused for an hour by his crisp sallies Besides he had been everywhere and seen everybody Culture and agriculture seemed all one to him When we rose to go in Lady Georgina remarked with emphasis Of course Harold you ll come and take up your diggings at our hotel Of course my dear aunt How can you ask Free quarters Nothing would give me greater pleasure She glanced at him keenly again I saw she had expected him to fake up some lame excuse for not joining us and I fancied she was annoyed at his prompt acquiescence which had done her out of the chance for a family disagreement Oh you ll come then she said grudgingly Certainly most respected aunt I shall much prefer it She let her piercing eye descend upon me once more I was aware that I had been talking with frank ease of manner to mister Tillington and that I had said several things which clearly amused him Then I remembered all at once our relative positions A companion I felt should know her place it is not her role to be smart and amusing Perhaps I said drawing back mister Tillington would like to remain in his present quarters till the end of the week while I am with you Lady Georgina after that he could have my room it might be more convenient His eye caught mine quickly Oh you re only going to stop a week then Miss Cayley he put in with an air of disappointment Only a week I nodded My dear child the Cantankerous Old Lady broke out what nonsense you do talk Only going to stop a week How can I exist without you That was the arrangement I said mischievously You were going to look about you recollect for an unsophisticated Gretchen You don t happen to know of any warehouse where a supply of unsophisticated Gretchens is kept constantly in stock do you mister Tillington No I don t he answered laughing I believe there are dodos and auks eggs in very small numbers still to be procured in the proper quarters but the unsophisticated Gretchen I am credibly informed is an extinct animal Why the cap of one fetches high prices nowadays among collectors But you will come to the hotel at once Harold Lady Georgina interposed Certainly aunt I will move in without delay If Miss Cayley is going to stay for a single week only that adds one extra inducement for joining you immediately His aunt s stony eye was cold as marble So when we got back to our hotel after the baths that afternoon the concierge greeted us with Well your noble nephew has arrived high well born countess He came with his boxes just now and has taken a room near your honourable ladyship s Lady Georgina s face was a study of mingled emotions I don t know whether she looked more pleased or jealous Later in the day I chanced on mister Tillington sunning himself on a bench in the hotel garden He rose and came up to me as fast as his languid nature permitted Oh Miss Cayley he said abruptly I do want to thank you so much for not betraying me I know you spotted me twice in the town yesterday and I also know you were good enough to say nothing to my revered aunt about it I had no reason for wishing to hurt Lady Georgina s feelings I answered with a permissible evasion His countenance fell I never thought of that he interposed with one hand on his moustache I I fancied you did it out of fellow feeling We all think of things mainly from our own point of view first I answered The difference is that some of us think of them from other people s afterwards Motives are mixed He smiled I didn t know my deeply venerated relative was coming here so soon he went on I thought she wasn t expected till next week my brother wrote me that she had quarrelled with her French maid and twould take her full ten days to get another I meant to clear out before she arrived To tell you the truth I was going to morrow And now you are stopping on He caught my eye again Illustration CIRCUMSTANCES ALTER CASES HE MURMURED Circumstances alter cases he murmured with meaning It is hardly polite to describe one as a circumstance I objected I meant he said quickly my aunt alone is one thing my aunt with a friend is quite another I see I answered There is safety in numbers He eyed me hard Are you mediaeval or modern he asked Modern I hope I replied Then I looked at him again Oxford He nodded And you half joking Cambridge I said glad to catch him out What college Merton Yours Girton The odd rhyme amused him Thenceforth we were friends two Varsity men he said And indeed it does make a queer sort of link a freemasonry to which even women are now admitted At dinner and through the evening he talked a great deal to me Lady Georgina putting in from time to time a characteristic growl about the table d hote chicken a special breed my dear with eight drumsticks apiece or about the inadequate lighting of the heavy German salon She was worse than ever pungent as a rule that evening she was grumpy When we retired for the night to my great surprise she walked into my bedroom She seated herself on my bed I saw she had come to talk over Harold He will be very rich my dear you know A great catch in time He will inherit all my brother s money Lord Kynaston s Bless the child no Kynaston s as poor as a church mouse with the tithes unpaid he has three sons of his own and not a blessed stiver to leave between them How could he poor dear idiot Agricultural depression a splendid pauper He has only the estate and that s in Essex land going begging worth nothing a year encumbered up to the eyes and loaded with first rent charges jointures settlements Money indeed poor Kynaston It s my brother Marmaduke s I mean lucky dog he went in for speculation began life as a guinea pig and rose with the rise of soap and cocoa He s worth his half million Oh mister Marmaduke Ashurst Lady Georgina nodded Marmy s a fool she said briefly but he knows which side of his bread is buttered And mister Tillington is his nephew Bless the child yes have you never read your British Bible the peerage Astonishing the ignorance of these Girton girls They don t even know the Leger s run at Doncaster The family name s Ashurst Kynaston s an earl I was Lady Georgina Ashurst before I took it into my head to marry and do for poor Evelyn Fawley My younger brother s the Honourable Marmaduke Ashurst women get the best of it there it s about the only place where they do get the best of it an earl s daughter is Lady Betty his son s nothing more than the Honourable Tom So one scores off one s brothers My younger sister Lady Guinevere Ashurst married Stanley Tillington of the Foreign Office Harold s their eldest son Now child do you grasp it Perfectly I answered You speak like Debrett Has issue Harold And Harold will inherit all Marmaduke s money What I m always afraid of is that some fascinating adventuress will try to marry him out of hand A pretty face and over goes Harold My business in life is to stand in the way and prevent it She looked me through and through again with her X ray scrutiny I don t think mister Tillington is quite the sort that falls a prey to adventuresses I answered boldly Ah but there are faggots and faggots the old lady said wagging her head with profound meaning Never mind though I d like to see an adventuress marry off Harold without my leave I d lead her a life I d turn her black hair gray for her I should think I assented you could do it Lady Georgina if you gave your attention seriously to it From that moment forth I was aware that my Cantankerous Old Lady s malign eye was inexorably fixed upon me every time I went within speaking distance of mister Tillington She watched him like a lynx She watched me like a dozen lynxes Wherever we went Lady Georgina was sure to turn up in the neighbourhood She was perfectly ubiquitous she seemed to possess a world wide circulation I don t know whether it was this constant suggestion of hers that I was stalking her nephew which roused my latent human feeling of opposition but in the end I began to be aware that I rather liked the supercilious attache than otherwise He evidently liked me and he tried to meet me Whenever he spoke to me indeed it was without the superciliousness which marked his manner towards others in point of fact it was with graceful deference He watched for me on the stairs in the garden by the terrace whenever he got a chance he sidled over and talked to me Sometimes he stopped in to read me Heine he also introduced me to select portions of Gabriele d Annunzio It is feminine to be touched by such obvious attention I confess before long I grew to like mister Harold Tillington The closer he followed me up the more did I perceive that Lady Georgina threw out acrid hints with increasing spleen about the ways of adventuresses They were hints of that acrimonious generalised kind too which one cannot answer back without seeming to admit that the cap has fitted It was atrocious how middle class young women nowadays ran after young men of birth and fortune A girl would stoop to anything in order to catch five hundred thousand Guileless youths should be thrown among their natural equals It was a mistake to let them see too much of people of a lower rank who consider themselves good looking And the clever ones were the worst they pretended to go in for intellectual companionship I also noticed that though at first Lady Georgina had expressed the strongest disinclination to my leaving her after the time originally proposed she now began to take for granted that I would go at the end of my week as arranged in London and she even went on to some overt steps towards securing the help of the blameless Gretchen We had arrived at Schlangenbad on Tuesday I was to stop with the Cantankerous Old Lady till the corresponding day of the following week On the Sunday I wandered out on the wooded hillside behind the village and as I mounted the path I was dimly aware by a sort of instinct that Harold Tillington was following me He came up with me at last near a ledge of rock How fast you walk he exclaimed I gave you only a few minutes start and yet even my long legs have had hard work to overtake you I am a fairly good climber I answered sitting down on a little wooden bench You see at Cambridge I went on the river a great deal I canoed and sculled and then besides I ve done a lot of bicycling What a splendid birthright it is he cried to be a wholesome athletic English girl You can t think how one admires English girls after living a year or two in Italy where women are dolls except for a brief period of intrigue before they settle down to be contented frumps with an outline like a barrel A little muscle and a little mind are no doubt advisable adjuncts for a housewife I admitted You shall not say that word he cried seating himself at my side It is a word for Germans housewife Our English ideal is something immeasurably higher and better A companion a complement

none	none	 it always sickens me when I hear German students sentimentalising over their maedchen their beautiful pure insipid yellow haired blue eyed maedchen her so fair so innocent so unapproachably vacuous so like a wax doll and then think of how they design her in days to come to cook sausages for their dinner and knit them endless stockings through a placid middle age till the needles drop from her paralysed fingers and she retires into frilled caps and Teutonic senility You seem to have almost as low an opinion of foreigners as your respected aunt I exclaimed looking quizzically at him He drew back surprised Oh no I m not narrow minded like my aunt I hope he answered I am a good cosmopolitan I allow Continental nations all their own good points and each has many But their women Miss Cayley and their point of view of their women you will admit that there they can t hold a candle to English women I drew a circle in the dust with the tip of my parasol On that issue I may not be a wholly unprejudiced observer I answered The fact of my being myself an Englishwoman may possibly to some extent influence my judgment You are sarcastic he cried drawing away Not at all I answered making a wider circle I spoke a simple fact But what is your ideal then as opposed to the German one He gazed at me and hesitated His lips half parted My ideal he said after a pause Well my ideal do you happen to have such a thing as a pocket mirror about you I laughed in spite of myself Now mister Tillington I said severely if you re going to pay compliments I shall have to return If you want to stop here with me you must remember that I am only Lady Georgina Fawley s temporary lady s maid Besides I didn t mean that I meant what is your ideal of a man s right relation to his maedchen Don t say maedchen he cried petulantly It sounds as if you thought me one of those sentimental Germans I hate sentiment Then towards the woman of his choice He glanced up through the trees at the light overhead and spoke more slowly than ever I think he said fumbling his watch chain nervously a man ought to wish the woman he loves to be a free agent his equal in point of action even as she is nobler and better than he in all spiritual matters I think he ought to desire for her a life as high as she is capable of leading with full scope for every faculty of her intellect or her emotional nature She should be beautiful with a vigorous wholesome many sided beauty moral intellectual physical yet with soul in her too and with the soul and the mind lighting up her eyes as it lights up well that is immaterial And if a man can discover such a woman as that and can induce her to believe in him to love him to accept him though how such a woman can be satisfied with any man at all is to me unfathomable well then I think he should be happy in devoting his whole life to her and should give himself up to repay her condescension in taking him And you hate sentiment I put in smiling Illustration MISS CAYLEY HE SAID YOU ARE PLAYING WITH ME He brought his eyes back from the sky suddenly Miss Cayley he said this is cruel I was in earnest You are playing with me I believe the chief characteristic of the English girl is supposed to be common sense I answered calmly and I trust I possess it But indeed as he spoke my heart was beginning to make its beat felt for he was a charming young man he had a soft voice and lustrous eyes it was a summer s day and alone in the woods with one other person where the sunlight falls mellow in spots like a leopard s skin one is apt to remember that we are all human That evening Lady Georgina managed to blurt out more malicious things than ever about the ways of adventuresses and the duty of relations in saving young men from the clever clutches of designing creatures She was ruthless in her rancour her gibes stung me On Monday at breakfast I asked her casually if she had yet found a Gretchen No she answered in a gloomy voice All slatterns my dear all slatterns Brought up in pig sties I wouldn t let one of them touch my hair for thousands That s unfortunate I said drily for you know I m going to morrow If I had dropped a bomb in their midst they couldn t have looked more astonished To morrow Lady Georgina gasped clutching my arm You don t mean it child you don t mean it I asserted my Ego Certainly I answered with my coolest air I said I thought I could manage you for a week and I have managed you She almost burst into tears But my child my child what shall I do without you The unsophisticated Gretchen I answered trying not to look concerned for in my heart of hearts in spite of her innuendoes I had really grown rather to like the Cantankerous Old Lady She rose hastily from the table and darted up to her own room Lois she said as she rose in a curious voice of mingled regret and suspicion I will talk to you about this later I could see she was not quite satisfied in her own mind whether Harold Tillington and I had not arranged this coup together I put on my hat and strolled off into the garden and then along the mossy hill path In a minute more Harold Tillington was beside me He seated me half against my will on a rustic bench Look here Miss Cayley he said with a very earnest face is this really true Are you going to morrow My voice trembled a little Yes I answered biting my lip I am going I see several reasons why I should go mister Tillington But so soon Yes I think so the sooner the better My heart was racing now and his eyes pleaded mutely Then where are you going I shrugged my shoulders and pouted my lips a little I don t know I replied The world is all before me where to choose I am an adventuress I said it boldly and I am in quest of adventures I really have not yet given a thought to my next place of sojourn But you will let me know when you have decided It was time to speak out No mister Tillington I said with decision I will not let you know One of my reasons for going is that I think I had better see no more of you He flung himself on the bench at my side and folded his hands in a helpless attitude But Miss Cayley he cried this is so short a notice you give a fellow no chance I hoped I might have seen more of you might have had some opportunity of of letting you realise how deeply I admired and respected you some opportunity of showing myself as I really am to you before before he paused and looked hard at me I did not know what to say I really liked him so much and when he spoke in that voice I could not bear to seem cruel to him Indeed I was aware at the moment how much I had grown to care for him in those six short days But I knew it was impossible Don t say it mister Tillington I murmured turning my face away The less said the sooner mended But I must he cried I must tell you now if I am to have no chance afterwards I wanted you to see more of me before I ventured to ask you if you could ever love me if you could ever suffer me to go through life with you to share my all with you He seized my trembling hand Lois he cried in a pleading voice I must ask you I can t expect you to answer me now but do say you will give me at least some other chance of seeing you and then in time of pressing my suit upon you Tears stood in my eyes He was so earnest so charming But I remembered Lady Georgina and his prospective half million I moved his hand away gently I cannot I said I cannot I am a penniless girl an adventuress Your family your uncle would never forgive you if you married me I will not stand in your way I I like you very much though I have seen so little of you But I feel it is impossible and I am going to morrow Illustration I ROSE OF A SUDDEN AND RAN DOWN THE HILL Then I rose of a sudden and ran down the hill with all my might lest I should break my resolve never stopping once till I reached my own bedroom An hour later Lady Georgina burst in upon me in high dudgeon Why Lois my child she cried What s this What on earth does it mean Harold tells me he has proposed to you proposed to you and you ve rejected him I dried my eyes and tried to look steadily at her Yes Lady Georgina I faltered You need not be afraid I have refused him and I mean it She looked at me all aghast And you mean it she repeated You mean to refuse him Then all I can say is Lois Cayley I call it pure cheek of you What I cried drawing back Yes cheek she answered volubly Forty thousand a year and a good old family Harold Tillington is my nephew he s an earl s grandson he s an attache at Rome and he s bound to be one of the richest commoners in England Who are you I d like to know miss that you dare to reject him I stared at her amazed But Lady Georgina I cried you said you wished to protect your nephew against bare faced adventuresses who were setting their caps at him She fixed her eyes on me half angry half tremulous Of course she answered with withering scorn But then I thought you were trying to catch him He tells me now you won t have him and you won t tell him where you are going I call it sheer insolence Where do you hail from girl that you should refuse my nephew A man that any woman in England would be proud to marry Forty thousand a year and an earl s grandson That s what comes I suppose of going to Girton I drew myself up Lady Georgina I said coldly I cannot allow you to use such language to me I promised to accompany you to Germany for a week and I have kept my word I like your nephew I respect your nephew he has behaved like a gentleman But I will not marry him Your own conduct showed me in the plainest way that you did not judge such a match desirable for him and I have common sense enough to see that you were quite right I am a lady by birth and education I am an officer s daughter but I am not what society calls a good match for mister Tillington He had better marry into a rich stockbroker s family It was an unworthy taunt the moment it escaped my lips I regretted it Illustration I WAS GOING TO OPPOSE YOU AND HAROLD To my intense surprise however Lady Georgina flung herself on my bed and burst into tears My dear she sobbed out covering her face with her hands I thought you would be sure to set your cap at Harold and after I had seen you for twenty four hours I said to myself That s just the sort of girl Harold ought to fall in love with I felt sure he would fall in love with you I brought you here on purpose I saw you had all the qualities that would strike Harold s fancy So I had made up my mind for a delightful regulation family quarrel I was going to oppose you and Harold tooth and nail I was going to threaten that Marmy would leave his money to Kynaston s eldest son I was going to kick up oh a dickens of a row about it Then of course in the end we should all have been reconciled we should have kissed and made friends for you re just the one girl in the world for Harold indeed I never met anybody so capable and so intelligent And now you spoil all my sport by going and refusing him It s really most ill timed of you And Harold has sent me here he s trembling with anxiety to see whether I can t induce you to think better of your decision I made up my mind at once No Lady Georgina I said in my gentlest voice positively stooping down and kissing her I like mister Tillington very much I dare not tell you how much I like him He is a dear good kind fellow But I cannot rest under the cruel imputation of being moved by his wealth and having tried to capture him Even if you didn t think so his family would I am sorry to go for in a way I like you But it is best to adhere to our original plan If I changed my mind you might change yours again Let us say no more I will go to morrow But you will see Harold again Not alone Only at dinner For I feared lest if he spoke to me alone he might over persuade me Then at least you will tell him where you are going No Lady Georgina I do not know myself And besides it is best that this should now be final She flung herself upon me But my dear child a lady can t go out into the world with only two pounds in pocket You must let me lend you something I unwound her clasping hands No dear Lady Georgina I said though I was loth to say it You are very sweet and good but I must work out my life in my own way I have started to work it out and I won t be turned aside just here on the threshold And you won t stop with me she cried opening her arms You think me too cantankerous I think you have a dear kind old heart I said under the quaintest and crustiest outside such a heart ever wore you re a truculent old darling so that s the plain truth of it She kissed me I kissed her in return with fervour though I am but a poor hand at kissing for a woman So now this episode is concluded I murmured I don t know about that she said drying her eyes I have set my heart upon you now and Harold has set his heart upon you and considering that your own heart goes much the same way I daresay my dear we shall find in the end some convenient road out of it Nevertheless next morning I set out by myself in the coach from Schlangenbad I went forth into the world to live my own life partly because it was just then so fashionable but mainly because fate had denied me the chance of living anybody else s III THE ADVENTURE OF THE INQUISITIVE AMERICAN In one week I had multiplied my capital two hundred and forty fold I left London with twopence in the world I quitted Schlangenbad with two pounds in pocket There s a splendid turn over I thought to myself If this luck holds at the same rate I shall have made four hundred and eighty pounds by Tuesday next and I may look forward to being a Barney Barnato by Christmas For I had taken high mathematical honours at Cambridge and if there is anything on earth on which I pride myself it is my firm grasp of the principle of ratios Still in spite of this brilliant financial prospect a budding Klondike I went away from the little Spa on the flanks of the Taunus with a heavy heart I had grown quite to like dear virulent fidgety old Lady Georgina and I felt that it had cost me a distinct wrench to part with Harold Tillington The wrench left a scar which was long in healing but as I am not a professional sentimentalist I will not trouble you here with details of the symptoms My livelihood however was now assured me With two pounds in pocket a sensible girl can read her title clear to six days board and lodging at six marks a day with a glorious margin of four marks over for pocket money And if at the end of six days my fairy godmother had not pointed me out some other means of earning my bread honestly well I should feel myself unworthy to be ranked in the noble army of adventuresses I thank thee Lady Georgina for teaching me that word An adventuress I would be for I loved adventure Meanwhile it occurred to me that I might fill up the interval by going to study art at Frankfort Elsie Petheridge had been there and had impressed upon me the fact that I must on no account omit to see the Staedel Gallery She was strong on culture Besides the study of art should be most useful to an adventuress for she must need all the arts that human skill has developed So to Frankfort I betook myself and found there a nice little pension for ladies only Frau Bockenheifner assured me at very moderate rates in a pleasant part of the Lindenstrasse It had dimity curtains I will not deny that as I entered the house I was conscious of feeling lonely my heart sank once or twice as I glanced round the luncheon table at the domestically unsympathetic German old maids who formed the rank and file of my fellow boarders There they sat eight comfortable Fraus who had missed their vocation plentiful ladies bulging and surging in tightly stretched black silk bodices They had been cut out for such housewives as Harold Tillington had described but found themselves deprived of their natural sphere in life by the unaccountable caprice of the men of their nation Each was a model Teutonic matron manquee Each looked capable of frying Frankfort sausages to a turn and knitting woollen socks to a remote eternity But I sought in vain for one kindred soul among them How horrified they would have been with their fat pudding faces and big saucer eyes had I boldly announced myself as an English adventuress I spent my first morning in laborious self education at the Ariadneum and the Staedel Gallery I borrowed a catalogue I wrestled with Van der Weyden I toiled like a galley slave at Meister Wilhelm and Meister Stephan I have a confused recollection that I saw a number of stiff mediaeval pictures and an alabaster statue of the lady who smiled as she rode on a tiger taken at the beginning of that interesting episode But the remainder of the Institute has faded from my memory In the afternoon I consoled myself for my herculean efforts in the direction of culture by going out for a bicycle ride on a hired machine to which end I decided to devote my pocket money You will perhaps object here that my conduct was imprudent To raise that objection is to misunderstand the spirit of these artless adventures I told you that I set out to go round the world but to go round the world does not necessarily mean to circumnavigate it My idea was to go round by easy stages seeing the world as I went as far as I got and taking as little heed as possible of the morrow Most of my readers no doubt accept that philosophy of life on Sundays only on week days they swallow the usual contradictory economic platitudes about prudential forethought and the horrid improvidence of the lower classes For myself I am not built that way I prefer to take life in a spirit of pure inquiry I put on my hat I saunter where I choose so far as circumstances permit and I wait to see what chance will bring me My ideal is breeziness The hired bicycle was not a bad machine as hired bicycles go it jolted one as little as you can expect from a common hack it never stopped at a Bier Garten and it showed very few signs of having been ridden by beginners with an unconquerable desire to tilt at the hedgerow So off I soared at once heedless of the jeers of Teutonic youth who found the sight of a lady riding a cycle in skirts a strange one for in South Germany the rational costume is so universal among women cyclists that tis the skirt that provokes unfavourable comment from those jealous guardians of female propriety the street boys I hurried on at a brisk pace past the Palm Garden and the suburbs with my loose hair straying on the breeze behind till I found myself pedalling at a good round pace on a broad level road which led towards a village by name Fraunheim As I scurried across the plain with the wind in my face not unpleasantly I had some dim consciousness of somebody unknown flying after me headlong My first idea was that Harold Tillington had hunted me down and tracked me to my lair but gazing back I saw my pursuer was a tall and ungainly man with a straw coloured moustache apparently American and that he was following me on his machine closely watching my action He had such a cunning expression on his face and seemed so strangely inquisitive with eyes riveted on my treadles that I didn t quite like the look of him I put on the pace to see if I could outstrip him for I am a swift cyclist But his long legs were too much for me He did not gain on me it is true but neither did I outpace him Pedalling my very hardest and I can make good time when necessary I still kept pretty much at the same distance in front of him all the way to Fraunheim Illustration HE KEPT CLOSE AT MY HEELS Gradually I began to feel sure that the weedy looking man with the alert face was really pursuing me When I went faster he went faster too when I gave him a chance to pass me he kept close at my heels and appeared to be keenly watching the style of my ankle action I gathered that he was a connoisseur but why on earth he should persecute me I could not imagine My spirit was roused now I pedalled with a will if I rode all day I would not let him go past me Beyond the cobble paved chief street of Fraunheim the road took a sharp bend and began to mount the slopes of the Taunus suddenly It was an abrupt steep climb but I flatter myself I am a tolerable mountain cyclist I rode sturdily on my pursuer darted after me But on this stiff upward grade my light weight and agile ankle action told I began to distance him He seemed afraid that I would give him the slip and called out suddenly with a whoop in English Stop miss I looked back with dignity but answered nothing He put on the pace panting I pedalled away and got clear from him Illustration I WAS PULLED UP SHORT BY A MOUNTED POLICEMAN At a turn of the corner however as luck would have it I was pulled up short by a mounted policeman He blocked the road with his horse like an ogre and asked me in a very gruff Swabian voice if this was a licensed bicycle I had no idea till he spoke that any license was required though to be sure I might have guessed it for modern Germany is studded with notices at all the street corners to inform you in minute detail that everything is forbidden I stammered out that I did not know The mounted policeman drew near and inspected me rudely It is strongly undersaid he began but just at that moment my pursuer came up and with American quickness took in the situation He accosted the policeman in choice bad German I have two licenses he said producing a handful The Fraeulein rides with me I was too much taken aback at so providential an interposition to contradict this highly imaginative statement My highwayman had turned into a protecting knight errant of injured innocence I let the policeman go his way then I glanced at my preserver A very ordinary modern saint George he looked with no lance to speak of and no steed but a bicycle Yet his mien was reassuring Good morning miss he began he called me Miss every time he addressed me as though he took me for a barmaid Ex cuse me but why did you want to speed her I thought you were pursuing me I answered a little tremulous I will confess but avid of incident And if I was he went on you might have con jectured miss it was for our mutual advantage A business man don t go out of his way unless he expects to turn an honest dollar and he don t reckon on other folks going out of theirs unless he knows he can put them in the way of turning an honest dollar with him That s reasonable I answered for I am a political economist The benefit should be mutual But I wondered if he was going to propose at sight to me He looked me all up and down You re a lady of con siderable personal attractions he said musingly as if he were criticising a horse and I want one that sort That s jest why I trailed you see Besides which there s some style about you Style I repeated Yes he went on you know how to use your feet and you have good understandings I gathered from his glance that he referred to my nether limbs We are all vertebrate animals why seek to conceal the fact I fail to follow you I answered frigidly for I really didn t know what the man might say next Illustration SEEMS I DIDN T MAKE MUCH OF A JOB OF IT That s so he replied It was I that followed you seems I didn t make much of a job of it either anyway I mounted my machine again Well good morning I said coldy I am much obliged for your kind assistance but your remark was fictitious and I desire to go on unaccompanied He held up his hand in warning You ain t going he cried horrified You ain t going without hearing me I mean business say Don t chuck away good money like that I tell you there s dollars in it In what I asked still moving on but curious On the slope if need were I could easily distance him Why in this cycling of yours he replied You re jest about the very woman I m looking for miss Lithe that s what I call you I kin put you in the way of making your pile I kin This is a bona fide offer No flies on my business You decline it Prejudice Injures you injures me Be reasonable anyway I looked round and laughed Formulate yourself I said briefly He rose to it like a man Meet me at Fraunheim corner by the Post Office ten o clock to morrow morning he shouted as I rode off and ef I don t convince you there s money in this job my name s not Cyrus W Hitchcock Something about his keen unlovely face impressed me with a sense of his underlying honesty Very well I answered I ll come if you follow me no further I reflected that Fraunheim was a populous village and that only beyond it did the mountain road over the Taunus begin to grow lonely If he wished to cut my throat I was well within reach of the resources of civilisation When I got home to the Abode of Blighted Fraus that evening I debated seriously with myself whether or not I should accept mister Cyrus W Hitchcock s mysterious invitation Prudence said no curiosity said yes I put the question to a meeting of one and since I am a daughter of Eve curiosity had it Carried unanimously I think I might have hesitated indeed had it not been for the Blighted Fraus Their talk was of dinner and of the digestive process they were critics of digestion They each of them sat so complacently through the evening solid and stolid stodgy and podgy stuffed comatose images knitting white woollen shawls to throw over their capacious shoulders at table d hote and they purred with such content in their middle aged rotundity that I made up my mind I must take warning betimes and avoid their temptations to adipose deposit I prefer to grow upwards the Frau grows sideways Better get my throat cut by an American desperado in my pursuit of romance than settle down on a rock like a placid fat oyster I am not by nature sessile Adventures are to the adventurous They abound on every side but only the chosen few have the courage to embrace them And they will not come to you you must go out to seek them Then they meet you half way and rush into your arms for they know their true lovers There were eight Blighted Fraus at the Home for Lost Ideals and I could tell by simple inspection that they had not had an average of half an adventure per lifetime between them They sat and knitted still like Awful Examples If I had declined to meet mister Hitchcock at Fraunheim I know not what changes it might have induced in my life I might now be knitting But I went boldly forth on a voyage of exploration prepared to accept aught that fate held in store for me As mister Hitchcock had assured me there was money in his offer I felt justified in speculating I expended another three marks on the hire of a bicycle though I ran the risk thereby of going perhaps without Monday s dinner That showed my vocation The Blighted Fraus I felt sure would have clung to their dinner at all hazards When I arrived at Fraunheim I found my alert American punctually there before me He raised his crush hat with awkward politeness I could see he was little accustomed to ladies society Then he pointed to a close cab in which he had reached the village I ve got it inside he whispered in a confidential tone I couldn t let em ketch sight of it You see there s dollars in it What have you got inside I asked suspiciously drawing back I don t know why but the word it somehow suggested a corpse I began to grow frightened Why the wheel of course he answered Ain t you come here to ride it Oh the wheel I echoed vaguely pretending to look wise but unaware as yet that that word was the accepted Americanism for a cycle And I have come to ride it Why certainly he replied jerking his hand towards the cab But we mustn t start right here This thing has got to be kept dark don t you see till the last day Till the last day That was ominous It sounded like monomania So ghostly and elusive I began to suspect my American ally of being a dangerous madman Jest you wheel away a bit up the hill he went on out o sight of the folks and I ll fetch her along to you Her I cried Who For the man bewildered me Why the wheel miss You understand This is business you bet And you re jest the right woman He motioned me on Urged by a sort of spell I remounted my machine and rode out of the village He followed on the box seat of his cab Then when we had left the world well behind and stood among the sun smitten boles of the pine trees he opened the door mysteriously and produced from the vehicle a very odd looking bicycle It was clumsy to look at It differed immensely in many particulars from any machine I had yet seen or ridden The strenuous American fondled it for a moment with his hand as if it were a pet child Then he mounted nimbly Pride shone in his eye I saw in a second he was a fond inventor He rode a few yards on Next he turned to me eagerly This ma chine he said in an impressive voice is pro pelled by an eccentric Like all his countrymen he laid most stress on unaccented syllables Oh I knew you were an eccentric I said the moment I set eyes upon you He surveyed me gravely You misunderstand me miss he corrected When I say an eccentric I mean a crank They are much the same thing I answered briskly Though I confess I would hardly have applied so rude a word as crank to you He looked me over suspiciously as if I were trying to make game of him but my face was sphinx like So he brought the machine a yard or two nearer and explained its construction to me He was quite right it was driven by a crank It had no chain but was moved by a pedal working narrowly up and down and attached to a rigid bar which impelled the wheels by means of an eccentric Besides this it had a curious device for altering the gearing automatically while one rode so as to enable one to adapt it to the varying slope in mounting hills This part of the mechanism he explained to me elaborately There was a gauge in front which allowed one to sight the steepness of the slope by mere inspection and according as the gauge marked one two three or four as its gradient on the scale the rider pressed a button on the handle bar with his left hand once twice thrice or four times so that the gearing adapted itself without an effort to the rise in the surface Besides there were devices for rigidity and compensation Altogether it was a most apt and ingenious piece of mechanism I did not wonder he was proud of it Get up and ride miss he said in a persuasive voice I did as I was bid To my immense surprise I ran up the steep hill as smoothly and easily as if it were a perfectly laid level Goes nicely doesn t she mister Hitchcock murmured rubbing his hands Beautifully I answered One could ride such a machine up Mont Blanc I should fancy He stroked his chin with nervous fingers It ought to knock em he said in an eager voice It s geared to run up most anything in creation How steep One foot in three That s good Yes It ll climb Mount Washington What do you call it I asked He looked me over with close scrutiny In Amurrica he said slowly we call it the Great Manitou because it kin do pretty well what it chooses but in Europe I am thinking of calling it the Martin Conway or the Whymper or something like that Why so Well because it s a famous mountain climber I see I said With such a machine you ll put a notice on the Matterhorn This hill is dangerous to cyclists He laughed low to himself and rubbed his hands again You ll do miss he said You re the right sort you are The moment I seen you I thought we two could do a trade together Benefits me benefits you A mutual advantage Reciprocity is the soul of business You hev some go in you you hev There s money in your feet You ll give these Meinherrs fits You ll take the clear starch out of them I fail to catch on I answered speaking his own dialect to humour him Oh you ll get there all the same he replied stroking his machine meanwhile It was a squirrel it was He pronounced it squirl It ud run up a tree ef it wanted wouldn t it He was talking to it now as if it were a dog or a baby There there it mustn t kick it was a frisky little thing Jest you step up on it miss and have a go at that there mountain I stepped up and had a go The machine bounded forward like an agile greyhound You had but to touch it and it ran of itself Never had I ridden so vivacious so animated a cycle I returned to him sailing with the gradient reversed The Manitou glided smoothly as on a gentle slope without the need for back pedalling It soars he remarked with enthusiasm Balloons are at discount beside it I answered Now you want to know about this business I guess he went on You want to know jest where the reciprocity comes in anyhow I am ready to hear you expound I admitted smiling Oh it ain t all on one side he continued eyeing his machine at an angle with parental affection I m a going to make your fortune right here You shall ride her for me on the last day and ef you pull this thing off don t you be scared that I won t treat you handsome If you were a little more succinct I said gravely we should get forrader faster Perhaps you wonder he put in that with money on it like this I should intrust the job into the hands of a female I winced but was silent Well it s like this don t you see ef a female wins it makes success all the more striking and con spicuous The world to day is ruled by adver tize ment I could stand it no longer mister Hitchcock I said with dignity I haven t the remotest idea what on earth you are talking about He gazed at me with surprise What he exclaimed at last And you kin cycle like that Not know what all the cycling world is mad about Why you don t mean to tell me you re not a pro fessional I enlightened him at once as to my position in society which was respectable if not lucrative His face fell somewhat High toned eh Still you d run all the same wouldn t you he inquired Run for what I asked innocently Parliament The Presidency The Frankfort Town Council He had difficulty in fathoming the depths of my ignorance But by degrees I understood him It seemed that the German Imperial and Prussian Royal Governments had offered a Kaiserly and Kingly prize for the best military bicycle the course to be run over the Taunus from Frankfort to Limburg the winning machine to get the equivalent of a thousand pounds each firm to supply its own make and rider The last day was Saturday next and the Great Manitou was the dark horse of the contest Then all was clear as day to me mister Cyrus W Hitchcock was keeping his machine a profound secret he wanted a woman to ride it so that his triumph might be the more complete and the moment he saw me pedal up the hill in trying to avoid him he recognised at once that I was that woman I recognised it too Twas a pre ordained harmony After two or three trials I felt that the Manitou was built for me and I was built for the Manitou We ran together like parts of one mechanism I was always famed for my circular ankle action and in this new machine ankle action was everything Strength of limb counted for naught what told was the power of clawing up again promptly I possess that power I have prehistoric feet my remote progenitors must certainly have been tree haunting monkeys We arranged terms then and there You accept Implicitly If I pulled off the race I was to have fifty pounds If I didn t I was to have five It ain t only your skill you see mister Hitchcock said with frank commercialism It s your personal attractiveness as well that I go upon That s an element to consider in business relations My face is my fortune I answered gravely He nodded acquiescence Till Saturday then I was free Meanwhile I trained and practised quietly with the Manitou in sequestered parts of the hills I also took spells turn about at the Staedel Institute I like to intersperse culture and athletics I know something about athletics and hope in time to acquire a taste for culture Tis expected of a Girton girl though my own accomplishments run rather towards rowing punting bicycling On Saturday I confess I rose with great misgivings I was not a professional and to find oneself practically backed for a thousand pounds in a race against men is a trifle disquieting Still having once put my hand to the plough I felt I was bound to pull it through somehow I dressed my hair neatly in a very tight coil I ate a light breakfast eschewing the fried sausages which the Blighted Fraus pressed upon my notice and satisfying myself with a gently boiled egg and some toast and coffee I always found I rowed best at Cambridge on the lightest diet in my opinion the raw beef regime is a serious error in training At a minute or two before eleven I turned up at the Schiller Platz in my short serge dress and cycling jacket The great square was thronged with spectators to see us start the police made a lane through their midst for the riders My backer had advised me to come to the post as late as possible For I have entered your name he said simply as Lois Cayley These Deutschers don t think but what you re a man and a brother But I am apprehensive of con tingencies When you put in a show they ll try to raise objections to you on account of your being a female There won t be much time though and I shall rush the objections Once they let you run and win it don t matter to me whether I get the twenty thousand marks or not It s the adver tize ment that tells Jest you mark my words miss and don t you make no mistake about it the world to day is governed by adver tize ment So I turned up at the last moment and cast a timid glance at my competitors They were all men of course and two of them were German officers in a sort of undress cycling uniform They eyed me superciliously One of them went up and spoke to the Herr Over Superintendent who had charge of the contest I understood him to be lodging an objection against a mere woman taking part in the race The Herr Over Superintendent a bulky official came up beside me and perpended visibly He bent his big brows to it Twas appalling to observe the measurable amount of Teutonic cerebration going on under cover of his round green glasses He was perpending for some minutes Time was almost up Then he turned to mister Hitchcock having finally made up his colossal mind and murmured rudely The woman cannot compete Why not I inquired in my very sweetest German with an angelic smile though my heart trembled Warum nicht Because the word rider in the Kaiserly and Kingly for this contest provided decree is distinctly in the masculine gender stated Pardon me Herr Over Superintendent I replied pulling out a copy of Law ninety seven on the subject with which I had duly provided myself if you will to Section forty five of the Bicycles Circulation Regulation Act your attention turn you will find it therein expressly enacted that unless any clause be anywhere to the contrary inserted the word rider in the masculine gender put shall here the word rideress in the feminine to embrace be considered For anticipating this objection I had taken the precaution to look the legal question up beforehand That is true the Herr Over Superintendent observed in a musing voice gazing down at me with relenting eyes The masculine habitually embraces the feminine And he brought his massive intellect to bear upon the problem once more with prodigious concentration I seized my opportunity Let me start at least I urged holding out the Act If I win you can the matter more fully with the Kaiserly and Kingly Governments hereafter argue out I guess this will be an international affair mister Hitchcock remarked well pleased It would be a first rate adver tize ment for the Great Manitou ef England and Germany were to make the question into a casus belli The United States could look on and pocket the chestnuts Two minutes to go the official starter with the watch called out Fall in then Fraeulein Englaenderin the Herr Over Superintendent observed without prejudice waving me into line He pinned a badge with a large number seven on my dress The Kaiserly and Kingly Governments shall on the affair of the starting s legality hereafter on my report more at leisure pass judgment The lieutenant in undress uniform drew back a little Oh if this is to be woman s play he muttered then can a Prussian officer himself by competing not into contempt bring I dropped a little curtsy If the Herr Lieutenant is afraid even to enter against an Englishwoman I said smiling He came up to the scratch sullenly One minute to go called out the starter We were all on the alert There was a pause a deep breath I was horribly frightened but I tried to look calm Then sharp and quick came the one word Go And like arrows from a bow off we all started I had ridden over the whole course the day but one before on a mountain pony with an observant eye and my sedulous American rising at five o clock so as not to excite undue attention and I therefore knew beforehand the exact route we were to follow but I confess when I saw the Prussian lieutenant and one of my other competitors dash forward at a pace that simply astonished me that fifty pounds seemed to melt away in the dim abyss of the Ewigkeit I gave up all for lost I could never make the running against such practised cyclists Illustration DON T SCORCH MISS DON T SCORCH However we all turned out into the open road which leads across the plain and down the Main valley in the direction of Mayence For the first ten miles or so it is a dusty level The surface is perfect but twas a blinding white thread As I toiled along it that broiling June day I could hear the voice of my backer who followed on horseback exhorting me in loud tones Don t scorch miss don t scorch never mind ef you lose sight of em Keep your wind that s the point The wind the wind s everything Let em beat you on the level you ll catch em up fast enough when you get on the Taunus But in spite of his encouragement I almost lost heart as I saw one after another of my opponents backs disappear in the distance till at last I was left toiling along the bare white road alone in a shower bath of sunlight with just a dense cloud of dust rising gray far ahead of me My head swam It repented me of my boldness Then the riders on horseback began to grumble for by police regulation they were not allowed to pass the hindmost of the cyclists and they were kept back by my presence from following up their special champions Give it up Fraeulein give it up they cried You re beaten Let us pass and get forward But at the self same moment I heard the shrill voice of my American friend whooping aloud across the din Don t you do nothing of the sort miss You stick to it and keep your wind It s the wind that wins Them Germans won t be worth a cent on the high slopes anyway Encouraged by his voice I worked steadily on neither scorching nor relaxing but maintaining an even pace at my natural pitch under the broiling sunshine Heat rose in waves on my face from the road below in the thin white dust the accusing tracks of six wheels confronted me Still I kept on following them till I reached the town of Hoechst nine miles from Frankfort Soldiers along the route were timing us at intervals with chronometers and noting our numbers As I rattled over the paved High Street I called aloud to one of them How far ahead the last man He shouted back good humouredly Four minutes Fraeulein Again I lost heart Then I mounted a slight slope and felt how easily the Manitou moved up the gradient From its summit I could note a long gray cloud of dust rolling steadily onward down the hill towards Hattersheim I coasted down with my feet up and a slight breeze just cooling me mister Hitchcock behind called out full throated from his seat No hurry No flurry Take your time Take your time miss Over the bridge at Hattersheim you turn to the right abruptly and begin to mount by the side of a pretty little stream the Schwarzbach which runs brawling over rocks down the Taunus from Eppstein By this time the excitement had somewhat cooled down for the moment I was getting reconciled to be beaten on the level and began to realise that my chances would be best as we approached the steepest bits of the mountain road about Niederhausen So I positively plucked up heart to look about me and enjoy the scenery With hair flying behind that coil had played me false I swept through Hofheim a pleasant little village at the mouth of a grassy valley inclosed by wooded slopes the Schwarzbach making cool music in the glen below as I mounted beside it Clambering larches like huge candelabra stood out on the ridge silhouetted against the skyline How far ahead the last man I cried to the recording soldier He answered me back Two minutes Fraeulein I was gaining on them I was gaining I thundered across the Schwarzbach by half a dozen clamorous little iron bridges making easy time now and with my feet working as if they were themselves an integral part of the machinery Up up up it looked a vertical ascent the Manitou glided well in its oil bath at its half way gearing I rode for dear life At sixteen miles Lorsbach at eighteen Eppstein the road still rising How far ahead the last man Just round the corner Fraeulein I put on a little steam Sure enough round the corner I caught sight of his back With a spurt I passed him a dust covered soul very hot and uncomfortable He had not kept his wind I flew past him like a whirlwind But oh how sultry hot in that sweltering close valley A pretty little town Eppstein with its mediaeval castle perched high on a craggy rock I owed it some gratitude I felt as I left it behind for twas here that I came up with the tail end of my opponents That one victory cheered me So far our route had lain along the well made but dusty high road in the steaming valley at Nieder Josbach two miles on we quitted the road abruptly by the course marked out for us and turned up a mountain path only wide enough for two cycles abreast a path that clambered towards the higher slopes of the Taunus That was arranged on purpose for this was no fair weather show but a practical trial for military bicycles under the conditions they might meet with in actual warfare It was rugged riding black walls of pine rose steep on either hand the ground was uncertain Our path mounted sharply from the first the steeper the better By the time I had reached Ober Josbach nestling high among larch woods I had distanced all but two of my opponents It was cooler now too As I passed the hamlet my cry altered Illustration HOW FAR AHEAD THE FIRST MAN How far ahead the first man Two minutes Fraeulein A civilian No no a Prussian officer The Herr Lieutenant led then For Old England s sake I felt I must beat him The steepest slope of all lay in the next two miles If I were going to win I must pass these two there for my advantage lay all in the climb if it came to coasting the men s mere weight scored a point in their favour Bump crash jolt I pedalled away like a machine the Manitou sobbed my ankles flew round so that I scarcely felt them But the road was rough and scarred with waterways ruts turned by rain to runnels At half a mile after a desperate struggle among sand and pebbles I passed the second man just ahead the Prussian officer looked round and saw me Thunder weather you there Englaenderin he cried darting me a look of unchivalrous dislike such as only your sentimental German can cast at a woman Illustration I AM HERE BEHIND YOU HERR LIEUTENANT Yes I am here behind you Herr Lieutenant I answered putting on a spurt and I hope next to be before you He answered not a word but worked his hardest So did I He bent forward I sat erect on my Manitou pulling hard at my handles Now my front wheel was upon him It reached his pedal We were abreast He had a narrow thread of solid path and he forced me into a runnel Still I gained He swerved I think he tried to foul me But the slope was too steep his attempt recoiled on himself he ran against the rock at the side and almost overbalanced That second lost him I waved my hand as I sailed ahead Good morning I cried gaily See you again at Limburg From the top of the slope I put my feet up and flew down into Idstein A thunder shower burst I was glad of the cool of it It laid the dust I regained the high road From that moment save for the risk of sideslips twas easy running just an undulating line with occasional ups and downs but I saw no more of my pursuers till twenty two kilometres farther on I rattled on the cobble paved causeway into Limburg I had covered the forty six miles in quick time for a mountain climb As I crossed the bridge over the Lahn to my immense surprise mister Hitchcock waved his arms all excitement to greet me He had taken the train on from Eppstein it seemed and got there before me As I dismounted at the Cathedral which was our appointed end and gave my badge to the soldier he rushed up and shook my hand Fifty pounds he cried Fifty pounds How s that for the great Anglo Saxon race And hooray for the Manitou The second man the civilian rode in wet and draggled forty seconds later As for the Herr Lieutenant a disappointed man he fell out by the way alleging a puncture I believe he was ashamed to admit the fact that he had been beaten in open fight by the objurgated Englaenderin So the end of it was I was now a woman of means with fifty pounds of my own to my credit I lunched with my backer royally at the best inn in Limburg IV THE ADVENTURE OF THE AMATEUR COMMISSION AGENT My eccentric American had assured me that if I won the great race for him I need not be skeert lest he should fail to treat me well and to do him justice I must admit that he kept his word magnanimously While we sat at lunch in the cosy hotel at Limburg he counted out and paid me in hand the fifty good gold pieces he had promised me Whether these Deutschers fork out my twenty thousand marks or not he said in his brisk way it don t much matter I shall get the contract and I shall hev gotten the adver tize ment Why do you start your bicycles in Germany though I asked innocently I should have thought myself there was so much a better chance of selling them in England Illustration LET THEM BOOM OR BUST ON IT He closed one eye and looked abstractedly at the light through his glass of pale yellow Brauneberger with the other England Yes England Well see miss you hev not been raised in business Business is business The way to do it in Germany is to manufacture for yourself and I ve got my works started right here in Frankfort The way to do it in England where capital s dirt cheap is to sell your patent for every cent it s worth to an English company and let them boom or bust on it I see I said catching at it The principle s as clear as mud the moment you point it out to one An English company will pay you well for the concession and work for a smaller return on its investment than you Americans are content to receive on your capital That s so You hit it in one miss Which will you take a cigar or a cocoa nut I smiled And what do you think you will call the machine in Europe He gazed hard at me and stroked his straw coloured moustache Well what do you think of the Lois Cayley For Heaven s sake no I cried fervently mister Hitchcock I implore you He smiled pity for my weakness Ah high toned again he repeated as if it were some natural malformation under which I laboured Oh ef you don t like it miss we ll say no more about it I am a gentleman I am What s the matter with the Excelsior Nothing except that it s very bad Latin I objected That may be so but it s very good business He paused and mused then he murmured low to himself When through an Alpine village passed That s where the idea of the Excelsior comes in see It goes up Mont Blanc you said yourself Through snow and ice A cycle with the strange device Excelsior If I were you I said I would stick to the name Manitou It s original and it s distinctive Think so Then chalk it up the thing s done You may not be aware of it miss but you are a lady for whose opinion in such matters I hev a high regard And you understand Europe I do not I admit it Everything seems to me to be verboten in Germany and everything else to be bad form in England We walked down the steps together What a picturesque old town I said looking round me well pleased Its beauty appealed to me for I had fifty pounds in pocket and I had lunched sumptuously Old town he repeated gazing with a blank stare You call this town old do you Why of course Just look at the cathedral Eight hundred years old at least He ran his eye down the streets dissatisfied Well ef this town is old he said at last with a snap of his fingers it s precious little for its age And he strode away towards the railway station What about the bicycle I asked for it lay a silent victor against the railing of the steps surrounded by a crowd of inquiring Teutons He glanced at it carelessly Oh the wheel he said You may keep it He said it so exactly in the tone in which one tells a waiter he may keep the change that I resented the impertinence No thank you I answered I do not require it He gazed at me open mouthed What Put my foot in it again he interposed Not high toned enough Eh Now I do regret it No offence meant miss nor none need be taken What I meant to in sinuate was this you hev won the big race for me Folks will notice you and talk about you at Frankfort Ef you ride a Manitou that ll make em talk the more A mutual advantage Benefits you benefits me You get the wheel I get the adver tize ment I saw that reciprocity was the lodestar of his life Very well mister Hitchcock I said pocketing my pride I ll accept the machine and I ll ride it Then a light dawned upon me I saw eventualities Look here I went on innocently recollect I was a girl just fresh from Girton I am thinking of going on very soon to Switzerland Now why shouldn t I do this try to sell your machines or rather take orders for them from anybody that admires them A mutual advantage Benefits you benefits me You sell your wheels I get He stared at me The commission I don t know what commission means I answered somewhat at sea as to the name but I thought it might be worth your while till the Manitou becomes better known to pay me say ten per cent on all orders I brought you His face was one broad smile I do admire at you miss he cried standing still to inspect me You may not know the meaning of the word commission but durned ef you haven t got a hang of the thing itself that would do honour to a Wall Street operator anyway Then that s business I asked eagerly for I beheld vistas Business he repeated Yes that s jest about the size of it business Adver tize ment miss may be the soul of commerce but Commission s its body You go in and win Ten per cent on every order you send me He insisted on taking my ticket back to Frankfort My affair miss my affair There was no gainsaying him He was immensely elated The biggest thing in cycles since Dunlop tyres he repeated And to morrow they ll give me advertizements gratis in every newspaper Next morning he came round to call on me at the Abode of Unclaimed Domestic Angels He was explicit and generous Look here miss he began I didn t do fair by you when you interviewed me about your agency last evening I took advantage at the time of your youth and inexperience You suggested ten per cent as the amount of your commission on sales you might effect and I jumped at it That was conduct unworthy of a gentleman Now I will not deceive you The ordinary commission on transactions in wheels is twenty five per cent I am going to sell the Manitou retail at twenty English pounds apiece You shall hev your twenty five per cent on all orders Five pounds for every machine I sell I exclaimed overjoyed He nodded That s so I was simply amazed at this magnificent prospect The cycle trade must be honeycombed with middlemen s profits I cried for I had my misgivings That s so he replied again Then jest you take and be a middlewoman But as a consistent socialist It is your duty to fleece the capitalist and the consumer A mutual benefit triangular this time I get the order the public gets the machine and you get the commission I am richer you are richer and the public is mounted on much the best wheel ever yet invented That sounds plausible I admitted I shall try it on in Switzerland I shall run up steep hills whenever I see any likely customers looking on then I shall stop and ask them the time as if quite accidentally He rubbed his hands You take to business like a young duck to the water he exclaimed admiringly That s the way to rake em in You go up and say to them Why not investigate We defy competition Leave the drudgery of walking uphill beside your cycle Progress is the order of the day Use modern methods This is the age of the telegraph the telephone and the typewriter You kin no longer afford to go on with an antiquated ante diluvian armour plated wheel Invest in a Hill Climber the last and lightest product of evvolootion Is it common sense to buy an old style unautomatic single geared inconvertible ten ton machine when for the same money or less you can purchase the self acting Manitou a priceless gem as light as a feather with all the most recent additions and improvements Be reasonable Get the best That s the style to fetch em I laughed in spite of myself Oh mister Hitchcock I burst out that s not my style at all I shall say simply This is a lovely new bicycle You can see for yourself how it climbs hills Try it if you wish It skims like a swallow And I get what they call five pounds commission on every one I can sell of them I think that way of dealing is much more likely to bring you in orders His admiration was undisguised Well I do call you a woman of business miss he cried You see it at a glance That s so That s the right kind of thing to rope in the Europeans Some originality about you You take em on their own ground You ve got the draw on them you hev I like your system You ll jest haul in the dollars I hope so I said fervently for I had evolved in my own mind oh such a lovely scheme for Elsie Petheridge s holidays He gazed at me once more Ef only I could get hold of a woman of business like you to soar through life with me he murmured Illustration HIS OPEN ADMIRATION WAS GETTING QUITE EMBARRASSING I grew interested in my shoes His open admiration was getting quite embarrassing He paused a minute Then he went on Well what do you say to it To what I asked amazed To my proposition my offer I I don t understand I stammered out bewildered The twenty five per cent you mean No the de votion of a lifetime he answered looking sideways at me Miss Cayley when a business man advances a proposition commercial or otherwise he advances it because he means it He asks a prompt reply Your time is valuable So is mine Are you prepared to consider it mister Hitchcock I said drawing back I think you misunderstand I think you do not realise All right miss he answered promptly though with a disappointed air Ef it kin not be managed it kin not be managed I understand your European ex clusiveness I know your prejudices But this little episode need not antagonise with the normal course of ordinary business I respect you Miss Cayley You are a lady of intelligence of initiative and of high toned culture I will wish you good day for the present without further words and I shall be happy at any time to receive your orders on the usual commission He backed out and was gone He was so honestly blunt that I really quite liked him Next day I bade a tearless farewell to the Blighted Fraus When I told those eight phlegmatic souls I was going they all said So much as they had said So to every previous remark I had been moved to make to them So is capital garnishing but viewed as a staple of conversation I find it a trifle vapid not to say monotonous I set out on my wanderings therefore to go round the world on my own account and my own Manitou which last I grew to love in time with a love passing the love of mister Cyrus Hitchcock I carried the strict necessary before me in a small waterproof bicycling valise but I sent on the portmanteau containing my whole estate real or personal to some point in advance which I hoped to reach from time to time in a day or two My first day s journey was along a pleasant road from Frankfort to Heidelberg some fifty four miles in all skirting the mountains the greater part of the way the Manitou took the ups and downs so easily that I diverged at intervals to choose side paths over the wooded hills I arrived at Heidelberg as fresh as a daisy my mount not having turned a hair meanwhile a favourite expression of cyclists which carries all the more conviction to an impartial mind because of the machine being obviously hairless Thence I journeyed on by easy stages to Karlsruhe Baden Appenweier and Offenburg where I set my front wheel resolutely for the Black Forest It is the prettiest and most picturesque route to Switzerland and being also the hilliest it would afford me I thought the best opportunity for showing off the Manitou s paces and trying my prentice hand as an amateur cycle agent From the quaint little Black Eagle at Offenburg however before I dashed into the Forest I sent off a letter to Elsie Petheridge setting forth my lovely scheme for her summer holidays She was delicate poor child and the London winters sorely tried her I was now a millionaire with the better part of fifty pounds in pocket so I felt I could afford to be royal in my hospitality As I was leaving Frankfort I had called at a tourist agency and bought a second class circular ticket from London to Lucerne and back I made it second class because I am opposed on principle to excessive luxury and also because it was three guineas cheaper Even fifty pounds will not last for ever though I could scarce believe it You see I am not wholly free after all from the besetting British vice of prudence It was a mighty joy to me to be able to send this ticket to Elsie at her lodgings in Bayswater pointing out to her that now the whole mischief was done and that if she would not come out as soon as her summer vacation began twas a point of honour with Elsie to say vacation instead of holidays to join me at Lucerne and stop with me as my guest at a mountain pension the ticket would be wasted I love burning my boats tis the only safe way for securing prompt action Then I turned my flying wheels up into the Black Forest growing weary of my loneliness for it is not all jam to ride by oneself in Germany and longing for Elsie to come out and join me I loved to think how her dear pale cheeks would gain colour and tone on the hills about the Bruenig where for business reasons so I said to myself with the conscious pride of the commission agent I proposed to pass the greater part of the summer From Offenburg to Hornberg the road makes a good stiff climb of twenty seven miles and some twelve hundred English feet in altitude with a fair number of minor undulations on the way to diversify it I will not describe the route though it is one of the most beautiful I have ever travelled rocky hills ruined castles huge straight stemmed pines that clamber up green slopes or halt in sombre line against steeps of broken crag the reality surpasses my poor powers of description And the people I passed on the road were almost as quaint and picturesque in their way as the hills and the villages the men in red lined jackets the women in black petticoats short waisted green bodices and broad brimmed straw hats with black and crimson pompons But on the steepest gradient just before reaching Hornberg I got my first nibble strange to say from two German students they wore Heidelberg caps and were toiling up the incline with short broken wind I put on a spurt with the Manitou and passed them easily I did it just at first in pure wantonness of health and strength but the moment I was clear of them it occurred to the business half of me that here was a good chance of taking an order Filled with this bright idea I dismounted near the summit and pretended to be engaged in lubricating my bearings though as a matter of fact the Manitou runs in a bath of oil self feeding and needs no looking after Presently my two Heidelbergers straggled up hot dusty panting Woman like I pretended to take no notice One of them drew near and cast an eye on the Manitou That s a new machine Fraeulein he said at last with more politeness than I expected It is I answered casually the latest model Climbs hills like no other And I feigned to mount and glide off towards Hornberg Stop a moment pray Fraeulein my prospective buyer called out Here Heinrich I wish you this new so excellent mountain climbing machine without chain propelled more fully to investigate I am going on to Hornberg I said with mixed feminine guile and commercial strategy still if your friend wishes to look Illustration MINUTE INSPECTION They both jostled round it with achs innumerable and after minute inspection pronounced its principle wunderschoen Might I essay it Heinrich asked Oh by all means I answered He paced it down hill a few yards then skimmed up again It is a bird he cried to his friend with many guttural interjections Like the eagle s flight so soars it Come try the thing Ludwig You permit Fraeulein I nodded They both mounted it several times It behaved like a beauty Then one of them asked And where can man of this new so remarkable machine nearest by purchase himself make possessor I am the Sole Agent I burst out with swelling dignity If you will give me your orders with cash in hand for the amount I will send the cycle carriage paid to any address you desire in Germany You they exclaimed incredulously The Fraeulein is pleased to be humorous Oh very well I answered vaulting into the saddle If you choose to doubt my word I waved one careless hand and coasted off Good morning meine Herren They lumbered after me on their ramshackled traction engines Pardon Fraeulein Do not thus go away Oblige us at least with the name and address of the maker I perpended like the Herr Over Superintendent at Frankfort Look here I said at last telling the truth with frankness I get twenty five per cent on all bicycles I sell I am as I say the maker s Sole Agent If you order through me I touch my profit if otherwise I do not Still since you seem to be gentlemen they bowed and swelled visibly I will give you the address of the firm trusting to your honour to mention my name I handed them a card if you decide on ordering The price of the palfrey is four hundred marks It is worth every pfennig of it And before they could say more I had spurred my steed and swept off at full speed round a curve of the highway I pencilled a note to my American that night from Hornberg detailing the circumstance but I am sorry to say for the discredit of humanity that when those two students wrote the same evening from their inn in the village to order Manitous they did not mention my name doubtless under the misconception that by suppressing it they would save my commission However it gives me pleasure to add per contra as we say in business that when I arrived at Lucerne a week or so later I found a letter poste restante from mister Cyrus Hitchcock inclosing an English ten pound note He wrote that he had received two orders for Manitous from Hornberg and feeling considerable confidence that these must necessarily originate from my German students he had the pleasure of forwarding me what he hoped would be the first of many similar commissions Illustration FELT A PERFECT LITTLE HYPOCRITE I will not describe my further adventures on the still steeper mountain road from Hornberg to Triberg and saint Georgen how I got bites on the way from an English curate an Austrian hussar and two unprotected American ladies nor how I angled for them all by riding my machine up impossible hills and then reclining gracefully to eat my lunch three times in one day on mossy banks at the summit I felt a perfect little hypocrite But mister Hitchcock had remarked that business is business and I will only add in confirmation of his view that by the time I reached Lucerne I had sown the good seed in fifteen separate human souls no less than four of which brought forth fruit in orders for Manitous before the end of the season I had now so little fear what the morrow might bring forth that I settled down in a comfortable hotel at Lucerne till Elsie s holidays began and amused myself meanwhile by picking out the hilliest roads I could find in the neighbourhood in order to display my steel steed s possibilities to the best advantage By the end of July Elsie joined me She was half angry at first that I should have forced the ticket and my hospitality upon her Nonsense dear I said smoothing her hair for her pale face quite frightened me What is the good of a friend if she will not allow you to do her little favours But Brownie you said you wouldn t stop and be dependent upon me one day longer than was necessary in London That was different I cried That was Me This is You I am a great strong healthy thing fit to fight the battle of life and take care of myself you Elsie are one of those fragile little flowers which tis everybody s duty to protect and to care for She would have protested more but I stifled her mouth with kisses Indeed for nothing did I rejoice in my prosperity so much as for the chance it gave me of helping poor dear overworked overwrought Elsie We took up our quarters thenceforth at a high perched little guest house near the top of the Bruenig It was bracing for Elsie and it lay close to a tourist track where I could spread my snares and exhibit the Manitou in its true colours to many passing visitors Elsie tried it and found she could ride on it with ease She wished she had one of her own A bright idea struck me In fear and trembling I wrote suggesting to mister Hitchcock that I had a girl friend from England stopping with me in Switzerland and that two Manitous would surely be better than one as an adver tize ment I confess I stood aghast at my own cheek but my hand I fear was rapidly growing subdued to that it worked in Anyhow I sent the letter off and waited developments By return of post came an answer from my American DEAR MISS By rail herewith please receive one lady s No four automatic quadruple geared self feeding Manitou as per your esteemed favour of July twenty seventh for which I desire to thank you The more I see of your way of doing business the more I do admire at you This is an elegant poster Two high toned English ladies mounted on Manitous careering up the Alps represent to both of us quite a mint of money The mutual benefit to me to you and to the other lady ought to be simply incalculable I shall be pleased at any time to hear of any further developments of your very remarkable advertising skill and I am obliged to you for this brilliant suggestion you have been good enough to make to me Respectfully CYRUS W HITCHCOCK What Am I to have it for nothing Brownie Elsie exclaimed bewildered when I read the letter to her I assumed the airs of a woman of the world Why certainly my dear I answered as if I always expected to find bicycles showered upon me It s a mutual arrangement Benefits him benefits you Reciprocity is the groundwork of business He gets the advertisement you get the amusement It s a form of handbill Like the ladies who exhibit their back hair don t you know in that window in Regent Street Thus inexpensively mounted we scoured the country together up the steepest hills between Stanzstadt and Meiringen We had lots of nibbles One lady in particular often stopped to look on and admire the Manitou She was a nice looking widow of forty five very fresh and round faced a missus Evelegh we soon found out who owned a charming chalet on the hills above Lungern She spoke to us more than once What a perfect dear of a machine she cried I wonder if I dare try it Can you cycle I asked I could once she answered I was awfully fond of it But doctor Fortescue Langley won t let me any longer Try it I said dismounting She got up and rode Oh isn t it just lovely she cried ecstatically Buy one I put in They re as smooth as silk they cost only twenty pounds and on every machine I sell I get five pounds commission I should love to she answered but doctor Fortescue Langley Who is he I asked I don t believe in drug drenchers She looked quite shocked Oh he s not that kind you know she put in breathlessly He s the celebrated esoteric faith healer He won t let me move far away from Lungern though I m longing to be off to England again for the summer My boy s at Portsmouth Then why don t you disobey him Her face was a study I daren t she answered in an awe struck voice He comes here every summer and he does me so much good you know He diagnoses my inner self He treats me psychically When my inner self goes wrong my bangle turns dusky She held up her right hand with an Indian silver bangle on it and sure enough it was tarnished with a very thin black deposit My soul is ailing now she said in a comically serious voice But it is seldom so in Switzerland The moment I land in England the bangle turns black and remains black till I get back to Lucerne again When she had gone I said to Elsie That is odd about the bangle State of health might affect it I suppose Though it looks to me like a surface deposit of sulphide I knew nothing of chemistry I admit but I had sometimes messed about in the laboratory at college with some of the other girls and I remembered now that sulphide of silver was a blackish looking body like the film on the bangle However at the time I thought no more about it Illustration SHE INVITED ELSIE AND MYSELF TO STOP WITH HER By dint of stopping and talking we soon got quite intimate with missus Evelegh As always happens I found out I had known some of her cousins in Edinburgh where I always spent my holidays while I was at Girton She took an interest in what she was kind enough to call my originality and before a fortnight was out our hotel being uncomfortably crowded she had invited Elsie and myself to stop with her at the chalet We went and found it a delightful little home missus Evelegh was charming but we could see at every turn that doctor Fortescue Langley had acquired a firm hold over her He s so clever you know she said and so spiritual He exercises such strong odylic force He binds my being together If he misses a visit I feel my inner self goes all to pieces Does he come often I asked growing interested Oh dear no she answered I wish he did it would be ever so good for me But he s so much run after I am but one among many He lives at Chateau d Oex and comes across to see patients in this district once a fortnight It is a privilege to be attended by an intuitive seer like doctor Fortescue Langley missus Evelegh was rich left comfortably as the phrase goes but with a clause which prevented her marrying again without losing her fortune and I could gather from various hints that doctor Fortescue Langley whoever he might be was bleeding her to some tune using her soul and her inner self as his financial lancet I also noticed that what she said about the bangle was strictly true generally bright as a new pin on certain mornings it was completely blackened I had been at the chalet ten days however before I began to suspect the real reason Then it dawned upon me one morning in a flash of inspiration The evening before had been cold for at the height where we were perched even in August we often found the temperature chilly in the night and I heard missus Evelegh tell Cecile her maid to fill the hot water bottle It was a small point but it somehow went home to me Next day the bangle was black and missus Evelegh lamented that her inner self must be suffering from an attack of evil vapours I held my peace at the time but I asked Cecile a little later to bring me that hot water bottle As I more than half suspected it was made of india rubber wrapped carefully up in the usual red flannel bag Lend me your brooch Elsie I said I want to try a little experiment Won t a franc do as well Elsie asked tendering one That s equally silver I think not I answered A franc is most likely too hard it has base metal to alloy it But I will vary the experiment by trying both together Your brooch is Indian and therefore soft silver The native jewellers never use alloy Hand it over it will clean with a little plate powder if necessary I m going to see what blackens missus Evelegh s bangle I laid the franc and the brooch on the bottle filled with hot water and placed them for warmth in the fold of a blanket After dejeuner we inspected them As I anticipated the brooch had grown black on the surface with a thin iridescent layer of silver sulphide while the franc had hardly suffered at all from the exposure I called in missus Evelegh and explained what I had done She was astonished and half incredulous How could you ever think of it she cried admiringly Why I was reading an article yesterday about india rubber in one of your magazines I answered and the person who wrote it said the raw gum was hardened for vulcanising by mixing it with sulphur When I heard you ask Cecile for the hot water bottle I thought at once The sulphur and the heat account for the tarnishing of missus Evelegh s bangle And the franc doesn t tarnish Then that must be why my other silver bracelet which is English make and harder never changes colour And doctor Fortescue Langley assured me it was because the soft one was of Indian metal and had mystic symbols on it symbols that answered to the cardinal moods of my sub conscious self and that darkened in sympathy I jumped at a clue He talked about your sub conscious self I broke in Yes she answered He always does It s the key note of his system He heals by that alone But my dear after this how can I ever believe in him Does he know about the hot water bottle I asked Oh yes he ordered me to use it on certain nights and when I go to England he says I must never be without one I see now that was why my inner self invariably went wrong in England It was all just the sulphur blackening the bangles I reflected A middle aged man I asked Stout diplomatic looking with wrinkles round his eyes and a distinguished grey moustache twirled up oddly at the corners That s the man my dear His very picture Where on earth have you seen him And he talks of sub conscious selves I went on He practises on that basis He says it s no use prescribing for the outer man to do that is to treat mere symptoms the sub conscious self is the inner seat of diseases How long has he been in Switzerland Oh he comes here every year He arrived this season late in May I fancy When will he visit you again missus Evelegh To morrow morning I made up my mind at once Then I must see him without being seen I said I think I know him He is our Count I believe For I had told missus Evelegh and Elsie the queer story of my journey from London Impossible my dear Im possible I have implicit faith in him Wait and see missus Evelegh You acknowledge he duped you over the affair of the bangle Illustration THE COUNT There are two kinds of dupe one kind the commonest goes on believing in its deceiver no matter what happens the other far rarer has the sense to know it has been deceived if you make the deception as clear as day to it missus Evelegh was fortunately of the rarer class Next morning doctor Fortescue Langley arrived by appointment As he walked up the path I glanced at him from my window It was the Count not a doubt of it On his way to gull his dupes in Switzerland he had tried to throw in an incidental trifle of a diamond robbery I telegraphed the facts at once to Lady Georgina at Schlangenbad She answered I am coming Ask the man to meet his friend on Wednesday missus Evelegh now almost convinced invited him On Wednesday morning with a bounce Lady Georgina burst in upon us My dear such a journey alone at my age but there I haven t known a happy day since you left me Oh yes I got my Gretchen unsophisticated well h m that s not the word for it I declare to you Lois there isn t a trick of the trade in Paris or London not a perquisite or a tip that that girl isn t up to Comes straight from the remotest recesses of the Black Forest and hadn t been with me a week I assure you honour bright before she was bandolining her yellow hair and rouging her cheeks and wearing my brooches and wagering gloves with the hotel waiters upon the Baden races And her language and her manners Why weren t you born in that station of life I wonder child so that I might offer you five hundred a year and all found to come and live with me for ever But this Gretchen her fringe her shoes her ribbons upon my soul my dear I don t know what girls are coming to nowadays Ask missus Lynn Linton I suggested as she paused She is a recognised authority on the subject The Cantankerous Old Lady stared at me And this Count she went on So you have really tracked him You re a wonderful girl my dear I wish you were a lady s maid You d be worth me any money I explained how I had come to hear of doctor Fortescue Langley Lady Georgina waxed warm doctor Fortescue Langley she exclaimed The wicked wretch But he didn t get my diamonds I ve carried them here in my hands all the way from Wiesbaden I wasn t going to leave them for a single day to the tender mercies of that unspeakable Gretchen The fool would lose them Well we ll catch him this time Lois and we ll give him ten years for it Ten years missus Evelegh cried clasping her hands in horror Oh Lady Georgina We waited in missus Evelegh s dining room the old lady and I behind the folding doors At three precisely doctor Fortescue Langley walked in I had difficulty in restraining Lady Georgina from falling upon him prematurely He talked a lot of high flown nonsense to missus Evelegh and Elsie about the influences of the planets and the seventy five emanations and the eternal wisdom of the East and the medical efficacy of sub conscious suggestion Excellent patter all of it quite as good in its way as the diplomatic patter he had poured forth in the train to Lady Georgina It was rich in spheres in elements in cosmic forces At last as he was discussing the reciprocal action of the inner self upon the exhalations of the lungs we pushed back the door and walked calmly in upon him His breath came and went The exhalations of the lungs showed visible perturbation He rose and stared at us For a second he lost his composure Then as bold as brass he turned with a cunning smile to missus Evelegh Where on earth did you pick up such acquaintances he inquired in a well simulated tone of surprise Yes Lady Georgina I have met you before I admit but it can hardly be agreeable to you to reflect under what circumstances Lady Georgina was beside herself You dare she cried confronting him You dare to brazen it out You miserable sneak But you can t bluff me now I have the police outside Which I regret to confess was a light hearted fiction The police he echoed drawing back I could see he was frightened I had an inspiration again Take off that moustache I said calmly in my most commanding voice Illustration I THOUGHT IT KINDER TO HIM TO REMOVE IT ALTOGETHER He clapped his hand to it in horror In his agitation he managed to pull it a little bit awry It looked so absurd hanging there all crooked that I thought it kinder to him to remove it altogether The thing peeled off with difficulty for it was a work of art very firmly and gracefully fastened with sticking plaster But it peeled off at last and with it the whole of the Count s and doctor Fortescue Langley s distinction The man stood revealed a very palpable man servant Lady Georgina stared hard at him Where have I seen you before she murmured slowly That face is familiar to me Why yes you went once to Italy as mister Marmaduke Ashurst s courier I know you now Your name is Higginson It was a come down for the Comte de Laroche sur Loiret but he swallowed it like a man at a single gulp Yes my lady he said fingering his hat nervously now all was up You are quite right my lady But what would you have me do Times are hard on us couriers Nobody wants us now I must take to what I can He assumed once more the tone of the Vienna diplomat Que voulez vous madame These are revolutionary days A man of intelligence must move with the Zeitgeist Lady Georgina burst into a loud laugh And to think she cried that I talked to this lackey from London to Malines without ever suspecting him Higginson you re a fraud but you re a precious clever one He bowed I am happy to have merited Lady Georgina Fawley s commendation he answered with his palm on his heart in his grandiose manner But I shall hand you over to the police all the same You are a thief and a swindler He assumed a comic expression Unhappily not a thief he objected This young lady prevented me from appropriating your diamonds Convey the wise call it I wanted to take your jewel case and she put me off with a sandwich tin I wanted to make an honest penny out of missus Evelegh and she confronts me with your ladyship and tears my moustache off Lady Georgina regarded him with a hesitating expression But I shall call the police she said wavering visibly De grace my lady de grace Is it worth while pour si peu de chose Consider I have really effected nothing Will you charge me with having taken in error a small tin sandwich case value elevenpence An affair of a week s imprisonment That is positively all you can bring up against me And brightening up visibly I have the case still I will return it to morrow with pleasure to your ladyship But the india rubber water bottle I put in You have been deceiving missus Evelegh It blackens silver And you told her lies in order to extort money under false pretences He shrugged his shoulders You are too clever for me young lady he broke out I have nothing to say to you But Lady Georgina missus Evelegh you are human let me go Reflect I have things I could tell that would make both of you look ridiculous That journey to Malines Lady Georgina Those Indian charms missus Evelegh Besides you have spoiled my game Let that suffice you I can practise in Switzerland no longer Allow me to go in peace and I will try once more to be indifferent honest Illustration INCH BY INCH HE RETREATED He backed slowly towards the door with his eyes fixed on them I stood by and waited Inch by inch he retreated Lady Georgina looked down abstractedly at the carpet missus Evelegh looked up abstractedly at the ceiling Neither spoke another word The rogue backed out by degrees Then he sprang downstairs and before they could decide was well out into the open Lady Georgina was the first to break the silence After all my dear she murmured turning to me there was a deal of sound English common sense about Dogberry I remembered then his charge to the watch to apprehend a rogue How if a will not stand Why then take no note of him but let him go and presently call the rest of the watch together and thank God you are rid of a knave When I remembered how Lady Georgina had hob nobbed with the Count from Ostend to Malines I agreed to a great extent both with her and with Dogberry V THE ADVENTURE OF THE IMPROMPTU MOUNTAINEER The explosion and evaporation of doctor Fortescue Langley with whom were amalgamated the Comte de Laroche sur Loiret mister Higginson the courier and whatever else that versatile gentleman chose to call himself entailed many results of varying magnitudes In the first place missus Evelegh ordered a Great Manitou That however mattered little to the firm as I loved to call us because it shocked dear Elsie so for of course after all her kindness we couldn t accept our commission on her purchase so that she got her machine cheap for Lfifteen from the maker But in the second place I declare I am beginning to write like a woman of business she decided to run over to England for the summer to see her boy at Portsmouth being certain now that the discoloration of her bangle depended more on the presence of sulphur in the india rubber bottle than on the passing state of her astral body Tis an abrupt descent from the inner self to a hot water bottle I admit but missus Evelegh took the plunge with grace like a sensible woman doctor Fortescue Langley had been annihilated for her at one blow she returned forthwith to common sense and England What will you do with the chalet while you re away Lady Georgina asked when she announced her intention You can t shut it up to take care of itself Every blessed thing in the place will go to rack and ruin Shutting up a house means spoiling it for ever Why I ve got a cottage of my own that I let for the summer in the best part of Surrey a pretty little place now vacant for which by the way I want a tenant if you happen to know of one and when it s left empty for a month or two Perhaps it would do for me missus Evelegh suggested jumping at it I m looking out for a furnished house for the summer within easy reach of Portsmouth and London for myself and Oliver Lady Georgina seized her arm with a face of blank horror My dear she cried For you I wouldn t dream of letting it to you A nasty damp cold unwholesome house on stiff clay soil with detestable drains in the deadliest part of the Weald of Surrey why you and your boy would catch your deaths of rheumatism Is it the one I saw advertised in the Times this morning I wonder missus Evelegh inquired in a placid voice Charming furnished house on Holmesdale Common six bedrooms four reception rooms splendid views pure air picturesque surroundings exceptionally situated I thought of writing about it Illustration NEVER LEAVE A HOUSE TO THE SERVANTS MY DEAR That s it Lady Georgina exclaimed with a demonstrative wave of her hand I drew up the advertisement myself Exceptionally situated I should just think it was Why my dear I wouldn t let you rent the place for worlds a horrid poky little hole stuck down in the bottom of a boggy hollow as damp as Devonshire with the paper peeling off the walls so that I had to take my choice between giving it up myself ten years ago or removing to the cemetery and I ve let it ever since to City men with large families Nothing would induce me to allow you and your boy to expose yourself to such risks For Lady Georgina had taken quite a fancy to missus Evelegh But what I was just going to say was this you can t shut your house up it ll all go mouldy Houses always go mouldy shut up in summer And you can t leave it to your servants I know the baggages no conscience no conscience they ll ask their entire families to come and stop with them en bloc and turn your place into a perfect piggery Why when I went away from my house in town one autumn didn t I leave a policeman and his wife in charge a most respectable man only he happened to be an Irishman And what was the consequence My dear I assure you I came back unexpectedly from poor dear Kynaston s one day at a moment s notice having quarrelled with him over Home Rule or Education or something poor dear Kynaston s what they call a Liberal I believe got at by that man Rosebery and there didn t I find all the O Flanagans and O Flahertys and O Flynns in the neighbourhood camping out in my drawing room with a strong detachment of O Donohues and O Dohertys and O Driscolls lying around loose in possession of the library Never leave a house to the servants my dear It s positively suicidal Put in a responsible caretaker of whom you know something like Lois here for instance Lois missus Evelegh echoed Dear me that s just the very thing What a capital idea I never thought of Lois She and Elsie might stop on here with Ursula and the gardener I protested that if we did it was our clear duty to pay a small rent but missus Evelegh brushed that aside You ve robbed yourselves over the bicycle she insisted and I m delighted to let you have it It s I who ought to pay for you ll keep the house dry for me I remembered mister Hitchcock Mutual advantage benefits you benefits me and made no bones about it So in the end missus Evelegh set off for England with Cecile leaving Elsie and me in charge of Ursula the gardener and the chalet As for Lady Georgina having by this time completed her cure at Schlangenbad complexion as usual no guinea yellower she telegraphed for Gretchen I can t do without the idiot and hung round Lucerne apparently for no other purpose but to send people up the Bruenig on the hunt for our wonderful new machines and so put money in our pockets She was much amused when I told her that Aunt Susan who lived you will remember in respectable indigence at Blackheath had written to expostulate with me on my unladylike conduct in becoming a bicycle commission agent Unladylike the Cantankerous Old Lady exclaimed with warmth What does the woman mean Has she got no gumption It s ladylike I suppose to be a companion or a governess or a music teacher or something else in the black thread glove way in London but not to sell bicycles for a good round commission My dear between you and me I don t see it If you had a brother now he might sell cycles or corner wheat or rig the share market or do anything else he pleased in these days and nobody d think the worse of him as long as he made money and it s my opinion that what is sauce for the goose can t be far out for the gander and vice versa Besides which what s the use of trying to be ladylike You are a lady child and you couldn t help being one why trouble to be like what nature made you Tell Aunt Susan from me to put that in her pipe and smoke it I did tell Aunt Susan by letter giving Lady Georgina s authority for the statement and I really believe it had a consoling effect upon her for Aunt Susan is one of those innocent minded people who cherish a profound respect for the opinions and ideas of a Lady of Title Especially where questions of delicacy are concerned It calmed her to think that though I an officer s daughter had declined upon trade I was mixing at least with the Best People We had a lovely time at the chalet two girls alone messing just as we pleased in the kitchen and learning from Ursula how to concoct pot au feu in the most approved Swiss fashion We pottered as we women love to potter half the day long the other half we spent in riding our cycles about the eternal hills and ensnaring the flies whom Lady Georgina dutifully sent up to us She was our decoy duck and in virtue of her handle she decoyed to a marvel Indeed I sold so many Manitous that I began to entertain a deep respect for my own commercial faculties As for mister Cyrus W Hitchcock he wrote to me from Frankfort The world continues to revolve on its axis the Manitou and the machine is booming Orders romp in daily When you ventilated the suggestion of an agency at Limburg I concluded at a glance you had the material of a first class business woman about you but I reckon I did not know what a traveller meant till you started on the road I am now enlarging and altering this factory to meet increased demands Branch offices at Berlin Hamburg Crefeld and Duesseldorf Inspect our stock before dealing elsewhere A liberal discount allowed to the trade Two hundred agents wanted in all towns of Germany If they were every one of them like you miss well I guess I would hire the town of Frankfort for my business premises One morning after we had spent about a week at the chalet by ourselves I was surprised to see a young man with a knapsack on his back walking up the garden path towards our cottage Quick quick Elsie I cried being in a mischievous mood Come here with the opera glass There s a Man in the offing A what Elsie exclaimed shocked as usual at my levity A Man I answered squeezing her arm A Man A real live Man A specimen of the masculine gender in the human being Man ahoy He has come at last the lodestar of our existence Next minute I was sorry I spoke for as the man drew nearer I perceived that he was endowed with very long legs and a languidly poetical bearing That supercilious smile that enticing moustache Could it be yes it was not a doubt of it Harold Tillington I grew grave at once Harold Tillington and the situation were serious What can he want here I exclaimed drawing back Who is it Elsie asked for being a woman she read at once in my altered demeanour the fact that the Man was not unknown to me Lady Georgina s nephew I answered with a tell tale cheek I fear You remember I mentioned to you that I had met him at Schlangenbad But this is really too bad of that wicked old Lady Georgina She has told him where we lived and sent him up to see us Perhaps Elsie put in he wants to charter a bicycle I glanced at Elsie sideways I had an uncomfortable suspicion that she said it slyly like one who knew he wanted nothing of the sort But at any rate I brushed the suggestion aside frankly Nonsense I answered He wants me not a bicycle He came up to us waving his hat He did look handsome Well Miss Cayley he cried from afar I have tracked you to your lair I have found out where you abide What a beautiful spot And how well you re looking This is an unexpected I paused He thought I was going to say pleasure but I finished it intrusion His face fell How did you know we were at Lungern mister Tillington My respected relative he answered laughing She mentioned casually his eyes met mine that you were stopping in a chalet And as I was on my way back to the diplomatic mill I thought I might just as well walk over the Grimsel and the Furca and then on to the Gotthard The Court is at Monza So it occurred to me that in passing I might venture to drop in and say how do you do to you Thank you I answered severely but my heart spoke otherwise I do very well And you mister Tillington Badly he echoed Badly since you went away from Schlangenbad I gazed at his dusty feet You are tramping I said cruelly I suppose you will get forward for lunch to Meiringen I I did not contemplate it Indeed He grew bolder No to say the truth I half hoped I might stop and spend the day here with you Elsie I remarked firmly if mister Tillington persists in planting himself upon us like this one of us must go and investigate the kitchen department Elsie rose like a lamb I have an impression that she gathered we wanted to be left alone Illustration I MAY STAY MAYN T I He turned to me imploringly Lois he cried stretching out his arms with an appealing air I may stay mayn t I I tried to be stern but I fear twas a feeble pretence We are two girls alone in a house I answered Lady Georgina as a matron of experience ought to have protected us Merely to give you lunch is almost irregular Good diplomatic word irregular Still in these days I suppose you may stay if you leave early in the afternoon That s the utmost I can do for you You are not gracious he cried gazing at me with a wistful look I did not dare to be gracious Uninvited guests must not quarrel with their welcome I answered severely Then the woman in me broke forth But indeed mister Tillington I am glad to see you He leaned forward eagerly So you are not angry with me Lois I may call you Lois I trembled and hesitated I am not angry with you I I like you too much to be ever angry with you And I am glad you came just this once to see me Yes when we are alone you may call me Lois He tried to seize my hand I withdrew it Then I may perhaps hope he began that some day I shook my head No no I said regretfully You misunderstand me I like you very much and I like to see you But as long as you are rich and have prospects like yours I could never marry you My pride wouldn t let me Take that as final I looked away He bent forward again But if I were poor he put in eagerly I hesitated Then my heart rose and I gave way If ever you are poor I faltered penniless hunted friendless come to me Harold and I will help and comfort you But not till then Not till then I implore you He leant back and clasped his hands You have given me something to live for dear Lois he murmured I will try to be poor penniless hunted friendless To win you I will try And when that day arrives I shall come to claim you We sat for an hour and had a delicious talk about nothing But we understood each other Only that artificial barrier divided us At the end of the hour I heard Elsie coming back by judiciously slow stages from the kitchen to the living room through six feet of passage discoursing audibly to Ursula all the way with a tardiness that did honour to her heart and her understanding Dear kind little Elsie I believe she had never a tiny romance of her own yet her sympathy for others was sweet to look upon We lunched at a small deal table in the veranda Around us rose the pinnacles The scent of pines and moist moss was in the air Elsie had arranged the flowers and got ready the omelette and cooked the chicken cutlets and prepared the junket I never thought I could do it alone without you Brownie but I tried and it all came right by magic somehow We laughed and talked incessantly Harold was in excellent cue and Elsie took to him A livelier or merrier table there wasn t in the twenty two Cantons that day than ours under the sapphire sky looking out on the sun smitten snows of the Jungfrau After lunch Harold begged hard to be allowed to stop for tea I had misgivings but I gave way he was such good company One may as well be hanged for a sheep as a lamb says the wisdom of our ancestors and after all missus Grundy was only represented here by Elsie the gentlest and least censorious of her daughters So he stopped and chatted till four when I made tea and insisted on dismissing him He meant to take the rough mountain path over the screes from Lungern to Meiringen which ran right behind the chalet I feared lest he might be belated and urged him to hurry Thanks I m happier here he answered I was sternness itself You promised me I said in a reproachful voice He rose instantly and bowed Your will is law even when it pronounces sentence of exile Would we walk a little way with him No I faltered we would not We would follow him with the opera glasses and wave him farewell when he reached the Kulm He shook our hands unwillingly and turned up the little path looking handsomer than ever It led ascending through a fir wood to the rock strewn hillside Once a quarter of an hour later we caught a glimpse of him near a sharp turn in the road after that we waited in vain with our eyes fixed on the Kulm not a sign could we discern of him At last I grew anxious He ought to be there I cried fuming He ought Elsie answered I swept the slopes with the opera glasses Anxiety and interest in him quickened my senses I suppose Look here Elsie I burst out at last Just take this glass and have a glance at those birds down the crag below the Kulm Don t they seem to be circling and behaving most oddly Elsie gazed where I bid her They re wheeling round and round she answered after a minute and they certainly do look as if they were screaming They seem to be frightened I suggested It looks like it Brownie Then he s fallen over a precipice I cried rising up and he s lying there on a ledge by their nest Elsie we must go to him She clasped her hands and looked terrified Oh Brownie how dreadful she exclaimed Her face was deadly white Mine burned like fire Not a moment to lose I said holding my breath Get out the rope and let us run to him Don t you think Elsie suggested we had better hurry down on our cycles to Lungern and call some men from the village to help us We are two girls and alone What can we do to aid him No I answered promptly that won t do It would only lose time and time may be precious You and I must go I ll send Ursula off to bring up guides from the village Fortunately we had a good long coil of new rope in the house which missus Evelegh had provided in case of accident I slipped it on my arm and set out on foot for the path was by far too rough for cycles I was sorry afterwards that I had not taken Ursula and sent Elsie to Lungern to rouse the men for she found the climbing hard and I had difficulty at times in dragging her up the steep and stony pathway almost a watercourse However we persisted in the direction of the Kulm tracking Harold by his footprints for he wore mountain boots with sharp headed nails which made dints in the moist soil and scratched the smooth surface of the rock where he trod on it We followed him thus for a mile or two along the regular path then of a sudden in an open part the trail failed us I turned back a few yards and looked close with my eyes fixed on the spongy soil as keen as a hound that sniffs his way after his quarry He went off here Elsie I said at last pulling up short by a spindle bush on the hillside How do you know Brownie Why see there are the marks of his stick he had a thick one you remember with a square iron spike These are its dints I have been watching them all the way along from the chalet But there are so many such marks Yes I know I can tell his from the older ones made by the spikes of alpenstocks because Harold s are fresher and sharper on the edge They look so much newer See here he slipped on the rock you can know that scratch is recent by the clean way it s traced and the little glistening crystals still left behind in it Those other marks have been wind swept and washed by the rain There are no broken particles How on earth did you find that out Brownie How on earth did I find it out I wondered myself But the emergency seemed somehow to teach me something of the instinctive lore of hunters and savages I did not trouble to answer her At this bush the tracks fail I went on and look he must have clutched at that branch and crushed the broken leaves as the twigs slipped through his fingers He left the path here then and struck off on a short cut of his own along the hillside lower down Elsie we must follow him She shrank from it but I held her hand It was a more difficult task to track him now for we had no longer the path to guide us However I explored the ground on my hands and knees and soon found marks of footsteps on the boggy patches with scratches on the rock where he had leapt from point to point or planted his stick to steady himself I tried to help Elsie along among the littered boulders and the dwarf growth of wind swept daphne but poor child it was too much for her she sat down after a few minutes upon the flat juniper scrub and began to cry What was I to do My anxiety was breathless I couldn t leave her there alone and I couldn t forsake Harold Yet I felt every minute might now be critical We were making among wet whortleberry thicket and torn rock towards the spot where I had seen the birds wheel and circle screaming The only way left was to encourage Elsie and make her feel the necessity for instant action He is alive still I exclaimed looking up the birds are crying If he were dead they would return to their nest Elsie we must get to him She rose bewildered and followed me I held her hand tight and coaxed her to scramble over the rocks where the scratches showed the way or to clamber at times over fallen trunks of huge fir trees Yet it was hard work climbing even Harold s sure feet had slipped often on the wet and slimy boulders though like most of Queen Margherita s set he was an expert mountaineer Then at times I lost the faint track so that I had to diverge and look close to find it These delays fretted me See a stone loosed from its bed he must have passed by here That twig is newly snapped no doubt he caught at it Ha the moss there has been crushed a foot has gone by And the ants on that ant hill with their eggs in their mouths a man s tread has frightened them So by some instinctive sense as if the spirit of my savage ancestors revived within me I managed to recover the spoor again and again by a miracle till at last round a corner by a defiant cliff with a terrible foreboding my heart stood still within me We had come to an end A great projecting buttress of crag rose sheer in front Above lay loose boulders Below was a shrub hung precipice The birds we had seen from home were still circling and screaming They were a pair of peregrine hawks Their nest seemed to lie far below the broken scar some sixty or seventy feet beneath us He is not dead I cried once more with my heart in my mouth If he were they would have returned He has fallen and is lying alive below there Illustration I ADVANCED ON MY HANDS AND KNEES TO THE EDGE OF THE PRECIPICE Elsie shrank back against the wall of rock I advanced on my hands and knees to the edge of the precipice It was not quite sheer but it dropped like a sea cliff with broken ledges I could see where Harold had slipped He had tried to climb round the crag that blocked the road and the ground at the edge of the precipice had given way with him it showed a recent founder of a few inches Then he clutched at a branch of broom as he fell but it slipped through his fingers cutting them for there was blood on the wiry stem I knelt by the side of the cliff and craned my head over I scarcely dared to look In spite of the birds my heart misgave me There on a ledge deep below he lay in a mass half raised on one arm But not dead I believed Harold I cried Harold He turned his face up and saw me his eyes lighted with joy He shouted back something but I could not hear it I turned to Elsie I must go down to him Her tears rose again Oh Brownie I unwound the coil of rope The first thing was to fasten it I could not trust Elsie to hold it she was too weak and too frightened to bear my weight even if I wound it round her body I feared my mere mass might drag her over I peered about at the surroundings No tree grew near no rock had a pinnacle sufficiently safe to depend upon But I found a plan soon In the crag behind me was a cleft narrowing wedge shape as it descended I tied the end of the rope round a stone a good big water worn stone rudely girdled with a groove near the middle which prevented it from slipping then I dropped it down the fissure till it jammed after which I tried it to see if it would bear It was firm as the rock itself I let the rope down by it and waited a moment to discover whether Harold could climb He shook his head and took a notebook with evident pain from his pocket Then he scribbled a few words and pinned them to the rope I hauled it up Can t move Either severely bruised and sprained or else legs broken There was no help for it then I must go to him My first idea was merely to glide down the rope with my gloved hands for I chanced to have my dog skin bicycling gloves in my pocket Fortunately however I did not carry out this crude idea too hastily for next instant it occurred to me that I could not swarm up again I have had no practice in rope climbing Here was a problem But the moment suggested its own solution I began making knots or rather nooses or loops in the rope at intervals of about eighteen inches What are they for Elsie asked looking on in wonder Footholds to climb up by But the ones above will pull out with your weight I don t think so Still to make sure I shall tie them with this string I must get down to him I threaded a sufficient number of loops trying the length over the edge Then I said to Elsie who sat cowering propped against the crag You must come and look over and do as I wave to you Mind dear you must Two lives depend upon it Brownie I daren t I shall turn giddy and fall over I smoothed her golden hair Elsie dear I said gently gazing into her blue eyes you are a woman A woman can always be brave where those she loves are concerned and I believe you love me I led her coaxingly to the edge Sit there I said in my quietest voice so as not to alarm her You can lie at full length if you like and only just peep over But when I wave my hand remember you must pull the rope up She obeyed me like a child I knew she loved me Illustration I GRIPPED THE ROPE AND LET MYSELF DOWN I gripped the rope and let myself down not using the loops to descend but just sliding with hands and knees and allowing the knots to slacken my pace Half way down I will confess the eerie feeling of physical suspense was horrible One hung so in mid air The hawks flapped their wings But Harold was below and a woman can always be brave where those she loves well just that moment catching my breath I knew I loved Harold I glided down swiftly The air whizzed At last on a narrow shelf of rock I leant over him He seized my hand I knew you would come he cried I felt sure you would find out Though how you found out Heaven only knows you clever brave little woman Are you terribly hurt I asked bending close His clothes were torn I hardly know I can t move It may only be bruises Can you climb by these nooses with my help He shook his head Oh no I couldn t climb at all I must be lifted somehow You had better go back to Lungern and bring men to help you And leave you here alone Never Harold never Then what can we do I reflected a moment Lend me your pencil I said He pulled it out his arms were almost unhurt fortunately I scribbled a line to Elsie Tie my plaid to the rope and let it down Then I waved to her to pull up again I was half surprised to find she obeyed the signal for she crouched there white faced and open mouthed watching but I have often observed that women are almost always brave in the great emergencies She pinned on the plaid and let it down with commendable quickness I doubled it and tied firm knots in the four corners so as to make it into a sort of basket then I fastened it at each corner with a piece of the rope crossed in the middle till it looked like one of the cages they use in mills for letting down sacks with As soon as it was finished I said Now just try to crawl into it He raised himself on his arms and crawled in with difficulty His legs dragged after him I could see he was in great pain But still he managed it I planted my foot in the first noose You must sit still I said breathless I am going back to haul you up Are you strong enough Lois With Elsie to help me yes I often stroked a four at Girton I can trust you he answered It thrilled me that he said so I began my hazardous journey I mounted the rope by the nooses one two three four counting them as I mounted I did not dare to look up or down as I did so lest I should grow giddy and fall but kept my eyes fixed firmly always on the one noose in front of me My brain swam the rope swayed and creaked Twenty thirty forty Foot after foot I slipped them in mechanically taking up with me the longer coil whose ends were attached to the cage and Harold My hands trembled it was ghastly swinging there between earth and heaven Forty five forty six forty seven I knew there were forty eight of them At last after some weeks as it seemed I reached the summit Tremulous and half dead I prised myself over the edge with my hands and knelt once more on the hill beside Elsie She was white but attentive What next Brownie Her voice quivered I looked about me I was too faint and shaky after my perilous ascent to be fit for work but there was no help for it What could I use as a pulley Not a tree grew near but the stone jammed in the fissure might once more serve my purpose I tried it again It had borne my weight was it strong enough to bear the precious weight of Harold I tugged at it and thought so I passed the rope round it like a pulley and then tied it about my own waist I had a happy thought I could use myself as a windlass I turned on my feet for a pivot Elsie helped me to pull Up you go I cried cheerily We wound slowly for fear of shaking him Bit by bit I could feel the cage rise gradually from the ground its weight taken so with living capstan and stone axle was less than I should have expected But the pulley helped us and Elsie spurred by need put forth more reserve of nervous strength than I could easily have believed lay in that tiny body I twisted myself round and round close to the edge so as to look over from time to time but not at all quickly for fear of dizziness The rope strained and gave It was a deadly ten minutes of suspense and anxiety Twice or thrice as I looked down I saw a spasm of pain break over Harold s face but when I paused and glanced inquiringly he motioned me to go on with my venturesome task There was no turning back now We had almost got him up when the rope at the edge began to creak ominously It was straining at the point where it grated against the brink of the precipice My heart gave a leap If the rope broke all was over With a sudden dart forward I seized it with my hands below the part that gave then one fierce little run back and I brought him level with the edge He clutched at Elsie s hand I turned thrice round to wind the slack about my body The taut rope cut deep into my flesh but nothing mattered now except to save him Catch the cloak Elsie I cried catch it pull him gently in Elsie caught it and pulled him in with wonderful pluck and calmness We hauled him over the edge He lay safe on the bank Then we all three broke down and cried like children together I took his hand in mine and held it in silence When we found words again I drew a deep breath and said simply How did you manage to do it Illustration I ROLLED AND SLID DOWN I tried to clamber past the wall that barred the way there by sheer force of stride you know my legs are long and I somehow overbalanced myself But I didn t exactly fall if I had fallen I must have been killed I rolled and slid down clutching at the weeds in the crannies as I slipped and stumbling over the projections without quite losing my foothold on the ledges till I found myself brought up short with a bump at the end of it And you think no bones are broken I can t feel sure It hurts me horribly to move I fancy just at first I must have fainted But I m inclined to guess I m only sprained and bruised and sore all over Why you re as bad as me I believe See your dear hands are all torn and bleeding How are we ever to get him back again Brownie Elsie put in She was paler than ever now and prostrate with the after effects of her unwonted effort You are a practical woman Elsie I answered Stop with him here a minute or two I ll climb up the hillside and halloo for Ursula and the men from Lungern I climbed and hallooed In a few minutes worn out as I was I had reached the path above and attracted their attention They hurried down to where Harold lay and using my cage for a litter slung on a young fir trunk carried him back between them across their shoulders to the village He pleaded hard to be allowed to remain at the chalet and Elsie joined her prayers to his but there I was adamant It was not so much what people might say that I minded but a deeper difficulty For if once I nursed him through this trouble how could I or any woman in my place any longer refuse him So I passed him ruthlessly on to Lungern though my heart ached for it and telegraphed at once to his nearest relative Lady Georgina to come up and take care of him He recovered rapidly Though sore and shaken his worst hurts it turned out were sprains and in three or four days he was ready to go on again I called to see him before he left I dreaded the interview for one s own heart is a hard enemy to fight so long but how could I let him go without one word of farewell to him After this Lois he said taking my hand in his and I was weak enough for a moment to let it lie there you cannot say No to me Oh how I longed to fling myself upon him and cry out No Harold I cannot I love you too dearly But his future and Marmaduke Ashurst s half million restrained me for his sake and for my own I held myself in courageously Though indeed it needed some courage and self control I withdrew my hand slowly Do you remember I said you asked me that first day at Schlangenbad it was an epoch to me now that first day whether I was mediaeval or modern And I answered Modern I hope And you said That s well You see I don t forget the least things you say to me Well because I am modern my lips trembled and belied me I can answer you No I can even now refuse you The old fashioned girl the mediaeval girl would have held that because she saved your life if I did save your life which is a matter of opinion she was bound to marry you But I am modern and I see things differently If there were reasons at Schlangenbad which made it impracticable for me to accept you though my heart pleaded hard I do not deny it those reasons cannot have disappeared merely because you have chosen to fall over a precipice and I have pulled you up again My decision was founded you see not on passing accidents of situation but on permanent considerations Nothing has happened in the last three days to affect those considerations We are still ourselves you rich I a penniless adventuress I could not accept you when you asked me at Schlangenbad On just the same grounds I cannot accept you now I do not see how the unessential fact that I made myself into a winch to pull you up the cliff and that I am still smarting for it He looked me all over comically How severe we are he cried in a bantering tone And how extremely Girtony A System of Logic Ratiocinative and Inductive by Lois Cayley What a pity we didn t take a professor s chair My child that isn t you It s not yourself at all It s an attempt to be unnaturally and unfemininely reasonable Logic fled I broke down utterly Harold I cried rising I love you I admit I love you But I will never marry you while you have those thousands I haven t got them yet Or the chance of inheriting them He smothered my hand with kisses for I withdrew my face If you admit you love me he cried quite joyously then all is well When once a woman admits that the rest is but a matter of time and Lois I can wait a thousand years for you Not in my case I answered through my tears Not in my case Harold I am a modern woman and what I say I mean I will renew my promise If ever you are poor and friendless come to me I am yours Till then don t harrow me by asking me the impossible I tore myself away At the hall door Lady Georgina intercepted me She glanced at my red eyes Then you have taken him she cried seizing my hand I shook my head firmly I could hardly speak No Lady Georgina I answered in a choking voice I have refused him again I will not stand in his way I will not ruin his prospects She drew back and let her chin drop Well of all the hard hearted cruel obdurate young women I ever saw in my born days if you re not the very hardest Illustration I half ran from the house I hurried home to the chalet There I dashed into my own room locked the door behind me flung myself wildly on my bed and burying my face in my hands had a good long hard hearted cruel obdurate cry exactly like any other mediaeval woman It s all very well being modern but my experience is that when it comes to a man one loves well the Middle Ages are still horribly strong within us VI THE ADVENTURE OF THE URBANE OLD GENTLEMAN 
7001-12337-0000	train-other-500	When Elsie s holidays I beg pardon vacation came to an end she proposed to return to her High School in London Zeal for the higher mathematics devoured her But she still looked so frail and coughed so often a

7001-12337-0019	train-other-500	I walked across to missus Evelegh s desk and began writing a letter It occurred to me that mister Hitchcock who was a man of business might be able to help a woman of business in this delicate matter I put the point to him fairly and squarely
7001-12337-0020	train-other-500	without circumlocution we were going to start an English typewriting office in Florence what was the ordinary way for people to become possessed of a typewriting machine without the odious and mercenary preliminary of paying for it

7001-12337-0038	train-other-500	no doubt Elsie answered dubiously
none	none	 But do you know Brownie 
7001-12337-0039	train-other-500	it strikes me there isn t quite that literary stir and ferment one might expect in Florence Dante and Petrarch appear to be dead The distinguished authors fail to stream in upon us as one imagined with manuscripts to copy
7001-12337-0040	train-other-500	I affected an air of confidence for I had sunk capital in the concern that s business like sunk capital Oh we re a new firm I assented carelessly Our enterprise is yet young When cultivated Florence learns we re here
none	none	 cultivated Florence will invade us in its thousands 
7001-12337-0041	train-other-500	But we sat in our office and bit our thumbs all day the thousands stopped at home
none	none	 We had ample opportunities for making studies of the decorative detail on the Campanile till we knew every square inch of it better than mister Ruskin 
7001-12337-0042	train-other-500	Elsie s notebook contains I believe eleven hundred separate sketches of the Campanile from the right end the left end and the middle of our window with eight hundred and five distinct distortions of the individual statues
none	none	 that adorn its niches 
7001-12337-0043	train-other-500	on the side turned towards us At last
none	none	 after we had sat and bitten our thumbs 
7001-12337-0044	train-other-500	and sketched the Four Greater Prophets for a fortnight on end an immense excitement occurred An old gentleman was distinctly seen to approach and to look up at the sign board which decorated our office I instantly slipped in a sheet of foolscap
7001-12337-0045	train-other-500	and began to type write with alarming speed click click click while Elsie rising to the occasion set to work to transcribe imaginary shorthand
none	none	 as if her life depended upon it 
7001-12337-0046	train-other-500	The old gentleman after a moment s hesitation lifted the latch of the door somewhat nervously I affected to take no notice of him so breathless was the haste with which our immense business connection compelled me to finger the keyboard
7001-12337-0047	train-other-500	but looking up at him under my eyelashes I could just make out he was a peculiarly bland and urbane old person dressed with the greatest care and some attention to fashion His face was smooth it tended towards portliness
7001-12337-0048	train-other-500	He made up his mind and entered the office I continued to click till I had reached the close of a sentence
none	none	 Or to take arms against a sea of troubles 
7001-12337-0049	train-other-500	and by opposing end them Then I looked up sharply
none	none	 Can I do anything for you I inquired in the smartest tone of business I observe that politeness is not professional Illustration THE URBANE OLD GENTLEMAN The Urbane Old Gentleman came forward with his hat in his hand 
7001-12337-0050	train-other-500	He looked as if he had just landed from the Eighteenth Century His figure was that of mister Edward Gibbon Yes madam he said in a markedly deferential tone fussing about with the rim of his hat as he spoke and adjusting his pince nez
7001-12337-0051	train-other-500	I was recommended to your
none	none	 ur your establishment for shorthand and typewriting I have some work which I wish done if it falls within your province 
7001-12337-0052	train-other-500	But I am rather particular I require a quick worker Excuse my asking it
none	none	 but how many words can you do a minute 
7001-12337-0053	train-other-500	Shorthand I asked sharply for I wished to imitate official habits The Urbane Old Gentleman bowed Yes shorthand Certainly I waved my hand with careless grace towards Elsie as if these things happened to us daily
7001-12337-0054	train-other-500	Miss Petheridge undertakes the shorthand department I said with decision I am the typewriting from dictation
none	none	 Miss Petheridge forward 
7001-12337-0055	train-other-500	Elsie rose to it like an angel A hundred she answered confronting him The old gentleman bowed again And your terms he inquired in a honey tongued voice If I may venture to ask them
7001-12337-0056	train-other-500	We handed him our printed tariff He seemed satisfied Could you spare me an hour this morning he asked still fingering his hat nervously with his puffy hand But perhaps you are engaged I fear I intrude upon you
7001-12337-0057	train-other-500	Not at all I answered consulting an imaginary engagement list This work can wait
none	none	 Let me see eleven point thirty Elsie 
7001-12337-0058	train-other-500	I think you have nothing to do before one that cannot be put off Quite so very well then yes we are both at your service The Urbane Old Gentleman looked about him for a seat I pushed him our one easy chair
7001-12337-0059	train-other-500	He withdrew his gloves with great deliberation and sat down in it with an apologetic glance I could gather from his dress and his diamond pin that he was wealthy Indeed I half guessed who he was already
7001-12337-0060	train-other-500	There was a fussiness about his manner which seemed strangely familiar to me He sat down by slow degrees edging himself about till he was thoroughly comfortable
none	none	 I could see he was of the kind that will have comfort 
7001-12337-0061	train-other-500	He took out his notes and a packet of letters which he sorted slowly
none	none	 Then he looked hard at me and at Elsie He seemed to be making his choice between us 
7001-12337-0062	train-other-500	After a time he spoke I think he said in a most leisurely voice I will not trouble your friend to write shorthand for me after all Or should I say your assistant Excuse my change of plan I will content myself with dictation
7001-12337-0063	train-other-500	You can follow on the machine As fast as you choose to dictate to me He glanced at his notes and began a letter It was a curious communication It seemed to be all about buying Bertha and selling Clara
none	none	 a cold blooded proceeding which almost suggested slave dealing 
7001-12337-0064	train-other-500	I gathered he was giving instructions to his agent could he have business relations with Cuba I wondered But there were also hints of mysterious middies
none	none	 brave British tars to the rescue possibly 
7001-12337-0065	train-other-500	Perhaps my bewilderment showed itself upon my face for at last he looked queerly at me You don t quite like this I m afraid he said breaking off short I was the soul of business Not at all I answered I am an automaton
7001-12337-0066	train-other-500	nothing more It is a typewriter s function to transcribe the words a client dictates as if they were absolutely meaningless to her Quite right he answered approvingly Quite right I see you understand A very proper spirit Then
7001-12337-0067	train-other-500	the Woman within me got the better of the Typewriter Though I confess I continued I do feel it is a little unkind to sell Clara at once for whatever she will fetch It seems to me well
none	none	 unchivalrous 
7001-12337-0068	train-other-500	He smiled but held his peace Still the middies I went on they will perhaps take care that these poor girls are not ill treated He leaned back clasped his hands and regarded me fixedly
7001-12337-0069	train-other-500	Bertha he said after a pause is Brighton A s to be strictly correct London Brighton and South Coast First Preference Debentures Clara is Glasgow and South Western Deferred Stock
none	none	 Middies are Midland Ordinary But I respect your feeling You are a young lady of principle And he fidgeted more than ever Illustration HE WENT ON DICTATING FOR JUST AN HOUR He went on dictating for just an hour His subject matter bewildered me It was all about India Bills and telegraphic transfers and selling cotton short and holding tight to Egyptian Unified Markets it seemed were glutted 
7001-12337-0070	train-other-500	Hungarians were only to be dealt in if they hardened hardened sinners I know but what are hardened Hungarians
none	none	 And fears were not unnaturally expressed that Turks might be irregular 
7001-12337-0071	train-other-500	Consols it appeared were certain to give way for political reasons
none	none	 but the downward tendency of Australians 
7001-12337-0072	train-other-500	I was relieved to learn for the honour of so great a group of colonies could only be temporary Greeks were growing decidedly worse
none	none	 though I had always understood Greeks were bad enough already 
7001-12337-0073	train-other-500	and Argentine Central were likely to be weak but Provincials must soon become commendably firm and if Uruguays went flat something good ought to be made out of them Scotch rails might shortly be quiet I always understood they were based upon sleepers
7001-12337-0074	train-other-500	but if South Eastern stiffened advantage should certainly be taken of their stiffening He would telegraph particulars on Monday morning And so on till my brain reeled Oh artistic Florence
none	none	 was this the Filippo Lippi the Michael Angelo I dreamed of 
7001-12337-0075	train-other-500	At the end of the hour the Urbane Old Gentleman rose urbanely He drew on his gloves again with the greatest deliberation and hunted for his stick as if his life depended upon it Let me see I had a pencil oh thanks
none	none	 yes that is it 
7001-12337-0076	train-other-500	This cover protects the point My hat Ah certainly And my notes much obliged notes always get mislaid People are so careless Then I will come again to morrow
7001-12337-0077	train-other-500	the same hour if you will kindly keep yourself disengaged Though excuse me you had better make an entry of it at once upon your agenda I shall remember it I answered smiling No will you But you haven t my name I know it I answered
7001-12337-0078	train-other-500	At least I think so You are mister Marmaduke Ashurst Lady Georgina Fawley sent you here He laid down his hat and gloves again so as to regard me more undistracted You
7001-12337-0079	train-other-500	are a most remarkable young lady he said in a very slow voice I impressed upon Georgina that she must not mention to you that I was coming
none	none	 How on earth did you recognise me 
7001-12337-0080	train-other-500	Intuition most likely He stared at me with a sort of suspicion
none	none	 Please don t tell me you think me like my sister he went on For though of course every right minded man feels ur a natural respect and affection for the members his family bows if I may so say 
7001-12337-0081	train-other-500	to the inscrutable decrees of Providence
none	none	 which has mysteriously burdened him with them 
7001-12337-0082	train-other-500	still there are points about Lady Georgina which I cannot conscientiously assert I approve of I remembered Marmy s a fool and held my tongue judiciously I do not resemble her I hope he persisted
7001-12337-0083	train-other-500	with a look which I could almost describe as wistful A family likeness perhaps I put in Family likenesses exist you know often with complete divergence of tastes and character He looked relieved That is true Oh how true
7001-12337-0084	train-other-500	But the likeness in my case I must admit escapes me I temporised Strangers see these things most I said airing the stock platitudes It may be superficial And of course
7001-12337-0085	train-other-500	one knows that profound differences of intellect and moral feeling often occur within the limits of a single family You are quite right he said with decision Georgina s principles are not mine Excuse my remarking it but you seem to be a young lady of unusual penetration
none	none	 I saw he took my remark as a compliment What I really meant to say was that a commonplace man might easily be brother to so clever a woman as Lady Georgina Illustration HE BOWED TO US EACH SEPARATELY He gathered up his hat his stick his gloves his notes and his typewritten letters one by one and backed out politely He was a punctilious millionaire He had risen by urbanity to his brother directors like a model guinea pig 
7001-12337-0086	train-other-500	He bowed to us each separately as if we had been duchesses As soon as he was gone Elsie turned to me Brownie how on earth did you guess it They re so awfully different
7001-12337-0087	train-other-500	Not at all I answered A few surface unlikenesses only just mask an underlying identity Their features are the same but his are plump hers shrunken Lady Georgina s expression is sharp and worldly
7001-12337-0088	train-other-500	mister Ashurst s is smooth and bland and financial And then their manner Both are fussy but Lady Georgina s is honest open ill tempered fussiness mister Ashurst s is concealed under an artificial mask of
7001-12337-0089	train-other-500	obsequious politeness One s cantankerous the other s only pernicketty It s one tune after all in two different keys From that day forth the Urbane Old Gentleman was a daily visitor
none	none	 He took an hour at a time at first but after a few days 
7001-12337-0090	train-other-500	the hour lengthened out apologetically to an entire morning He presumed to ask my Christian name the second day and remembered my father
none	none	 a man of excellent principles But he didn t care for Elsie to work for him Fortunately for her other work dropped in once we had found a client 
7001-12337-0091	train-other-500	or else poor girl she would have felt sadly slighted I was glad she had something to do the sense of dependence weighed heavily upon her The Urbane Old Gentleman did not confine himself entirely after the first few days
7001-12337-0092	train-other-500	to Stock Exchange literature He was engaged on a Work he spoke of it always with bated breath and a capital letter was implied in his intonation the Work was one on the Interpretation of Prophecy Unlike Lady Georgina who was tart and crisp
none	none	 mister Marmaduke Ashurst was devout and decorous 
7001-12337-0093	train-other-500	where she said pack of fools he talked with unction of the mental deficiencies of our poorer brethren But his religious opinions and his stockbroking had got strangely mixed up at the wash somehow
7001-12337-0094	train-other-500	He was convinced that the British nation represented the Lost Ten Tribes of Israel and in particular Ephraim a matter on which as a mere lay woman I would not presume either to agree with him or to differ from him That being so Miss Cayley
7001-12337-0095	train-other-500	we can easily understand that the existing commercial prosperity of England depends upon the promises made to Abraham I assented without committing myself It would seem to follow mister Ashurst encouraged by so much assent
7001-12337-0096	train-other-500	went on to unfold his System of Interpretation which was of a strictly commercial or company promoting character It ran like a prospectus
7001-12337-0097	train-other-500	We have inherited the gold of Australia and the diamonds of the Cape he said growing didactic and lifting one fat forefinger we are now inheriting Klondike and the Rand
none	none	 for it is morally certain that we shall annex the Transvaal 
7001-12337-0098	train-other-500	Again the chief things of the ancient mountains and the precious things of the everlasting hills What does that mean The ancient mountains are clearly the Rockies can the everlasting hills be anything but the Himalayas
7001-12337-0099	train-other-500	For they shall suck of the abundance of the seas that refers of course to our world wide commerce due mainly to imports and of the treasures hid in the sand Which sand Undoubtedly I say the desert of Mount Sinai
7001-12337-0100	train-other-500	What then is our obvious destiny A lady of your intelligence must gather at once that it is He paused and gazed at me
none	none	 To drive the Sultan out of Syria I suggested tentatively 
7001-12337-0101	train-other-500	and to annex Palestine to our practical province of Egypt He leaned back in his chair and folded his fat hands in undisguised satisfaction Now you are a thinker of exceptional penetration he broke out
none	none	 Do you know Miss Cayley I have tried to make that point clear to the War Office and the Prime Minister 
7001-12337-0103	train-other-500	and many leading financiers in the City of London
none	none	 and I can t get them to see it They have no heads those people But you catch at it at a glance 
7001-12337-0104	train-other-500	Why I endeavoured to interest Rothschild and induce him to join me in my Palestine Development Syndicate and will you believe it the man refused point blank Though
none	none	 if he had only looked at Nahum iii seventeen Mere financiers I said smiling will not consider these questions from a historical and prophetic point of view 
7001-12337-0105	train-other-500	They see nothing above percentages That s it he replied lighting up They have no higher feelings Though mind you there will be dividends too mark my words there will be dividends
none	none	 This syndicate besides fulfilling the prophecies 
7001-12337-0106	train-other-500	will pay forty per cent on every penny embarked in it Only forty per cent for Ephraim I murmured half below my breath Why Judah is said to batten upon sixty He caught at it eagerly without perceiving my gentle sarcasm
7001-12337-0107	train-other-500	In that case we might even expect seventy he put in with a gasp of anticipation Though
none	none	 I approached Rothschild first with my scheme on purpose 
7001-12337-0108	train-other-500	so that Israel and Judah might once more unite in sharing the promises Your combined generosity and commercial instinct does you credit I answered It is rare to find so much love for an abstract study side by side
none	none	 with such conspicuous financial ability His guilelessness was beyond words He swallowed it like an infant So I think he answered I am glad to observe that you understand my character Mere City men don t They have no soul above shekels 
7001-12337-0109	train-other-500	Though as I show them there are shekels in it too Dividends dividends di vidends But you are a lady of understanding and comprehension You have been to Girton haven t you Perhaps you read Greek then
none	none	 Enough to get on with Could you look things up in Herodotus 
7001-12337-0110	train-other-500	Certainly In the original Oh dear yes He regarded me once more with the same astonished glance
none	none	 His own classics I soon learnt were limited to the amount which a public school succeeds in dinning during the intervals of cricket and football 
7001-12337-0111	train-other-500	into an English gentleman Then he informed me that he wished me to hunt up certain facts in Herodotus and elsewhere confirmatory of his view that the English were the descendants of the Ten Tribes I promised to do so
none	none	 swallowing even that comprehensive elsewhere 
7001-12337-0112	train-other-500	It was none of my business to believe or disbelieve I was paid to get up a case and I got one up to the best of my ability I imagine it was at least as good as most other cases in similar matters at any rate it pleased the old gentleman vastly
7001-12337-0113	train-other-500	By dint of listening I began to like him But Elsie couldn t bear him
none	none	 She hated the fat crease at the back of his neck she told me 
7001-12337-0114	train-other-500	After a week or two devoted to the Interpretation of Prophecy on a strictly commercial basis of Founders Shares with interludes of mining engineers reports upon the rubies of Mount Sinai
none	none	 and the supposed auriferous quartzites of Palestine 
7001-12337-0115	train-other-500	the Urbane Old Gentleman trotted down to the office one day carrying a packet of notes of most voluminous magnitude Can we work in a room alone this morning Miss Cayley he asked with mystery in his voice he was always mysterious
none	none	 I want to intrust you with a piece of work of an exceptionally private and confidential character It concerns Property 
7001-12337-0116	train-other-500	In point of fact he dropped his voice to a whisper I want you to draw up my will for me
none	none	 Certainly I said opening the door into the back office But I trembled in my shoes Could this mean that he was going to draw up a will disinheriting Harold Tillington And suppose he did what then My heart was in a tumult If Harold were rich well and good I could never marry him But if Harold were poor 
7001-12337-0117	train-other-500	I must keep my promise Could I wish him to be rich Could I wish him to be poor My heart stood divided two ways within me The Urbane Old Gentleman began with immense deliberation as befits a man of principle when Property is at stake
none	none	 You will kindly take down notes from my dictation he said fussing with his papers and afterwards I will ask you to be so good as to copy it all out fair on your typewriter for signature 
7001-12337-0118	train-other-500	Is a typewritten form legal I ventured to inquire A most perspicacious young lady he interjected well pleased I have investigated that point and find it perfectly regular Only if I may venture to say so there should be no erasures
7001-12337-0119	train-other-500	There shall be none I answered
none	none	 The Urbane Old Gentleman leant back in his easy chair 
7001-12337-0120	train-other-500	and began dictating from his notes with tantalising deliberateness This was the last will and testament of him Marmaduke Courtney Ashurst Its verbiage wearied me I was eager for him to come to the point about Harold Instead of that he did
7001-12337-0121	train-other-500	what it seems is usual in such cases set out with a number of unimportant legacies to old family servants and other hangers on among our poorer brethren I fumed and fretted inwardly Next came a series of quaint bequests of a quite novel character
none	none	 I give and bequeath to James Walsh and Sons of seven hundred twenty High Holborn London 
7001-12337-0122	train-other-500	the sum of Five Hundred Pounds in consideration of the benefit they have conferred upon humanity by the invention of a sugar spoon or silver sugar sifter by means of which it is possible to dust sugar upon a tart or pudding without letting the whole or the greater part of the material
7001-12337-0123	train-other-500	run through the apertures uselessly in transit You must have observed Miss Cayley with your usual perspicacity that most sugar sifters allow the sugar to fall through them on to the table prematurely I have noticed it I answered trembling with anxiety
none	none	 James Walsh and Sons acting on a hint from me have succeeded in inventing a form of spoon which does not possess that regrettable drawback 
7001-12337-0124	train-other-500	Run through the apertures uselessly in transit I think I said last Yes thank you Very good We will now continue And I give and bequeath the like sum of Five Hundred Pounds did I say free of legacy duty No
7001-12337-0125	train-other-500	Then please add it to James Walsh s clause Five Hundred Pounds free of legacy duty to Thomas Webster Jones of Wheeler Street Soho for his admirable invention of a pair of braces which will not slip down on the wearer s shoulders after half an hour s use
none	none	 Most braces you must have observed Miss Cayley My acquaintance with braces is limited not to say abstract I interposed smiling 
7001-12337-0126	train-other-500	He gazed at me and twirled his fat thumbs Of course he murmured Of course But most braces you may not be aware slip down unpleasantly on the shoulder blade
none	none	 and so lead to an awkward habit of hitching them up by the sleeve hole of the waistcoat at frequent intervals 
7001-12337-0127	train-other-500	Such a habit must be felt to be ungraceful Thomas Webster Jones to whom I pointed out this error of manufacture has invented a brace the two halves of which diverge at a higher angle than usual
none	none	 and fasten further towards the centre of the body in front 
7001-12337-0128	train-other-500	pardon these details so as to obviate that difficulty He has given me satisfaction and he deserves to be rewarded I heard through it all the voice of Lady Georgina observing tartly
none	none	 Why the idiots can t make braces to fit one at first passes my comprehension But there my dear the people who manufacture them are a set of born fools and what can you expect from an imbecile 
7001-12337-0129	train-other-500	mister Ashurst was Lady Georgina veneered with a thin layer of ingratiating urbanity Lady Georgina was clever and therefore acrimonious mister Ashurst was astute and therefore obsequious
7001-12337-0130	train-other-500	He went on with legacies to the inventor of a sauce bottle which did not let the last drop dribble down so as to spot the table cloth
none	none	 of a shoe horn the handle of which did not come undone and of a pair of sleeve links which you could put off 
7001-12337-0131	train-other-500	and on without injury to the temper A real benefactor Miss Cayley a real benefactor to the link wearing classes for he has sensibly diminished the average annual output of profane swearing
7001-12337-0132	train-other-500	When he left Five Hundred Pounds to his faithful servant Frederic Higginson courier I was tempted to interpose but I refrained in time and I was glad of it afterwards At last
none	none	 after many divagations my Urbane Old Gentleman arrived at the central point and I give and bequeath to my nephew 
7001-12337-0133	train-other-500	Harold Ashurst Tillington Younger of Gledcliffe Dumfriesshire
none	none	 attache to Her Majesty s Embassy at Rome Illustration I WAITED BREATHLESS I waited breathless He was annoyingly dilatory 
7001-12337-0134	train-other-500	My house and estate of Ashurst Court in the County of Gloucester and my town house at twenty four Park Lane North in London together with the residue
none	none	 of all my estate real or personal 
7001-12337-0135	train-other-500	and so forth I breathed again At least I had not been called upon to disinherit Harold Provided always he went on in the same voice I wondered what was coming Provided always that
7001-12337-0136	train-other-500	the said Harold Ashurst Tillington does not marry
none	none	 leave a blank there Miss Cayley I will find out the name of the young person I desire to exclude and fill it in afterward I don t recollect it at this moment but Higginson no doubt will be able to supply the deficiency In fact I don t think I ever heard it though Higginson has told me all about the woman Higginson I inquired Is he here Oh dear yes 
7001-12337-0137	train-other-500	You heard of him I suppose from Georgina Georgina is prejudiced He has come back to me I am glad to say An excellent servant Higginson though a trifle too omniscient
none	none	 All men are equal in the eyes of their Maker of course 
7001-12337-0138	train-other-500	but we must have due subordination A courier ought not to be better informed than his master
none	none	 or ought at least to conceal the fact dexterously 
7001-12337-0139	train-other-500	Well Higginson knows this young person s name my sister wrote to me about her disgraceful conduct when she first went to Schlangenbad An adventuress it seems an adventuress quite a shocking creature Foisted herself upon Lady Georgina in Kensington Gardens
7001-12337-0140	train-other-500	unintroduced if you can believe such a thing with the most astonishing effrontery and Georgina who will forgive anything on earth for the sake of what she calls originality
none	none	 another name for impudence as I am sure you must know 
7001-12337-0141	train-other-500	took the young woman with her as her maid to Germany There this minx tried to set her cap at my nephew Harold
none	none	 who can be caught at once by a pretty face 
7001-12337-0142	train-other-500	and Harold was bowled over almost got engaged to her Georgina took a fancy to the girl later having a taste for dubious people I cannot say I approve of Georgina s friends and wrote again to say her first suspicions were unfounded
7001-12337-0143	train-other-500	the young woman was in reality a paragon of virtue But I know better than that Georgina has no judgment I regret to be obliged to confess it but cleverness I fear is the only thing in the world my excellent sister cares for
none	none	 The hussy it seems was certainly clever Higginson has told me about her He says her bare appearance would suffice to condemn her a bold fast shameless brazen faced creature But you will forgive me I am sure my dear young lady

none	none	 He let his notes drop in his astonishment 
7001-12337-0148	train-other-500	I went on with my typewriting unmoved Provided always that the said Harold Ashurst Tillington does not marry Lois Cayley in which case I will and desire that the said estate shall pass to whom shall I put in mister Ashurst
7001-12337-0149	train-other-500	He leant forward with his fat hands on his ample knees It was really you he inquired open mouthed I nodded There is no use in denying the truth mister Tillington did ask me to be his wife and I refused him
7001-12337-0150	train-other-500	But my dear Miss Cayley

7001-12337-0151	train-other-500	Yes I know I admit all that So I declined his offer I did not wish to ruin his prospects The Urbane Old Gentleman eyed me with a sudden tenderness in his glance Young men are lucky he said slowly after a short pause
7001-12337-0152	train-other-500	and Higginson is an idiot
none	none	 I say it deliberately an idiot How could one dream of trusting the judgment of a flunkey about a lady

7001-12337-0154	train-other-500	the said Harold Ashurst Tillington consents to marry I think that sounds better He looked at me with such fatherly regard that it pricked my heart ever to have poked fun at his Interpretation of Prophecy on Stock Exchange principles I think I flushed crimson No
7001-12337-0155	train-other-500	no I answered firmly That will not do either please That s worse than the other way You must not put it mister Ashurst I could not consent to be willed away to anybody He leant forward with real earnestness My dear he said
7001-12337-0156	train-other-500	that s not the point Pardon my reminding you that you are here in your capacity as my amanuensis I am drawing up my will and if you will allow me to say so I cannot admit that anyone has a claim to influence me in the disposition of my Property
7001-12337-0157	train-other-500	Please I cried pleadingly He looked at me and paused Well he went on at last after a long interval since you insist upon it I will leave the bequest to stand without condition
none	none	 Thank you I murmured bending low over my machine If I did as I like though he went on I should say Unless he marries Miss Lois Cayley who is a deal too good for him the estate shall revert to Kynaston s eldest son

7001-12337-0159	train-other-500	Lord Southminster is a con founded jackass I rose and took his hand in my own spontaneously mister Ashurst I said you may interpret prophecy as long as ever you like but you are a dear kind old gentleman
none	none	 I am truly grateful to you for your good opinion And you will marry Harold Never I answered while he is rich I have said as much to him That s hard he went on slowly For 
7001-12337-0160	train-other-500	I should like to be your uncle I trembled all over
none	none	 Elsie saved the situation by bursting in abruptly 
7001-12337-0161	train-other-500	I will only add that when mister Ashurst left
none	none	 I copied the will out neatly without erasures The rough original I threw somewhat carelessly into the waste paper basket That afternoon somebody called to fetch the fair copy for mister Ashurst I went out into the front office to see him To my surprise it was Higginson in his guise as courier Illustration WHAT YOU HERE HE CRIED He was as astonished as myself What you here he cried You dog me I was thinking the same thing of you M le Comte I answered curtsying He made no attempt at an excuse Well I have been sent for the will he broke out curtly And you were sent for the jewel case I retorted No no doctor Fortescue Langley 
7001-12337-0162	train-other-500	I am in charge of the will and I will take it myself to mister Ashurst I will be even with you yet he snapped out
none	none	 I have gone back to my old trade and am trying to lead an honest life but you won t let me 
7001-12337-0163	train-other-500	On the contrary I answered smiling a polite smile I rejoice to hear it If you say nothing more against me to your employer I will not disclose to him what I know about you But if you slander me I will
none	none	 So now we understand one another And I kept the will till I could give it myself into mister Ashurst s own hands in his rooms that evening VII THE ADVENTURE OF THE UNOBTRUSIVE OASIS I will not attempt to describe to you the minor episodes of our next twelve months the manuscripts we type wrote and the Manitous we sold Tis one of my aims in a world so rich in bores to avoid being tedious I will merely say therefore that we spent the greater part of the year in Florence where we were building up a connection but rode back for the summer months to Switzerland as being a livelier place for the trade in bicycles The net result was not only that we covered our expenses but that as chancellor of the exchequer I found myself with a surplus in hand at the end of the season When we returned to Florence for the winter however I confess I began to chafe This is slow work Elsie I said I started out to go round the world it has taken me eighteen months to travel no further than Italy At this rate I shall reach New York a gray haired old lady in a nice lace cap and totter back into London a venerable crone on the verge of ninety However those invaluable doctors came to my rescue unexpectedly I do love doctors they are always sending you off at a moment s notice to delightful places you never dreamt of Elsie was better but still far from strong I took it upon me to consult our medical attendant and his verdict was decisive He did just what a doctor ought to do She is getting on very well in Florence he said but if you want to restore her health completely I should advise you to take her for a winter to Egypt After six months of the dry warm desert air I don t doubt she might return to her work in London That last point I used as a lever with Elsie She positively revels in teaching mathematics At first to be sure she objected that we had only just money enough to pay our way to Cairo and that when we got there we might starve her favourite programme I have not this extraordinary taste for starving my idea is to go where you like and find something decent to eat when you get there However to humour her I began to cast about me for a source of income There is no absolute harm in seeing your way clear before you for a twelvemonth though of course it deprives you of the plot interest of poverty Elsie I said in my best didactic style I excel in didactics you do not learn from the lessons that life sets before you Look at the stage for example the stage is universally acknowledged at the present day to be a great teacher of morals Does not Irving say so and he ought to know There is that splendid model for imitation for instance the Clown in the pantomime How does Clown regulate his life Does he take heed for the morrow Not a bit of it I wish I had a goose he says at some critical juncture and just as he says it pat a super strolls upon the stage with a property goose on a wooden tray and Clown cries Oh look here Joey here s a goose and proceeds to appropriate it Then he puts his fingers in his mouth and observes I wish I had a few apples to make the sauce with and as the words escape him pat again a small boy with a very squeaky voice runs on carrying a basket of apples Clown trips him up and bolts with the basket There s a model for imitation The stage sets these great moral lessons before you regularly every Christmas yet you fail to profit by them Govern your life on the principles exemplified by Clown expect to find that whatever you want will turn up with punctuality and dispatch at the proper moment Be adventurous and you will be happy Take that as a new maxim to put in your copy book I wish I could think so dear Elsie answered But your confidence staggers me That evening at our table d hote however it was amply justified A smooth faced young man of ample girth and most prosperous exterior happened to sit next us He had his wife with him so I judged it safe to launch on conversation We soon found out he was the millionaire editor proprietor of a great London daily with many more strings to his journalistic bow his honoured name was Elworthy I mentioned casually that we thought of going for the winter to Egypt He pricked his ears up But at the time he said nothing After dinner we adjourned to the cosy salon I talked to him and his wife and somehow that evening the devil entered into me I am subject to devils I hasten to add they are mild ones I had one of my reckless moods just then however and I reeled off rattling stories of our various adventures mister Elworthy believed in youth and audacity I could see I interested him The more he was amused the more reckless I became That s bright he said at last when I told him the tale of our amateur exploits in the sale of Manitous That would make a good article Yes I answered with bravado determined to strike while the iron was hot What the Daily Telephone lacks is just one enlivening touch of feminine brightness He smiled What is your forte he inquired My forte I answered is to go where I choose and write what I like about it He smiled again And a very good new departure in journalism too A roving commission Have you ever tried your hand at writing Had I ever tried It was the ambition of my life to see myself in print though hitherto it had been ineffectual I have written a few sketches I answered with becoming modesty As a matter of fact our office bulged with my unpublished manuscripts Could you let me see them he asked I assented with inner joy but outer reluctance If you wish it I murmured but you must be very lenient Illustration HE READ THEM CRUEL MAN BEFORE MY VERY EYES Though I had not told Elsie the truth of the matter was I had just then conceived an idea for a novel my magnum opus the setting of which compelled Egyptian local colour and I was therefore dying to get to Egypt if chance so willed it I submitted a few of my picked manuscripts accordingly to mister Elworthy in fear and trembling He read them cruel man before my very eyes I sat and waited twiddling my thumbs demure but apprehensive When he had finished he laid them down Racy he said Racy You re quite right Miss Cayley That s just what we want on the Daily Telephone I should like to print these three selecting them out at our usual rate of pay per thousand You are very kind But the room reeled with me Not at all I am a man of business And these are good copy Now about this Egypt I will put the matter in the shape of a business proposition Will you undertake if I pay your passage and your friend s with all travelling expenses to let me have three descriptive articles a week on Cairo the Nile Syria and India running to about two thousand words apiece at three guineas a thousand My breath came and went It was positive opulence The super with the goose couldn t approach it for patness My editor had brought me the apple sauce as well without even giving me the trouble of cooking it The very next day everything was arranged Elsie tried to protest on the foolish ground that she had no money but the faculty had ordered the apex of her right lung to go to Egypt and I couldn t let her fly in the face of the faculty We secured our berths in a P and O steamer from Brindisi and within a week we were tossing upon the bosom of the blue Mediterranean People who haven t crossed the blue Mediterranean cherish an absurd idea that it is always calm and warm and sunny I am sorry to take away any sea s character but I speak of it as I find it to borrow a phrase from my old gyp at Girton and I am bound to admit that the Mediterranean did not treat me as a lady expects to be treated It behaved disgracefully People may rhapsodize as long as they choose about a life on the ocean wave for my own part I wouldn t give a pin for sea sickness We glided down the Adriatic from Brindisi to Corfu with a reckless profusion of lateral motion which suggested the idea that the ship must have been drinking I tried to rouse Elsie when we came abreast of the Ionian Islands and to remind her that Here was the home of Nausicaa in the Odyssey Elsie failed to respond she was otherwise occupied At last I succumbed and gave it up I remember nothing further till a day and a half later when we got under lee of Crete and the ship showed a tendency to resume the perpendicular Then I began once more to take a languid interest in the dinner question I may add parenthetically that the Mediterranean is a mere bit of a sea when you look at it on the map a pocket sea to be regarded with mingled contempt and affection but you learn to respect it when you find that it takes four clear days and nights of abject misery merely to run across its eastern basin from Brindisi to Alexandria I respected the Mediterranean immensely while we lay off the Peloponnesus in the trough of the waves with a north wind blowing I only began to temper my respect with a distant liking when we passed under the welcome shelter of Crete on a calm star lit evening It was deadly cold We had not counted upon such weather in the sunny south I recollected now that the Greeks were wont to represent Boreas as a chilly deity and spoke of the Thracian breeze with the same deferentially deprecating adjectives which we ourselves apply to the east wind of our fatherland but that apt classical memory somehow failed to console or warm me A good natured male passenger however volunteered to ask us Will I get ye a rug ladies The form of his courteous question suggested the probability of his Irish origin You are very kind I answered If you don t want it for yourself I m sure my friend would be glad to have the use of it Is it meself Sure I ve got me big ulsther and I m as warrum as a toast in it But ye re not provided for this weather Ye ve thrusted too much to those rascals the po uts Where breaks the blue Sicilian say the rogues write I d like to set them down in it wid a nor easter blowing He fetched up his rug It was ample and soft a smooth brown camel hair He wrapped us both up in it We sat late on deck that night as warm as a toast ourselves thanks to our genial Irishman Illustration TIS DOCTOR MACLOGHLEN HE ANSWERED We asked his name Tis doctor Macloghlen he answered I m from County Clare ye see and I m on me way to Egypt for thravel and exploration Me fader whisht me to see the worruld a bit before I d settle down to practise me profession at Liscannor Have ye ever been in County Clare Sure tis the pick of Oireland We have that pleasure still in store I answered smiling It spreads gold leaf over the future as George Meredith puts it Is it Meredith Ah there s the foine writer Tis jaynius the man has I can t undtherstand a word of him But he s half Oirish ye know What proof have I got of it An would he write like that if there wasn t a dhrop of the blood of the Celt in him Next day and next night mister Macloghlen was our devoted slave I had won his heart by admitting frankly that his countrywomen had the finest and liveliest eyes in Europe eyes with a deep twinkle half fun half passion He took to us at once and talked to us incessantly He was a red haired raw boned Munster man but a real good fellow We forgot the aggressive inequalities of the Mediterranean while he talked to us of the pizzantry Late the second evening he propounded a confidence It was a lovely night Orion overhead and the plashing phosphorescence on the water below conspired with the hour to make him specially confidential Now Miss Cayley he said leaning forward on his deck chair and gazing earnestly into my eyes there s wan question I d like to ask ye The ambition of me life is to get into Parlimint And I want to know from ye as a frind if I accomplish me heart s wish is there annything in me apparence ar in me voice ar in me accent ar in me manner that would lade annybody to suppose I was an Oirishman I succeeded by good luck in avoiding Elsie s eye What on earth could I answer Then a happy thought struck me doctor Macloghlen I said it would not be the slightest use your trying to conceal it for even if nobody ever detected a faint Irish intonation in your words or phrases how could your eloquence fail to betray you for a countryman of Sheridan and Burke and Grattan He seized my hand with such warmth that I thought it best to hurry down to my state room at once under cover of my compliment At Alexandria and Cairo we found him invaluable He looked after our luggage which he gallantly rescued from the lean hands of fifteen Arab porters all eagerly struggling to gain possession of our effects he saw us safe into the train and he never quitted us till he had safely ensconced us in our rooms at Shepheard s For himself he said with subdued melancholy twas to some cheaper hotel he must go Shepheard s wasn t for the likes of him though if land in County Clare was wort what it ought to be there wasn t a finer estate in all Oireland than his fader s Our mister Elworthy was a modern proprietor who knew how to do things on the lordly scale Having commissioned me to write this series of articles he intended them to be written in the first style of art and he had instructed me accordingly to hire one of Cook s little steam dahabeeahs where I could work at leisure doctor Macloghlen was in his element arranging for the trip Sure the only thing I mind he said is that I ll not be going wid ye I think he was half inclined to invite himself but there again I drew a line I will not sell salt fish and I will not go up the Nile unchaperoned with a casual man acquaintance He did the next best thing however he took a place in a sailing dahabeeah and as we steamed up slowly stopping often on the way to give me time to write my articles he managed to arrive almost always at every town or ruin exactly when we did I will not describe the voyage The Nile is the Nile Just at first before we got used to it we conscientiously looked up the name of every village we passed on the bank in our Murray and our Baedeker After a couple of days Niling however we found that formality quite unnecessary They were all the same village under a number of aliases They did not even take the trouble to disguise themselves anew like doctor Fortescue Langley on each fresh appearance They had every one of them a small whitewashed mosque with a couple of tall minarets and around it spread a number of mud built cottages looking more like bee hives than human habitations They had also every one of them a group of date palms overhanging a cluster of mean bare houses and they all alike had a picturesque and even imposing air from a distance but faded away into indescribable squalor as one got abreast of them Our progress was monotonous At twelve noon we would pass Aboo Teeg with its mosque its palms its mud huts and its camels then for a couple of hours we would go on through the midst of a green field on either side studded by more mud huts and backed up by a range of gray desert mountains only to come at two P M twenty miles higher up upon Aboo Teeg once more with the same mosque the same mud huts and the same haughty camels placidly chewing the same aristocratic cud but under the alias of Koos kam After a wild hubbub at the quay we would leave Koos kam behind with its camels still serenely munching day before yesterday s dinner and twenty miles further on again having passed through the same green plain backed by the same gray mountains we would stop once more at the identical Koos kam which this time absurdly described itself as Tahtah But whether it was Aboo Teeg or Koos kam or Tahtah or anything else only the name differed it was always the same town and had always the same camels at precisely the same stage of the digestive process It seemed to us immaterial whether you saw all the Nile or only five miles of it It was just like wall paper A sample sufficed the whole was the sample infinitely repeated However I had my letters to write and I wrote them valiantly I described the various episodes of the complicated digestive process in the camel in the minutest detail I gloated over the date palms which I knew in three days as if I had been brought up upon dates I gave word pictures of every individual child veiled woman Arab sheikh and Coptic priest whom we encountered on the voyage And I am open to reprint those conscientious studies of mud huts and minarets with any enterprising publisher who will make me an offer Illustration TOO MUCH NILE Another disillusion weighed upon my soul Before I went up the Nile I had a fancy of my own that the bank was studded with endless ruined temples whose vast red colonnades were reflected in the water at every turn I think Macaulay s Lays were primarily answerable for that particular misapprehension As a matter of fact it surprised me to find that we often went for two whole days hard steaming without ever a temple breaking the monotony of those eternal date palms those calm and superciliously irresponsive camels In my humble opinion Egypt is a fraud there is too much Nile very dirty Nile at that and not nearly enough temple Besides the temples when you do come up with them are just like the villages they are the same temple over again under a different name each time and they have the same gods the same kings the same wearisome bas reliefs except that the gentleman in a chariot ten feet high who is mowing down enemies a quarter his own size with unsportsmanslike recklessness is called Rameses in this place and Sethi in that and Amen hotep in the other With this trifling variation when you have seen one temple one obelisk one hieroglyphic table you have seen the whole of Ancient Egypt At last after many days voyage through the same scenery daily rising in the morning off a village with a mosque ten palms and two minarets and retiring late at night off the same village once more with mosque palms and minarets as before da capo we arrived one evening at a place called Geergeh In itself I believe Geergeh did not differ materially from all the other places we had passed on our voyage it had its mosque its ten palms and its two minarets as usual But I remember its name because something mysterious went wrong there with our machinery and the engineer informed us we must wait at least three days to mend it doctor Macloghlen s dahabeeah happened opportunely to arrive at the same spot on the same day and he declared with fervour he would see us through our throubles But what on earth were we to do with ourselves through three long days and nights at Geergeh There were the ruins of Abydus close at hand to be sure though I defy anybody not a professed Egyptologist to give more than one day to the ruins of Abydus In this emergency doctor Macloghlen came gallantly to our aid He discovered by inquiring from an English speaking guide that there was an unobtrusive oasis never visited by Europeans one long day s journey off across the desert As a rule it takes at least three days to get camels and guides together for such an expedition for Egypt is not a land to hurry in But the indefatigable Doctor further unearthed the fact that a sheikh had just come in who for a consideration would lend us camels for a two days trip and we seized the chance to do our duty by mister Elworthy and the world wide circulation An unvisited oasis and two Christian ladies to be the first to explore it there s journalistic enterprise for you If we happened to be killed so much the better for the Daily Telephone I pictured the excitement at Piccadilly Circus Extra Special Our Own Correspondent brutally murdered I rejoiced at the opportunity I cannot honestly say that Elsie rejoiced with me She cherished a prejudice against camels massacres and the new journalism She didn t like being murdered though this was premature for she had never tried it She objected that the fanatical Mohammedans of the Senoosi sect who were said to inhabit the oasis in question might cut our throats for dogs of infidels I pointed out to her at some length that it was just that chance which added zest to our expedition as a journalistic venture fancy the glory of being the first lady journalists martyred in the cause But she failed to grasp this aspect of the question However if I went she would go too she said like a dear girl that she is she would not desert me when I was getting my throat cut Illustration EMPHASIS doctor Macloghlen made the bargain for us and insisted on accompanying us across the desert He told us his method of negotiation with the Arabs with extreme gusto Is it pay in advance ye want says I to the dirty beggars divvil a penny will ye get till ye bring these ladies safe back to Geergeh And remimber mister Sheikh says I fingering me pistol so by way of emphasis we take no money wid us so if yer friends at Wadi Bou choose to cut our throats tis for the pleasure of it they ll be cutting them not for anything they ll gain by it Provisions effendi says he salaaming Provisions is it says I Take everything ye ll want wid you I suppose ye can buy food fit for a Crischun in the bazaar in Geergeh and never wan penny do ye touch for it all till ye ve landed us on the bank again as safe as ye took us So if the religious sintiments of the faithful at Wadi Bou should lade them to hack us to pieces says I just waving me revolver thin tis yerself that will be out of pocket by it And the ould divvil cringed as if he took me for the Prince of Wales Faix tis the purse that s the best argumint to catch these haythen Arabs upon When we set out for the desert in the early dawn next day it looked as if we were starting for a few months voyage We had a company of camels that might have befitted a caravan We had two large tents one for ourselves and one for doctor Macloghlen with a third to dine in We had bedding and cushions and drinking water tied up in swollen pig skins which were really goat skins looking far from tempting We had bread and meat and a supply of presents to soften the hearts and weaken the religious scruples of the sheikhs at Wadi Bou We thravel en prince said the Doctor When all was ready we got under way solemnly our camels rising and sniffing the breeze with a superior air as who should say I happen to be going where you happen to be going but don t for a moment suppose I do it to please you It is mere coincidence You are bound for Wadi Bou I have business of my own which chances to take me there Illustration RIDING A CAMEL DOES NOT GREATLY DIFFER PROM SEA SICKNESS Over the incidents of the journey I draw a veil Riding a camel I find does not greatly differ from sea sickness They are the same phenomenon under altered circumstances We had been assured beforehand on excellent authority that much of the comfort on a desert journey depends upon having a good camel On this matter I am no authority I do not set up as a judge of camel flesh But I did not notice any of the comfort so I venture to believe my camel must have been an exceptionally bad one We expected trouble from the fanatical natives I am bound to admit we had most trouble with Elsie She was not insubordinate but she did not care for camel riding And her beast took advantage of her youth and innocence A well behaved camel should go almost as fast as a child can walk and should not sit down plump on the burning sand without due reason Elsie s brute crawled and called halts for prayer at frequent intervals it tried to kneel like a good Mussulman many times a day and it showed an intolerant disposition to crush the infidel by rolling over on top of Elsie doctor Macloghlen admonished it with Irish eloquence not always in language intended for publication but it only turned up its supercilious lip and inquired in its own unspoken tongue what he knew about the desert I feel like a wurrum before the baste the Doctor said nonplussed If the Nile was monotonous the road to Wadi Bou was nothing short of dreary We crossed a great ridge of bare gray rock and followed a rolling valley of sand scored by dry ravines and baking in the sun It was ghastly to look upon All day long save at the midday rest by some brackish wells we rode on and on the brutes stepping forward with slow outstretched legs though sometimes we walked by the camels sides to vary the monotony but ever through that dreary upland plain sand in the centre rocky mountain at the edge and not a thing to look at We were relieved towards evening to stumble against stunted tamarisks half buried in sand and to feel we were approaching the edge of the oasis When at last our arrogant beasts condescended to stop in their patronising way we saw by the dim light of the moon a sort of uneven basin or hollow studded with date palms and in the midst of the depression a crumbling walled town with a whitewashed mosque two minarets by its side and a crowd of mud houses It was strangely familiar We had come all this way just to see Aboo Teeg or Koos kam over again We camped outside the fortified town that night Next morning we essayed to make our entry At first the servants of the Prophet on watch at the gate raised serious objections No infidel might enter But we had a pass from Cairo exhorting the faithful in the name of the Khedive to give us food and shelter and after much examination and many loud discussions the gatemen passed us We entered the town and stood alone three Christian Europeans in the midst of three thousand fanatical Mohammedans I confess it was weird Elsie shrank by my side Suppose they were to attack us Brownie Thin the sheikh here would never get paid doctor Macloghlen put in with true Irish recklessness Faix he ll whistle for his money on the whistle I gave him That touch of humour saved us We laughed and the people about saw we could laugh They left off scowling and pressed around trying to sell us pottery and native brooches In the intervals of fanaticism the Arab has an eye to business We passed up the chief street of the bazaar The inhabitants told us in pantomime the chief of the town was away at Asioot whither he had gone two days ago on business If he were here our interpreter gave us to understand things might have been different for the chief had determined that whatever came no infidel dog should settle in his oasis Illustration HER AGITATION WAS EVIDENT The women with their veiled faces attracted us strangely They were wilder than on the river They ran when one looked at them Suddenly as we passed one we saw her give a little start She was veiled like the rest but her agitation was evident even through her thick covering She is afraid of Christians Elsie cried nestling towards me The woman passed close to us She never looked in our direction but in a very low voice she murmured as she passed Then you are English I had presence of mind enough to conceal my surprise at this unexpected utterance Don t seem to notice her Elsie I said looking away Yes we are English She stopped and pretended to examine some jewellery on a stall So am I she went on in the same suppressed low voice For Heaven s sake help me What are you doing here I live here married I was with Gordon s force at Khartoum They carried me off A mere girl then Now I am thirty And you have been here ever since She turned away and walked off but kept whispering behind her veil We followed unobtrusively Yes I was sold to a man at Dongola He passed me on again to the chief of this oasis I don t know where it is but I have been here ever since I hate this life Is there any chance of a rescue Anny chance of a rescue is it the Doctor broke in a trifle too ostensibly If it costs us a whole British Army me dear lady we ll fetch you away and save you But now to day You won t go away and leave me You are the first Europeans I have seen since Khartoum fell They may sell me again You will not desert me No I said We will not Then I reflected a moment What on earth could we do This was a painful dilemma If we once lost sight of her we might not see her again Yet if we walked with her openly and talked like friends we would betray ourselves and her to those fanatical Senoosis I made my mind up promptly I may not have much of a mind but such as it is I flatter myself I can make it up at a moment s notice Can you come to us outside the gate at sunset I asked as if speaking to Elsie The woman hesitated I think so Then keep us in sight all day and when evening comes stroll out behind us She turned over some embroidered slippers on a booth and seemed to be inspecting them But my children she murmured anxiously The Doctor interposed Is it childern she has he asked Thin they ll be the Mohammedan gintleman s We mustn t interfere wid them We can take away the lady she s English and detained against her will but we can t deprive anny man of his own childern I was firm and categorical Yes we can I said stoutly if he has forced a woman to bear them to him whether she would or not That s common justice I have no respect for the Mohammedan gentleman s rights Let her bring them with her How many are there Two a boy and girl not very old the eldest is seven She spoke wistfully A mother is a mother Then say no more now but keep us always in sight and we will keep you Come to us at the gate about sundown We will carry you off with us She clasped her hands and moved off with the peculiar gliding air of the veiled Mohammedan woman Our eyes followed her We walked on through the bazaar thinking of nothing else now It was strange how this episode made us forget our selfish fears for our own safety Even dear timid Elsie remembered only that an Englishwoman s life and liberty were at stake We kept her more or less in view all day She glided in and out among the people in the alleys When we went back to the camels at lunch time she followed us unobtrusively through the open gate and sat watching us from a little way off among a crowd of gazers for all Wadi Bou was of course agog at this unwonted invasion We discussed the circumstance loudly so that she might hear our plans doctor Macloghlen advised that we should tell our sheikh we meant to return part of the way to Geergeh that evening by moonlight I quite agreed with him It was the only way out Besides I didn t like the looks of the people They eyed us askance This was getting exciting now I felt a professional journalistic interest Whether we escaped or got killed what splendid business for the Daily Telephone The sheikh of course declared it was impossible to start that evening The men wouldn t move the camels needed rest But doctor Macloghlen was inexorable Very well thin mister Sheikh he answered philosophically Ye ll plaze yerself about whether ye come on wid us or whether ye shtop That s yer own business But we set out at sundown and whin ye return by yerself on foot to Geergeh ye can ask for yer camels at the British Consulate All through that anxious afternoon we sat in our tents under the shade of the mud wall wondering whether we could carry out our plan or not About an hour before sunset the veiled woman strolled out of the gate with her two children She joined the crowd of sight seers once more for never through the day were we left alone for a second The excitement grew intense Elsie and I moved up carelessly towards the group talking as if to one another I looked hard at Elsie then I said as though I were speaking about one of the children Go straight along the road to Geergeh till you are past the big clump of palms at the edge of the oasis Just beyond it comes a sharp ridge of rock Wait behind the ridge where no one can see you When we get there I patted the little girl s head don t say a word but jump on my camel My two friends will each take one of the children If you understand and consent stroke your boy s curls We will accept that for a signal She stroked the child s head at once without the least hesitation Even through her veil and behind her dress I could somehow feel and see her trembling nerves her beating heart But she gave no overt token She merely turned and muttered something carelessly in Arabic to a woman beside her We waited once more in long drawn suspense Would she manage to escape them Would they suspect her motives After ten minutes when we had returned to our crouching place under the shadow of the wall the woman detached herself slowly from the group and began strolling with almost overdone nonchalance along the road to Geergeh We could see the little girl was frightened and seemed to expostulate with her mother fortunately the Arabs about were too much occupied in watching the suspicious strangers to notice this episode of their own people Presently our new friend disappeared and with beating hearts we awaited the sunset Illustration CROUCHING BY THE ROCKS SAT OUR MYSTERIOUS STRANGER Then came the usual scene of hubbub with the sheikh the camels the porters and the drivers It was eagerness against apathy With difficulty we made them understand we meant to get under way at all hazards I stormed in bad Arabic The Doctor inveighed in very choice Irish At last they yielded and set out One by one the camels rose bent their slow knees and began to stalk in their lordly way with outstretched necks along the road to the river We moved through the palm groves a crowd of boys following us and shouting for backsheesh We began to be afraid they would accompany us too far and discover our fugitive but fortunately they all turned back with one accord at a little whitewashed shrine near the edge of the oasis We reached the clump of palms we turned the corner of the ridge Had we missed one another No There crouching by the rocks with her children by her side sat our mysterious stranger The Doctor was equal to the emergency Make those bastes kneel he cried authoritatively to the sheikh The sheikh was taken aback This was a new exploit burst upon him He flung his arms up gesticulating wildly The Doctor unmoved made the drivers understand by some strange pantomime what he wanted They nodded half terrified In a second the stranger was by my side Elsie had taken the girl the Doctor the boy and the camels were passively beginning to rise again That is the best of your camel Once set him on his road and he goes mechanically The sheikh broke out with several loud remarks in Arabic which we did not understand but whose hostile character could not easily escape us He was beside himself with anger Then I was suddenly aware of the splendid advantage of having an Irishman on our side doctor Macloghlen drew his revolver like one well used to such episodes and pointed it full at the angry Arab Look here mister Sheikh he said calmly yet with a fine touch of bravado do ye see this revolver Well unless ye make yer camels thravel sthraight to Geergeh widout wan other wurrud tis yer own brains will be spattered sor on the sand of this desert And if ye touch wan hair of our heads ye ll answer for it wid yer life to the British Government I do not feel sure that the sheikh comprehended the exact nature of each word in this comprehensive threat but I am certain he took in its general meaning punctuated as it was with some flourishes of the revolver He turned to the drivers and made a gesture of despair It meant apparently that this infidel was too much for him Then he called out a few sharp directions in Arabic Next minute our camels legs were stepping out briskly along the road to Geergeh with a promptitude which I m sure must have astonished their owners We rode on and on through the gloom in a fever of suspense Had any of the Senoosis noticed our presence Would they miss the chief s wife before long and follow us under arms Would our own sheikh betray us I am no coward as women go but I confess if it had not been for our fiery Irishman I should have felt my heart sink We were grateful to him for the reckless and good humoured courage of the untamed Celt It kept us from giving way Ye ll take notice mister Sheikh he said as we threaded our way among the moon lit rocks that I have twinty wan cartridges in me case for me revolver and that if there s throuble to night tis twinty of them there ll be for your frinds the Senoosis and wan for yerself but for fear of disappointing a gintleman tis yer own special bullet I ll disthribute first if it comes to fighting The sheikh s English was a vanishing quantity but to judge by the way he nodded and salaamed at this playful remark I am convinced he understood the Doctor s Irish quite as well as I did We spoke little by the way we were all far too frightened except the Doctor who kept our hearts up by a running fire of wild Celtic humour But I found time meanwhile to learn by a few questions from our veiled friend something of her captivity She had seen her father massacred before her eyes at Khartoum and had then been sold away to a merchant who conveyed her by degrees and by various exchanges across the desert through lonely spots to the Senoosi oasis There she had lived all those years with the chief to whom her last purchaser had trafficked her She did not even know that her husband s village was an integral part of the Khedive s territory far less that the English were now in practical occupation of Egypt She had heard nothing and learnt nothing since that fateful day she had waited in vain for the off chance of a deliverer But did you never try to run away to the Nile I cried astonished Run away How could I I did not even know which way the river lay and was it possible for me to cross the desert on foot or find the chance of a camel The Senoosis would have killed me Even with you to help me see what dangers surround me alone I should have perished like Hagar in the wilderness with no angel to save me An ye ve got the angel now doctor Macloghlen exclaimed glancing at me Steady there mister Sheikh What s this that s coming It was another caravan going the opposite way on its road to the oasis A voice halloaed from it Our new friend clung tight to me My husband she whispered gasping They were still far off on the desert and the moon shone bright A few hurried words to the Doctor and with a wild resolve we faced the emergency He made the camels halt and all of us springing off crouched down behind their shadows in such a way that the coming caravan must pass on the far side of us At the same moment the Doctor turned resolutely to the sheikh Look here mister Arab he said in a quiet voice with one more appeal to the simple Volapuk of the pointed revolver I cover ye wid this Let these frinds of yours go by If there s anny unnecessary talking betwixt ye or anny throuble of anny kind remimber the first bullet goes sthraight as an arrow t rough that haythen head of yours The sheikh salaamed more submissively than ever The caravan drew abreast of us We could hear them cry aloud on either side the customary salutes In Allah s name peace answered by Allah is great there is no god but Allah Would anything more happen Would our sheikh play us false It was a moment of breathlessness We crouched and cowered in the shade holding our hearts with fear while the Arab drivers pretended to be unsaddling the camels A minute or two of anxious suspense then peering over our beasts backs we saw their long line filing off towards the oasis We watched their turbaned heads silhouetted against the sky disappear slowly One by one they faded away The danger was past With beating hearts we rose up again The Doctor sprang into his place and seated himself on his camel Now ride on mister Sheikh he said wid all yer men as if grim death was afther ye Camels or no camels ye ve got to march all night for ye ll never draw rein till we re safe back at Geergeh And sure enough we never halted under the persuasive influence of that loaded revolver till we dismounted once more in the early dawn upon the Nile bank under British protection Then Elsie and I and our rescued country woman broke down together in an orgy of relief We hugged one another and cried like so many children VIII 
6853-12339-0000	train-other-500	THE ADVENTURE OF THE PEA GREEN PATRICIAN Away to India A life on the ocean wave once more and may it prove less wavy In plain prose my arrangement with my proprietor mister Elworthy
6853-12339-0001	train-other-500	thus we speak in the newspaper trade included a trip to Bombay for myself and Elsie So as soon as we had drained Upper Egypt journalistically dry we returned to Cairo on our road to Suez I am glad to say
6853-12339-0002	train-other-500	my letters to the Daily Telephone gave satisfaction My employer wrote You are a born journalist I confess this surprised me for I have always considered myself a truthful person Still as he evidently meant it for praise
6853-12339-0003	train-other-500	I took the doubtful compliment in good part and offered no remonstrance I have a mercurial temperament My spirits rise and fall as if they were Consols Monotonous Egypt depressed me as it depressed the Israelites
6853-12339-0004	train-other-500	but the passage of the Red Sea set me sounding my timbrel I love fresh air I love the sea if the sea will but behave itself and I positively revelled in the change from Egypt
none	none	 Unfortunately we had taken our passages by a P and O steamer from Suez to Bombay many weeks beforehand 
6853-12339-0005	train-other-500	so as to secure good berths and still more unfortunately in a letter to Lady Georgina I had chanced to mention the name of our ship and the date of the voyage I kept up a spasmodic correspondence with Lady Georgina nowadays
6853-12339-0006	train-other-500	tuppence ha penny a fortnight the dear cantankerous racy old lady had been the foundation of my fortunes and I was genuinely grateful to her or rather I ought to say she had been their second foundress
6853-12339-0007	train-other-500	for I will do myself the justice to admit that the first was my own initiative and enterprise
none	none	 I flatter myself I have the knack of taking the tide on the turn and I am justly proud of it But being a grateful animal I wrote once a fortnight to report progress to Lady Georgina Besides let me whisper strictly between ourselves twas an indirect way of hearing about Harold This time however as events turned out I recognised that I had made a grave mistake in confiding my movements to my shrewd old lady She did not betray me on purpose of course but I gathered later that casually in conversation she must have mentioned the fact and date of my sailing before somebody who ought to have had no concern in it and the somebody I found had governed himself accordingly All this however I only discovered afterwards So without anticipating I will narrate the facts exactly as they occurred to me Illustration AN ODD LOOKING YOUNG MAN When we mounted the gangway of the Jumna at Suez and began the process of frizzling down the Red Sea I noted on deck almost at once an odd looking young man of twenty two or thereabouts with a curious faint pea green complexion He was the wishy washiest young man I ever beheld in my life an achromatic study in spite of the delicate pea greeniness of his skin 
6853-12339-0009	train-other-500	all the colouring matter of the body seemed somehow to have faded out of him
none	none	 Perhaps he had been bleached As he leant over the taffrail gazing down with open mouth and vacant stare at the water I took a good long look at him He interested me much because he was so exceptionally uninteresting 
6853-12339-0010	train-other-500	a pallid anaemic indefinite hobbledehoy with a high narrow forehead and sketchy features He had watery restless eyes of an insipid light blue
none	none	 thin yellow hair almost white in its paleness and twitching hands that played nervously all the time with a shadowy moustache This shadowy moustache seemed to absorb 
6853-12339-0011	train-other-500	as a rule the best part of his attention it was so sparse and so blanched that he felt it continually to assure himself no doubt of the reality of its existence I need hardly add that he wore an eye glass
none	none	 He was an aristocrat I felt sure Eton and Christ Church no 
6853-12339-0012	train-other-500	ordinary person could have been quite so flavourless
none	none	 Imbecility like his is only to be attained as the result of long 
6853-12339-0013	train-other-500	and judicious selection He went on gazing in a vacant way at the water below an ineffectual patrician smile playing feebly round the corners of his mouth meanwhile Then he turned and stared at me as I lay back in my deck chair
6853-12339-0014	train-other-500	For a minute he looked me over as if I were a horse for sale When he had finished inspecting me he beckoned to somebody at the far end of the quarter deck The somebody sidled up with a deferential air
6853-12339-0015	train-other-500	which confirmed my belief in the pea green young man s aristocratic origin
none	none	 It was such deference as the British flunkey pays only to blue blood 
6853-12339-0016	train-other-500	for he has gradations of flunkeydom He is respectful to wealth polite to acquired rank but servile only to hereditary nobility Indeed you can make a rough guess at the social status of the person he addresses
6853-12339-0017	train-other-500	by observing which one of his twenty seven nicely graduated manners he adopts in addressing him The pea green young man glanced over in my direction and murmured something to the satellite whose back was turned towards me
none	none	 I felt sure from his attitude 
6853-12339-0018	train-other-500	he was asking whether I was the person he suspected me to be The satellite nodded assent whereat the pea green young man screwing up his face to fix his eye glass
none	none	 stared harder than ever 
6853-12339-0019	train-other-500	He must be heir to a peerage I felt convinced nobody short of that rank would consider himself entitled to stare with such frank unconcern at an unknown lady Presently
6853-12339-0020	train-other-500	it further occurred to me that the satellite s back seemed strangely familiar I have seen that man somewhere Elsie I whispered putting aside the wisps of hair that blew about my face So have I dear
6853-12339-0021	train-other-500	Elsie answered with a slight shudder
none	none	 And I was instinctively aware that I too disliked him As Elsie spoke 
6853-12339-0022	train-other-500	the man turned and strolled slowly past us
none	none	 with that ineffable insolence which is the other side of the flunkey s insufferable self abasement 
6853-12339-0023	train-other-500	He cast a glance at us as he went by a withering glance of brazen effrontery
none	none	 We knew him now of course 
6853-12339-0024	train-other-500	it was that variable star our old acquaintance mister Higginson the courier
none	none	 He was here as himself this time 
6853-12339-0025	train-other-500	no longer the count or the mysterious faith healer The diplomat hid his rays under the garb of the man servant Depend upon it Elsie I cried clutching her arm with a vague sense of fear
6853-12339-0026	train-other-500	this man means mischief There is danger ahead When a creature of Higginson s sort who has risen to be a count and a fashionable physician descends again to be a courier
6853-12339-0027	train-other-500	you may rest assured it is because he has something to gain by it He has some deep scheme afloat
none	none	 And we are part of it 
6853-12339-0028	train-other-500	His master looks weak enough and silly enough for anything Elsie answered eyeing the suspected lordling I should think he is just the sort of man such a wily rogue would naturally fasten upon
none	none	 When a wily rogue gets hold of a weak fool who is also dishonest 
6853-12339-0029	train-other-500	I said the two together may make a formidable combination But never mind We re forewarned I think I shall be even with him
6853-12339-0030	train-other-500	That evening at dinner in the saloon the pea green young man strolled in with a jaunty air and took his seat next to us The Red Sea by the way was kinder than the Mediterranean
6853-12339-0031	train-other-500	it allowed us to dine from the very first evening Cards had been laid on the plates to mark our places I glanced at my neighbour s It bore the inscription Viscount Southminster
none	none	 That was the name of Lord Kynaston s eldest son 
6853-12339-0032	train-other-500	Lady Georgina s nephew Harold Tillington s cousin So this was the man who might possibly inherit mister Marmaduke Ashurst s money
6853-12339-0033	train-other-500	I remembered now how often and how fervently Lady Georgina had said Kynaston s sons are all fools If the rest came up to sample I was inclined to agree with her It also flashed across me that Lord Southminster might have heard
none	none	 through Higginson of our meeting with mister Marmaduke Ashurst at Florence 
6853-12339-0034	train-other-500	and of my acquaintance with Harold Tillington at Schlangenbad and Lungern With a woman s instinct I jumped at the fact that the pea green young man had taken passage by this boat on purpose to baffle both me
none	none	 and Harold Thinking it over it seemed to me too that he might have various possible points of view on the matter 
6853-12339-0035	train-other-500	He might desire for example that Harold should marry me under the impression that his marriage with a penniless outsider would annoy his uncle for the pea
none	none	 green young man doubtless thought that I was still to mister Ashurst just that dreadful adventuress 
6853-12339-0036	train-other-500	If so his obvious cue would be to promote a good understanding between Harold and myself in order to make us marry so that the urbane old gentlemen might then disinherit his favourite nephew and make a new will
none	none	 in Lord Southminster s interest 
6853-12339-0037	train-other-500	Or again the pea green young man might on the contrary be aware that mister Ashurst and I had got on admirably together when we met at Florence
none	none	 in which case his aim would naturally be to find out something that might set the rich uncle against me Yet once more 
6853-12339-0038	train-other-500	he might merely have heard that I had drawn up Uncle Marmaduke s will at the office and he might desire to worm the contents of it out of me Whichever was his design I resolved to be upon my guard in every word I said to him
none	none	 and leave no door open to any trickery either way For of one thing I felt sure 
6853-12339-0039	train-other-500	that the colourless young man had torn himself away from the mud honey of Piccadilly for this voyage to India only because he had heard there was a chance of meeting me That was a politic move whoever planned it himself or Higginson
6853-12339-0040	train-other-500	for a week on board ship with a person or persons is the very best chance of getting thrown in with them whether they like it or lump it they can t easily avoid you
none	none	 It was while I was pondering these things in my mind and resolving with myself not to give myself away that the young man with the pea green face lounged in and dropped into the next seat to me He was dressed amongst other things in a dinner jacket and a white tie for myself I detest such fopperies on board ship they seem to me out of place they conflict with the infinite possibilities of the situation One stands too near the realities of things Evening dress and mal de mer sort ill together Illustration HE TURNED TO ME WITH AN INANE SMILE As my neighbour sat down he turned to me with an inane smile which occupied all his face Good evening he said in a baronial drawl Miss Cayley I gathah I asked the skippah s leave to set next yah 
6853-12339-0041	train-other-500	We ought to be friends rathah I think yah know my poor deah old aunt Lady Georgina Fawley I bowed a somewhat freezing bow
6853-12339-0042	train-other-500	Lady Georgina is one of my dearest friends I answered No really Poor deah old Georgey
none	none	 Got somebody to stick up for her at last has she 
6853-12339-0043	train-other-500	Now that s what I call chivalrous of yah Magnanimous isn t it I like to see people stick up for their friends And it must be a novelty for Georgey
6853-12339-0044	train-other-500	For between you and me a moah cantankerous spiteful acidulated old cough drop than the poor deah soul it ud be difficult to hit upon Lady Georgina has brains I answered
none	none	 and they enable her to recognise a fool when she sees him 
6853-12339-0045	train-other-500	I will admit that she does not suffer fools gladly He turned to me with a sudden sharp look in the depths of the lack lustre eyes Already it began to strike me that though the pea green young man was inane he had his
6853-12339-0046	train-other-500	due proportion of a certain insidious practical cunning
none	none	 That s true he answered measuring me 
6853-12339-0047	train-other-500	And according to her almost everybody s a fool especially her relations There s a fine knack of sweeping generalisation about deah skinny old Georgey
6853-12339-0048	train-other-500	The few people she reahlly likes are all archangels the rest are blithering idiots there s no middle course with her I held my peace frigidly
6853-12339-0049	train-other-500	She thinks me a very special and peculiah fool he went on crumbling his bread Lady Georgina I answered is a person of exceptional discrimination
6853-12339-0050	train-other-500	I would almost always accept her judgment on anyone as practically final He laid down his soup spoon fondled the imperceptible moustache with his tapering fingers and then broke once more into a cheerful expanse of smile
none	none	 which reminded me of nothing so much as of the village idiot 
6853-12339-0051	train-other-500	It spread over his face as the splash from a stone spreads over a mill pond Now that s a nice cheerful sort of thing to say to a fellah he ejaculated fixing his eye glass in his eye with a few
6853-12339-0052	train-other-500	fierce contortions of his facial muscles That s encouraging don t yah know as the foundation of an acquaintance Makes a good cornah stone Calculated to place things
none	none	 at once upon what yah call a friendly basis Georgey said you had a pretty wit I see now why she admiahed it Birds of a feathah very wise old proverb I reflected that after all this young man had nothing overt against him beyond a fishy blue eye and an inane expression so feeling that I had perhaps gone a little too far I continued after a minute And your uncle how is he Marmy he inquired with another elephantine smile and then I perceived it was a form of humour with him or rather a cheap substitute to speak of his elder relations by their abbreviated Christian names without any prefix 
6853-12339-0053	train-other-500	Marmy s doing very well thank yah as well as could be expected In fact bettah Habakkuk on the brain it s carrying him off at last He has
6853-12339-0054	train-other-500	Bright s disease very bad drank port don t yah know and won t trouble this wicked world much longah with his presence It will be a happy release especially for his nephews
none	none	 I was really grieved for I had grown 
6853-12339-0055	train-other-500	to like the urbane old gentleman as I had grown to like the cantankerous old lady
none	none	 In spite of his fussiness and his Stock Exchange views on the interpretation of Scripture his genuine kindliness 
6853-12339-0056	train-other-500	and his real liking for me had softened my heart to him and my face must have shown my distress for the pea green young man added quickly with an afterthought
none	none	 But you needn t be afraid yah know 
6853-12339-0057	train-other-500	It s all right for Harold Tillington You ought to know that as well as anyone and bettah for it was you who drew up his will for him at Florence I flushed crimson I believe
none	none	 Then he knew all about me 
6853-12339-0058	train-other-500	I was not asking on mister Tillington s account I answered I asked because I have a personal feeling of friendship for your uncle mister Ashurst His hand strayed up to the straggling yellow hairs on his upper lip once more
6853-12339-0059	train-other-500	and he smiled again this time with a curious undercurrent of foolish craftiness That s a good one he answered Georgey told me you were original Marmy s a millionaire
6853-12339-0060	train-other-500	and many people love millionaires for their money But to love Marmy for himself
none	none	 I do call that originality Why weight for age he s acknowledged to be the most portentous 
6853-12339-0061	train-other-500	old boah in London society I like mister Ashurst because he has a kind heart and some genuine instincts I answered He has not allowed all human feeling to be replaced by a cheap mask of Pall Mall cynicism
6853-12339-0062	train-other-500	Oh I say how s that for preaching
none	none	 Don t you manage to give it hot to a fellah neithah And at sight too without the usual three days of grace Have some of my champagne 
6853-12339-0063	train-other-500	I m a forgiving creachah No thank you I prefer this hock Your friend then
none	none	 And he motioned the steward to pass the bottle 
6853-12339-0064	train-other-500	To my great disgust Elsie held out her glass I was annoyed at that
none	none	 It showed she had missed the drift of our conversation and was therefore lacking in feminine intuition I should be sorry if I had allowed the higher mathematics to kill out in me the most distinctively womanly faculty From that first day forth however 
6853-12339-0065	train-other-500	in spite of this beginning Lord Southminster almost
none	none	 persecuted me with his persistent attentions He did all a fellah could possibly do to please me 
6853-12339-0066	train-other-500	I could not make out precisely what he was driving at but I saw he had some artful game of his own to play and that he was playing it subtly
none	none	 I also saw that vapid as he was 
6853-12339-0067	train-other-500	his vapidity did not prevent him from being worldly wise with the wisdom of the self seeking man of the world who utterly distrusts
none	none	 and disbelieves in all the higher emotions of humanity 
6853-12339-0068	train-other-500	He harped so often on this string that on our second day out as we lolled on deck in the heat I had to rebuke him sharply He had been sneering for some hours There are two kinds of silly simplicity Lord Southminster I said at last
none	none	 One kind is the silly simplicity of the rustic who trusts everybody the other kind is the silly simplicity of the Pall Mall clubman who trusts nobody It is just as foolish 
6853-12339-0069	train-other-500	and just as one sided to overlook the good as to overlook the evil in humanity
none	none	 If you trust everyone you are likely to be taken in but if you trust no one you put yourself at a serious practical disadvantage 
6853-12339-0070	train-other-500	besides losing half the joy of living Then you think me a fool like Georgey he broke out I should never be rude enough to say so I answered fanning myself Well
6853-12339-0071	train-other-500	you re what I call a first rate companion for a voyage down the Red Sea he put in gazing abstractedly at the awnings Such a lovely freezing mixture A fellah doesn t need ices when you re on tap
none	none	 I recommend you as a refrigeratah I am glad I answered demurely if I have secured your approbation in that humble capacity I m sure I have tried hard for it Illustration NOTHING SEEMED TO PUT THE MAN DOWN Yet nothing that I could say seemed to put the man down In spite of rebuffs he was assiduous in running down the companion ladder 
6853-12339-0072	train-other-500	for my parasol or my smelling bottle he fetched me chairs he stayed me with cushions he offered to lend me books he pestered me to drink his wine and he kept Elsie in champagne which she annoyed me by accepting
none	none	 Poor dear Elsie clearly failed to understand the creature He s so kind and polite Brownie isn t he 
6853-12339-0073	train-other-500	she would observe in her simple fashion Do you know I think he s
none	none	 taken quite a fancy to you 
6853-12339-0074	train-other-500	And he ll be an earl by and by I call it romantic
none	none	 How lovely it would seem dear 
6853-12339-0075	train-other-500	to see you a countess Elsie I said severely with one hand on her arm you are a dear little soul and I am very fond of you but if you think I could sell myself for a coronet to
none	none	 a pasty faced young man with a pea 
6853-12339-0076	train-other-500	green complexion and glassy blue eyes I can only say my child you have misread my character He isn t a man he s a lump of putty I think Elsie was quite shocked that I should apply these terms
6853-12339-0077	train-other-500	to a courtesy lord the eldest son of a peer Nature had endowed her with the profound British belief that peers should be spoken of in choice and peculiar language If a peer s a fool Lady Georgina said once to me
6853-12339-0078	train-other-500	people think you should say his temperament does not fit him for the conduct of affairs if he s a roue or a drunkard they think you should say he has unfortunate weaknesses What most of all convinced me however
6853-12339-0079	train-other-500	that the wishy washy young man with the pea green complexion must be playing some stealthy game was the demeanour and mental attitude of mister Higginson his courier
none	none	 After the first day Higginson appeared to be politeness 
6853-12339-0080	train-other-500	and deference itself to us He behaved to us both almost as if we belonged to the titled classes He treated us with the second best of his twenty seven graduated manners
6853-12339-0081	train-other-500	He fetched and carried for us with a courtly grace which recalled that distinguished diplomat the Comte de Laroche sur Loiret at the station at Malines with Lady Georgina It is true
6853-12339-0082	train-other-500	at his politest moments I often caught the undercurrent of a wicked twinkle in his eye and felt sure he was doing it all with some profound motive But his external demeanour was everything that one could desire from a well trained man servant
none	none	 I could hardly believe it was the same man who had growled to me at Florence I shall be even with you yet as he left our office Do you know Brownie Elsie mused once I really begin to think we must have misjudged Higginson He s so extremely polite Perhaps after all he is really a count who has been exiled and impoverished for his political opinions 
6853-12339-0083	train-other-500	I smiled and held my tongue Silence costs nothing But mister Higginson s political opinions I felt sure were of that simple communistic sort which the law in its blunt way calls fraudulent
6853-12339-0084	train-other-500	They consisted in a belief that all was his which he could lay his hands on Higginson s a splendid fellah for his place yah know Miss Cayley Lord Southminster said to me one evening as we were approaching Aden
none	none	 What I like about him is he s so 
6853-12339-0085	train-other-500	doosid intelligent Extremely so I answered Then the devil entered into me again
none	none	 He had the doosid intelligence even to take in Lady Georgina 
6853-12339-0086	train-other-500	Yaas that s just it don t you know Georgey told me that story Screamingly funny wasn t it And I said to myself at once
6853-12339-0087	train-other-500	Higginson s the man for me I want a courier with jolly lots of brains
none	none	 and no blooming scruples I ll entice this chap away from Marmy And I did I outbid Marmy Oh yaas he s a first rate fellah Higginson What I want is a man who will do what he s told and ask no beastly unpleasant questions Higginson s that man He s as sharp as a ferret And as dishonest as they make them He opened his hands with a gesture of unconcern All the bettah for my purpose 
6853-12339-0088	train-other-500	See how frank I am Miss Cayley
none	none	 I tell the truth 
6853-12339-0089	train-other-500	The truth is very rare You ought to respect me for it It depends somewhat upon the kind of truth I answered with a random shot I don t respect a man for instance
6853-12339-0090	train-other-500	for confessing to a forgery He winced Not for months after did I know how a stone thrown at a venture had chanced to hit the spot and had vastly enhanced his opinion of my cleverness
6853-12339-0091	train-other-500	You have heard about doctor Fortescue Langley too I suppose I went on
none	none	 Oh yaas 
6853-12339-0092	train-other-500	Wasn t it real jam
none	none	 He did the doctor trick on a lady in Switzerland And the way he has come it ovah deah simple old Marmy He played Marmy with Ezekiel Not so dusty was it He s too lovely for anything He s an edged tool I said Yaas that s why I use him And edged tools may cut the user s fingers Illustration YAH DON T CATCH ME GOING SO FAH FROM NEWMARKET Not mine he answered taking out a cigarette Oh deah no He can t turn against me He wouldn t dare to Yah see I have the fellah entirely in my powah I know all his little games and I can expose him any day But it suits me to keep him I don t mind telling yah since I respect your intellect 
6853-12339-0093	train-other-500	that he and I are engaged in pulling off a big coup togethah If it were not for that
none	none	 I wouldn t be heah Yah don t catch me going away so fah from Newmarket 
6853-12339-0094	train-other-500	and the Empire for nothing I judged as much I answered
none	none	 And then I was silent But I wondered to myself 
6853-12339-0095	train-other-500	why the neutral tinted young man should be so communicative to an obviously hostile stranger
none	none	 For the next few days it amused me to see how hard our lordling tried to suit his conversation to myself and Elsie 
6853-12339-0096	train-other-500	He was absurdly anxious to humour us Just at first it is true he had discussed the subjects that lay nearest to his own heart
none	none	 He was an ardent votary of the noble quadruped 
6853-12339-0097	train-other-500	and he loved the turf whose sward we judged he trod mainly at Tattersall s He spoke to us with erudition on two year old form and gave us several safe things for the spring handicaps
6853-12339-0098	train-other-500	The Oaks he considered a moral for Clorinda He also retailed certain choice anecdotes about ladies whose Christian names were chiefly Tottie and Flo and whose honoured surnames have escaped my memory
6853-12339-0099	train-other-500	Most of them flourished I recollect at the Frivolity Music Hall
none	none	 But when he learned that our interest in the noble quadruped was scarcely more than tepid and that we had never even visited the Friv as he affectionately called it he did his best in turn to acquire 
6853-12339-0100	train-other-500	our subjects He had heard us talk about Florence for example and he gathered from our talk that we loved its art treasures So he
none	none	 set himself to work to be studiously artistic 
6853-12339-0101	train-other-500	It was a beautiful study in human ineptitude
none	none	 Ah yaas he murmured turning up the pale blue eyes ecstatically towards the mast head 
6853-12339-0102	train-other-500	Chawming place Florence I dote on the
none	none	 pickchahs 
6853-12339-0103	train-other-500	I know them all by heart
none	none	 I assuah yah 
6853-12339-0104	train-other-500	I ve spent houahs and houahs feeding my soul in the galleries And what particular painter does your soul most feed upon I asked bluntly with a smile The question staggered him
6853-12339-0105	train-other-500	I could see him hunting through the vacant chambers of his brain for a Florentine painter Then a faint light gleamed in the leaden eyes and he fingered the straw coloured moustache with that nervous hand till he almost put a visible point upon it
none	none	 Ah Raphael 
6853-12339-0106	train-other-500	he said tentatively with an inquiring air yet beaming at his success Don t you think so Splendid artist Raphael And a very safe guess I answered leading him on
6853-12339-0107	train-other-500	You can t go far wrong in mentioning Raphael can you But after him He dived into the recesses of his memory again peered about him for a minute or two and brought back nothing
6853-12339-0108	train-other-500	I can t remembah the othah fellahs names he went on they re all so much alike all in elli don t yah know but I recollect at the time
none	none	 they impressed me awfully No doubt 
6853-12339-0109	train-other-500	I answered He tried to look through me and failed Then he plunged like a noble sportsman that he was on a second fetch of memory
none	none	 Ah and Michael Angelo he went on quite proud of his treasure trove Sweet things Michael Angelo s 
6853-12339-0110	train-other-500	Very sweet I admitted So simple so touching so tender so domestic I thought Elsie would explode but she kept her countenance
none	none	 The pea green young man gazed at me uneasily He had half an idea by this time 
6853-12339-0111	train-other-500	that I was making game of him However he fished up a name once more and clutched at it Savonarola too he adventured I adore Savonarola
none	none	 His pickchahs are beautiful 
6853-12339-0112	train-other-500	And so rare Elsie murmured Then there is Fra Diavolo I suggested going one better
none	none	 How do you like Fra Diavolo He seemed to have heard the name before but still he hesitated 
6853-12339-0113	train-other-500	Ah what did he paint he asked with growing caution
none	none	 I stuffed him valiantly Those charming angels you know I answered 
6853-12339-0114	train-other-500	With the roses and the glories
none	none	 Oh yaas I recollect 
6853-12339-0115	train-other-500	All askew aren t they like this I remembah them very well But
none	none	 a doubt flitted across his brain wasn t his name Fra Angelico His brother I replied casting truth to the winds They worked together you must have heard One did the saints the other did the opposite Division of labour don t you see Fra Angelico Fra Diavolo Illustration WASN T FRA DIAVOLO ALSO A COMPOSAH He fingered his cigarette with a dubious hand and wriggled his eye glass tighter Yaas beautiful beautiful But growing suspicious apace wasn t Fra Diavolo also a composah Of course I assented In his off time he composed Those early Italians so versatile you see so versatile He had his doubts but he suppressed them And Torricelli I went on with a side glance at Elsie who was choking by this time And Chianti and Frittura and Cinquevalli and Giulio Romano His distrust increased Now you re trying to make me commit myself he drawled out I remembah Torricelli 
6853-12339-0116	train-other-500	he s the fellah who used to paint all his women crooked But
none	none	 Chianti s a wine 
6853-12339-0117	train-other-500	I ve often drunk it and Romano s well every fellah knows Romano s is a restaurant near the Gaiety Theatre Besides I continued in a drawl like his own there are
none	none	 Risotto 
6853-12339-0118	train-other-500	and Gnocchi and Vermicelli and
none	none	 Anchovy all famous paintahs 
6853-12339-0119	train-other-500	and all of whom I don t doubt you admiah Elsie exploded at last
none	none	 But he took no offence He smiled inanely as if he rather enjoyed it Look heah you know he said with his crafty smile that s one too 
6853-12339-0120	train-other-500	much I m not taking any
none	none	 You think yourselves very clevah for kidding me with paintahs who are really macaroni and cheese and claret yet if I were to tell you the Lejah was run at Ascot or the Cesarewitch at Doncastah why you d be no wisah When it comes to art I don t have a look in but I could tell you a thing or two about starting prices And I was forced to admit that there he had reason Still I think he realised that he had better avoid the subject of art in future as we avoided the noble quadruped He saw his limitations Not till the last evening before we reached Bombay did I really understand the nature of my neighbour s project That evening as it chanced Elsie had a headache and went below early I stopped with her till she dozed off then I slipped up on deck once more for a breath of fresh air before retiring for the night to the hot and stuffy cabin It was an exquisite evening The moon rode in the pale green sky of the tropics A strange light still lingered on the western horizon The stifling heat of the Red Sea had given way long since to the refreshing coolness of the Indian Ocean I strolled a while on the quarter deck and sat down at last near the stern Next moment I was aware of somebody creeping up to me Look heah Miss Cayley a voice broke in I m in luck at last I ve been waiting oh evah so long for this opportunity I turned and faced him Have you indeed I answered Well I have not Lord Southminster I tried to rise but he motioned me back to my chair There were ladies on deck and to avoid being noticed I sank into my seat again I want to speak to you he went on in a voice that for him was almost impressive Half a mo Miss Cayley I want to say this last night you misunderstand me On the contrary I answered the trouble is that I understand you perfectly No yah don t Look heah He bent forward quite romantically I m going to be perfectly frank Of course yah know that when I came on board this ship I came to checkmate yah Of course I replied Why else should you and Higginson have bothered to come here He rubbed his hands together That s just it You re always clevah You hit it first shot But there s wheah the point comes in At first I only thought of how we could circumvent yah I treated yah as the enemy Now it s all the othah way Miss Cayley you re the cleverest woman I evah met in this world you extort my admiration I could not repress a smile I didn t know how it was but I could see I possessed some mysterious attraction for the Ashurst family I was fatal to Ashursts Lady Georgina Harold Tillington the Honourable Marmaduke Lord Southminster different types as they were all succumbed without one blow to me You flatter me I answered coldly No I don t he cried flashing his cuffs and gazing affectionately at his sleeve links Pon my soul I assuah yah I mean it I can t tell you how much I admiah yah I admiah your intellect Every day I have seen yah I feel it moah and moah Why you re the only person who has evah out flanked my fellah Higginson As a rule I don t think much of women I ve been through several London seasons and lots of em have tried their level best to catch me the cleverest mammas have been aftah me for their Ethels But I wasn t so easily caught I dodged the Ethels With you it s different I feel he paused you re a woman a fellah might be really proud of You are too kind I answered in my refrigerator voice Well will you take me he asked trying to seize my hand Miss Cayley if you will you will make me unspeakably happy It was a great effort for him and I was sorry to crush it I regret I said that I am compelled to deny you unspeakable happiness Illustration TAKE MY WORD FOR IT YOU RE STAKING YOUR MONEY ON THE WRONG FELLAH Oh but you don t catch on You mistake Let me explain You re backing the othah man Now I happen to know about that and I assuah you it s an error Take my word for it you re staking your money on the wrong fellah I do not understand you I replied drawing away from his approach And what is more I may add you could never understand me Yaas but I do I understand perfectly I can see where you go wrong You drew up Marmy s will and you think Marmy has left all he s worth to Harold Tillington so you re putting every penny you ve got on Harold Well that s mere moonshine Harold may think it s all right but it s not all right There s many a slip twixt the cup and the Probate Court Listen heah Miss Cayley Higginson and I are a jolly sight sharpah than your friend Harold Harold s what they call a clevah fellah in society and I m what they call a fool but I know bettah than Harold which side of my bread s buttahed I don t doubt it I answered Well I have managed this business I don t mind telling you now I had a telegram from Marmy s valet when we touched at Aden and poor old Marmy s sinking Habakkuk s been too much for him Sixteen stone going under Why am I not with him yah may ask Because when a man of Marmy s temperament is dying it s safah to be away from him There s plenty of time for Marmy to altah his will yet and there are othah contingencies Still Harold s quite out of it You take my word for it if you back Harold you back a man who s not going to get anything while if you back me you back the winnah with a coronet into the bargain And he smiled fatuously I looked at him with a look that would have made a wiser man wince But it fell flat on Lord Southminster Do you know why I do not rise and go down to my cabin at once I said slowly Because if I did somebody as I passed might see my burning cheeks cheeks flushed with shame at your insulting proposal and might guess that you had asked me and that I had refused you And I should shrink from the disgrace of anyone s knowing that you had put such a humiliation upon me You have been frank with me after your kind Lord Southminster frank with the frankness of a low and purely commercial nature I will be frank with you in turn You are right in supposing that I love Harold Tillington a man whose name I hate to mention in your presence But you are wrong in supposing that the disposition of mister Marmaduke Ashurst s money has or can have anything to do with the feelings I entertain towards him I would marry him all the sooner if he were poor and penniless You cannot understand that state of mind of course but you must be content to accept it And I would not marry you if there were no other man left in the world to marry I should as soon think of marrying a lump of dough I faced him all crimson Is that plain enough Do you see now that I really mean it He gazed at me with a curious look and twirled what he considered his moustache once more quite airily The man was imperturbable a pachydermatous imbecile You re all wrong yah know he said after a long pause during which he had regarded me through his eye glass as if I were a specimen of some rare new species You re all wrong and yah won t believe me But I tell yah I know what I m talking about You think it s quite safe about Marmy s money that he s left it to Harold because you drew the will up I assuah you that will s not worth the paper it s written on You fancy Harold s a hot favourite he s a rank outsidah I give you a chance and you won t take it I want yah because you re a remarkable woman Most of the Ethels cry when they re trying to make a fellah propose to em and I don t like em damp but you have some go about yah You insist upon backing the wrong man But you ll find your mistake out yet A bright idea struck him I say why don t you hedge Leave it open till Marmy s gone and then marry the winnah It was hopeless trying to make this clod understand His brain was not built with the right cells for understanding me Lord Southminster I said turning upon him and clasping my hands I will not go away while you stop here But you have some spark enough of a gentleman in your composition I hope not to inflict your company any longer upon a woman who does not desire it I ask you to leave me here alone When you have gone and I have had time to recover from your degrading offer I may perhaps feel able to go down to my cabin He stared at me with open blue eyes those watery blue eyes Oh just as you like he answered I wanted to do you a good turn because you re the only woman I evah really admiahed to say admiah don t you know not trotted round like the Ethels but you won t allow me I ll go if you wish it though I tell you again you re backing the wrong man and soonah or latah you ll discover it I don t mind laying you six to four against him Howevah I ll do one thing for yah I ll leave this offah always open I m not likely to marry any othah woman not good enough is it and if evah you find out you re mistaken about Harold Tillington remembah honour bright I shall be ready at any time to renew my offah By this time I was at boiling point I could not find words to answer him I waved him away angrily with one hand He raised his hat with quite a jaunty air and strolled off forward puffing his cigarette I don t think he even knew the disgust with which he inspired me I sat some hours with the cool air playing about my burning cheeks before I mustered up courage to rise and go down below again IX THE ADVENTURES OF THE MAGNIFICENT MAHARAJAH Our arrival at Bombay was a triumphal entry We were received like royalty Indeed to tell you the truth Elsie and I were beginning to get just a leetle bit spoiled It struck us now that our casual connection with the Ashurst family in its various branches had succeeded in saddling us like the Lady of Burleigh with the burden of an honour unto which we were not born We were everywhere treated as persons of importance and oh dear by dint of such treatment we began to feel at last almost as if we had been raised in the purple I felt that when we got back to England we should turn up our noses at plain bread and butter Yes life has been kind to me Have your researches into English literature ever chanced to lead you into reading Horace Walpole I wonder That polite trifler is fond of a word which he coined himself Serendipity It derives from the name of a certain happy Indian Prince Serendip whom he unearthed or invented in some obscure Oriental story a prince for whom the fairies or the genii always managed to make everything pleasant It implies the faculty which a few of us possess of finding whatever we want turn up accidentally at the exact right moment Well I believe I must have been born with serendipity in my mouth in place of the proverbial silver spoon for wherever I go all things seem to come out exactly right for me The Jumna for example had hardly heaved to in Bombay Harbour when we noticed on the quay a very distinguished looking Oriental potentate in a large white turban with a particularly big diamond stuck ostentatiously in its front He stalked on board with a martial air as soon as we stopped and made inquiries from our captain after someone he expected The captain received him with that odd mixture of respect for rank and wealth combined with true British contempt for the inferior black man which is universal among his class in their dealings with native Indian nobility The Oriental potentate however who was accompanied by a gorgeous suite like that of the Wise Men in Italian pictures seemed satisfied with his information and moved over with his stately glide in our direction Elsie and I were standing near the gangway among our rugs and bundles in the hopeless helplessness of disembarkation He approached us respectfully and bowing with extended hands and a deferential air asked in excellent English May I venture to inquire which of you two ladies is Miss Lois Cayley I am I replied my breath taken away by this unexpected greeting May I venture to inquire in return how you came to know I was arriving by this steamer Illustration I AM THE MAHARAJAH OF MOOZUFFERNUGGAR He held out his hand with a courteous inclination I am the Maharajah of Moozuffernuggar he answered in an impressive tone as if everybody knew of the Maharajah of Moozuffernuggar as familiarly as they knew of the Duke of Cambridge Moozuffernuggar in Rajputana not the one in the Doab You must have heard my name from mister Harold Tillington I had not but I dissembled so as to salve his pride mister Tillington s friends are our friends I answered sententiously And mister Tillington s friends are my friends the Maharajah retorted with a low bow to Elsie This is no doubt Miss Petheridge I have heard of your expected arrival as you will guess from Tillington He and I were at Oxford together I am a Merton man It was Tillington who first taught me all I know of cricket He took me to stop at his father s place in Dumfriesshire I owe much to his friendship and when he wrote me that friends of his were arriving by the Jumna why I made haste to run down to Bombay to greet them The episode was one of those topsy turvy mixtures of all places and ages which only this jumbled century of ours has witnessed it impressed me deeply Here was this Indian prince a feudal Rajput chief living practically among his vassals in the Middle Ages when at home in India yet he said I am a Merton man as Harold himself might have said it and he talked about cricket as naturally as Lord Southminster talked about the noble quadruped The oddest part of it all was we alone felt the incongruity to the Maharajah the change from Moozuffernuggar to Oxford and from Oxford back again to Moozuffernuggar seemed perfectly natural They were but two alternative phases in a modern Indian gentleman s education and experience Still what were we to do with him If Harold had presented me with a white elephant I could hardly have been more embarrassed than I was at the apparition of this urbane and magnificent Hindoo prince He was young he was handsome he was slim for a rajah he wore European costume save for the huge white turban with its obtrusive diamond and he spoke English much better than a great many Englishmen Yet what place could he fill in my life and Elsie s For once I felt almost angry with Harold Why couldn t he have allowed us to go quietly through India two simple unofficial journalistic pilgrims in our native obscurity His Highness of Moozuffernuggar however had his own views on this question With a courteous wave of one dusky hand he motioned us gracefully into somebody else s deck chairs and then sat down on another beside us while the gorgeous suite stood by in respectful silence unctuous gentlemen in pink and gold brocade forming a court all round us Elsie and I unaccustomed to be so observed grew conscious of our hands our skirts our postures But the Maharajah posed himself with perfect unconcern like one well used to the fierce light of royalty I have come he said with simple dignity to superintend the preparations for your reception Gracious heavens I exclaimed Our reception Maharajah I think you misunderstand We are two ordinary English ladies of the proletariat accustomed to the level plain of professional society We expect no reception He bowed again with stately Eastern deference Friends of Tillington s he said shortly are persons of distinction Besides I have heard of you from Lady Georgina Fawley Lady Georgina is too good I answered though inwardly I raged against her Why couldn t she leave us alone to feed in peace on dak bungalow chicken instead of sending this regal mannered heathen to bother us So I have come down to Bombay to make sure that you are met in the style that befits your importance in society he went on waving his suite away with one careless hand for he saw it fussed us I mentioned you to His Honour the Acting Governor who had not heard you were coming His Honour s aide de camp will follow shortly with an invitation to Government House while you remain in Bombay which will not be many days I don t doubt for there is nothing in this city of plague to stop for Later on during your progress up country I do myself the honour to hope that you will stay as my guests for as long as you choose at Moozuffernuggar My first impulse was to answer Impossible Maharajah we couldn t dream of accepting your kind invitation But on second thoughts I remembered my duty to my proprietor Journalism first inclination afterwards My letter from Egypt on the rescue of the Englishwoman who escaped from Khartoum had brought me great eclat as a special correspondent and the Daily Telephone now billed my name in big letters on its placards so mister Elworthy wrote me Here was another noble chance must I not strive to rise to it Two English ladies at a native court in Rajputana that ought to afford scope for some rattling journalism It is extremely kind of you I said hesitating and it would give us great pleasure were it feasible to accept your friendly offer But English ideas you know prince Two unprotected women I hardly see how we could come alone to Moozuffernuggar unchaperoned The Maharajah s face lighted up he was evidently flattered that we should even thus dubiously entertain his proposal Oh I ve thought about that too he answered growing more colloquial in tone I ve been some days in Bombay making inquiries and preparations You see you had not informed the authorities of your intended visit so that you were travelling incognito or should it be incognita and if Tillington hadn t written to let me know your movements you might have arrived at this port without anybody s knowing it and have been compelled to take refuge in an hotel on landing He spoke as if we had been accustomed all our lives long to be received with red cloth by the Mayor and Corporation and presented with illuminated addresses and the freedom of the city in a gold snuff box But I have seen to all that The Acting Governor s aide de camp will be down before long and I have arranged that if you consent a little later to honour my humble roof in Rajputana with your august presence Major Balmossie and his wife will accompany you and chaperon you I have lived in England of course I understand that two English ladies of your rank and position cannot travel alone as if you were Americans But missus Balmossie is a nice little soul of unblemished character that sweet touch charmed me received at Government House he had learned the respect due to missus Grundy so that if you will accept my invitation you may rest assured that everything will be done with the utmost regard to the the unaccountable prejudices of Europeans His thoughtfulness took me aback I thanked him warmly He unbent at my thanks And I am obliged to you in return he said It gives me real pleasure to be able through you to repay Harold Tillington part of the debt I owe him He was so good to me at Oxford Miss Cayley you are new to India and therefore as yet no doubt unprejudiced You treat a native gentleman I see like a human being I hope you will not stop long enough in our country to get over that stage as happens to most of your countrymen and countrywomen In England a man like myself is an Indian prince in India to ninety nine out of a hundred Europeans he is just a damned nigger I smiled sympathetically I think I said venturing under these circumstances on a harmless little swear word of course in quotation marks you may trust me never to reach damn nigger point So I believe he answered if you are a friend of Harold Tillington s Ebony or ivory he never forgot we were two men together Illustration WHO S YOUR BLACK FRIEND Five minutes later when the Maharajah had gone to inquire about our luggage Lord Southminster strolled up Oh I say Miss Cayley he burst out I m off now ta ta but remembah that offah s always open By the way who s your black friend I couldn t help laughing at the airs the fellah gave himself To see a niggah sitting theah with his suite all round him waving his hands and sunning his rings and behaving for all the world as if he were a gentleman it s reahly too ridiculous Harold Tillington picked up with a fellah like that at Oxford doosid good cricketer too wondah if this is the same one Good bye Lord Southminster I said quietly with a stiff little bow Remember on your side that your offer was rejected once for all last night Yes the Indian prince is Harold Tillington s friend the Maharajah of Moozuffernuggar whose ancestors were princes while ours were dressed in woad and oak leaves But you were right about one thing he behaves like a gentleman Oh I say the pea green young man ejaculated drawing back that s anothah in the eye for me You re a good un at facers You gave me one for a welcome and you give me one now for a parting shot Nevah mind though I can wait you re backing the wrong fellah but you re not the Ethels and you re well worth waiting for He waved his hand So long See yah again in London And he retired with that fatuous smile still absorbing his features Our three days in Bombay were uneventful we merely waited to get rid of the roll of the ship which continued to haunt us for hours after we landed the floor of our bedrooms having acquired an ugly trick of rising in long undulations as if Bombay were suffering from chronic earthquake We made the acquaintance of His Honour the Acting Governor and His Honour s consort We were also introduced to missus Balmossie the lady who was to chaperon us to Moozuffernuggar Her husband was a soldierly Scotchman from Forfarshire but she herself was English a flighty little body with a perpetual giggle She giggled so much over the idea of the Maharajah s inviting us to his palace that I wondered why on earth she accepted his invitation At this she seemed surprised Why it s one of the jolliest places in Rajputana she answered with a bland Simla smile so picturesque he he he and so delightful Simpkin flows like water Simpkin s baboo English for champagne you know he he he and though of course the Maharajah s only a native like the rest of them he he he still he s been educated at Oxford and has mixed with Europeans and he knows how to make one he he he well thoroughly comfortable But what shall we eat I asked Rice ghee and chupatties Oh dear no he he he Europe food every bit of it Foie gras and York ham and wine ad lib His hospitality s massive If it weren t for that of course one wouldn t dream of going there But Archie hopes some day to be made Resident don t you know and it will do him no harm he he he with the Foreign Office to have cultivated friendly relations beforehand with His Highness of Moozuffernuggar These natives he he he so absurdly sensitive For myself the Maharajah interested me and I rather liked him Besides he was Harold s friend and that was in itself sufficient recommendation So I determined to push straight into the heart of native India first and only afterwards to do the regulation tourist round of Agra and Delhi the Taj and the mosques Benares and Allahabad leaving the English and Calcutta for the tail end of my journey It was better journalism as I thought that thought I began to fear that mister Elworthy was right after all and that I was a born journalist On the day fixed for our leaving Bombay whom should I meet but Lord Southminster with the Maharajah at the railway station He lounged up to me with that eternal smile still vaguely pervading his empty features Well we shall have a jolly party I gathah he said They tell me this niggah is famous for his tigahs I gazed at him positively taken aback You don t mean to tell me I cried you actually propose to accept the Maharajah s hospitality His smile absorbed him Yaas he answered twirling his yellow moustache and gazing across at the unconscious prince who was engaged in overlooking the arrangements for our saloon carriage The black fellah discovahed I was a cousin of Harold s so he came to call upon me at the club of which some Johnnies heah made me an honorary membah He s offahed me the run of his place while I m in Indiah and of course I ve accepted Eccentric sort of chap can t make him out myself says anyone connected with Harold Tillington is always deah to him Rum start isn t it He is a mere Oriental I answered unused to the ways of civilised life He cherishes the superannuated virtue of gratitude Yaas no doubt so I m coming along with you I drew back horrified Now While I am there After what I told you last week on the steamer Oh that s all right I bear yah no malice If I want any fun of course I must go while you re at Moozuffernuggar Why so Yah see this black boundah means to get up some big things at his place in your honah and one naturally goes to stop with anyone who has big things to offah Hang it all what does it mattah who a fellah is if he can give yah good shooting It s shooting don t yah know that keeps society in England togethah And therefore you propose to stop in the same house with me I exclaimed in spite of what I have told you Well Lord Southminster I should have thought there were limits which even your taste He cut me short with an inane grin There you make your blooming little erraw he answered airily I told yah I keep my offah still open and hang it all I don t mean to lose sight of yah in a hurry Some other fellah might come along and pick you up when I wasn t looking and I don t want to miss yah In point of fact I don t mind telling yah I back myself still for a couple of thou soonah or latah to marry yah It s dogged as does it faint heart they say nevah won fair lady If it had not been that I could not bear to disappoint my Indian prince I think when I heard this I should have turned back then and there at the station The journey up country was uneventful but dusty The Mofussil appears to consist mainly of dust indeed I can now recall nothing of it but one pervading white cloud which has blotted from my memory all its other components The dust clung to my hair after many washings and was never really beaten out of my travelling clothes I believe part of it thus went round the world with me to England When at last we reached Moozuffernuggar after two days and a night s hard travelling we were met by a crowd of local grandees who looked as if they had spent the greater part of their lives in brushing back their whiskers and we drove up at once in European carriages to the Maharajah s palace The look of it astonished me It was a strange and rambling old Hindoo hill fort high perched on a scarped crag like Edinburgh Castle and accessible only on one side up a gigantic staircase guarded on either hand by huge sculptured elephants cut in the living sandstone Below clustered the town an intricate mass of tangled alleys I had never seen anything so picturesque or so dirty in my life as for Elsie she was divided between admiration for its beauty and terror at the big whiskered and white turbaned attendants What sort of rooms shall we have I whispered to our moral guarantee missus Balmossie Oh beautiful dear the little lady smirked back Furnished throughout he he he by Liberty The Maharajah wants to do honour to his European guests he he he he fancies poor man he s quite European That s what comes of sending these creatures to Oxford So he s had suites of rooms furnished for any white visitors who may chance to come his way Ridiculous isn t it And champagne oh gallons of it He s quite proud of his rooms he he he he s always asking people to come and occupy them he thinks he s done them up in the best style of decoration He had reason for they were as tasteful as they were dainty and comfortable And I could not for the life of me make out why his hospitable inclination should be voted ridiculous But missus Balmossie appeared to find all natives alike a huge joke together She never even spoke of them without a condescending smile of distant compassion Indeed most Anglo Indians seem first to do their best to Anglicise the Hindoo and then to laugh at him for aping the Englishman After we had been three days at the palace and had spent hours in the wonderful temples and ruins the Maharajah announced with considerable pride at breakfast one morning that he had got up a tiger hunt in our special honour Lord Southminster rubbed his hands Ha that s right Maharaj he said briskly I do love big game To tell yah the truth old man that s just what I came heah for You do me too much honour the Hindoo answered with quiet sarcasm My town and palace may have little to offer that is worth your attention but I am glad that my big game at least has been lucky enough to attract you The remark was thrown away on the pea green young man He had described his host to me as a black boundah Out of his own mouth I condemned him he supplied the very word he was himself nothing more than a born bounder Illustration A TIGER HUNT IS NOT A THING TO BE GOT UP LIGHTLY During the next few days the preparations for the tiger hunt occupied all the Maharajah s energies You know Miss Cayley he said to me as we stood upon the big stairs looking down on the Hindoo city a tiger hunt is not a thing to be got up lightly Our people themselves don t like killing a tiger They reverence it too much They re afraid its spirit might haunt them afterwards and bring them bad luck That s one of our superstitions You do not share it yourself then I asked He drew himself up and opened his palms with a twinkling of pendant emeralds I am royal he answered with naive dignity and the tiger is a royal beast Kings know the ways of kings If a king kills what is kingly it owes him no grudge for it But if a common man or a low caste man were to kill a tiger who can say what might happen I saw he was not himself quite free from the superstition Our peasants he went on fixing me with his great black eyes won t even mention the tiger by name for fear of offending him they believe him to be the dwelling place of a powerful spirit If they wish to speak of him they say the great beast or my lord the striped one Some think the spirit is immortal except at the hands of a king But they have no objection to see him destroyed by others They will even point out his whereabouts and rejoice over his death for it relieves the village of a serious enemy and they believe the spirit will only haunt the huts of those who actually kill him Then you know where each tiger lives I asked As well as your gamekeepers in England know which covert may be drawn for foxes Yes tis a royal sport and we keep it for Maharajahs I myself never hunt a tiger till some European visitor of distinction comes to Moozuffernuggar that I may show him good sport This tiger we shall hunt to morrow for example he is a bad old hand He has carried off the buffaloes of my villagers over yonder for years and years and of late he has also become a man eater He once ate a whole family at a meal a man his wife and his three children The people at Janwargurh have been pestering me for weeks to come and shoot him and each week he has eaten somebody a child or a woman the last was yesterday but I waited till you came because I thought it would be something to show you that you would not be likely to see elsewhere And you let the poor people go on being eaten that we might enjoy this sport I cried He shrugged his shoulders and opened his palms They were villagers you know ryots mere tillers of the soil poor naked peasants I have thousands of them to spare If a tiger eats ten of them they only say It was written upon their foreheads One woman more or less who would notice her at Moozuffernuggar Then I perceived that the Maharajah was a gentleman but still a barbarian The eventful morning arrived at last and we started all agog for the jungle where the tiger was known to live Elsie excused herself She remarked to me the night before as I brushed her back hair for her that she had half a mind not to go My dear I answered giving the brush a good dash for a higher mathematician that phrase lacks accuracy If you were to say seven eighths of a mind it would be nearer the mark In point of fact if you ask my opinion your inclination to go is a vanishing quantity She admitted the impeachment with an accusing blush You re quite right Brownie to tell you the truth I m afraid of it So am I dear horribly afraid Between ourselves I m in a deadly funk of it But the brave man is not he that feels no fear and I believe the same principle applies almost equally to the brave woman I mean that fear to subdue as far as I am able The Maharajah says I shall be the first girl who has ever gone tiger hunting I m frightened out of my life I never held a gun in my born days before But Elsie recollect this is splendid journalism I intend to go through with it You offer yourself on the altar Brownie I do dear I propose to die in the cause I expect my proprietor to carve on my tomb Sacred to the memory of the martyr of journalism She was killed in the act of taking shorthand notes by a Bengal tiger We started at early dawn a motley mixture My short bicycling skirt did beautifully for tiger hunting There was a vast company of native swells nawabs and ranas in gorgeous costumes whose precise names and titles I do not pretend to remember there were also Major Balmossie Lord Southminster the Maharajah and myself all mounted on gaily caparisoned elephants We had likewise on foot a miserable crowd of wretched beaters with dirty white loin cloths We were all very brave of course demonstratively brave and we talked a great deal at the start about the exhilaration given by the spice of danger But it somehow struck me that the poor beaters on foot had the majority of the danger and extremely little of the exhilaration Each of us great folk was mounted on his own elephant which carried a light basket work howdah in two compartments the front one intended for the noble sportsman the back one for a servant with extra guns and ammunition I pretended to like it but I fear I trembled visibly Our mahouts sat on the elephants necks each armed with a pointed goad to whose admonition the huge beasts answered like clock work A born journalist always pretends to know everything before hand so I speak carelessly of the mahout as if he were a familiar acquaintance But I don t mind telling you aside in confidence that I had only just learnt the word that morning The Maharajah protested at first against my taking part in the actual hunt but I think his protest was merely formal In his heart of hearts I believe he was proud that the first lady tiger hunter should have joined his party Dusty and shadeless the road from Moozuffernuggar fares straight across the plain towards the crumbling mountains Behind in the heat mist the castle and palace on their steeply scarped crag with the squalid town that clustered at their feet reminded me once more most strangely of Edinburgh where I used to spend my vacations from Girton But the pitiless sun differed greatly from the gray haar of the northern metropolis It warmed into intense white the little temples of the wayside and beat on our heads with tropical garishness I am bound to admit also that tiger hunting is not quite all it is cracked up to be In my fancy I had pictured the gallant and bloodthirsty beast rushing out upon us full pelt from some grass grown nullah at the first sniff of our presence and fiercely attacking both men and elephants Instead of that I will confess the whole truth frightened as at least one of us was of the tiger the tiger was still more desperately frightened of his human assailants I could see clearly that so far from rushing out of his own accord to attack us his one desire was to be let alone He was horribly afraid he skulked in the jungle like a wary old fox in a trusty spinney There was no nullah whatever a nullah may be there was only a waste of dusty cane brake We encircled the tall grass patch where he lurked forming a big round with a ring fence of elephants The beaters on foot advancing half naked with a caution with which I could fully sympathise endeavoured by loud shouts and gesticulations to rouse the royal beast to a sense of his position Not a bit of it the royal beast declined to be drawn he preferred retirement The Maharajah whose elephant was stationed next to mine even apologised for the resolute cowardice with which he clung to his ignoble lurking place The beaters drew in the elephants raising their trunks in air and sniffing suspicion moved slowly inward We had girt him round now with a perfect ring through which he could not possibly break without attacking somebody The Maharajah kept a fixed eye on my personal safety But still the royal animal crouched and skulked and still the black beaters shrieked howled and gesticulated At last among the tall perpendicular lights and shadows of the big grasses and bamboos I seemed to see something move something striped like the stems yet passing slowly slowly slowly between them It moved in a stealthy undulating line No one could believe till he saw it how the bright flame coloured bands of vivid orange yellow on the monster s flanks and the interspersed black stripes could fade away and harmonise in their native surroundings with the lights and shades of the upright jungle It was a marvel of mimicry Look there I cried to the Maharajah pointing one eager hand What is that thing there moving He stared where I pointed By Jove he cried raising his rifle with a sportsman s quickness you have spotted him first The tiger The terrified beast stole slowly and cautiously through the tall grasses his lithe silken side gliding in and out snakewise and only his fierce eyes burning bright with gleaming flashes between the gloom of the jungle Once I had seen him I could follow with ease his sinuous path among the tangled bamboos a waving line of beauty in perpetual motion The Maharajah followed him too with his keen eyes and pointed his rifle hastily But quick as he was Lord Southminster was before him I had half expected to find the pea green young man turn coward at the last moment but in that I was mistaken I will do him the justice to say whatever else he was he was a born sportsman The gleam of joy in his leaden eye when he caught sight of the tiger the flush of excitement on his pasty face the eagerness of his alert attitude were things to see and remember That moment almost ennobled him In sight of danger the best instincts of the savage seemed to revive within him In civilised life he was a poor creature face to face with a wild beast he became a mighty shikari Perhaps that was why he was so fond of big game shooting He may have felt it raised him in the scale of being He lifted his rifle and fired He was a cool shot and he wounded the beast upon its left shoulder I could see the great crimson stream gush out all at once across the shapely sides staining the flame coloured stripes and reddening the black shadows The tiger drew back gave a low fierce growl and then crouched among the jungle I saw he was going to leap he bent his huge backbone into a strong downward curve took in a deep breath and stood at bay glaring at us Which elephant would he attack That was what he was now debating Next moment with a frightful R r r r he had straightened out his muscles and like a bolt from a bow had launched his huge bulk forward I never saw his charge I never knew he had leapt upon me I only felt my elephant rock from side to side like a ship in a storm He was trumpeting shaking roaring with rage and pain for the tiger was on his flanks its claws buried deep in the skin of his forehead I could not keep my seat I felt myself tossed about in the frail howdah like a pill in a pill box The elephant in a death grapple was trying to shake off his ghastly enemy For a minute or two I was conscious of nothing save this swinging movement Then opening my eyes for a second I saw the tiger in all his terrible beauty clinging to the elephant s head by the claws of his fore paws and struggling for a foothold on its trunk with his mighty hind legs in a wounded agony of despair and vengeance He would sell his life dear he would have one or other of us Lord Southminster raised his rifle again but the Maharajah shouted aloud in an angry voice Don t fire Don t fire You will kill the lady You can t aim at him like that The beast is rocking so that no one can say where a shot will take effect Down with your gun sir instantly Illustration IT WENT OFF UNEXPECTEDLY My mahout unable to keep his seat with the rocking now dropped off his cushion among the scrub below He could speak a few words of English Shoot Mem Sahib shoot he cried flinging his hands up But I was tossed to and fro from side to side with my rifle under my arm It was impossible to aim Yet in sheer terror I tried to draw the trigger I failed but somehow I caught my rifle against the side of my cage Something snapped in it somewhere It went off unexpectedly without my aiming or firing I shut my eyes When I opened them again I saw a swimming picture of the great sullen beast loosing his hold on the elephant I saw his brindled face I saw his white tusks But his gleaming pupils burned bright no longer His jaw was full towards me I had shot him between the eyes He fell slowly with blood streaming from his nostrils and his tongue lolling out His muscles relaxed his huge limbs grew limp In a minute he lay stretched at full length on the ground with his head on one side a grand terrible picture My mahout flung up his hands in wonder and amazement My father he cried aloud Truly the Mem Sahib is a great shikari The Maharajah stretched across to me That was a wonderful shot he exclaimed I could never have believed a woman could show such nerve and coolness Nerve and coolness indeed I was trembling all over like an Italian greyhound every limb a jelly and I had not even fired the rifle went off of itself without me I am innocent of having ever endangered the life of a haycock But once more I dissembled Yes it was a difficult shot I said jauntily as if I rather liked tiger hunting I didn t think I d hit him Still the effect of my speech was somewhat marred I fear by the tears that in spite of me rolled down my cheek silently Pon honah I nevah saw a finah piece of shooting in my life Lord Southminster drawled out Then he added aside in an undertone Makes a fellow moah determined to annex her than evah I sat in my howdah half dazed I hardly heard what they were saying My heart danced like the elephant Then it stood still within me I was only aware of a feeling of faintness Luckily for my reputation as a mighty sportswoman however I just managed to keep up and did not actually faint as I was more than half inclined to do Next followed the native paean The beaters crowded round the fallen beast in a chorus of congratulation Many of the villagers also ran out with prayers and ejaculations to swell our triumph It was all like a dream They hustled round me and salaamed to me A woman had shot him Wonderful A babel of voices resounded in my ears I was aware that pure accident had elevated me into a heroine Put the beast on a pad elephant the Maharajah called out The beaters tied ropes round his body and raised him with difficulty The Maharajah s face grew stern Where are the whiskers he asked fiercely in his own tongue which Major Balmossie interpreted for me The beaters and the villagers bowing low and expanding their hands made profuse expressions of ignorance and innocence But the fact was patent the grand face had been mangled While they had crowded in a dense group round the fallen carcass somebody had cut off the lips and whiskers and secreted them They have ruined the skin the Maharajah cried out in angry tones I intended it for the lady I shall have them all searched and the man who has done this thing Illustration I SAW HIM NOW THE ORIENTAL DESPOT He broke off and looked around him His silence was more terrible by far than the fiercest threat I saw him now the Oriental despot All the natives drew back awe struck The voice of a king is the voice of a great god my mahout murmured in a solemn whisper Then nobody else said anything Why do they want the whiskers I asked just to set things straight again They seem to have been in a precious hurry to take them The Maharajah s brow cleared He turned to me once more with his European manner A tiger s body has wonderful power after his death he answered His fangs and his claws are very potent charms His heart gives courage Whoever eats of it will never know fear His liver preserves against death and pestilence But the highest virtue of all exists in his whiskers They are mighty talismans Chopped up in food they act as a slow poison which no doctor can detect no antidote guard against They are also a sovereign remedy against magic or the evil eye And administered to women they make an irresistible philtre a puissant love potion They secure you the heart of whoever drinks them I d give a couple of monkeys for those whiskahs Lord Southminster murmured half unnoticed We began to move again We ll go on to where we know there is another tiger the Maharajah said lightly as if tigers were partridges Miss Cayley you will come with us I rested on my laurels I was quivering still from head to foot No thank you Maharajah as unconcernedly as I could I ve had quite enough sport for my first day s tiger hunting I think I ll go back now and write a newspaper account of this little adventure You have had luck he put in Not everyone kills a tiger his first day out This will make good reading I wouldn t have missed it for a hundred pounds I answered Then try another I wouldn t try another for a thousand I cried fervently That evening at the palace I was the heroine of the day They toasted me in a bumper of Heidsieck s dry monopole The men made speeches Everybody talked gushingly of my splendid courage and my steadiness of hand It was a brilliant shot under such difficult circumstances For myself I said nothing I pretended to look modest I dared not confess the truth that I never fired at all And from that day to this I have never confessed it till I write it down now in these confiding memoirs Illustration IT S I WHO AM THE WINNAH One episode cast a gloom over my ill deserved triumph In the course of the evening a telegram arrived for the pea green young man by a white turbaned messenger He read it and crumpled it up carelessly in his hand I looked inquiry Yaas he answered nodding You re quite right It s that Pooah old Marmy has gone aftah all Ezekiel and Habakkuk have carried off his sixteen stone at last And I don t mind telling yah now though it was a neah thing it s I who am the winnah X THE ADVENTURE OF THE CROSS EYED Q C The cold weather as it is humorously called was now drawing to a close and the young ladies in sailor hats and cambric blouses who flock to India each autumn for the annual marriage market were beginning to resign themselves to a return to England unless of course they had succeeded in catching So I realised that I must hurry on to Delhi and Agra if I was not to be intercepted by the intolerable summer When we started from Moozuffernuggar for Delhi and the East Lord Southminster was starting for Bombay and Europe This surprised me not a little for he had confided to my unsympathetic ear a few nights earlier in the Maharajah s billiard room that he was stony broke and must wait at Moozuffernuggar for lack of funds till the oof bird laid at his banker s in England His conversation enlarged my vocabulary at any rate So you ve managed to get away I exclaimed as he dawdled up to me at the hot and dusty station Yaas he drawled fixing his eye glass and lighting a cigarette I ve p f managed to get away Maharaj seems to have thought p f it would be cheepah in the end to pay me out than to keep me You don t mean to say he offered to lend you money I cried No not exactly that I offahed to borrow it From the man you call a nigger His smile spread broader over his face than ever Well we borrow from the Jews yah know he said pleasantly so why the jooce shouldn t we borrow from the heathen also Spoiling the Egyptians don t yah see the same as we used to read about in the Scripchah when we were innocent kiddies Like marriage quite You borrow in haste and repay at leisure He strolled off and took his seat I was glad to get rid of him at the main line junction In accordance with my usual merciful custom I spare you the details of our visit to Agra Muttra Benares At Calcutta Elsie left me Her health was now quite restored dear little soul I felt I had done that one good thing in life if no other and she could no longer withstand the higher mathematics which were beckoning her to London with invisible fingers For myself having so far accomplished my original design of going round the world with twopence in my pocket I could not bear to draw back at half the circuit and mister Elworthy having willingly consented to my return by Singapore and Yokohama I set out alone on my homeward journey Illustration HE WROTE I EXPECT YOU TO COME BACK TO ENGLAND AND MARRY ME Harold wrote me from London that all was going well He had found the will which I drew up at Florence in his uncle s escritoire and everything was left to him but he trusted in spite of this untoward circumstance long absence might have altered my determination Dear Lois he wrote I expect you to come back to England and marry me I was brief but categorical Nothing meanwhile had altered my resolve I did not wish to be considered mercenary While he was rich and honoured I could never take him If some day fortune frowned but there let us not forestall the feet of calamity let us await contingencies Still I was heavy in heart If only it had been otherwise To say the truth I should be thrown away on a millionaire but just think what a splendid managing wife a girl like me would have made for a penniless pauper At Yokohama however while I dawdled in curiosity shops a telegram from Harold startled me into seriousness My chance at last I knew what it meant that villain Higginson Come home at once I want your evidence to clear my character Southminster opposes the will as a forgery He has a strong case the experts are with him Forgery That was clever I never thought of that I suspected them of trying to forge a will of their own but to upset the real one to throw the burden of suspicion on Harold s shoulders how much subtler and craftier I saw at a glance it gave them every advantage In the first place it put Harold virtually in the place of the accused and compelled him to defend instead of attacking an attitude which prejudices people against one from the outset Then again it implied positive criminality on his part and so allowed Lord Southminster to assume the air of injured innocence The eldest son of the eldest brother unjustly set aside by the scheming machinations of an unscrupulous cousin Primogeniture the ingrained English love for keeping up the dignity of a noble family the prejudice in favour of the direct male line as against the female all were astutely utilised in Lord Southminster s interest But worst of all it was I who had typewritten the will I a friend of Harold s a woman whom Lord Southminster would doubtless try to exhibit as his fiancee I saw at once how much like conspiracy it looked Harold and I had agreed together to concoct a false document and Harold had forged his uncle s signature to it Could a British jury doubt when a Lord declared it Fortunately I was just in time to catch the Canadian steamer from Japan to Vancouver But oh the endless breadth of that broad Pacific How time seemed to lag as each day one rose in the morning in the midst of space blue sky overhead behind one the hard horizon in front of one the hard horizon and nothing else visible then steamed on all day to arrive at night where why in the midst of space starry sky overhead behind one the dim horizon in front of one the dim horizon and nothing else visible The Nile was child s play to it Illustration IT WAS ENDLESSLY WEARISOME Day after day we steamed and night after night were still where we began in the centre of the sea no farther from our starting point no nearer to our goal yet for ever steaming It was endlessly wearisome who could say what might be happening meanwhile in England At last after months as it seemed of this slow torture we reached Vancouver There in the raw new town a telegram awaited me Glad to hear you are coming Make all haste You may be just in time to arrive for the trial Just in time I would not waste a moment I caught the first train on the Canadian Pacific and travelled straight through day and night to Montreal and Quebec without one hour s interval I cannot describe to you that journey across a continent I had never before seen It was endless and hopeless I only know that we crawled up the Rocky Mountains and the Selkirk Range over spider like viaducts with interminable effort and that the prairies were just the broad Pacific over again They rolled on for ever But we did reach Quebec in time we reached it and we caught by an hour the first liner to Liverpool At Prince s Landing stage another telegram awaited me Come on at once Case now proceeding Harold is in court We need your evidence GEORGINA FAWLEY I might still be in time to vindicate Harold s character At Euston to my surprise I was met not only by my dear cantankerous old lady but also by my friend the magnificent Maharajah dressed this time in a frock coat and silk hat of Bond Street glossiness What has brought you to England I asked astonished The Jubilee He smiled and showed his two fine rows of white teeth That nominally In reality the cricket season I play for Berks But most of all to see dear Tillington safe through this trouble He s a brick Lady Georgina cried with enthusiasm A regular brick my dear Lois His carriage is waiting outside to take you up to my house He has stood by Harold well like a Christian Or a Hindu the Maharajah corrected smiling And how have you been all this time dear Lady Georgina I asked hardly daring to inquire about what was nearest to my soul Harold The cantankerous old lady knitted her brows in a familiar fashion Oh my dear don t ask I haven t known a happy hour since you left me in Switzerland Lois I shall never be happy again without you It would pay me to give you a retaining fee of a thousand a year honour bright it would I assure you What I ve suffered from the Gretchens since you ve been in the East has only been equalled by what I ve suffered from the Mary Annes and the Celestines Not a hair left on my scalp not one hair I declare to you They ve made my head into a tabula rasa for the various restorers George R Sims and missus S A Allen are going to fight it out between them My dear I wish you could take my maid s place I ve always said I finished the speech for her A lady can do better whatever she turns her hand to than any of these hussies She nodded And why Because her hands are hands while as for the Gretchens and the Mary Annes paws is the only word one can honestly apply to them Then on top of it all comes this trouble about Harold So distressing isn t it You see at the point which the matter has reached it s simply impossible to save Harold s reputation without wrecking Southminster s Pretty position that for a respectable family The Ashursts hitherto have been quite respectable a company respondent or two perhaps but never anything serious Now either Southminster sends Harold to prison or Harold sends Southminster There s a nice sort of dilemma I always knew Kynaston s boys were born fools but to find they re born knaves too is hard on an old woman in her hairless dotage However you ve come my child and you ll soon set things right You re the one person on earth I can trust in this matter Harold go to prison My head reeled at the thought I staggered out into the open air and took my seat mechanically in the Maharajah s carriage All London swam before me After so many months absence the polychromatic decorations of our English streets looming up through the smoke seemed both strange and familiar I drove through the first half mile with a vague consciousness that Lipton s tea is the perfection of cocoa and matchless for the complexion but that it dyes all colours and won t wash clothes After a while however I woke up to the full terror of the situation Where are you taking me I inquired To my house dear Lady Georgina answered looking anxiously at me for my face was bloodless No that won t do I answered My cue must be now to keep myself as aloof as possible from Harold and Harold s backers I must put up at an hotel It will sound so much better in cross examination She s quite right the Maharajah broke in with sudden conviction One must block every ball with these nasty swift bowlers Where s Harold I asked after another pause Why didn t he come to meet me My dear how could he He s under examination A cross eyed Q C with an odious leer Southminster s chosen the biggest bully at the Bar to support his contention Drive to some hotel in the Jermyn Street district I cried to the Maharajah s coachman That will be handy for the law courts He touched his hat and turned In a sort of dickey behind sat two gorgeous turbaned Rajput servants That evening Harold came round to visit me at my rooms I could see he was much agitated Things had gone very badly Lady Georgina was there she had stopped to dine with me dear old thing lest I should feel lonely and give way so had Elsie Petheridge mister Elworthy sent a telegram of welcome from Devonshire I knew at least that my friends were rallying round me in this hour of trial The kind Maharajah himself would have come too if I had allowed him but I thought it inexpedient They explained everything to me Harold had propounded mister Ashurst s will the one I drew up at Florence and had asked for probate Lord Southminster intervened and opposed the grant of probate on the ground that the signatures were forgeries He propounded instead another will drawn some twenty years earlier when they were both children duly executed at the time and undoubtedly genuine in it testator left everything without reserve to the eldest son of his eldest brother Lord Kynaston Marmy didn t know in those days that Kynaston s sons would all grow up fools Lady Georgina said tartly Besides which that was before the poor dear soul took to plunging on the Stock Exchange and made his money He had nothing to leave then but his best silk hat and a few paltry hundreds Afterwards when he d feathered his nest in soap and cocoa he discovered that Bertie that s Lord Southminster was a first class idiot Marmy never liked Southminster nor Southminster Marmy For after all with all his faults Marmy was a gentleman while Bertie well my dear we needn t put a name to it So he altered his will as you know when he saw the sort of man Southminster turned out and left practically everything he possessed to Harold Who are the witnesses to the will I asked There s the trouble Who do you think Why Higginson s sister who was Marmy s masseuse and a waiter Franz Markheim at the hotel at Florence who s dead they say or at least not forthcoming And Higginson s sister forswears her signature Harold added gloomily while the experts are most of them dead against the genuineness of my uncle s That s clever I said leaning back and taking it in slowly Higginson s sister How well they ve worked it They couldn t prevent mister Ashurst from making this will but they managed to supply their own tainted witnesses If it had been Higginson himself now he d have had to be cross examined and in cross examination of course we could have shaken his credit by bringing up the episodes of the Count de Laroche sur Loiret and doctor Fortescue Langley But his sister What s she like Have you anything against her My dear Lady Georgina cried there the rogue has bested us Isn t it just like him What do you suppose he has done Why provided himself with a sister of tried respectability and blameless character And she denies that it is her handwriting I asked Declares on her Bible oath she never signed the document I was fairly puzzled It was a stupendously clever dodge Higginson must have trained up his sister for forty years in the ways of wickedness yet held her in reserve for this supreme moment And where is Higginson I asked Lady Georgina broke into a hysterical laugh Where is he my dear That s the question With consummate strategy the wretch has disappeared into space at the last moment That s artful again I said His presence could only damage their case I can see of course Lord Southminster has no need of him Southminster s the wiliest fool that ever lived Harold broke out bitterly Under that mask of imbecility he s a fox for trickiness I bit my lip Well if you succeed in evading him I said you will have cleared your character And if you don t then Harold our time will have come you will have your longed for chance of trying me That won t do me much good he answered if I have to wait fourteen years for you at Portland Illustration THE CROSS EYED Q C BEGGED HIM TO BE VERY CAREFUL Next morning in court I heard Harold s cross examination He described exactly where he had found the contested will in his uncle s escritoire The cross eyed Q C a heavy man with bloated features and a bulbous nose begged him with one fat uplifted forefinger to be very careful How did he know where to look for it Because I knew the house well I knew where my uncle was likely to keep his valuables Oh indeed not because you had put it there The court rang with laughter My face grew crimson After an hour or two of fencing Harold was dismissed He stood down baffled Counsel recalled Lord Southminster The pea green young man stepping briskly up gazed about him open mouthed with a vacant stare The look of cunning on his face was carefully suppressed He wore on the contrary an air of injured innocence combined with an eye glass You did not put this will in the drawer where mister Tillington found it did you counsel asked The pea green young man laughed No I certainly didn t put it theah My cousin Harold was man in possession He took jolly good care I didn t come neah the premises Do you think you could forge a will if you tried Lord Southminster laughed No I don t he answered with a well assumed naivete That s just the difference between us don t yah know I m what they call a fool and my cousin Harold s a precious clevah fellah There was another loud laugh That s not evidence the judge observed severely It was not But it told far more than much that was It told strongly against Harold Besides Lord Southminster continued with engaging frankness if I forged a will at all I d take jolly good care to forge it in my own favah My turn came next Our counsel handed me the incriminated will Did you draw up this document he asked I looked at it closely The paper bore our Florentine water mark and was written with a Spread Eagle I type wrote it I answered gazing at it with care to make sure I recognised it Our counsel s business was to uphold the will not to cast aspersions upon it He was evidently annoyed at my close examination You have no doubts about it he said trying to prompt me I hesitated No no doubts I answered turning over the sheet and inspecting it still closer I type wrote it at Florence Do you recognise that signature as mister Marmaduke Ashurst s he went on I stared at it Was it his It was like it certainly Yet that k and those s s I almost wondered Counsel was obviously annoyed at my hesitation He thought I was playing into the enemy s hands Is it his or is it not he inquired again testily It is his I answered Yet I own I was troubled Illustration I WAS A GROTESQUE FAILURE He asked many questions about the circumstances of the interview when I took down the will I answered them all But I vaguely felt he and I were at cross purposes I grew almost as uncomfortable under his gaze as if he had been examining me in the interest of the other side He managed to fluster me As a witness for Harold I was a grotesque failure Then the cross eyed Q C rising and shaking his huge bulk began to cross examine me Where did you type write this thing do you say he said pointing to it contemptuously In my office at Florence Yes I understand you had an office in Florence after you gave up retailing bicycles on the public roads and you had a partner I think a Miss Petherick or Petherton or Pennyfarthing or something Miss Petheridge I corrected while the Court tittered Ah Petheridge you call it Well now answer this question carefully Did your Miss Petheridge hear mister Ashurst dictate the terms of his last will and testament No I answered The interview was of a strictly confidential character mister Ashurst took me aside into the back room at our office Oh he took you aside Confidential Well now we re getting at it And did anybody but yourself see or hear any part whatsoever of this precious document Certainly not I replied It was a private matter Private oh very Nobody else saw it Did mister Ashurst take it away from the office in person No he sent his courier for it His courier The man Higginson Yes but I refused to give it to Higginson I took it myself that night to the hotel where mister Ashurst was stopping Ah You took it yourself So the only other person who knows anything at first hand about the existence of the alleged will is this person Higginson Miss Petheridge knows I said flushing At the time I told her of it Oh you told her Well that doesn t help us much If what you are swearing isn t true remember you are on your oath what you told Miss Petherick or Petheridge or Pennyfarthing at the time can hardly be regarded as corroborative evidence Your word then and your word now are just equally valuable or equally worthless The only person who knows besides yourself is Higginson Now I ask you where is Higginson Are you going to produce him The wicked cunning of it struck me dumb They were keeping him away and then using his absence to cast doubts on my veracity Stop I cried taken aback Higginson is well known to be a rogue and he is keeping away lest he may damage your side I know nothing of Higginson Yes I m coming to that in good time Don t be afraid that we re going to pass over Higginson You admit this man is a man of bad character Now what do you know of him I told the stories of the Count and of doctor Fortescue Langley The cross eyed cross examiner leant across towards me and leered And this is the man he exclaimed with a triumphant air whose sister you pretended you had got to sign this precious document of yours Whom mister Ashurst got to sign it I answered red hot It is not my document And you have heard that she swears it is not her signature at all So they tell me She is Higginson s sister For all I know she may be prepared to swear or to forswear anything Don t cast doubt upon our witnesses without cause Miss Higginson is an eminently respectable woman You gave this document to mister Ashurst you say There your knowledge of it ends A signature is placed on it which is not his as our experts testify It purports to be witnessed by a Swiss waiter who is not forthcoming and who is asserted to be dead as well as by a nurse who denies her signature And the only other person who knows of its existence before mister Tillington discovers it in his uncle s desk is the missing man Higginson Is that or is it not the truth of the matter I suppose so I said baffled Well now as to this man Higginson He first appears upon the scene so far as you are concerned on the day when you travelled from London to Schlangenbad That is so I answered And he nearly succeeded then in stealing Lady Georgina Fawley s jewel case He nearly took it but I saved it And I explained the circumstance The cross eyed Q C held his fat sides with his hands looking incredulously at me and smiled His vast width of waistcoat shook with silent merriment You are a very clever young lady he murmured You can explain away anything But don t you think it just as likely that it was a plot between you two and that owing to some mistake the plot came off unsuccessful I do not I cried crimson I never saw the Count before that morning He tried another tack Still wherever you went this man Higginson the only other person you admit who knows about the previous existence of the will turned up simultaneously He was always turning up at the same place as you did He turned up at Lucerne as a faith healer didn t he If you will allow me to explain I cried biting my lip He bowed all blandness Oh certainly he murmured Explain away everything I explained but of course he had discounted and damaged my explanation He made no comment And then he went on with his hands on his hips and his obtrusive rotundity he turned up at Florence as courier to mister Ashurst at the very date when this so called will was being concocted He was at Florence when mister Ashurst dictated it to me I answered growing desperate You admit he was in Florence Good Once more he turned up in India with my client Lord Southminster upon whose youth and inexperience he had managed to impose himself And he carried him off did he not by one of these strange coincidences to which you are peculiarly liable on the very same steamer on which you happened to be travelling Lord Southminster told me he took Higginson with him because a rogue suited his book I answered warmly Will you swear his lordship didn t say the rogue suited his book which is quite another thing the Q C asked blandly I will swear he did not I replied I have correctly reported him Then I congratulate you young lady on your excellent memory My lud will you allow me later to recall Lord Southminster to testify on this point The judge nodded Now once more as to your relations with the various members of the Ashurst family You introduced yourself to Lady Georgina Fawley I believe quite casually on a seat in Kensington Gardens That is true I answered You had never seen her before Never And you promptly offered to go with her as her lady s maid to Schlangenbad in Germany In place of her lady s maid for one week I answered Ah a delicate distinction In place of her lady s maid You are a lady I believe an officer s daughter you told us educated at Girton So I have said already I replied crimson And you stick to it By all means Tell the truth and stick to it It s always safest Now don t you think it was rather an odd thing for an officer s daughter to do to run about Germany as maid to a lady of title Illustration THE JURY SMILED I tried to explain once more but the jury smiled You can t justify originality to a British jury Why they would send you to prison at once for that alone if they made the laws as well as dispensing them He passed on after a while to another topic I think you have boasted more than once in society that when you first met Lady Georgina Fawley you had twopence in your pocket to go round the world with I had I answered and I went round the world with it Exactly I m getting there in time With it and other things A few months later more or less you were touring up the Nile in your steam dahabeeah and in the lap of luxury you were taking saloon carriages on Indian railways weren t you I explained again The dahabeeah was in the service of the Daily Telephone I answered I became a journalist He cross questioned me about that Then I am to understand he said at last leaning forward with all his waistcoat that you sprang yourself upon mister Elworthy at sight pretty much as you sprang yourself upon Lady Georgina Fawley We arranged matters quickly I admitted The dexterous wretch was making my strongest points all tell against me H m Well he was a man and you will admit I suppose fingering his smooth fat chin that you are a lady of what is the stock phrase the reporters use considerable personal attractions My Lord I said turning to the Bench I appeal to you Has he the right to compel me to answer that question Illustration THE QUESTION REQUIRES NO ANSWER HE SAID The judge bowed slightly The question requires no answer he said with a quiet emphasis I burned bright scarlet Well my lud I defer to your ruling the cross eyed cross examiner continued radiant I go on to another point When in India I believe you stopped for some time as a guest in the house of a native Maharajah Is that matter relevant the judge asked sharply My lud the Q C said in his blandest voice I am striving to suggest to the jury that this lady the only person who ever beheld this so called will till mister Harold Tillington described in its terms as Younger of Gledcliffe whatever that may be produced it out of his uncle s desk I am striving to suggest that this lady is my duty to my client compels me to say an adventuress He had uttered the word I felt my character had not a leg left to stand upon before a British jury I went there with my friend Miss Petheridge I began Oh Miss Petheridge once more you hunt in couples Accompanied and chaperoned by a married lady the wife of a Major Balmossie on the Bombay Staff Corps That was certainly prudent One ought to be chaperoned Can you produce the lady How is it possible I cried missus Balmossie is in India Yes but the Maharajah I understand is in London That is true I answered And he came to meet you on your arrival yesterday With Lady Georgina Fawley I cried taken off my guard Do you not consider it curious he asked that these Higginsons and these Maharajahs should happen to follow you so closely round the world should happen to turn up wherever you do He came to be present at this trial I exclaimed And so did you I believe he met you at Euston last night and drove you to your hotel in his private carriage With Lady Georgina Fawley I answered once more And Lady Georgina is on mister Tillington s side I fancy Ah yes I thought so And mister Tillington also called to see you and likewise Miss Petherick I beg your pardon Petheridge We must be strictly accurate where Miss Petheridge is concerned And in fact you had quite a little family party My friends were glad to see me back again I murmured He sprang a fresh innuendo But mister Tillington did not resent your visit to this gallant Maharajah Certainly not I cried bridling Why should he Oh we re getting to that too Now answer me this carefully We want to find out what interest you might have supposing a will were forged on either side in arranging its terms We want to find out just who would benefit by it Please reply to this question yes or no without prevarication Are you or are you not conditionally engaged to mister Harold Tillington If I might explain I began quivering He sneered You have a genius for explaining we are aware Answer me first yes or no we will qualify afterward I glanced appealingly at the judge He was adamant Answer as counsel directs you witness he said sternly Yes I am I faltered But Excuse me one moment You promised to marry him conditionally upon the result of mister Ashurst s testamentary dispositions I did I answered but My explanation was drowned in roars of laughter in which the judge joined in spite of himself When the mirth in court had subsided a little I went on I told mister Tillington I would only marry him in case he was poor and without expectations If he inherited mister Marmaduke Ashurst s money I could never be his wife I said it proudly The cross eyed Q C drew himself up and let his rotundity take care of itself Do you take me he inquired for one of Her Majesty s horse marines There was another roar of laughter feebly suppressed by a judicial frown and I slank away annihilated You can go my persecutor said I think we have got well everything we wanted from you You promised to marry him if all went ill That is a delicate feminine way of putting it Women like these equivocations They relieve one from the onus of speaking frankly I stood down from the box feeling for the first time in my life conscious of having scored an ignominious failure Our counsel did not care to re examine me I recognised that it would be useless The hateful Q C had put all my history in such an odious light that explanation could only make matters worse it must savour of apology The jury could never understand my point of view It could never be made to see that there are adventuresses and adventuresses Then came the final speeches on either side Harold s advocate said the best he could in favour of the will our party propounded but his best was bad and what galled me most was this I could see he himself did not believe in its genuineness His speech amounted to little more than a perfunctory attempt to put the most favourable face on a probable forgery As for the cross eyed Q C he rose to reply with humorous confidence Swaying his big body to and fro he crumpled our will and our case in his fat fingers like so much flimsy tissue paper mister Ashurst had made a disposition of his property twenty years ago the right disposition the natural disposition he had left the bulk of it as childless English gentlemen have ever been wont to leave their wealth to the eldest son of the eldest son of his family The Honourable Marmaduke Courtney Ashurst the testator was the scion of a great house which recent agricultural changes he regretted to say had relatively impoverished he had come to the succour of that great house as such a scion should with his property acquired by honest industry elsewhere It was fitting and reasonable that mister Ashurst should wish to see the Kynaston peerage regain in the person of the amiable and accomplished young nobleman whom he had the honour to represent some portion of its ancient dignity and splendour But jealousy and greed intervened Here he frowned at Harold mister Harold Tillington the son of one of mister Ashurst s married sisters cast longing eyes as he had tried to suggest to them on his cousin Lord Southminster s natural heritage The result he feared was an unnatural intrigue mister Harold Tillington formed the acquaintance of a young lady should we say young lady he withered me with his glance well yes a lady indeed by birth and education but an adventuress by choice a lady who brought up in a respectable though not he must admit a distinguished sphere had lowered herself by accepting the position of a lady s maid and had trafficked in patent American cycles on the public high roads of Germany and Switzerland This clever and designing woman he would grant her ability he would grant her good looks had fascinated mister Tillington that was the theory he ventured to lay before the jury to day and the jury would see for themselves that whatever else the young lady might be she had distinctly a certain outer gift of fascination It was for them to decide whether Miss Lois Cayley had or had not suggested to mister Harold Tillington the design of substituting a forged will for mister Marmaduke Ashurst s undeniable testament He would point out to them her singular connection with the missing man Higginson whom the young lady herself described as a rogue and from whom she had done her very best to dissociate herself in this court but ineffectually Wherever Miss Cayley went the man Higginson went independently Such frequent recurrences such apt juxtapositions could hardly be set down to mere accidental coincidence He went on to insinuate that Higginson and I had concocted the disputed will between us that we had passed it on to our fellow conspirator Harold and that Harold had forged his uncle s signature to it and had appended those of the two supposed witnesses But who now were these witnesses One Franz Markheim was dead or missing dead men tell no tales the other was obviously suggested by Higginson It was his own sister Perhaps he forged her name to the document Doubtless he thought that family feeling would induce her when it came to the pinch to accept and endorse her brother s lie nay he might even have been foolish enough to suppose that this cock and bull will would not be disputed If so he and his master had reckoned without Lord Southminster a gentleman who concealed beneath the careless exterior of a man of fashion the solid intelligence of a man of affairs and the hard head of a man not to be lightly cheated in matters of business The alleged will had thus not a leg to stand upon It was typewritten save the mark from dictation at Florence by whom By the lady who had most to gain from its success the lady who was to be transformed from a shady adventuress tossed about between Irish doctors and Hindu Maharajahs into the lawful wife of a wealthy diplomatist of noble family on one condition only if this pretended will could be satisfactorily established The signatures were forgeries as shown by the expert evidence and also by the oath of the one surviving witness The will left all the estate practically to mister Harold Tillington and five hundred pounds to whom why to the accomplice Higginson The minor bequests the Q C regarded as ingenious inventions pure play of fancy intended to give artistic verisimilitude as Pooh Bah says in the opera to an otherwise bald and unconvincing narrative The fads it was true were known fads of mister Ashurst s but what sort of fads Bimetallism Anglo Israel No braces and shoe horns clearly the kind that would best be known to a courier like Higginson the sole begetter he believed of this nefarious conspiracy The cross eyed Q C lifting his fat right hand in solemn adjuration called upon the jury confidently to set aside this ridiculous fabrication and declare for a will of undoubted genuineness a will drawn up in London by a firm of eminent solicitors and preserved ever since by the testator s bankers It would then be for his lordship to decide whether in the public interest he should recommend the Crown to prosecute on a charge of forgery the clumsy fabricator of this preposterous document The judge summed up strongly in favour of Lord Southminster s will If the jury believed the experts and Miss Higginson one verdict alone was possible The jury retired for three minutes only It was a foregone conclusion They found for Lord Southminster The judge looking grave concurred in their finding A most proper verdict And he considered it would be the duty of the Public Prosecutor to pursue mister Harold Tillington on the charge of forgery Illustration I REELED WHERE I SAT I reeled where I sat Then I looked round for Harold He had slipped from the court unseen during counsel s address some minutes earlier That distressed me more than anything else on that dreadful day I wished he had stood up in his place like a man to face this vile and cruel conspiracy I walked out slowly supported by Lady Georgina who was as white as a ghost herself but very straight and scornful I always knew Southminster was a fool she said aloud I always knew he was a sneak but I did not know till now he was also a particularly bad type of criminal On the steps of the court the pea green young man met us His air was jaunty Well I was right yah see he said smiling and withdrawing his cigarette You backed the wrong fellah I told you I d win I won t say moah now this is not the time or place to recur to that subject but by and by you ll come round you ll think bettah of it still you ll back the winnah I wished I were a man that I might have the pleasure of kicking him We drove back to my hotel and waited for Harold To my horror and alarm he never came near us I might almost have doubted him if he had not been Harold I waited and waited He did not come at all He sent no word no message And all that evening we heard the newsboys shouting at the top of their voice in the street Extra Speshul the Ashurst Will Kise Sensational Developments Mysterious Disappearance of mister Arold Tillington XI THE ADVENTURE OF THE ORIENTAL ATTENDANT I did not sleep that night Next morning I rose very early from a restless bed with a dry hot mouth and a general feeling that the solid earth had failed beneath me Still no news from Harold It was cruel I thought My faith almost flagged He was a man and should be brave How could he run away and hide himself at such a time Even if I set my own anxiety aside just think to what serious misapprehension it laid him open I sent out for the morning papers They were full of Harold Rumours rumours rumours mister Tillington had deliberately chosen to put himself in the wrong by disappearing mysteriously at the last moment He had only himself to blame if the worst interpretation were put upon his action But the police were on his track Scotland Yard had a clue it was confidently expected an arrest would be made before evening at latest As to details authorities differed The officials of the Great Western Railway at Paddington were convinced that mister Tillington had started alone and undisguised by the night express for Exeter The South Eastern inspectors at Charing Cross on the other hand were equally certain that he had slipped away with a false beard in company with his accomplice Higginson by the eight point fifteen P M to Paris Everybody took it for granted however that he had left London Conjecture played with various ultimate destinations Spain Morocco Sicily the Argentine In Italy said the Chronicle he might lurk for a while he spoke Italian fluently and could manage to put up at tiny osterie in out of the way places seldom visited by Englishmen He might try Albania said the Morning Post airing its exclusive society information he had often hunted there and might in turn be hunted He would probably attempt to slink away to some remote spot in the Carpathians or the Balkans said the Daily News quite proud of its geography Still wherever he went leaden footed justice in this age said the Times must surely overtake him The day of universal extradition had dawned we had no more Alsatias even the Argentine itself gives up its rogues at last not an asylum for crime remains in Europe not a refuge in Asia Africa America Australia or the Pacific Islands I noted with a shudder of horror that all the papers alike took his guilt as certain In spite of a few decent pretences at not prejudging an untried cause they treated him already as the detected criminal the fugitive from justice I sat in my little sitting room at the hotel in Jermyn Street a limp rag looking idly out of the window with swimming eyes and waiting for Lady Georgina It was early too early but oh why didn t she come Unless somebody soon sympathised with me my heart would break under this load of loneliness Presently as I looked out on the sloppy morning street I was vaguely aware through the mist that floated before my dry eyes for tears were denied me of a very grand carriage driving up to the doorway the porch with the four wooden Ionic pillars I took no heed of it I was too heart sick for observation My life was wrecked and Harold s with it Yet dimly through the mist I became conscious after a while that the carriage was that of an Indian prince I could see the black faces the white turbans the gold brocades of the attendants in the dickey Then it came home to me with a pang that this was the Maharajah It was kindly meant yet after all that had been insinuated in court the day before I was by no means over pleased that his dusky Highness should come to call upon me Walls have eyes and ears Reporters were hanging about all over London eager to distinguish themselves by successful eavesdropping They would note with brisk innuendoes after their kind how the Maharajah of Moozuffernuggar called early in the day on Miss Lois Cayley with whom he remained for at least half an hour in close consultation I had half a mind to send down a message that I could not see him My face still burned with the undeserved shame of the cross eyed Q C s unspeakable suggestions Before I could make my mind up however I saw to my surprise that the Maharajah did not propose to come in himself He leaned back in his place with his lordly Eastern air and waited looking down on the gapers in the street while one of the two gorgeous attendants in the dickey descended obsequiously to receive his orders The man was dressed as usual in rich Oriental stuffs and wore his full white turban swathed in folds round his head I could not see his features He bent forward respectfully with Oriental suppleness to take his Highness s orders Then receiving a card and bowing low he entered the porch with the wooden Ionic pillars and disappeared within while the Maharajah folded his hands and seemed to resign himself to a temporary Nirvana Illustration THE MESSENGER ENTERED A minute later a knock sounded on my door Come in I said faintly and the messenger entered I turned and faced him The blood rushed to my cheek Harold I cried darting forward My joy overcame me He folded me in his arms I allowed him unreproved For the first time he kissed me I did not shrink from it Then I stood away a little and gazed at him Even at that crucial moment of doubt and fear I could not help noticing how admirably he made up as a handsome young Rajput Three years earlier at Schlangenbad I remembered he had struck me as strangely Oriental looking he had the features of a high born Indian gentleman without the complexion His large poetical eyes his regular oval face his even teeth his mouth and moustache all vaguely recalled the highest type of the Eastern temperament Now he had blackened his face and hands with some permanent stain Indian ink I learned later and the resemblance to a Rajput chief was positively startling In his gold brocade and ample white turban no passer by I felt sure would ever have dreamt of doubting him Then you knew me at once he said holding my face between his hands That s bad darling I flattered myself I had transformed my face into the complete Indian Love has sharp eyes I answered It can see through brick walls But the disguise is perfect No one else would detect you Love is blind I thought Not where it ought to see There it pierces everything I knew you instantly Harold But all London I am sure would pass you by unknown You are absolute Orient That s well for all London is looking for me he answered bitterly The streets bristle with detectives Southminster s knaveries have won the day So I have tried this disguise Otherwise I should have been arrested the moment the jury brought in their verdict And why were you not I asked drawing back Oh Harold I trust you but why did you disappear and make all the world believe you admitted yourself guilty He opened his arms Can t you guess he cried holding them out to me I nestled in them once more but I answered through my tears I had found tears now No Harold it baffles me You remember what you promised me he murmured leaning over me and clasping me If ever I were poor friendless hunted you would marry me Now the opportunity has come when we can both prove ourselves To day except you and dear Georgey I haven t a friend in the world Everyone else has turned against me Southminster holds the field I am a suspected forger in a very few days I shall doubtless be a convicted felon Unjustly as you know yet still we must face it a convicted felon So I have come to claim you I have come to ask you now in this moment of despair will you keep your promise I lifted my face to his He bent over it trembling I whispered the words in his ear Yes Harold I will keep it I have always loved you And now I will marry you I knew you would he cried and pressed me to his bosom We sat for some minutes holding each other s hands and saying nothing we were too full of thought for words Then suddenly Harold roused himself We must make haste darling he cried We are keeping Partab outside and every minute is precious every minute s delay dangerous We ought to go down at once Partab s carriage is waiting at the door for us Go down I exclaimed clinging to him How Why I don t understand What is your programme Ah I forgot I hadn t explained to you Listen here dearest quick I can waste no words over it I said just now I had no friends in the world but you and Georgey That s not true for dear old Partab has stuck to me nobly When all my English friends fell away the Rajput was true to me He arranged all this it was his own idea he foresaw what was coming He urged me yesterday just before the verdict when he saw my acquaintances beginning to look askance to slip quietly out of court and make my way by unobtrusive roads to his house in Curzon Street There he darkened my face like his and converted me to Hinduism I don t suppose the disguise will serve me for more than a day or two but it will last long enough for us to get safely away to Scotland Scotland I murmured Then you mean to try a Scotch marriage It is the only thing possible We must be married to day and in England of course we cannot do it We would have to be called in church or else to procure a license either of which would involve disclosure of my identity Besides even the license would keep us waiting about for a day or two In Scotland on the other hand we can be married at once Partab s carriage is below to take you to King s Cross He is staunch as steel dear fellow Do you consent to go with me My faculty for promptly making up such mind as I possess stood me once more in good stead Implicitly I answered Dear Harold this calamity has its happy side for without it much as I love you I could never have brought myself to marry you One moment he cried Before you go recollect this step is irrevocable You will marry a man who may be torn from you this evening and from whom fourteen years of prison may separate you I know it I cried through my tears But I shall be showing my confidence in you my love for you He kissed me once more fervently This makes amends for all he cried Lois to have won such a woman as you I would go through it all a thousand times over It was for this and for this alone that I hid myself last night I wanted to give you the chance of showing me how much how truly you loved me And after we are married I asked trembling I shall give myself up at once to the police in Edinburgh I clung to him wistfully My heart half urged me to urge him to escape But I knew that was wrong Give yourself up then I said sobbing It is a brave man s place You must stand your trial and come what will I will strive to bear it with you I knew you would he cried I was not mistaken in you We embraced again just once It was little enough after those years of waiting Now come he cried Let us go I drew back Not with you dearest I whispered Not in the Maharajah s carriage You must start by yourself I will follow you at once to King s Cross in a hansom He saw I was right It would avoid suspicion and it would prevent more scandal He withdrew without a word We meet I said at ten at King s Cross Station I did not even wait to wash the tears from my eyes All red as they were I put on my hat and my little brown travelling jacket I don t think I so much as glanced once at the glass The seconds were precious I saw the Maharajah drive away with Harold in the dickey arms crossed imperturbable Orientally silent He looked the very counterpart of the Rajput by his side Then I descended the stairs and walked out boldly As I passed through the hall the servants and the visitors stared at me and whispered They spoke with nods and liftings of the eyebrows I was aware that that morning I had achieved notoriety At Piccadilly Circus I jumped of a sudden into a passing hansom King s Cross I cried as I mounted the step Drive quick I have no time to spare And as the man drove off I saw by a convulsive dart of someone across the road that I had given the slip to a disappointed reporter At the station I took a first class ticket for Edinburgh On the platform the Maharajah and his attendants were waiting He lifted his hat to me though otherwise he took no overt notice But I saw his keen eyes follow me down the train Harold in his Oriental dress pretended not to observe me One or two porters and a few curious travellers cast inquiring eyes on the Eastern prince and made remarks about him to one another That s the chap as was up yesterday in the Ashurst will kise said one lounger to his neighbour But nobody seemed to look at Harold his subordinate position secured him from curiosity The Maharajah had always two Eastern servants gorgeously dressed in attendance he had been a well known figure in London society and at Lord s and the Oval for two or three seasons Bloomin fine cricketer one porter observed to his mate as he passed Yuss not so dusty for a nigger the other man replied Fust rite bowler but Lord he can t old a candle to good old Ranji As for myself nobody seemed to recognise me I set this fact down to the fortunate circumstance that the evening papers had published rough wood cuts which professed to be my portrait and which naturally led the public to look out for a brazen faced raw boned hard featured termagant I took my seat in a ladies compartment by myself As the train was about to start Harold strolled up as if casually for a moment You think it better so he queried without moving his lips or seeming to look at me Decidedly I answered Go back to Partab Don t come near me again till we get to Edinburgh It is dangerous still The police may at any moment hear we have started and stop us half way and now that we have once committed ourselves to this plan it would be fatal to be interrupted before we have got married You are right he cried Lois you are always right somehow I wished I could think so myself but twas with serious misgivings that I felt the train roll out of the station Oh that long journey north alone in a ladies compartment with the feeling that Harold was so near yet so unapproachable it was an endless agony He had the Maharajah who loved and admired him to keep him from brooding but I left alone and confined with my own fears conjured up before my eyes every possible misfortune that Heaven could send us I saw clearly now that if we failed in our purpose this journey would be taken by everyone for a flight and would deepen the suspicion under which we both laboured It would make me still more obviously a conspirator with Harold Whatever happened we must strain every nerve to reach Scotland in safety and then to get married in order that Harold might immediately surrender himself Illustration HE TOOK A LONG CARELESS STARE AT ME At York I noticed with a thrill of terror that a man in plain clothes with the obtrusively unobtrusive air of a detective looked carefully though casually into every carriage I felt sure he was a spy because of his marked outer jauntiness of demeanour which hardly masked an underlying hang dog expression of scrutiny When he reached my place he took a long careless stare at me a seemingly careless stare which was yet brim full of the keenest observation Then he paced slowly along the line of carriages with a glance at each till he arrived just opposite the Maharajah s compartment There he stared hard once more The Maharajah descended so did Harold and the Hindu attendant who was dressed just like him The man I took for a detective indulged in a frank long gaze at the unconscious Indian prince but cast only a hasty eye on the two apparent followers That touch of revelation relieved my mind a little I felt convinced the police were watching the Maharajah and myself as suspicious persons connected with the case but they had not yet guessed that Harold had disguised himself as one of the two invariable Rajput servants We steamed on northward At Newcastle the same detective strolled with his hands in his pockets along the train once more and puffed a cigar with the nonchalant air of a sporting gentleman But I was certain now from the studious unconcern he was anxious to exhibit that he must be a spy upon us He overdid his mood of careless observation It was too obvious an assumption Precisely the same thing happened again when we pulled up at Berwick I knew now that we were watched It would be impossible for us to get married at Edinburgh if we were thus closely pursued There was but one chance open we must leave the train abruptly at the first Scotch stopping station The detective knew we were booked through for Edinburgh So much I could tell because I saw him make inquiries of the ticket examiner at York and again at Berwick and because the ticket examiner thereupon entered a mental note of the fact as he punched my ticket each time Oh Edinburgh miss All right and then stared at me suspiciously I could tell he had heard of the Ashurst will case He also lingered long about the Maharajah s compartment and then went back to confer with the detective Thus putting two and two together as a woman will I came to the conclusion that the spy did not expect us to leave the train before we reached Edinburgh That told in our favour Most men trust much to just such vague expectations They form a theory and then neglect the adverse chances You can only get the better of a skilled detective by taking him thus psychologically and humanly By this time I confess I felt almost like a criminal Never in my life had danger loomed so near not even when we returned with the Arabs from the oasis For then we feared for our lives alone now we feared for our honour I drew a card from my case before we left Berwick station and scribbled a few hasty words on it in German We are watched A detective If we run through to Edinburgh we shall doubtless be arrested or at least impeded This train will stop at Dunbar for one minute Just before it leaves again get out as quietly as you can at the last moment I will also get out and join you Let Partab go on it will excite less attention The scheme I suggest is the only safe plan If you agree as soon as we have well started from Berwick shake your handkerchief unobtrusively out of your carriage window Illustration I BECKONED A PORTER I beckoned a porter noiselessly without one word The detective was now strolling along the fore part of the train with his back turned towards me peering as he went into all the windows I gave the porter a shilling Take this to a black gentleman in the next carriage but one I said in a confidential whisper The porter touched his hat nodded smiled and took it Would Harold see the necessity for acting on my advice I wondered I gazed out along the train as soon as we had got well clear of Berwick A minute two minutes three minutes passed and still no handkerchief I began to despair He was debating no doubt If he refused all was lost and we were disgraced for ever At last after long waiting as I stared still along the whizzing line with the smoke in my eyes and the dust half blinding me I saw to my intense relief a handkerchief flutter It fluttered once not markedly then a black hand withdrew it Only just in time for even as it disappeared the detective s head thrust itself out of a farther window He was not looking for anything in particular as far as I could tell just observing the signals But it gave me a strange thrill to think even now we were so nearly defeated My next trouble was would the train draw up at Dunbar The ten A M from King s Cross is not set down to stop there in Bradshaw for no passengers are booked to or from the station by the day express but I remembered from of old when I lived at Edinburgh that it used always to wait about a minute for some engine driver s purpose This doubt filled me with fresh fear did it draw up there still they have accelerated the service so much of late years and abolished so many old accustomed stoppages I counted the familiar stations with my breath held back They seemed so much farther apart than usual Reston Grant s House Cockburnspath Innerwick The next was Dunbar If we rolled past that then all was lost We could never get married I trembled and hugged myself The engine screamed Did that mean she was running through Oh how I wished I had learned the interpretation of the signals Then gradually gently we began to slow Were we slowing to pass the station only No with a jolt she drew up My heart gave a bound as I read the word Dunbar on the station notice board I rose and waited with my fingers on the door Happily it had one of those new fashioned slip latches which open from inside No need to betray myself prematurely to the detective by a hand displayed on the outer handle I glanced out at him cautiously His head was thrust through his window and his sloping shoulders revealed the spy but he was looking the other way observing the signals doubtless to discover why we stopped at a place not mentioned in Bradshaw Harold s face just showed from another window close by Too soon or too late might either of them be fatal He glanced inquiry at me I nodded back Now The train gave its first jerk a faint backward jerk indicative of the nascent intention of starting As it braced itself to go on I jumped out so did Harold We faced one another on the platform without a word Stand away there the station master cried in an angry voice The guard waved his green flag The detective still absorbed on the signals never once looked back One second later we were safe at Dunbar and he was speeding away by the express for Edinburgh It gave us a breathing space of about an hour Illustration YOU CAN T GET OUT HERE HE SAID CRUSTILY For half a minute I could not speak My heart was in my mouth I hardly even dared to look at Harold Then the station master stalked up to us with a threatening manner You can t get out here he said crustily in a gruff Scotch voice This train is not timed to set down before Edinburgh We have got out I answered taking it upon me to speak for my fellow culprit the Hindu as he was to all seeming The logic of facts is with us We were booked through to Edinburgh but we wanted to stop at Dunbar and as the train happened to pull up we thought we needn t waste time by going on all that way and then coming back again Ye should have changed at Berwick the station master said still gruffly and come on by the slow train I could see his careful Scotch soul was vexed incidentally at our extravagance in paying the extra fare to Edinburgh and back again In spite of agitation I managed to summon up one of my sweetest smiles a smile that ere now had melted the hearts of rickshaw coolies and of French douaniers He thawed before it visibly Time was important to us I said oh he guessed not how important and besides you know it is so good for the company That s true he answered mollified He could not tilt against the interests of the North British shareholders But how about yer luggage It ll have gone on to Edinburgh I m thinking We have no luggage I answered boldly He stared at us both puckered his brow a moment and then burst out laughing Oh ay I see he answered with a comic air of amusement Well well it s none of my business no doubt and I will not interfere with ye though why a lady like you He glanced curiously at Harold I saw he had guessed right and thought it best to throw myself unreservedly on his mercy Time was indeed important I glanced at the station clock It was not very far from the stroke of six and we must manage to get married before the detective could miss us at Edinburgh where he was due at six point thirty So I smiled once more that heart softening smile We have each our own fancies I said blushing and indeed such is the pride of race among women I felt myself blush in earnest at the bare idea that I was marrying a black man in spite of our good Maharajah s kindness He is a gentleman and a man of education and culture I thought that recommendation ought to tell with a Scotchman We are in sore straits now but our case is a just one Can you tell me who in this place is most likely to sympathise most likely to marry us He looked at me and surrendered at discretion I should think anybody would marry ye who saw yer pretty face and heard yer sweet voice he answered But perhaps ye d better present yerself to mister Schoolcraft the U P minister at Little Kirkton He was aye soft hearted How far from here I asked About two miles he answered Can we get a trap Oh ay there s machines always waiting at the station Illustration WE TOLD OUR TALE We interviewed a machine and drove out to Little Kirkton There we told our tale in the fewest words possible to the obliging and good natured U P minister He looked as the station master had said soft hearted but he dashed our hopes to the ground at once by telling us candidly that unless we had had our residence in Scotland for twenty one days immediately preceding the marriage it would not be legal If you were Scotch he added I could go through the ceremony at once of course and then you could apply to the sheriff to night for leave to register the marriage in proper form afterward but as one of you is English and the other I judge he smiled and glanced towards Harold an Indian born subject of Her Majesty it would be impossible for me to do it the ceremony would be invalid under Lord Brougham s Act without previous residence This was a terrible blow I looked away appealingly Harold I cried in despair do you think we could manage to hide ourselves safely anywhere in Scotland for twenty one days His face fell How could I escape notice All the world is hunting for me And then the scandal No matter where you stopped however far from me no Lois darling I could never expose you to it The minister glanced from one to the other of us puzzled Harold he said turning over the word on his tongue Harold That doesn t sound like an Indian name does it And he hesitated you speak wonderful English I saw the safest plan was to make a clean breast of it He looked the sort of man one could trust on an emergency You have heard of the Ashurst will case I said blurting it out suddenly I have seen something about it in the newspapers yes But it did not interest me I have not followed it I told him the whole truth the case against us the facts as we knew them Then I added slowly This is mister Harold Tillington whom they accuse of forgery Does he look like a forger I want to marry him before he is tried It is the only way by which I can prove my implicit trust in him As soon as we are married he will give himself up at once to the police if you wish it before your eyes But married we must be Can t you manage it somehow My pleading voice touched him Harold Tillington he murmured I know of his forebears Lady Guinevere Tillington s son is it not Then you must be Younger of Gledcliffe For Scotland is a village everyone in it seems to have heard of every other What does he mean I asked Younger of Gledcliffe I remembered now that the phrase had occurred in mister Ashurst s will though I never understood it A Scotch fashion Harold answered The heir to a laird is called Younger of so and so My father has a small estate of that name in Dumfriesshire a very small estate I was born and brought up there Then you are a Scotchman the minister asked Yes Harold answered frankly by remote descent We are trebly of the female line at Gledcliffe still I am no doubt more or less Scotch by domicile Younger of Gledcliffe Oh yes that ought certainly to be quite sufficient for our purpose Do you live there I have been living there lately I always live there when I m in Britain It is my only home I belong to the diplomatic service But then the lady She is unmitigatedly English Harold admitted in a gloomy voice Not quite I answered I lived four years in Edinburgh And I spent my holidays there while I was at Girton I keep my boxes still at my old rooms in Maitland Street Oh that will do the minister answered quite relieved for it was clear that our anxiety and the touch of romance in our tale had enlisted him in our favour Indeed now I come to think of it it suffices for the Act if one only of the parties is domiciled in Scotland And as mister Tillington lives habitually at Gledcliffe that settles the question Still I can do nothing save marry you now by religious service in the presence of my servants which constitutes what we call an ecclesiastical marriage it becomes legal if afterwards registered and then you must apply to the sheriff for a warrant to register it But I will do what I can later on if you like you can be re married by the rites of your own Church in England Are you quite sure our Scotch domicile is good enough in law Harold asked still doubtful I can turn it up if you wish I have a legal handbook Before Lord Brougham s Act no formalities were necessary But the Act was passed to prevent Gretna Green marriages The usual phrase is that such a marriage does not hold good unless one or other of the parties either has had his or her usual residence in Scotland or else has lived there for twenty one days immediately preceding the date of the marriage If you like I will wait to consult the authorities No thank you I cried There is no time to lose Marry us first and look it up afterwards One or other will do it seems mister Tillington is Scotch enough I am sure he has no address in Britain but Gledcliffe we will rest our claim upon that Even if the marriage turns out invalid we only remain where we were This is a preliminary ceremony to prove good faith and to bind us to one another We can satisfy the law if need be when we return to England The minister called in his wife and servants and explained to them briefly He exhorted us and prayed We gave our solemn consent in legal form before two witnesses Then he pronounced us duly married In a quarter of an hour more we had made declaration to that effect before the sheriff the witnesses accompanying us and were formally affirmed to be man and wife before the law of Great Britain I asked if it would hold in England as well You couldn t be firmer married the sheriff said with decision by the Archbishop of Canterbury in Westminster Abbey Harold turned to the minister Will you send for the police he said calmly I wish to inform them that I am the man for whom they are looking in the Ashurst will case Our own cabman went to fetch them It was a terrible moment But Harold sat in the sheriff s study and waited as if nothing unusual were happening He talked freely but quietly Never in my life had I felt so proud of him At last the police came much inflated with the dignity of so great a capture and took down our statement Do you give yourself in charge on a confession of forgery the superintendent asked as Harold ended Certainly not Harold answered I have not committed forgery But I do not wish to skulk or hide myself I understand a warrant is out against me in London I have come to Scotland hurriedly for the sake of getting married not to escape apprehension I am here openly under my own name I tell you the facts tis for you to decide if you choose you can arrest me The superintendent conferred for some time in another room with the sheriff Then he returned to the study Very well sir he said in a respectful tone I arrest you So that was the beginning of our married life More than ever I felt sure I could trust in Harold The police decided after hearing by telegram from London that we must go up at once by the night express which they stopped for the purpose They were forced to divide us I took the sleeping car Harold travelled with two constables in a ordinary carriage Strange to say notwithstanding all this so great was our relief from the tension of our flight that we both slept soundly Next morning we arrived in London Harold guarded The police had arranged that the case should come up at Bow Street that afternoon It was not an ideal honeymoon and yet I was somehow happy At King s Cross they took him away from me Still I hardly cried All the way up in the train whenever I was awake an idea had been haunting me a possible clue to this trickery of Lord Southminster s Petty details cropped up and fell into their places I began to unravel it all now I had an inkling of a plan to set Harold right again The will we had proved but I must not anticipate When we parted Harold kissed me on the forehead and murmured rather sadly Now I suppose it s all up Lois I must go These rogues have been too much for us Illustration I HAVE FOUND A CLUE Not a bit of it I answered new hope growing stronger and stronger within me I see a way out I have found a clue I believe dear Harold the right will still be vindicated And red eyed as I was I jumped into a hansom and called to the cabman to drive at once to Lady Georgina s XII THE ADVENTURE OF THE UNPROFESSIONAL DETECTIVE Is Lady Georgina at home The discreet man servant in sober black clothes eyed me suspiciously No miss he answered That is to say no ma am Her ladyship is still at mister Marmaduke Ashurst s the late mister Marmaduke Ashurst I mean in Park Lane North You know the number ma am Yes I know it I replied with a gasp for this was indeed a triumph My one fear had been lest Lord Southminster should already have taken possession why you will see hereafter and it relieved me to learn that Lady Georgina was still at hand to guard my husband s interests She had been living at the house practically since her brother s death I drove round with all speed and flung myself into my dear old lady s arms Kiss me I cried flushed I am your niece But she knew it already for our movements had been fully reported by this time with picturesque additions in the morning papers Imagination ill developed in the English race seems to concentrate itself in the lower order of journalists She kissed me on both cheeks with unwonted tenderness Lois she cried with tears in her eyes you re a brick It was not exactly poetical at such a moment but from her it meant more than much gushing phraseology And you re here in possession I murmured Illustration I VE HELD THE FORT BY MAIN FORCE The Cantankerous Old Lady nodded She was in her element I must admit She dearly loved a row above all a family row but to be in the thick of a family row and to feel herself in the right with the law against her that was joy such as Lady Georgina had seldom before experienced Yes dear she burst out volubly I m in possession thank Heaven And what s more they won t oust me without a legal process I ve been here off and on you know ever since poor dear Marmy died looking after things for Harold and I shall look after them still till Bertie Southminster succeeds in ejecting me which won t be easy Oh I ve held the fort by main force I can tell you held it like a Trojan Bertie s in a precious great hurry to move in I can see but I won t allow him He s been down here this morning fatuously blustering and trying to carry the post by storm with a couple of policemen Policemen I cried To turn you out Yes my dear policemen but the Lord be praised I was too much for him There are legal formalities to fulfil yet and I won t budge an inch Lois not one inch my dear till he s fulfilled every one of them Mark my words child that boy s up to some devilry He is I answered Yes he wouldn t be in such a rampaging hurry to get in being as lazy as he s empty headed takes after Gwendoline in that if he hadn t some excellent reason for wishing to take possession and depend upon it the reason is that he wants to get hold of something or other that s Harold s But he sha n t if I can help it and thank my stars I m a dour woman to reckon with If he comes he comes over my old bones child I ve been overhauling everything of Marmy s I can tell you to checkmate the boy if I can but I ve found nothing yet and till I ve satisfied myself on that point I ll hold the fort still if I have to barricade that pasty faced scoundrel of a nephew of mine out by piling the furniture against the front door I will as sure as my name s Georgina Fawley I know you will dear I assented kissing her and so I shall venture to leave you while I go out to institute another little enquiry What enquiry I shook my head It s only a surmise I said hesitating I ll tell you about it later I ve had time to think while I ve been coming back in the train and I ve thought of many things Mount guard till I return and mind you don t let Lord Southminster have access to anything I ll shoot him first dear And I believe she meant it I drove on in the same cab to Harold s solicitor There I laid my fresh doubts at once before him He rubbed his bony hands You ve hit it he cried charmed My dear madam you ve hit it I never did like that will I never did like the signatures the witnesses the look of it But what could I do mister Tillington propounded it Of course it wasn t my business to go dead against my own client Then you doubted Harold s honour mister Hayes I cried flushing Illustration NEVER HE ANSWERED NEVER Never he answered Never I felt sure there must be some mistake somewhere but not any trickery on your husband s part Now you supply the right clue We must look into this immediately He hurried round with me at once in the same cab to the court The incriminated will had been impounded as they call it but under certain restrictions and subject to the closest surveillance I was allowed to examine it with my husband s solicitor before the eyes of the authorities I looked at it long with the naked eye and also with a small pocket lens The paper as I had noted before was the same kind of foolscap as that which I had been in the habit of using at my office in Florence and the typewriting was it mine The longer I looked at it the more I doubted it After a careful examination I turned round to our solicitor mister Hayes I said firmly having arrived at my conclusion this is not the document I type wrote at Florence How do you know he asked A different machine Some small peculiarity in the shape of the letters No the rogue who typed this will was too cunning for that He didn t allow himself to be foiled by such a scholar s mate It is written with a Spread Eagle the same sort of machine precisely as my own I know the type perfectly But I hesitated But what Well it is difficult to explain There is character in typewriting just as there is in handwriting only of course not quite so much of it Every operator is liable to his own peculiar tricks and blunders If I had some of my own typewritten manuscript here to show you I could soon make that evident I can easily believe it Individuality runs through all we do however seemingly mechanical But are the points of a sort that you could make clear in court to the satisfaction of a jury I think so Look here for example Certain letters get habitually mixed up in typewriting c and v stand next one another on the keyboard of the machine and the person who typed this draft sometimes strikes a c instead of a v or vice versa I never do that The letters I tend to confuse are s and w or else e and r which also come very near one another in the arbitrary arrangement Besides when I type wrote the original of this will I made no errors at all I took such very great pains about it And this person did make errors Yes struck the wrong letter first and then corrected it often by striking another rather hard on top of it See this was a v to begin with and he turned it into a c Besides the hand that wrote this will is heavier than mine it comes down thump thump thump while mine glides lightly And the hyphens are used with a space between them and the character of the punctuation is not exactly as I make it Still mister Hayes objected we have nothing but your word I m afraid in such a case we could never induce a jury to accept your unsupported evidence I don t want them to accept it I answered I am looking this up for my own satisfaction I want to know first who wrote this will And of one thing I am quite clear it is not the document I drew up for mister Ashurst Just look at that x The x alone is conclusive My typewriter had the upper right hand stroke of the small x badly formed or broken while this one is perfect I remember it well because I used always to improve all my lower case x s with a pen when I re read and corrected I see their dodge clearly now It is a most diabolical conspiracy Instead of forging a will in Lord Southminster s favour they have substituted a forgery for the real will and then managed to make my poor Harold prove it In that case no doubt they have destroyed the real one the original mister Hayes put in I don t think so I answered after a moment s deliberation From what I know of mister Ashurst I don t believe it is likely he would have left his will about carelessly anywhere He was a secretive man fond of mysteries and mystifications He would be sure to conceal it Besides Lady Georgina and Harold have been taking care of everything in the house ever since he died But mister Hayes objected the forger of this document supposing it to be forged must have had access to the original since you say the terms of the two are identical only the signatures are forgeries And if he saw and copied it why might he not also have destroyed it A light flashed across me all at once The forger did see the original I cried but not the fair copy I have it all now I detect their trick It comes back to me vividly When I had finished typing the copy at Florence from my first rough draft which I had taken down on the machine before mister Ashurst s eyes I remember now that I threw the original into the waste paper basket It must have been there that evening when Higginson called and asked for the will to take it back to mister Ashurst He called for it no doubt hoping to open the packet before he delivered it and make a copy of the document for this very purpose But I refused to let him have it Before he saw me however he had been left by himself for ten minutes in the office for I remember coming out to him and finding him there alone and during that ten minutes being what he is you may be sure he fished out the rough draft and appropriated it Illustration WE SHALL HAVE HIM IN OUR POWER That is more than likely my solicitor nodded You are tracking him to his lair We shall have him in our power I grew more and more excited as the whole cunning plot unravelled itself mentally step by step before me He must then have gone to Lord Southminster I went on and told him of the legacy he expected from mister Ashurst It was five hundred pounds a mere trifle to Higginson who plays for thousands So he must have offered to arrange matters for Lord Southminster if Southminster would consent to make good that sum and a great deal more to him That odious little cad told me himself on the Jumna they were engaged in pulling off a big coup between them He thought then I would marry him and that he would so secure my connivance in his plans but who would marry such a piece of moist clay Besides I could never have taken anyone but Harold Then another clue came home to me mister Hayes I cried jumping at it Higginson who forged this will never saw the real document itself at all he saw only the draft for mister Ashurst altered one word viva voce in the original at the last moment and I made a pencil note of it on my cuff at the time and see it isn t here though I inserted it in the final clean copy of the will the word especially It grows upon me more and more each minute that the real instrument is hidden somewhere in mister Ashurst s house Harold s house our house and that because it is there Lord Southminster is so indecently anxious to oust his aunt and take instant possession In that case mister Hayes remarked we had better go back to Lady Georgina without one minute s delay and while she still holds the house institute a thorough search for it No sooner said than done We jumped again into our cab and started As we drove back mister Hayes asked me where I thought we were most likely to find it In a secret drawer in mister Ashurst s desk I answered by a flash of instinct without a second s hesitation How do you know there s a secret drawer I don t know it I infer it from my general knowledge of mister Ashurst s character He loved secret drawers ciphers cryptograms mystery mongering But it was in that desk that your husband found the forged document the lawyer objected Once more I had a flash of inspiration or intuition Because White mister Ashurst s valet had it in readiness in his possession I answered and hid it there in the most obvious and unconcealed place he could find as soon as the breath was out of his master s body I remember now Lord Southminster gave himself away to some extent in that matter The hateful little creature isn t really clever enough for all his cunning and with Higginson to back him to mix himself up in such tricks as forgery He told me at Aden he had had a telegram from Marmy s valet to report progress and he received another the night mister Ashurst died at Moozuffernuggar Depend upon it White was more or less in this plot Higginson left him the forged will when they started for India and as soon as mister Ashurst died White hid it where Harold was bound to find it If so mister Hayes answered that s well we have something to go upon The more of them the better There is safety in numbers for the honest folk I never knew three rogues hold long together especially when threatened with a criminal prosecution Their confederacy breaks down before the chance of punishment Each tries to screen himself by betraying the others Higginson was the soul of this plot I went on Of that you may be sure He s a wily old fox but we ll run him to earth yet The more I think of it the more I feel sure from what I know of mister Ashurst s character he would never have put that will in so exposed a place as the one where Harold says he found it We drew up at the door of the disputed house just in time for the siege mister Hayes and I walked in We found Lady Georgina face to face with Lord Southminster The opposing forces were still at the stage of preliminaries of warfare Look heah the pea green young man was observing in his drawling voice as we entered it s no use your talking deah Georgey This house is mine and I won t have you meddling with it This house is not yours you odious little scamp his aunt retorted raising her shrill voice some notes higher than usual and while I can hold a stick you shall not come inside it Very well then you drive me to hostilities don t yah know I m sorry to show disrespect to your gray hairs if any but I shall be obliged to call in the police to eject yah Call them in if you like I answered interposing between them Go out and get them mister Hayes while he s gone send for a carpenter to break open the back of mister Ashurst s escritoire A carpentah he cried turning several degrees whiter than his pasty wont What for A carpentah I spoke distinctly Because we have reason to believe mister Ashurst s real will is concealed in this house in a secret drawer and because the keys were in the possession of White whom we believe to be your accomplice in this shallow conspiracy He gasped and looked alarmed No you don t he cried stepping briskly forward You don t I tell yah Break open Marmy s desk Why hang it all it s my property We shall see about that after we ve broken it open I answered grimly Here this screw driver will do The back s not strong Now your help mister Hayes one two three we can prise it apart between us Lord Southminster rushed up and tried to prevent us But Lady Georgina seizing both wrists held him tight as in a vice with her dear skinny old hands He writhed and struggled all in vain he could not escape her I ve often spanked you Bertie she cried and if you attempt to interfere I ll spank you again that s the long and the short of it He broke from her and rushed out to call the police I believe and prevent our desecration of pooah Marmy s property Illustration VICTORY Inside the first shell were several locked drawers and two or three open ones out of one of which Harold had fished the false will Instinct taught me somehow that the central drawer on the left hand side was the compartment behind which lay the secret receptacle I prised it apart and peered about inside it Presently I saw a slip panel which I touched with one finger The pigeon hole flew open and disclosed a narrow slit I clutched at something the will Ho victory the will I raised it aloft with a wild shout Not a doubt of it The real the genuine document We turned it over and read it It was my own fair copy written at Florence and bearing all the small marks of authenticity about it which I had pointed out to mister Hayes as wanting to the forged and impounded document Fortunately Lady Georgina and four of the servants had stood by throughout this scene and had watched our demeanour as well as Lord Southminster s We turned next to the signatures The principal one was clearly mister Ashurst s I knew it at once his legible fat hand Marmaduke Courtney Ashurst And then the witnesses They fairly took our breath away Why Higginson s sister isn t one of them at all mister Hayes cried astonished A flush of remorse came over me I saw it all now I had misjudged that poor woman She had the misfortune to be a rogue s sister but as Harold had said was herself a most respectable and blameless person Higginson must have forged her name to the document that was all and she had naturally sworn that she never signed it He knew her honesty It was a master stroke of rascality The other one isn t here either I exclaimed growing more puzzled The waiter at the hotel Why that s another forgery Higginson must have waited till the man was safely dead and then used him similarly It was all very clever Now who are these people who really witnessed it The first one mister Hayes said examining the handwriting is Sir Roger Bland the Dorsetshire baronet he s dead poor fellow but he was at Florence at the time and I can answer for his signature He was a client of mine and died at Mentone The second is Captain Richards of the Mounted Police he s living still but he s away in South Africa Then they risked his turning up If they knew who the real witnesses were at all which is doubtful You see as you say they may have seen the rough draft only Higginson would know I answered He was with mister Ashurst at Florence at the time and he would take good care to keep a watch upon his movements In my belief it was he who suggested this whole plot to Lord Southminster Of course it was Lady Georgina put in That s absolutely certain Bertie s a rogue as well as a fool but he s too great a fool to invent a clever roguery and too great a knave not to join in it foolishly when anybody else takes the pains to invent it And it was a clever roguery mister Hayes interposed An ordinary rascal would have forged a later will in Lord Southminster s favour and run the risk of detection Higginson had the acuteness to forge a will exactly like the real one and to let your husband bear the burden of the forgery It was as sagacious as it was ruthless The next point I said will be for us to prove it At that moment the bell rang and one of the house servants all puzzled by this conflict of interests came in with a telegram which he handed me on a salver I broke it open without glancing at the envelope Its contents baffled me My address is Hotel Bristol Paris name as usual Send me a thousand pounds on account at once I can t afford to wait No shillyshallying The message was unsigned For a moment I couldn t imagine who sent it or what it was driving at Then I took up the envelope Viscount Southminster twenty four Park Lane North London My heart gave a jump I saw in a second that chance or Providence had delivered the conspirators into my hands that day The telegram was from Higginson I had opened it by accident It was obvious what had happened Lord Southminster must have written to him on the result of the trial and told him he meant to take possession of his uncle s house immediately Higginson had acted on that hint and addressed his telegram where he thought it likely Lord Southminster would receive it earliest I had opened it in error and that too was fortunate for even in dealing with such a pack of scoundrels it would never have occurred to me to violate somebody else s correspondence had I not thought it was addressed to me But having arrived at the truth thus unintentionally I had of course no scruples about making full use of my information I showed the despatch at once to Lady Georgina and mister Hayes They recognised its importance What next I inquired Time presses At half past three Harold comes up for examination at Bow Street mister Hayes was ready with an apt expedient Ring the bell for mister Ashurst s valet he said quietly The moment has now arrived when we can begin to set these conspirators by the ears As soon as they learn that we know all they will be eager to inform upon one another I rang the bell Send up White I said We wish to speak to him The valet stole up self accused a timid servile creature rubbing his hands nervously and suspecting mischief He was a rat in trouble He had thin brown hair neatly brushed and plastered down so as to make it look still thinner and his face was the average narrow cunning face of the dishonest man servant It had an ounce of wile in it to a pound or two of servility He seemed just the sort of rogue meanly to join in an underhand conspiracy and then meanly to back out of it You could read at a glance that his principle in life was to save his own bacon Illustration YOU WISHED TO SEE ME SIR He advanced fumbling his hands all the time and smiling and fawning You wished to see me sir he murmured in a deprecatory voice looking sideways at Lady Georgina and me but addressing the lawyer Yes White I wished to see you I have a question to ask you Who put the forged will in mister Ashurst s desk Was it you or some other person The question terrified him He changed colour and gasped But he rubbed his hands harder than ever and affected a sickly smile Oh sir how should I know sir I had nothing to do with it I suppose it was mister Tillington Our lawyer pounced upon him like a hawk on a titmouse Don t prevaricate with me sir he said sternly If you do it may be worse for you This case has assumed quite another aspect It is you and your associates who will be placed in the dock not mister Tillington You had better speak the truth it is your one chance I warn you Lie to me and instead of calling you as a witness for our case I shall include you in the indictment White looked down uneasily at his shoes and cowered Oh sir I don t understand you Yes you do You understand me and you know I mean it Wriggling is useless we intend to prosecute We have unravelled this vile plot We know the whole truth Higginson and Lord Southminster forged a will between them Oh sir not Lord Southminster His lordship I m sure mister Hayes s keen eye had noted the subtle shade of distinction and admission But he said nothing openly Well then Higginson forged and Lord Southminster accepted a false will which purported to be mister Marmaduke Ashurst s Now follow me clearly That will could not have been put into the escritoire during mister Ashurst s life for there would have been risk of his discovering it It must therefore have been put there afterward The moment he was dead you or somebody else with your consent and connivance slipped it into the escritoire and you afterwards showed mister Tillington the place where you had set it or seen it set leading him to believe it was mister Ashurst s will and so involved him in all this trouble Note that that was a felonious act We accuse you of felony Do you mean to confess and give evidence on our behalf or will you force me to send for a policeman to arrest you The cur hesitated still Oh sir drawing back and fumbling his hands on his breast you don t mean it mister Hayes was prompt Hesslegrave go for a policeman That curt sentence brought the rogue on his marrow bones at once He clasped his hands and debated inwardly If I tell you all I know he said at last looking about him with an air of abject terror as if he thought Lord Southminster or Higginson would hear him will you promise not to prosecute me His tone became insinuating For a hundred pounds I could find the real will for you You d better close with me To day is the last chance As soon as his lordship comes in he ll hunt it up and destroy it I flourished it before him and pointed with one hand to the broken desk which he had not yet observed in his craven agitation We do not need your aid I answered We have found the will ourselves Thanks to Lady Georgina it is safe till this minute And to me he put in cringing and trying after his kind to curry favour with the winners at the last moment It s all my doing my lady I wouldn t destroy it His lordship offered me a hundred pounds more to break open the back of the desk at night while your ladyship was asleep and burn the thing quietly But I told him he might do his own dirty work if he wanted it done It wasn t good enough while your ladyship was here in possession Besides I wanted the right will preserved for I thought things might turn up so and I wouldn t stand by and see a gentleman like mister Tillington as has always behaved well to me deprived of his inheritance Which is why you conspired with Lord Southminster to rob him of it and to send him to prison for Higginson s crime I interposed calmly Then you confess you put the forged will there mister Hayes said getting to business White looked about him helplessly He missed his headpiece the instigator of the plot Well it was like this my lady he began turning to Lady Georgina and wriggling to gain time You see his lordship and mister Higginson he twirled his thumbs and tried to invent something plausible Lady Georgina swooped No rigmarole she said sharply Do you confess you put it there or do you not reptile Her vehemence startled him Yes I confess I put it there he said at last blinking As soon as the breath was out of mister Ashurst s body I put it there He began to whimper I m a poor man with a wife and family sir he went on though in mister Ashurst s time I always kep that quiet and his lordship offered to pay me well for the job and when you re paid well for a job yourself sir mister Hayes waved him off with one imperious hand Sit down in the corner there man and don t move or utter another word he said sternly until I order you You will be in time still for me to produce at Bow Street Just at that moment Lord Southminster swaggered back accompanied by a couple of unwilling policemen Oh I say he cried bursting in and staring around him jubilant Look heah Georgey are you going quietly or must I ask these coppahs to evict you He was wreathed in smiles now and had evidently been fortifying himself with brandies and soda Lady Georgina rose in her wrath Yes I ll go if you wish it Bertie she answered with calm irony I ll leave the house as soon as you like for the present till we come back again with Harold and his policemen to evict you This house is Harold s Your game is played boy She spoke slowly We have found the other will we have discovered Higginson s present address in Paris and we know from White how he and you arranged this little conspiracy Illustration WELL THIS IS A FAIR KNOCK OUT HE EJACULATED She rapped out each clause in this last accusing sentence with deliberate effect like so many pistol shots Each bullet hit home The pea green young man drawing back and staring stroked his shadowy moustache with feeble fingers in undisguised astonishment Then he dropped into a chair and fixed his gaze blankly on Lady Georgina Well this is a fair knock out he ejaculated fatuously disconcerted I wish Higginson was heah I really don t quite know what to do without him That fellah had squared it all up so neatly don t yah know that I thought there couldn t be any sort of hitch in the proceedings You reckoned without Lois Lady Georgina said calmly Ah Miss Cayley that s true I mean missus Tillington Yaas yaas I know she s a doosid clevah person for a woman now isn t she It was impossible to take this flabby creature seriously even as a criminal Lady Georgina s lips relaxed Doosid clever she admitted looking at me almost tenderly But not quite so clevah don t yah know as Higginson There you make your blooming little erraw mister Hayes burst in adopting one of Lord Southminster s favourite witticisms the sort of witticism that improves like poetry by frequent repetition Policemen you may go into the next room and wait this is a family affair we have no immediate need of you Oh certainly Lord Southminster echoed much relieved Very propah sentiment Most undesirable that the constables should mix themselves up in a family mattah like this Not the place for inferiahs Then why introduce them Lady Georgina burst out turning on him He smiled his fatuous smile That s just what I say he answered Why the jooce introduce them But don t snap my head off The policemen withdrew respectfully glad to be relieved of this unpleasant business where they could gain no credit and might possibly involve themselves in a charge of assault Lord Southminster rose with a benevolent grin and looked about him pleasantly The brandies and soda had endowed him with irrepressible cheerfulness Well Lady Georgina murmured Well I think I ll leave now Georgey You ve trumped my ace yah know Nasty trick of White to go and round on a fellah I don t like the turn this business is taking Seems to me the only way I have left to get out of it is to turn Queen s evidence Lady Georgina planted herself firmly against the door Bertie she cried no you don t not till we ve got what we want out of you He gazed at her blandly His face broke once more into an imbecile smile You were always a rough un Georgey Your hand did sting Well what do you want now We ve each played our cards and you needn t cut up rusty over it especially when you re winning Hang it all I wish I had Higginson heah to tackle you If you go to see the Treasury people or the Solicitor General or the Public Prosecutor or whoever else it may be Lady Georgina said stoutly mister Hayes must go with you We ve trumped your ace as you say and we mean to take advantage of it And then you must trundle yourself down to Bow Street afterwards confess the whole truth and set Harold at liberty Oh I say now Georgey The whole truth the whole blooming truth That s really what I call humiliating a fellah If you don t we arrest you this minute fourteen years imprisonment Fourteen yeahs He wiped his forehead Oh I say How doosid uncomfortable I was nevah much good at doing anything by the sweat of my brow I ought to have lived in the Garden of Eden Georgey you re hard on a chap when he s down on his luck It would be confounded cruel to send me to fourteen yeahs at Portland You would have sent my husband to it I broke in angrily confronting him What You too Miss Cayley I mean missus Tillington Don t look at me like that Tigahs aren t in it His jauntiness disarmed us However wicked he might be one felt it would be ridiculous to imprison this schoolboy A sound flogging and a month s deprivation of wine and cigarettes was the obvious punishment designed for him by nature You must go down to the police court and confess this whole conspiracy Lady Georgina went on after a pause as sternly as she was able I prefer if we can to save the family even you Bertie But I can t any longer save the family honour I can only save Harold s You must help me to do that and then you must give me your solemn promise in writing to leave England for ever and go to live in South Africa He stroked the invisible moustache more nervously than before That penalty came home to him What leave England for evah Newmarket Ascot the club the music halls Or fourteen years imprisonment Georgey you spank as hard as evah Decide at once or we arrest you He glanced about him feebly I could see he was longing for his lost confederate Well I ll go he said at last sobering down and your solicitaw can trot round with me I ll do all that you wish though I call it most unfriendly Hang it all fourteen yeahs would be so beastly unpleasant We drove forthwith to the proper authorities who on hearing the facts at once arranged to accept Lord Southminster and White as Queen s evidence neither being the actual forger We also telegraphed to Paris to have Higginson arrested Lord Southminster giving us up his assumed name with the utmost cheerfulness and without one moment s compunction mister Hayes was quite right each conspirator was only too ready to save himself by betraying his fellows Then we drove on to Bow Street Lord Southminster consoling himself with a cigarette on the way just in time for Harold s case which was to be taken by special arrangement at three point thirty A very few minutes sufficed to turn the tables completely on the conspirators Harold was discharged and a warrant was issued for the arrest of Higginson the actual forger He had drawn up the false will and signed it with mister Ashurst s name after which he had presented it for Lord Southminster s approval The pea green young man told his tale with engaging frankness Bertie s a simple Simon Lady Georgina commented to me but he s also a rogue and Higginson saw his way to make excellent capital of him in both capacities first use him as a catspaw and then blackmail him Illustration HAROLD YOUR WIFE HAS BESTED ME On the steps of the police court as we emerged triumphant Lord Southminster met us still radiant as ever He seemed wholly unaware of the depths of his iniquity a fresh dose of brandy had restored his composure Look heah he said Harold your wife has bested me Jolly good thing for you that you managed to get hold of such a clevah woman If you hadn t deah boy you d have found yourself in Queeah Street But I say Lois I call yah Lois because you re my cousin now yah know you were backing the wrong man aftah all as I told yah For if you d backed me all this wouldn t have come out you d have got the tin and been a countess as well aftah the governah s dead and gone don t yah see You d have landed the double event So you d have pulled off a bettah thing for yourself in the end as I said if you d laid your bottom dollah on me for winnah Higginson is now doing fourteen years at Portland Harold and I are happy in the sweetest place in Gloucestershire and Lord Southminster blissfully unaware of the contempt with which the rest of the world regards him is shooting big game among his boys in South Africa Indeed he bears so little malice that he sent us a present of a trophy of horns for our hall last winter THE END THE WINCHESTER EDITION OF THE NOVELS OF JANE AUSTEN ten Vols Demy eightvo Cloth fives net each Vol The perfection of the edition rests entirely on the efforts of printer paper maker and binder Messrs T and A CONSTABLE of Edinburgh being responsible for the typography while mister LAURENCE HOUSMAN has designed the cover SPECTATOR The Winchester Edition has special claims to gratitude through the delightful quality of its print and paper The print is of a generous design and very black and clear and the paper while untransparent not so heavy but that the book can be held comfortably in one hand Altogether this promises to be one of the most delightful reprints ever given to the public ATHENAEUM An exceedingly handsome edition This is decidedly a cheap edition as well as an ornamental one WESTMINSTER GAZETTE mister Grant Richards is to be congratulated on the charming edition of Miss Austen s Novels which starts with Sense and Sensibility in two volumes Print paper and binding green and gold with a charming design are all that the most fastidious could desire An edition of this kind is really wanted and comes at a moment when there is a natural inclination to turn back to the pages of this delightful writer The younger generation is supposed not to read Miss Austen which if true is hardly creditable to its education and good taste But latterly there have been signs of a re discovery which will be stimulated by the issue of these beautiful volumes Most useful companions to the traveller PUNCH GRANT ALLEN S HISTORICAL GUIDES Fcap eightvo Pocket Size Limp Cloth Round Corners threes sixd net each VOLUMES NOW READY PARIS CITIES OF BELGIUM Bruges Ghent Brussels Antwerp VENICE

Tours Orleans Some Opinions of the Press THE TIMES Such good work in the way of showing students the right manner of approaching the history of a great city The execution of the little volumes is on the whole admirable These useful little volumes THE GUARDIAN From the point of view of really intelligent sight seeing the two little volumes that have already appeared are better than anything that we yet have and if the holiday maker will only take them with him to Paris or Florence he will probably feel that he has learnt more of the real city than in all his former visits THE SPECTATOR A visitor to Florence could hardly we imagine do better than provide himself with this volume A great amount of matter and good matter too is compressed into a small space for the book is light and such as can go into a pocket of moderate capacity mister Grant Allen not only guides his reader s judgment but disposes of his time for him he must not only not do much at once but must arrange his sight seeing in an economical and intelligent way MORNING POST That much abused class of people the tourists have often been taunted with their ignorance and want of culture and the perfunctory manner in which they hurry through and do the art galleries of Europe There is a large amount of truth no doubt in the charge but they might very well retort on their critics that no one had come forward to meet their wants or to assist in dispelling their ignorance No doubt there are guide books very excellent ones in their way but on all matters of art very little better than mere indices something fuller was required to enable the average man intelligently to appreciate the treasures submitted to his views mister Grant Allen has undertaken to meet their wants and offers these handbooks to the public at a price which ought to be within the reach of every one who can afford to travel at all The idea is a good one and should ensure the success which mister Allen deserves GRANT RICHARDS nine
